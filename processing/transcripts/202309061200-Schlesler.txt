Thank you, Matteo, for the introduction. And also, I want to thank the organizers for letting me speak. This talk is about a joint project with Stefan Kj√∂nke, where we try to apply techniques from the theory of groups acting on rooted trees to a variety of problems. Of problems. And the first application I want to present you is concerning a classical question in group theory: namely, what can you say about a group if you know all of its finite quotients? And what kind of sets of finite quotient can actually arise as a profinite completion of a group? Okay, and for this question to make sense, one has to restrict to a class of groups which has enough finite quotients, and this is a class of residually finite groups. Recall that a group is residually finite. Recall that a group is reasonably finite, G, if for every non-trivial element in G, there is a finite quotient in which the element stays non-trivial. And once we have a residually finite group, there is a nice way to capture the information about all the finite quotients of G in a topological group. And this group is the profinite completion of G. So it is the inverse limit of the inverse. Of the inverse system of all finite quotients of G, and it sits by definition in a product of these finite quotients. So, associated with the product topology, it is a compact topological group. And it is well suited for capturing the information about the finite quotients of G, since, in some sense, it does not contain any other information. At least, this is my interpretation of a result of Dixon-Forman-Chinac Poland. Result of Dixon-Formanek Poland and Dribes. They showed that for arbitrarily finitely generated groups, their profinite completions are isomorphic as topological groups if and only if G and H have the same set, just abstract set of isomorphism classes of finite quotients. So this is a bit surprising. And moreover, these topological these completions do not contain more finite quotients than G has. In fact, they Than G has, in fact, they coincide with the finite version of G by a famous result of Nikolov and Siegel. Okay, so it makes sense to study profinal completion of a group. Okay, I think now we are well prepared for the story I actually wanted to tell you. It begins with a well-known paper of Neumann from 1937, and it is well-known. Since this is the first paper where non-finite. Where non-finitely presented, finitely generated groups are constructed. And his construction is as follows. He associates to every set of odd naturals greater equal to three, a group. And this group, G, sits inside an infinite product of alternating groups whose ranks are indexed by the given set S. So when it's generated by So, and it's generated by two sequences of permutations. The first sequence is a constant three cycle in each coordinate, and the second sequence consists of long cycles in each coordinate. And he proves that Gs oh okay, and what yeah, right. He proves that in Gs, an alternating group is a normal subgroup of G, just upside. Is a normal subgroup of G just abstractly if and only if the rank of this alternating group is an element of S. So, in particular, there are uncontributably many residual finite groups, but there are only contributing many finitely presented groups, so he constructed finitely generated, not finitely presented groups. And since then, his groups appeared in a variety of contexts, have many applications, were studied by many peoples, and one of those are Luboski. One of those are Lubovsky, Paiba, and Shalef, who constructed or computed the profinite completion of GS. They showed that it is almost the product of these alternating groups, but with an error term, namely Z hat. And the reason why they were interested in these profinal completion is that they were counting subgroups of finite index. There's a whole industry counting subgroups of finite index of groups, and these are appropriate. And these are appropriate for this purpose since the profile completion can be written down explicitly. This is not a typical case. And they did the same. Yeah, they introduced a construction in a similar spirit as Neumann's groups, where the alternating groups are replaced by other simple groups, PSL and FQ, and also computed to profile completion. So, and Pi bar. So, and Fiber proved that it is also possible to do the same where one of the factors arises several times. So several times fn, while fn does not cannot be an arbitrary function since hs is finitely generated, but some mild restrictions. So, and the reason why this z head always appears Head always appears, it's not because they wanted it to appear. No, actually, they wanted to get rid of. Um, but for their purposes, it also did not harm because that does not have too many finite index subgroups like of a given index, just one. But for other counting purposes, also these people are interested in, it causes serious problem problems, namely counting finite dimensional representations. To count them, these groups cannot be used. These groups cannot be used because, because of the Z head factor, they are uncountably many of each given dimension. So, Piber asked whether one can get rid of that head, and this turned out to be surprisingly difficult. So, right, if this would be possible, then a product of finite simple groups would arise as a profinite completion of a given group and Yeah, it is not always true that the product of finite simple groups arises as a profinite completion, even if there is a finitely generated dense subgroup in this product. This was observed by Siegel, who showed that the product of PSLN Fp, where P, where the index goes over P, contains a finally generated nan subgroup, but it is not a pro-final completion. It's a non-trivial result. However, Paiba's question has an affirmative answer, and the first step towards it was achieved by Kasubov, 2007, who at least got rid of that head. So he constructed finally generated dense subgroup and the infinite product of all simple alternating groups. And the profinal completion of this group is exactly this final product, P. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. This product is supposed to be P, and but he had to pay a price, and the price was the pro six times the profinite completion of SL3FP over the Laurent polynomials. And already, like the formulation of this result suggests that it is not easy. Nevertheless, together with Nikolov, they were able to somehow get rid of the H head error term. Error term by introducing the notion of a frame. So, this is, can be generally stated, for a product of simple, for a product of finite groups as n. And inside such a product, a finitely generated subgroup G is called a frame if it contains the infinite direct sum of these groups and the inclusion of G inside the product extends continuously to an isomorphism of. Of the profile completion of G to P. There's always a continuous extension, but in this case, it's also an isomorphism. From the first property, one can deduce that it is also surjective already, but the problem is injective. So, and yeah, Kasabov and Nikolov were able to find a frame and thereby answer. Frame and thereby answer affirmatively the question of Piver. And their frames, they're constructed explicitly where frames inside the product of alternating groups where the ranks are given by some formula with respect to a prime, to an odd prime. And they were 10 generated. This is a complicated construction according to, yeah. But what is surprising is that one What is surprising is that once one has any frame in any infinite product of alternating groups, it is not so difficult to glue them together in a way that one obtains frames in arbitrary products of alternating groups whenever they contain a finitely generated dense subgroup, since otherwise it makes no sense. However, they were not completely satisfied with their result because a priori their generation Priori, their generating sets are not optimal in canonality. So, for example, the product of all alternating groups, where each factor arises just one time, contains many two-generated dense subgroups. But typically, if one just chooses random generating two random two-element generating sets of these alternating groups, it will typically generate a free group. So, this can be made precise. This was done by Dixon. Precise, this was done by Dixon, Perber, Servez, and Shalef. They showed that if, with this strategy by just randomly choosing generating sets, one typically obtains a free group. And free groups are, of course, not appropriate to be framed since they have a bunch of other final quotients. Okay. Now they ask whether the optimum of the Carninality for a finitely generated dense subgroup can be achieved, actually. And conjecture this should at least in general not be the case. So, and it also makes sense to conjecture this might not be the case. And there are many, meanwhile, there's quite some results suggesting that there are many residually finite groups which need more generators than each of their finite quotients. So the first one was obtained by Moskov. So the first one was obtained by Moskov and later Weiss constructed fine represented examples. Okay, now our contribution is that for certain products of alternating groups, there is a two-generated frame and two-generated is of course optimal since one generated is cyclic. So today I want to introduce the group which gives rise to this frame, but also I want to mention that But also, I want to mention that although I will not explicitly construct them today, the construction which gives rise to these frames can be applied for other finite groups as well. Okay, but let's today consider the alternating case. And it comes from the notion of a B telescope, which we introduced. It's quite general. We fix any group B. We fix any group B, and a B telescope is then a pair consisting of a direct system of groups. The groups are called omega i and a sequence of morphisms from b to omega i. But due to technical reasons, the index starts from 2. So there is no phi 1, but we have for every i greater or equal to 2, there is a morphism from b. To two, there is a morphism from B to omega i. And this B telescope has to satisfy two axioms. First, omega i should be generated by the conjugates of Bi. So Bi are the images of phi i in omega i. And the conjugates, for this axiom to make sense, are not elements from omega i, but from omega i minus one. But from omega i minus one, which is included into omega i by the maps Yota ij from the direct system. And the second condition is that the B i's commute. But of course, to make them commute, they have to live in the same ambient group. So one has to push one the b i, where e where i is the less index to the same index. Less index to the same index, to the same omega by taking the omega Yota ij. So inside the same group, they commute. Okay, let's consider a picture. In all our cases, in all constructions we have, the Yota Ij are inclusions. So in this picture, what is marked gray are the omega I groups, and inside the omega i groups are the groups B. Groups are the groups B, I, and they commute, which is indicated by do not intersect inside the whole group. And once they do not intersect into some groups, they will never intersect into the next group, which is a consequence of being homomorphically mapped by the YOTAS. Okay. Yeah, so it's a B telescope, and let's consider an example. Another example with An example: another example which gives rise to the alternating frame. We fix integer d greater or equal to 5 and an alphabet with d letters x1 until xd. And now the omegas from the B telescope are the alternating groups over the whole set of words of length I. And the inclusions between these groups is rather. These groups is rather canonical to include the alternating group which acts on the words of length i into the group of into the alternating groups of words of length j where j is larger than i is given by acting on the initial subword of length i so the most obvious thing one can do for example we take d equals to five Take d equals to five, we have a five element alphabet. Okay, and we consider the three cycle sigma given by x3, x4, x5. And by definition, this three cycle, it permutes these three vertices or points. But we consider in this image Yota I2 of sigma, which then lives in omega2, which is the alternating group of x squared. So it is the next level. Squared. So it is the next level. So here they are all words of length 2. And by definition, Yota I2 of sigma only permutes the initial letter of the two element word. So it permutes these blocks hanging below the vertices. So vertices, because we will draw a tree soon. So it's going to be vertices. It just permutes these blocks. And now we have to choose some B. And now we have to show some B for the B telescope. It is the alternating group of all two letter words starting by X1 or X2. And for I greater or equal to 2, we have to define morphisms from B to omega i, which are given as follows. There will be a picture soon. It's actually not so difficult as it looks like. So once we have i greater or equal to 2, we have at least two letters. And these two letters are x and y. These are the last two letters. And whatever comes before, we capture in a word v, which might be empty. So whenever phi i of b should act on any word, the word can be written by v x y, where v might be empty. X Y where V might be empty. So every word can be written as this. And now phi I of B acts on this word by either fixing it or in the very special case that V is given as a power of the last letter, namely X D power I minus 2. In this case, V just acts on the last letters, nothing else. And now one can prove, it's not so difficult, that It's not so difficult that the telescope associated with this data, we call it AD, curly AD, is a B telescope. Okay, now here's a picture of such an of the elements phi I of B. So the first phi, so phi two, maps onto the alternating group on this ten. These 10 points. These are all the points starting with either x1 or x2, and the next letter is arbitrary. So inside the tree of all words, we consider the first two left branches, and below there, we just permute what is going on there, just abstractly permute them with the three cycle. And then in the next step to define phi 3 of B, we go along the right branch. Go along the right branch to X5, rightmost branch. And then again, consider the first two branches on the left. So X5, X1, and X5, X2. And below these two vertices, there are 10 vertices and then abstractly permutes them. So in particular, it is not some tree automorphism since we fix these two vertices while permuting what is below arbitrarily. So it is not a continuous tree automorphism. So, it is not a continuous tree automorphism, but it will give rise to a continuous homeomorphism on a cantor set later. So far, we have, we did not define a group, we just defined what a B telescope is. Now, let's define groups associated with this B telescope. So, we fix the B telescope S and the group we construct lives in the product of the groups omega I. So, P S is the product of these groups. Product of these groups. And as in the examples of branch group, in the classical examples, there will be two groups generating the group associated to a B telescope. The first one aims to generalize what is the rooted automorphism. And this is done as follows. We will only, for the generating set, we will only consider i equals one in this definition, but it will be useful to consider. It will be useful to consider every i. So, and there is a way to embed omega i into the product ps by just putting trivial elements in the first i minus one coordinates, then do the identity, and from that point onwards, just do inclusions. So, essentially, it is a constant from some point onwards. So, this the first so the first group generally gives rise to our beep telescope. To our beep telescope frame groups is delta one of omega one. Now, for example, we take the three cycle sigma x3, x4, x5. It lives in omega 1. And by considering delta 1 of sigma, this is just permuting the trees hanging below x3, x4, x5. So phasing through the definitions, it is just this. And now the second generator aims to generalize what is known as a spine construction in branch groups. So for each i again, we recursively define elements. So tilde i, which is map from b to the product, is given by mapping an element b to b tilde i, which is defined recursively. Is defined recursively, but still well defined. It's defined recursively by the definition of b tilde i plus one, but it splits off the factor delta i plus one of phi i plus one of b. And this is well defined since we want to define a map from b into ps, but ps is a product of groups, so we only have to define what the morphism does on each coordinate. does on each coordinate. But delta i plus one, it only acts non-trivially from i plus one onwards. So on the first i entries, it just fixes. So if you start with some index i and we are interested in what does this element in some coordinate j, then we split off the delta parts, split off, split off until we reach j plus one. And the remaining part does not interest us because Remaining part does not interest us because it's only this part from i to j which does something. Okay, this can be like written down precisely, but yeah, let us rather draw an image. Okay, yeah, now the definition of the group associated to the telescope, Gs, is the group generated by delta one of omega one, right, and b tilde one. Okay, let's go back to our Go back to our example and consider the three cycle of two letter words given by x1, x4, x1, x5, and x2, x1. And now there's this splitting of procedure. And inside the tree, this splitting off procedure can be visualized as follows. So first we have to split off delta 2 phi 2, but now, right, it's not only phi 2 acting on these three verticals. phi2 acting on these three vertices but but it is delta two phi two which means that not only these three vertices are permuted but also the trees hanging below and we we do it uh like for every of these 10 element sets hanging below uh words of the form x5 some power x1 x2 yeah right we have here the 10 uh Here, the 10 element set where the power of x5 is like zero. Here we have x5, just once, and then x1, x2. Here we have x5, x5, and then x1, x2. Yeah, and we do it diagonally, diagonally acting on all of these sets, which can be done since they have digit design support, so everything can be done simultaneously in a homomorphic way. In a homomorphic way. Okay, now here a reminder of a well-known group. I think it's first, it goes back to Wilson, which inspired our construction. Consider B0, the alternating group of words starting with X1. Well, so two element words were starting with X1. And by definition, it, of course, lives inside B, which is the alternating group of words starting with X1 or X2. Of worlds starting with x1 or x2. But now the group gamma d, which is defined as a group generated by delta 1, omega 1, and b0 tilde is a well-known branch group. So this non-continuous part does not arise anymore since the alternating group is restricted to this subtree starting by x1 and then permuting. Starting by x1 and then permuting the sub-trees, it is a tree automorphism and doing this all over and over. It's still a tree automorphism. And this well-known group, gamma D, let's say Wilson's group, is a spinal branch group. It splits as a rest product, as Matteo showed us. It splits as a rest product of itself. Oh, here, the D is missing. Of itself with omega 1. With omega 1, so the alternating group over x. It is a permutational rest product. And as a consequence, it virtually maps onto products of itself. So it is not hereditarily just infinite, as Mateo already said. And actually, our idea was to destroy the property of mapping onto powers of itself by messing up the trees hanging below. The trees hanging below in order to construct a held just infinite group, but we failed because, well, this worked out. The projection onto powers of omega of gamma d did not arise anymore. But did it still not hereally just infinite since we created in this manner a new infinite proper quotient? But let's see. Yeah, property. Yeah, property since we are speaking about profinite completion. The profinite completion of gamma d is the infinite iterative rest product, so the inverse limit of these rest product decompositions. And it's related to our B telescope group GAD by being exactly the tree automorphisms inside G. So every other element in GAD is not a tree automorphism. Okay, now I wanted to say to state some results we had for B telescopes, but to make them precise, one has to include a further axiom. So further axioms. But let's not go too much in detail. Let's just show what these axioms are. The axioms are that certain other things also commute. Not only the B's, but certain conjugates of B also commutes. Okay, but in all examples we are aware of, they are flexible. So let's do not care about. So let's do not care about this axioms anymore. So now the result is as follows. Whenever we have a flexible B telescope and the group B is perfect, then a variety of strange things happen. The first is that G contains the infinite direct sum of the omega i's. So what this was like needed for being a frame. The second is that the inclusion into the product The product induces an isomorphism on profinite completion, but this time we have since the groups involved in PS are not necessarily finite, the profinite completions of them do not concite or phrase differently, the profinite completion of PS is not necessarily PS. It is the case if PS is a product of finite groups, but the omega i are not needed to be pro-finite. So the natural generalization would be that the inclusion of GS. The inclusion of Gs into its ambient product induces an isomorphism of the profile completion of Gs to Ps, which is the case under these axioms. So the next thing is that, well, we have the direct sum as a subgroup, which is actually the problem with being hereditarias infinite since we can divide it out and obtain an infinite group. So there was no Just an infinite group. But it does not have finite quotients, which is also interesting. So, in particular, it implies that it is not elementary abelian if Qs is infinite. And also, one can, like in the rest product decomposition, one can always split off the group in terms of rest product. But in our case, one can also split off the groups involved, but as a direct product, like Gs is equal to. G is equal to omega 1 times slight cousin of Gs, omega 1, omega 2 times some group related to GS and so on. One can just split out things over and over again. Okay, but now let's restrict ourselves to some non-degenerate things. Suppose that omega i and b are finitely generated and that omega i is non-trivial for infinitely. For infinitely many i, then the following happens: gs is still finally generated, clear, because it's generated by a copy of omega one and b. And there's an obstruction, it was more or less obvious obstruction, but if you have a family of finite groups and you wonder whether it might arise as a B telescope somehow, then this can only happen if happen if at some point the omega i do not have small finite quotients otherwise it cannot happen this is rather an obstruction for yeah gs is not elementary amenable as i said it it follows from the fact of not having finite quotients since an infinite finitely generated group which doesn't have finite quotients it still has an hereditarily just infinite group quotient no it still has always a just infinite quotient but this just Just infinite quotient, but this just infinite quotient cannot be residently finite because the group has no finite quotient, so it must be simple. But there are no simple elementary amenable groups, and elementary amenable is closed under quotients, so G cannot be elementary amenable. So gives rise maybe to new families of amenable simple groups. This is what we hope. Gs is not linear and L2A is cyclic. And L2A cyclic. So, in particular, in the B telescope we considered so far, it gives rise to a frame in the product of alternating groups. This just follows from the results just stated. And it is also two-generated, which is not well, which has to be proven. It's not difficult, but yeah, it has to be proven. So, and this is actually. And this is actually an easy, compared to, let's say, the other constructions of frames, surprisingly easy. I'll try to convince you how easy it is. So the first observation is that the groups delta L and of omega L and B tilde L, which arise inside the definition, are actual subgroups of the group associated to the V tilde scope. And to see this, And to see this, just one step. It's an inductive proof. Let's consider one step. What is needed are three cycles in each omega L. These three cycles are, well, we have seen a special case. The last, let's just say it. It is a three cycle of two letter of words of the form xd to some power l minus one, then x. L minus one, then Xd minus one, then the same Xd to the power L minus one, then X D minus one, and then X D to the power L. Three words, a three cycle of them. And now it's almost evident from the picture that if you consider the combinator of some element of the form H tilde and K tilde, where K tilde is conjugated by delta one of alpha one. By delta one of alpha one, the commutator subgroup of this turns out to be the commutator, delta two of phi two of the commutator subgroup of H and K. Yeah, the reason is that S in the Brand spinal construct, oh, maybe we can just look it up. Okay, takes longer than I thought. Right, okay. Uh here's here's uh So, here's a B. Let's see what happens if you conjugate B by the three cycle delta one of X3, X4, X5, the three cycle. If we conjugate this element by the three cycle, this part is fixed. And this part, the support of this part, gets translated to the support of this part or this part, depending on whether we conjugate by the three cycle or its inverse. By this three cycle or its inverse. But we are taking the commutator. So we're taking the commutator of an element of this form and an element where the support of this element, this part, gets shifted here. So the support side is joined and the elements commute. So everything on the right side cancels out. And what is left is a commutator of two elements which live here. Okay, we have this formula, but we assume that B is perfect and H and K were arbitrary, so the commutators, so all these commutators they generate B. And so we have delta 2 of B included in GAD. But once we have this, it remains okay. Okay, so the first part with the delta, ah, right, it's delta two of B. We still need delta two of omega two. Okay, but now we can, ah, right, right, right. It's an inductive proof and suppose it is true for by definition. All right. By definition, delta one and b tilde one generates a group. So the next step would be to prove that delta two. So the next step would be to prove that delta 2 and b tilde 2 are included. So what we have seen is that delta 2 of b is included. And now we can consider the conjugates of delta 2 by omega 1. But by the axiom of a b telescope, this generates delta 2 of omega 2. So we have delta 2 of omega 2. And now we need to prove that b tilde 2 is also included, but this is obvious since. Is obvious since by the definition of the elements in B tilde 2, one can split off tilde 2 and the tilde 1 elements, they just differ by an element of the form delta 2. But delta 2 is already included in our group, so we can forget about it. And H tilde 2 is also included in our group, so every element of the form in B tilde 2 is included in the group. Okay, first step done. So the next step is that. So the next step is that the infinite direct sum is included. But this is completely obvious, since if the delta groups are included, the difference between two delta groups, two adjacent omega groups, is just like an element which acts only in one coordinate. So these are the elements who act only on infinitely many coordinates. And we can just give an element which only acts on one. Just given an element which only acts on one coordinate, we can write it as a difference between the delta elements acting on adjacent coordinates. Yeah. And so we see that the infinite direct sum is also included. So the next observation is that the kernel of the canonical map from the frame onto the first L coordinates, it is generated by delta L plus one and B L plus one. And B L plus one. We know that these groups are already included in our groups, and it is also clear that these groups act trivially on the first L minus one coordinates. So what is needed is to show that the other inclusion is also true. And again, inductively, suppose it is true for KL and we want to prove it for KL plus one. Then since it is true by for Kl. since since it is true by for for KL plus one we can write every element in since it is true for KL we can write every element G in KL plus one as a product of the generators from KL and Jen just by rewriting the the generators it becomes clear that it can also be written as by elements in delta two delta L plus two and tilde L plus two elements so Two elements. So nothing is happening here, really. Okay, the next step is KL is the normal closure of B tilde. Okay, let's skip this. This is already a complete verification, but skip this. The last part, this I find interesting. So this can be also applied in various settings. It's based on a trick of Siegel. And in his paper, in Siegel's paper, he does not really use this trick. Not really use this trick, but writes it is too beautiful to omit. And luckily, he writes this down without using it, so we can use it. His trick is as follows. So what we want to prove is that for every subgroup, without loss of generality, normal subgroup, n in G F means finite index. There is an element L such that the canonical normal subgroup which we are The canonical normal subgroup, which we obtained in the third step, sits inside the given finite index subgroup. Okay, and now the first step are completely general. So given a normal subgroup of finite index in G, we can count the elements, we can count the groups sitting between n and g. Since n has finite index and g is finitely generated, there are only finitely many of them. Let's say m. only finitely many of them let's say m and uh okay then okay and then there exists a natural number l and elements all right and elements omega one to omega m plus one in omega l that the following happens the the conjugates of b tilde l by the delta elements corresponding to omega i's the pairwise commute Pairwise commute. And this is again the same support trick we have seen. So the support of B tilde L is at the rightmost branch. But omega L is a complete alternating group on the L level. We can just commute it to somewhere with this joint support. And then these conjugates, let's call them HI and pairwise commute. Pairwise commute. And since they are m plus one, many of them, and all of them lie. Many of them, and all of them lie in between n and g. Some of them coincide. Some of them coincide after extending them by n. n is a normal subgroup. We can consider the group generated by h i and n and h j and n. And since there are n plus one, many, there is some equality. And then the following happens since hi is perfect. Hi is perfect, Hi is an image of the perfect group B, it coincides with the commutator subgroup. But this, by general group theory, lives inside, by definition, lives inside the commutator of Hi and N. But since Hi N equals to Hj n, we can just replace this, this. But since Hi and Hj commute, we can just By just permuting elements, n is a normal subgroup. We can collect every element of n in a word on the right side. Whatever happens on the left, in the remaining part cancels out. So it lies in n. So the observation is there is some hi lying in n. But now, since hi is a is a conjugate of gate of B tilde and we are considering normal subgroups which which I forgot to mention some apparently b tilde L also lies in N. And again the same once we have B tilde N lying in N, again this commutator trick can be used to obtain delta L plus one by again the splitting off thing. And once we have delta L plus one we also have Once we have delta L plus one, we also have the tilde one by again using the commutator trick. But having delta L plus one and B L plus one by step three implies that we have the whole group K L sitting inside N. Okay, and now we are done since the following is true. If you consider the profinite completion of our frame, by definition, it is the inverse limit of all of its finite quotients, but each of the Quotients, but each of the finite quotients are given by dividing out some finite index normal subgroup. But each of these finite index normal subgroups contains a group of a form KL. And it can be easily seen that nothing changes in the profinite completion if you just only consider the groups KL. But G, but the frame divided by KL is just the That's the image of this projection. It is omega one to omega L. And the inverse limit of this product, the inverse limit corresponding to mapping onto the first coordinates, is just the product of these groups. So now we are convinced that this is very easy and go on. Yeah, as I said, we said that it did not give rise to hereditary just infinite group. not give rise to hereditarily just infinite groups but according to to to wise to a wise advice of lobotsky one should try to success one should try to sell their own own failure by as a success somehow yeah this is what what i try to do um what what are the all right okay let let's let's just um try to construct Try to construct finitely generated simple remunerable groups. Since we are ended up in a group which has no non-trivial finite quotients, we know it has a just infinite group which has no finite quotients, so it must be simple. So what are there, which of these groups are interesting? Well, count as interesting. So apparently, amenable ones count as interesting since it took a whole while to construct the first of them. So the first of them were. Of them. So the first of them were constructed by a seminal breakthrough of Yushchenko and Mono in 2013. They constructed some of them. Now let's try to do the same. Okay, now first recall what an immuneable group is. So an imenable group is defined as follows. Finally generated amenable group. That's a finite generated amenable group. It is amenable if for every epsilon greater than zero, there is some Or greater than zero, there is some finite subset inside the group which has a small boundary compared to its cardinality. So, boundary, you can take every definition of boundary you want, it will give rise to the same, to an equivalent definition. So, boundary here means the subset of f that is connected to an element not in f. So, to pick two cases in z squared, it can In z squared, it can be easily seen that it is amenable by this definition, because if we do this picture like in a large scale, then the boundary will be small compared to the number of elements inside this ball. But this does not work with free groups. Large part of the free group, the boundary is always very large. So there are two canonical examples of so they are. So, there are two easy ways to construct amenable and non-amenable groups. For non-amenable, just find a free subgroup. It will not be amenable. And for amenable, construct them out of finite and abelian parts. It will be elementary amenable. So, right, examples of amenable groups, finite ones, abelian ones, groups that are obtained from the first ones. Yeah, and for a while, that's yeah, itycobile. That's yeah, it took a while to find to find new examples, but there are examples like Matteo Sek, Gigorchuk's group was the first one. But there are also other groups, Yushenko Mono's examples of topological full groups of minimal cantor systems. And for non-amenable groups, it is difficult to find examples which do not contain free subgroups. It's known as Neumann's problem, whether this coincides, having no finite free subgroups and being non-amenable. Being non-amenable. But this is also not true. There are, for example, torsion groups with the Castrant T property, which, as Roman said, is the opposite of being amenable. All Shansky-Starsky monsters are non-amenable. Monos-Frankenstein groups are non-amenable. But you see, there are monsters involved often. Okay, now we were very surprised when dealing with But when dealing with simple groups, finally generated simple groups, it is very difficult to find examples which are not two generated. There are results of difficult results constructing simple, finally generated simple groups which are 10 generated but not nine generated and so on. So we were very surprised to see the following question in a book of Yushchenko, whether there are two generated infinite simple amino groups. Amenable groups, but these arise as the quotients of our groups. And they are also amenable, which I want to show you. But the amenable proof, the proof of amenability is rather a verification of some properties which are known to imply amenability by results of Nikosvich, De La Salle, and Yushchenko. Okay. Okay, but yeah, at least something, right? And the corollary, and what I find a bit surprising is not only the simple group is amenable, but also the frame is also amenable, but also residually finite. And I actually I'm not aware of any other examples of residually finite amenable groups which have infinite simple quotients, but maybe there are. I'm not aware of them. It is oh okay, somehow one uh actually I want I wanted to include a question which asks whether this is true for every finitely generated amenable group, whether it is always true that the finitely generated amenable group emits a residually finitely generated amenable cover. And this is a special case of the following question of Tome, which is unbelievable that there are no count of examples. That there are no kind of examples known yet. So, Tom asks whether every group, every group is a quotient of a residually finite group by a normal amenable subgroup. In other words, up to a small error term, in terms small means amenable, every group is residually finite. And apparently, there are no counter examples now yet. And so, so, in particular, it would imply that every amenable group contains a amenable residually finite cover. Okay, now to verify the axioms, to verify the conditions which are needed to imply amenability, we need an action on a counter set because Yushchenko-Nekashevich-Delasal result applies for groups acting on a counter set. One can do it precisely, but let's just draw images. Okay, and in our sense, in our In our case, the counter set arises as the infinite product of the alphabet x from x1 to xd. Yeah, okay. And the goal is to find a nice action of the frame on a counter set. Yeah, we can do it as I said precisely, but rather let's rather. Ah, by the way, this construction reminded me very much of Matimateo's construction. So we should talk afterwards. But maybe let's not go too much into detail, but rather to draw a draw image. Detail, but rather to draw images. So the first generator I told you about, it is just the root of the tree automorphisms. It's just permuting the sub-tree. Clear, it already acts on the counterset by definition. Every group which acts on the tree acts on the counter set and infinity of the tree. So here we do not have to do anything. Now the other generator is the other generators are given as follows. They permute these subtrees here. Permute these sub-trees here while fixing everything above. So, in here and also with the other trees. Now, the homeomorphism of the cantor set defined by this element is just consider the cloak on sets which are at infinity of these subtrees here and just permute them. And the remaining part, fix it. So, it is not a phaseful action, but it defines an action by continuous. Yeah, it defines an action on a Yeah, it defines an action on a contracept by homeomorphisms. It is not faceful, but the kernel is the infinite direct sum which arises in the definition of a frame. So the action is given by a homomorphism, and the kernel is precisely this group here. But this group is a direct sum of finite groups, so it is amenable. So amenability of the image, the faithful image of a homogeneous The faceful image of homomorphisms on the counter set is amenable if and only if the frame is immunable since they differ by an amenable group. Right. And by the way, to mention a huge difference to the branch group case, the group we obtain this way acts infinitely transitively, ah, okay, ah, on the counter set, of course not, but on each of its orbits. On each of its orbits. It acts infinitely transitively on each of its orbits on the counter set. Okay, now to state what is needed for being an amenable group acting on a counter set, we have to introduce two notions. The first one is the notion of a consistent point. So whenever we have a homomorphism of the counter set C and a word And a word v of length i. We say that alpha is consistent at this word if the restriction of this homeomorphism to every to the set of words starting with v is the same as just commuting the subtrees hanging below the element v. So, this is the first definition we need, and this is all right. This all right, and now homeomorphism is said to be of bounded type if the following happens: if there is a constant associated to alpha, only depending on alpha, such that if we count the non-consistent points in each level, so for each i, they are uniformly, the number of them is uniformly bounded by c. Okay, and what what we will need is. And what we will need is for our action on a counter set is that every element is of bounded type and the germs of the action are small in the sense that they are immune. So recall that if we have a group acting on a counter set and an element in a counter set, the group of germs at the given element C is defined as the quotient of the stabilizer of G, where two elements Of G, where two elements coincide if and only if they are equivalent if they coincide on some small open neighborhood of C. So let's check both of these conditions. So let's first consider the set of consistent points. So for the first generator, everything is obvious. Let's consider this generator. So the consistent points in the first level are just for this. level are just for this element are just x4 and x3 like for for for x1 it is not consistent since below x1 it it does something so it does it it permutes something so the same reason and due to the same reason x2 is also not consistent and x5 of course also not but x3 x4 and every vertex below is fixed so b tilde one is consistent at these two vertices now in the next level many more Many more elements are consistent. Also, the ones including the permutation part, because they all just permute the subtrees. They do nothing below this. Inside the subtrees, they are just permuting them. I mean, this is allowed for consistence. So in this part, the consistent points are only these two. But it is clear that going down, almost every point is consistent. The only non-consistent points are like there's only a bounded number. There's only a bounded number of non-consistent points. And for a germ, it appears that the following is happening. So the germs are either trivial or they are isomorphic to the group B. But B is the alternating group on a 10-letter alphabet. So it is finite. So it is amenable. And the inclusion, the map, the quotient map of G. The quotient map of G to the group of germs of, let's say, the rightmost branch here, yeah, it gets fixed by B, so one can so it lives inside the stabilizer, and so one can map the stabilizer to the group of germs, B lies in it, so B maps onto the group of germs, and it maps injectively. So, in fact, it is an isomorphism onto the group of germs and uh. And yeah, this is somehow clear because since in every neighborhood of C, so whenever we have a non-trivial element of B, it does something at infinitely many sub-trees hanging below this rightmost path. So and in every neighborhood of C, in every open neighborhood, there will be some of these sub-trees. So the map from B to the group of germs is in fact an embedding. And the tilde elements, all of them coincide in this image. Because the tilde elements, let's say, what is drawn here is B tilde one. So B tilde one, it consists of all of these delta maps. B tilde two, it consists of all the delta maps starting from here. It forgets about this. But they concite on the open neighborhood, which only considers the open neighborhood until here, but not this part. But they concite so they are equivalent. But they concite, so they're equivalent. Okay, and now the result is not difficult to show, as the images suggest, that the simple group, which acts phasefully, it acts by homomorphism of bounded type of C, and the group of germs is either trivial or isomorphic to B. So in this case, the great result of Yushchenko Nagachow-LaSalle says that it is amenable. So whenever a group acts faithfully by a homomorphism of bounded type on the counterset, Type on the counter set. If the germs are amenable, then G is also amenable. So, as a corollary, these groups are amenable. Okay, one last result I want to mention. Now, we have some construction of an amenable group. What can we do what the others so far at least did not do? We can extend it. Our group very much looks like a branch group. Our group very much looks like a branch group. So, in the algebraic sense, it very much differs because it is simple while branch groups are really finite. So, from the algebraic points of view, they are very different. But from the geometric point of view, acting on the counter states, they are very similar. So, many orbits, the Schreier graphs, are almost quasiometric, so very, very similar. So, one can try to just extend techniques from branch groups to this specific simple group. Simple group. For example, one could try to extend embedding theorems, let's say, from the resiliently finite groups to branch groups to the simple case, to this case, and try whether it works out. And in fact, it did. So embedding things into simple groups has a long history. It started with a famous result of Berschke-Ulam, who showed that every group embeds in a simple group. And if it's all even countable, then it embeds into a two-generated simple group by Goyushkin and Shub. Group by Koyushkin and Chup. And if it's even finely generated, then it Kamasi isometrically embeds. And there are many variations of the form. Given a group with some specific property, does it embed in a simple group with the same property? For example, a recent result of Darbin Jan and Sienborg shows that every orderable group embeds into simple orderable group, which, by the way, okay, let's not say, okay. Okay. Wait. So the natural question would be to extend this to amenable groups. Well, is it? Of course, simple aminable groups can only contain amenable subgroups. But what kind of subgroups can arise? So which aminable groups can embed into finely generated aminable simple groups? And then there are not too many results known because there are not too many. Known because there are not too many simple amino groups known. But some we found there's a very nice result of Nicolas Matabon, who shows that every Gigacia group inside the uncouth family of Grigoric groups embeds into such a group. And also he showed that every group of bonded automata, which for example includes the Wilson group I told you about, it is also a group of bonded automata. It also embeds into finitely generated symbol groups, amenable groups. Simple amenable groups. So, in both of these, it's interesting that in both results, the groups which are embedded are residually finite. Although, in a simple group, a priori, every finitely generated group can be embedded. So now we try to do it for every residually finite group, which is amenable. And yeah, okay, but let's just say the result in effect worked out. So every finally generated residually amenable group, residually finite amino group embeds into. Registerly finite amenable group embeds into a finite generated simple one. Of course, it is not amenable anymore, but of course, it is not residually finite anymore. But at least it is what is called LAF, which is a weak or weak notion of amenability. But yeah, let's not go into this. Thank you. The audience here? So, in general, if the groups involved, the omega i are amenable, you cannot tell, essentially, you cannot tell anything about amenability of the resulting group. It can contain a free group, a non-abelian free group, in the same way as the branched group in the spinal construction can also obtain, can also contain non-abelian free groups. Just try to. Just try to mimic algebraically the examples of spinal branch groups. And yeah. Oh, yeah, this would be fantastic. Not yet. But yeah, this would be fantastic. I was also thinking about it, but I could never first I could not prove it, and also I could not find a reference for this. But actually, it's very natural since both of these groups in Bottle are topic. What about the Lesopic, what about the group in the middle of the short exact sequence? I could not find it. I think it is not known. So yeah, I think that you I asked that as well. Yeah. Wouldn't it be very interesting to use the nature of last year and the paperwork? I very much hope so. We we did not seriously try yet. So the next step would be to no no no we did not even try we did we did not even try uh to make some torsion yet. But torsion I I claim will will not be so difficult, but Not be so difficult, but please sign up. Sure, sure,
