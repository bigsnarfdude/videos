Thank you. Can you hear me? Yes? Okay, thanks for the invitation. So it's my pleasure to attend such a special event online. My talk is on other packets for sub-regular unipon representations of G two. And this is a joint work with. And this is a joint work with Clifton and Andrew. Andrew is here. So here is the outline of my talk. So it has three parts. The first part is the introduction and motivation. Second part is the basic notations. The result is basically sketching in part three and a very sketchy proof. Okay, so we start from a geodetic field F and we call OF the ring of integers and Q is the number of the radio field of F. It's the size of the radio field and we have a weak group Wf. So we have an exact sequence and WF has a subgroup it's called a nature subgroup and it suggests Group and it subjects to the integer z and we fix element which is called a flippiness. It is essentially the pre-image of one. Okay, next we fix the split adjoint connected reductive group. Okay, so here we have many restrictions on, for example, split adjoint. I mean, they are here just for simplicities. I mean, the Is I mean the at least the first part, I mean, it works for any connected or reductive group, even non-connected. And let G hat be the convector of G so here are some examples for G hat. For example, if G is GRN, its head is just GRNC. If G is S S O odd, then G hat is S. O odd, then g hat is a sp 2n. And if g is g2, then g hat is also g2, but it's a complex field, it's over complex field. And consider another set, it is called a set of complex class of low-length parameters of G. So here a lowland parameter is a group homomorphism phi from Wf cross SR2C maps to G hat. I mean, here in general, I mean here in general its target is not G hat but here since we assume G is split so we can assume its target space is just G hat and pad G is a set of asomoxum class of irreducible but missable smooth representations of G F and the local element correspondence conjecture says that there should be a finite to one subjective map from pi G. One subjective map from pi G. So here again, pi G is a set of smooth, sorry, set of S maximum class of irreducible to missible smooth representation of G. And phi G is just a set of London parameters. So this conjecture essentially says that we can parametrize representations in terms of London parameters, and it is finite to one. And here are some cases. And here are some history of the about the local length correspondence. So for GRN, it is proved by Harris Taylor, Honeyard, and recently by Peter Schulz. And for classical groups, see like SP, SO, and unitary group. This local correspondence is proved by was proved by ASER and then AUSHA proved for SPSO. Protocol for SPSO and the MOC protocol result for unitary group, cost-specific unitary group, and many, several other, not many other. And this conjecture is in general still open for many other groups, for example, exceptional groups. And here are some details, some more structure about the local on the group. Some more structure about the local lambda correspondence. So here we fix the low-man parameter phi and denoted by pi sub phi, the pre-image of phi and the local correspondence conjecture. So pi sub phi is a subset of pi g and it's called the error product of phi. And we know according to the conjecture, we know this set is finite. And we can also decompose pi g of the representations according to its London parameter. You can just write pi g as a disjoint union of a packet, of L packets. So if we denote by a phi, the component group of the of image phi of the centralizer of image phi. So we just do the following thing: we consider it centralized. following thing we consider it centralizer of image phi and the mod all it's the component group which contains one which sorry the connect component which contains one and the quotient is called a phi and we denote it by i sorry height a phi the set of isomorphism class of irreducible characters of a phi so this a phi is a is a finite group and its height is just all Just all of the irreducible representations of Aphi. I mean, because Aphi is character, so Aphi is finite, so it's the same as its irreducible characters. And there should be a bijection between pi phi, the packet, R packet of phi, and the irreducible representation of A phi. So here, this is a mass structure of about pi phi. I mean, it's not only about a finite set. We know more about that. We know it's for example. We know more about that. We know it's, for example, we know it's cardinality once we know a phi, it's all determined by phi. So, here are some drawbacks. I mean, we're supposed to know more structures about pi phi. So, the first property is for we just consider tempered parameter. So, error parameter is called tempered if it is bounded when restricted to the first component wf. The first component Wf and we denote by phi sub temp TMP the subset of tempered error parameters and the local and the local correspondence we should have the tempered error parameter should correspond to tempered representation so here I didn't I didn't define tempered representation but I just assume everyone knows that but anyway it's I mean But anyway, it's it, I mean, it's certain spatial representations of G. So, here are some additional properties for tempered air packets. So, we know that for tempered phi, the air package has certain additional properties. For example, the first one is that it determines the stable distribution of Gf. And the second is it has the scopic series. Unfortunately, it is not always true if we drop the condition tempered. So, for general non-tempered air packets, these properties are not true. So, Arthur's idea is, I mean, other want to just remedy this drawback. So, Arthur's idea is just to enlarge the non-tempered air package to the so-called other packets now. So, to define other packets, let's first define other parameters. So, an answer parameter is a group homorphism from WF cross two copies of SR2C into G hype and also satisfies certain properties. So here they are omitted. And given other parameter psi, we can associate a learner's parameter fib psi, defined by this way. Defined by this way. So fib side w x is just psi w x. On the third component, we just put that as dw. D sub w is like this. It's a diagonal element in SR2C. Then other conjecture that is the existence of a pipe size. So for each other parameter psi, there should be a packet called pipe size. Pipe size, such as that the corresponding error packet should be a subset of pipe size. So, this is a so-called way. I mean, this is the idea to enlarge pi fib size, to enlarge the error packet. And such is that the pi subside, the corresponding other packet satisfies the additional properties, the stable distribution property, and endoscopic property. So, here are some remarks. So, here are some remarks. So, of course, the original motivation of Arthur is not like this. His motivation is global. And in particular, on Chase formula. And Arthur conjecture for classical proofs were proved by Arthur and several others. Actually, Arthur proved the Hayes conjecture and then proved the London conjecture. So, again, for exceptional groups. Again, for exceptional groups, not much is known. So, this talk is basically on, I mean, in this talk, we just give one interesting example for exceptional group G2. So, here is a group G2. G2 is a, we just view that as a Schulai group. It's a thinking diagram is something like that. It has two simple roots. Sorry that I couldn't find a bad picture online. I couldn't find a bad picture online. I don't know how to draw the long, sorry, I don't know how to draw the thinking diagram myself. And we call the root two, it's a long root. We call it beta. Okay, in the picture, two correspond to beta. Sorry, one correspond to beta, two correspond to alpha. And there are six positive roots. The root system is given by the next picture. So there are six positive roots, six negative roots. 60 negative roots. The dimension of G2 is 14. It has rank 2 and it has 14 roots, sorry, 12 roots. And some more notations. So G2F is just means the F rational points of G2. Actually, G2 is defined over Z. It's a Shoulette group. It can be defined over any ring. So we just consider it F rational points. And for each root, gamma, we fix. For each root gamma, we fix the root space u gamma, and we also fix the isomorphism x gamma, which is from f to u gamma. And also we fix something non-trivial thing in the in its Lie algebra. It's just a differential of x gamma one. And there are two maximal parabolic subgroups, P alpha, P beta. They correspond to the correspond to the two simple roots. So for P alpha we require that, so here P alpha equals M alpha and alpha. So M alpha is the levy and alpha is the unipotent of P alpha. So for P alpha we require that U sub alpha is the inside M alpha. So actually we know that M alpha and M beta are both of them are isomorphic to 02. And And the dual group of G2 is just, so first we denoted that by G2 hat, and we also know that it is isomorphic to G2 over C now. So it's the complex points of G2. So we denote by C2 height, the Lie algebra by mass frag G2, okay, height, mass frag G2. And similarly for G2. And similarly for G2, I mean, inside G2, you let gamma height be the corresponding corrod, I should say. I mean, it's a root of G2 height, but it corresponds to the corrood of G2. But in this case, the short root and the long root are switched. So alpha is the short root for G2, but alpha height is going to be the long root of G2 height. And we use similar notation for G2 height. Notation for G2 hat for the Lie algebra of G2 hat. And there are four orbits of a non-trivial uniponental conjugate class inside of the Lie algebra. So they are denoted by O sub long, O sub short, O sub O sub sub regular, O regular. Okay, the long just means it's long. I mean, it is generated by long root. So on O sub long just means. on O sub long just means it is generated by alpha hat. Alpha hat is the long root of G2 hat. So O short is generated by beta hat. O reg is generated by the regular part. It's generated by alpha hat plus beta hat. There's an additional one it's called a subregular. Here I don't want to give the very explicit description of a sub-regular. Description of O sub-regular. But I mean, we have a very clear description for the other three. But O sub-regular is a tricky one. It is tricky for several reasons. And for each unipotent context class, we can determine a group homorphism. I mean, basically, each unit, sorry, each unipotent context class will determine an SR2 triple. SR2 triple will determine a group homophysome from Determine a group homomorphism from SR2C to G2 height. And we denoted this map by phi sub. It is induced by O sub-regular. So phi sub is determined by O sub-regular. And we consider a very special language parameter, which is from Wf to cross SR2C to G2 head, such that it is trivial on W. Trivia on W but on this on the SR2 part it is determined by feed sub raw phase up I mean the two feet are different but you should see the difference from the slide and one special thing about this feed sub is we know that its component group is isomorphic to S3 actually we know S3 is just symmetric group of three letters Group of three letters. It is the smallest nine billion group. So, by the way, the G2 is the smallest rank group which realizes this non-abelian component group. So, for all the groups considered before, see like SP or SO or GRN, all their component groups are a billion. So, this is the first nine billion case. So, this is why it is interesting for us. This is why it is interesting for us at least. And so, here we not only brought, we not only consider a phase sub, a line parameter, we consider more, we consider lambda sub. It's a so-called infinitesimal parameter. It is defined as this. It's a map from Wf to G2 head, defined this way. We just put the inside phi sub. Phi sub is a group homorphism from homophysm from Wf cross S R2, we just put the SR2 part by still the DW the same simple element in SR2. So in fact we care about all elements parameters with the same infinitesimal parameter lambda sub and we know something about that actually why do we care about it? Why do we care about this? Because they form a nice category. Such parameters are parametrized by orbits of some action, some group action of H on some space V. So here are the definition of H and V. So for this lambda sub, in general, given lambda, how do we define H? H is going to be the centralizer of lambda, of the image of lambda, inside G2 high. image of lambda instead of g2 height in this case it is isomorphic to zero two actually we know it is isomorphic to m beta height so m beta height is a levy inside g2 height okay it corresponds to the short root beta height and it is a space v sub is i mean it's it's it is defined this way such is that the lambda sub fr fr is a for benefits inside w F writer for Benius instead of WF. Okay. Lambda sub for Beninus. So contribution by lambda for Beninus is it has an eigen space eigenvalue q. And in this case, we know that it is isomorphic to A4, just four-dimensional vector space over C. Sorry, I'm too slow. I cannot finish this on time. So, and the group of action is determined by determining inverse cross-symmetric Q. I should speed up. I probably have to omit some details. And the action is defined explicitly by some polynomial action. And there are going to be four orbits. And for each orbit, there is a for each orbit. For each orbit, there is a London parameter phi i. So there are totally four orbits. And for each orbit, there is a London parameter phi i. And only in the first case, its component group is S3. And here are the two notations. So here epsilon is the sine character of S3. Really the unique irreducible two-dimensional representation of S3. And in this And in this case, we happen to know the Longland correspondence. Somehow it is given by this. I mean, here, I don't specify what pi 0, pi 1, pi 2, pi 3 are. There are certain representations, but the point is that we know each long as the correspondence, and we also know the corresponding error packets. But again, So let's keep this remark. Sorry about that. So we only know that the third one is a tempered packet. It satisfies the underscore property and the stable distribution property. For the other two, for the other three, I should say, for the other three, Pi FI does not satisfy the underscore property and the stable distribution property. And also, in this case, the good thing is. So in this case, the good thing is each phi i is of other type. So that means we can construct an other parameter such that we can construct psi i such that phi i equals phi sub psi i. phi sub psi is defined before. And in this case, we can consider the centralizer of each psi i, sorry, the image of each psi i. In this case, we know that the In this case, we know that the centralizer of psi 0 and size 3 are S3, and the centralizer of psi 1 plus 2 are just mu2 or z over 2z, just two group. And here is our main theorem, okay. So this says, I mean, this is written very formal, but the point is the point is just we can extend, we can enlarge each pi phi i here in this table. Pi phi i here in this table to pi posi i such that it satisfies the two additional property. It is written in a very formal way just because that we want to be this theorem be more like the original author's theorem, local theorem. So here is a very explicit stable distribution problem. stable distribution property. So for each psi, for each psi above, we can define a stable distribution. It is spanned by the corresponding distribution of pi inside the other packet. So if we just consider the other packet, we don't have such a zero. So this is the explicit other packet and explicit group homorphism. Group homomorphism in the previous theorem. So you can see you can compare the other packet with the previous London packet. So the error packet for phi0, phi1, phi2, all of them has a unique element. They are singleton. But for the other packet, each one has three. For the other packet, each one has three elements. Each other packet has three elements. And from each other packet, we can associate the stable distribution. That's the main point of this theorem. I guess I have no time to talk about the proof. I mean, I have probably three more slides. I will just go just skip that. Sorry about that. I basically run out of time. So, I want to mention that is some future work. Actually, the goal of us is just to construct all of other packets for all unipod representations. So, here I just presented a single example. And probably we'll do more for other exceptional groups later. So, I mean, if you are lucky, we can. So, I mean, if you are lucky, we might be able to give probably a proof of local line correspondence for G2. Yeah, that's all. I should stop here. Thank you. Any questions? All right, let's make the speaker. Thank you.
