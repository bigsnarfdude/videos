We have one longer talk to start with with Rose McCarty. So, something about sounds like structure or graph theory. So, that's this. Great, thank you. Yeah, so I'd like to thank the organizers for arranging all of this and also for inviting me to give a talk. So, I'm going to be talking about two papers, and I started working with quite a few co-authors. So, Jan Dreyer, Ianis Electrotyriotis, Jakub Bayarski, Nico Maliman, Pierre Ollman, Michael Philip Jokis. Pierre Oldman, Mihau Philipchuk. There's a couple different Philipchuks who are active in areas, different areas, and this is Mihau. Shebashevsky, Seabirds, Sokowowski, and Tarunchik. So basically, this is a really active area of research. And at one point, two different groups combined papers that discovered the same thing independently. And I'm also going to be talking about two different papers that all relate to this idea of understanding the structure of. Understanding the structure of kinetically stable graph classes. And colorings will show up too.
