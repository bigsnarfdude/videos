Should we start or? I don't know. Maybe we start now. We have two minutes. Maybe we start now. Okay, maybe we start. So our next speaker is Professor Monica Ludovic, and the title is Functional Intrinsic Volumes and Mixed Monk Emperor Mirrors. So please, Professor. So please, Professor Budwig. Okay. Thank you very much. And thank you for the invitation. It's nice to be in China, at least virtually. I want to report about joint work with Andrea Colisanti and Fabian Musnik. And let me start with intrinsic volumes and then go to the functional versions. So intrinsic volumes is a classical notion defined on the space of convex bodies. The space of convex bodies. So I look at non-empty compact convex sets in Rn, and one way to define these intrinsic volumes is through the Steiner formula. So you look at the Minkowski sum of convex body K and dilated unit ball, so ball of radius R. So this is just the parallel set of K, distance R, so the set of all points that have. So, the set of all points that have a distance r from k, and we look at the n-dimensional volume of this set. And as Steiner has shown long ago, this is a polynomial in R of degree at most n. And here we have some constants, kappa n minus j is the n minus j is the dimensional volume of the n minus j dimensional unit ball, and the coefficients that appear here are cold intrinsic volumes. Here are cold intrinsic volumes. So, in particular, Vn is an ordinary volume, Vn minus one is proportional to surface area, the boundary measure of a convex body, and V0 is just, if you look at this formula, it's just a constant, it's the Euler characteristic, it's just one for every convex body. And these are very important functionals in Euclidean convex geometry, and they have many representations, particular through integral geometry. Particular through integral geometry, Crofton and Koshiko-Boda formulas, and also if we assume that the body has smooth boundary, we have representations in differential geometry. So here we integrate over the affine Grasmanian over this Euler characteristic. So this is one if the body intersects this affine hyperplane, and we integrate with respect to some measure. And if the measure is chosen suitable, we just get the this is the. This is the Ha measure here. Then we get the intrinsic volume, or we could use the orthogonal projection of k onto a subspace, a J-dimensional subspace. This is the Trasmanian of subspaces. And again, now we integrate the J-dimensional measure of the set, but this set now is J-dimensional. So this is just the ordinary J-dimensional volume of the set. And again, we integrate with the Haar measure and get the intrinsic volume. The intrinsic volume. And here we have the J is an elementary symmetric function of the principal radii of curvature of k, some normalization we integrate over the boundary of the unit sphere and get the intrinsic volume, or we can do something similar for the boundary of the convex body. And these are very one of the most important functionals in the geometry of convex bodies, and they're important inequalities for these intrinsic volumes and many other results. The intrinsic volumes and many other results. So, there was repeatedly asked how to find analogs for functions. So, this is what we call function intrinsic volumes. How can you generalize these notions to suitable spaces of functions? And of course, you could start with any of these formulas or these representations and then try to generalize this. But what I want to do is, and what we were doing in a series. And what we were doing in a series of papers is to use a classical result in the geometry of convex bodies, namely an axiomatic approach to this intrinsic volumes through evaluation theory. So what is evaluation? It's a very simple, basic notion. So we look at the space of convex bodies, curly k n. We look at here real-valued functions, and we say that such a function is a valuation if these inclusion exclusion. If these inclusion-exclusion principle holds, so set of K plus set of L is equal to set K union L plus set K intersected L for all convex bodies, such that your union is again a convex body. So, of course, this is a familiar property if you think of a measure. Measure have this fulfill this inclusion-exclusion property, but this is a more general notion. And in particular, these intrinsic volumes we have defined on the previous slide. On the previous slide, are valuations on the space of convex bodies. And this notion has been studied now for a long time. This started with Hilbert's third problem in 1900 and the solution by Dean. And this kind of motivated Blaschke to ask for classification of important valuation to develop a geometric valuation theory and the maybe first fundamental. Maybe, first fundamental result in this direction is due to Hartwiger, who's on this picture. And after that, many people have contributed, and also some that are here in the audience. And the result by Hartwiger is the following. If we look at the function on the space of convex body, it is a continuous translation invariant and rotation invariant valuation. So continuity is just with the usual notion topology on the space of convex bodies induced by the Hausdorff. The space of convex bodies induced by the Hausdorff metric. It's clear what translation invariant means and rotation invariant. And the statement is that all such functionals are linear combinations of the intrinsic volumes. So this is a finite dimensional space spanned by these intrinsic volumes. And let me just mention a simple corollary. So in particular, if we assume in addition that the function is J homogeneous. That the function is J homogeneous. If set is J homogeneous, this means if I multiply the convex body with a factor r, then the intrinsic valuation, the set is multiplied with r to the j. Then this is the case if and only if this j is an integer between 0 and n, and it's a multiple of this intrinsic volume. So this is a characterization of intrinsic volumes. And at the same time, Hartiger's theorem provides a classification of all. Provides a classification of all continuous and translation and rotation invariant valuations. So, this was our starting point. If we want to look at functionals on different spaces, we want to use this approach to classify all valuations on these spaces with certain properties. This corresponds to the properties that we have here in Article characterization theorem. Characterization theorem. So, this leads to the question of a classification of valuations on function spaces, and here is the basic definition. So, we look at a sum space of real-valued functions, and we look at the pointwise maximum and the point-wise minimum of two functions, and we say that a function on this space is evaluation if a set of f plus set of g is equal to the point was maximum. point was maximum set evaluated at the point that maximum plus set evaluated at the point that minimum of f and g if this holds for all f and g where everything is defined so this is the notion that we use here and it's a generalization of the notion that i described before in particular you can for example identify convex bodies with the indicator functions or the support functions and you see that And you see that for these support functions or the indicator functions, this relation corresponds to the relation I have mentioned before in the setting of geometry, in the setting of sets. And you can also, this was considered previously, evaluations on star sets or star bodies. This also coincides with this definition here. If we identify star sets with indicator functions. Star sets with indicator functions or radial functions. And I started to study the question to classify interesting valuations on some of the classical function spaces a while ago. And here are some of the results by the beginning by myself and some of my students. This is Tu Wang and Denma, Andy Seng. Also, Jin Li and Den Ma contributed to these questions, valuations on sovereignty. To these questions, valuations on Sobolev spaces and spaces of functions of bounded variation and LP spaces and on spaces of orange functions. In Italy, Andrea Colesanti started to look at evaluations on quasi-concave functions with some of his students. And in particular, in Spain, there were now recently established some results on valuations on continuous and Lipschitz functions. But I want to today talk about valuation. Today, they talk about valuations on convex functions. And let me just give you the basic definition here. We look at convex functions, and in our setting, we always look at functions defined on Rn and we allow the value plus infinity. We don't allow minus infinity, and we look at functions that are convex and lower semi-continuous and proper, which just means they're not identically equal to plus infinity. Identically equal to plus infinity. So, in particular, this is a convex function here. And on the right-hand side, this is an important class of convex functions. This here is the convex indicator function of convex set K. So it's just equal to zero on K and plus infinity outside. This, of course, belongs to the space. And this is a way how to embed the space of convex bodies in this space. And we. And since we want to have something like a Hardwiger theorem, we need a topology. And there's a standard topology on the space of convex bodies. It's called and used by the notion of EP convergence. So as long as everything is finite, this is just pointwise convergence or uniform convergence on compact sets. But if we have here boundary points, boundaries of the points of the domain, so where the function is finite, then we have to be a bit more careful. Then we have to be a bit more careful, and this is the formal definition. This is also called a gamma convergence, and this is the notion I will use when I talk about continuous valuations. Actually, in the first part, we will need a smaller space of convex functions. We will talk about supercursive functions. So, we say that a function is supercursive if the limit as the norm of x goes to plus infinity of To plus infinity of u of x divided by the norm of x is plus infinity. So this is growth stronger than linear growth. And for example, this is an example of such a supercursive function, if this is kind of something like a quadratic function. And this piecewise linear function here is not supercursive, so it doesn't belong to our space of supercursive functions. And the reason that we stick to this space is that on a larger space, On a larger space, similar results or results hardwigger type become trivial or non-interest. Okay, so we want to talk about geometric classification of valuations on this basis. So, we need, of course, some notions of invariance. Of course, rotation invariance is what you would expect it to be. So, if you have a special To be. So, if you have a special orthogonal transformation, then this relation here holds for all functions in our space. Then we say that the functional is rotation invariant. We say that the functional is epitranslation invariant. If it's not changed, if we translate its apigraph. So, if we are allowed to use kind of horizontal translations, but we are also allowed to use vertical translations. And if this holds, we say that the function is AP translation environment. We say that a function, we also have a kind of multiplication operation. This is called AP multiplication. This just corresponds to the multiplication of the AP graph of U by positive T. And we say that a function is AP homogeneous of degree J if this homogeneity relation holds with. Homogeneity relation holds with respect to this notion of AP multiplication, so the multiplication of the AP graph with this factor T. And a while ago, we established the following result. If we look at a functional that is continuous and AP translation invariant valuation, then we have what is called a homogeneous decomposition. So there exists continuous AP translation invariant evaluations set J, J from 0 to N. j, j from 0 to n, such that each of these set j's is epihomogeneous of degree j. So we can kind of split up this functional into these homogeneous parts. And of course, if we want to have something that looks like a Hartliger theorem, we want to have such a homogeneous decomposition because also this is what appeared in Hartliger theorem. And let me just mention as a remark that Mention as a remark that if you look at this result on the space of all convex functions, this still holds. But the only finite here we always assume that everything is finite valuations that have these properties on this bigger space are the constants. So this is the reason that we have to restrict to or that we do restrict to these spaces of superconversive functions. So let me just give you the definition of Me just give you the definition of what we call function intrinsic volumes. This is a theorem about a year old. So we start with a certain class of real-valued functions. So this is denoted by djn. So for zero j in zero up to n minus one, this is a class of continuous functions on Continuous functions on the open interval from zero to infinity with bounded support that would fill a certain growth condition at zero. So we allow singularities at zero, but only singularities of a certain prescribed type. And for j is equal to n, we just require that the limit as s goes to zero of this function. Of this function is finite, so we could kind of identify this space here with the space of continuous functions with compact support. So, this is our kind of parametrization of intrinsic volumes. And then the statement is the following. We define the functional as an extension of this integral here that's only well defined for definite. For or definitely well-defined for functions that are c2 plus or c2 would be enough two. So we if we have c2, then of course we can define here, let me give the definition, the Hessian matrix and these brackets with this index k, this denotes the kth elementary symmetric function of the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. So this is something. Hessian matrix. So, this is sometimes called the k-trace of the Hessian matrix. This is one ingredient of the definition, and then we take our function from our prescribed class and evaluate it at the absolute value of the gradient of u of x and integrate with respect to dx. This is well defined and by our growth conditions. Conditions we don't have problems at zero because everything is smooth here, and we have started with the function of this bounded support, so this is definitely finite. And the statement is that there exists a unique continuous AP translation and rotation invariant variation that coincides with this well-defined functional on this subset of smooth functions. Functions. And more or less, what's behind is here: if you look at this term, this can be extended to so-called Hessian measures. They were studied and introduced by Tudinger and Wang some 20 years ago and studied also by Colisanti and Tuk in a somewhat different setting. We looked at this in. We looked at this in a more general setting of this kind of extended real evaluations where this kind of gradient term appeared. But this setting, unfortunately, is not enough because we have a singularity here. So we have allowed that this function theta has a singularity at zero. So we cannot get the existence of this extension. The existence of this extension from the existence of these nice Hessian measures. But we have to work a little bit harder. We were looking at so-called singular Hessian valuations and we're using some approximation results to define this, what we call functional intrinsic volumes. And basically, the main subject of this talk is to give a different representation of these functional intrinsic volumes, where we can write these functionals in an explicit way. These functionals in an explicit way using a suitable class of measures that are defined as mixed and Mauser pair measures. But maybe the first question that one might ask is, why do we call them functional intrinsic volumes? Is this justified? Is this a reasonable definition? And we think it is because we have a Half-Wigger theorem. So a functional is a continuous AP translation and rotation invariant variation if and only if there. If and only if there exists functions from these prescribed classes, such that set of u is a linear combination of these function intrinsic volumes for every functions in my space of supercursive convex functions. So, of course, if you look at Hartweger's theorem, I've just put it here again, there is an analogy. Analogy and these functionals that we have written here correspond to constants times the intrinsic volumes. So this is the reason why we call them intrinsic volumes. And let me go to the question. What we wanted to do is to have a more explicit representation of these. Of these functionals, and let me not talk about the proof of this result. This is something I've talked about before, but let me talk about this new representation now. It turns out to be convenient to switch to a dual setting. This is something we can do, and this is, of course, well known. Okay, actually, here's a corollary again. Actually, here's a corollary again. This is a characterization of intrinsic volumes, functional intrinsic volumes, as we had before for Hartbiger theory. Okay, so now the dual setting, we look at the Legendre transform or the convex conjugate or convex conjugation with the usual definition. And if we look at the space of all convex conjugate, Base of all convex functions v that are always finite, we use this notation, then this Loganto transform or convex congregation is a continuous bijection between these two spaces. And it's not too difficult to see that if you have a valuation on this space of finite-valued convex bodies, convex functions, then the dual valuation defined as set star of u is equal to. set star of u is equal to set of u star, the Legendre transform. This is now defined on the space of supercursive convex function as stated here and it's still evaluation, it's still continuous. So basically this means we can switch between one and the other setting and actually there are no problems if we look at a valuation that is AP translation invariant on the space. AP translation invariant on the space of supercursive functions, this corresponds to what we call dually AP translation invariant valuation on the space of finite value convex functions. And if you plug in the definition and the properties of the Legendre transform, it's easy to see this corresponds to a valuation on the space of finite valued convex functions with the property that if you add a linear function or a constant or a linear function and a constant, this doesn't change. And this doesn't change the valuation. So instead of talking about AP translation invariant valuations, we can now talk on this space about dual AP translation invariant valuation, where we have this definition. And the following two results hold. And this is just a straightforward translation of what we had on the previous slide. We define this dual valuation, soon the convex conjugation. Convex conjugation and this now has a representation as an integral over R n zeta of norm of x times again this now J trace of V dx for every smooth function. And again, there exists a unique continuous Dooley EBIT translation invariant notation evaluation that extends this functional and all functionals on this frequency that are continuous and duly EBIT translation. And dual epidemic translation and rotation invariant are linear combinations of these J intrinsic volumes function and J intrinsic volumes for J from 0 to N, with again the same kind of descriptions through these particular classes of functions. And again, what I want to do is to find a different representation, a more explicit representation of these functional intrinsic volumes. And this is done through a Steiner formula. So we have the following result. Now we start with a θ in D and N. I've mentioned that this just corresponds just to the space of continuous functions with compact supports. So in this case, we don't have a singularity, so everything is nice and smooth. Then we look at this nth function intrinsic volumes for such a theta. For such a theta, we look at something like a parallel function v plus r times h b n, where hbn is just support function of the unit ball. So hbn of x is just the norm of x. So this is what we look at. And the statement is: again, this is again joint with Andrea Colesanti and Fran Musnik. This is a linear combination. This is a linear combination. Sum j is equal to 0 to n, r to the n minus j, kappa n minus j. Now the function intrinsic volume of order j with the function zeta j of v, where theta j is given to such an integral transformation by the function zeta. So let me just put in the classical Steiner formula. So this is. Classical Steiner formula. So, this is in a certain way very similar. We look at something like a parallel function. Here we have a parallel set. Here we have the same kind of structure, but the difference is here we have the v j k, while here we have to use a different function to describe the functional intrinsic volume. And maybe just two words about the proof. We use We use Rayleigh's formulas in the proof. We also have used Rayleigh's formulas in the proof that this extension exists a bit before. And we also have a direct proof using the functional Hartlinger theorem. This is actually quite simple if you have the functional Hartlinger theorem to get this result. To show that such an expansion exists without understanding what happens with these transformations is also Transformations is also a simple consequence from what I've said before about this homogeneous decomposition, but to describe this completely requires more work. And in particular, we get from this an explicit representation of these functional intrinsic volumes. This, of course, just trivially by differentiation. And now, if we want What's important is this transformation that maps theta to theta j. This is an abijection, so we can invert it and we can describe all functional intrinsic volumes for arbitrary functions theta in my right class by this formula. So, this is a kind of new explicit representation of these functional intrinsic volumes, but actually we can do even better. We can do even better because we understand how to write this function intrinsic volumes for the case that the index j is equal to n. So let me describe this here. This is already two years well published. If we take a function in my class D and N, as I've said, this corresponds to And as I've said, this corresponds to continuous functions with compact support and the finite-valued function convex function. Then we can write this function intrinsic volume as an integral over Rn a theta of norm of X integrated with respect to the Montgomery-Pierre measure. So, in particular, this is of course a well-known property of the Montjam-Pierre measure. If everything is smooth, this is just the integral over Rn. Is just the integral over R n zeta norm of x determinant of the Hessian dx. And maybe just recall what the Montana pair measure is. Of course, you could just get it as an extension of this measure that's written here in the smooth case, or you can define it as the Lebesgue measure of the image under the sub-differential. Image under the sub-differential map of a Borel set B. So this Moham-Pair measure is a nice Radon measure for every finite value convex function. And this now allows us to, if you look at again in the Steiner formula, we now have to plug in V plus R times the support function. And this means we can use the following to get a more explicit representation. To get a more explicit representation, we can use polarization. This is, of course, something that's well known. That we can write through polarization define a mixed Montchampere measure. This is how here's an explicit formula for this. And again, these are Adon measures if we start with n-tuple of convex functions. And just as a remark, the Hessian measures, so the measures with this density that I had. Measures with this density that I had before in my representation of the function intrinsic volumes in the smooth case. R belong to this family of Mojam-Pair measures. I just have to plug in the function v j times, and here I plug in the quadratic function n minus j times. Then this gives me this right density here, and it gives me the And it gives me the jth hash measure. But for us, we use a different family of Monsieur pair measures. We plug in the support function of the unit ball n minus j times. And this is the notation that I use. The Monsieur pair measure m Aj is just the mixed Monsieur pair measure. I plug in the J times and I plug in the support function n minus J times. Minus j times. And if I put now everything together, what I have said, it's not difficult to see that we have the following explicit representation of these functional intrinsic volumes for any allowed function theta and any convex function, finite value convex function v. This functional intrinsic volume is equal to an integral over alpha of norm of x. norm of x d m a j v of x where now this alpha is a continuous functions with compact support and this is the explicit representation of this continuous function this is again the same integral transformation as before and in particular if i look at the smooth case i've said that you can write the mounch and pierre measure using the determinant and you can write this new You can write this new family of mixed Monsieur pair measures by using the mixed determinant. I still write debt for this of the hash of my function v j times. And here I plug in the hashion of my support function. This is just one over norm of x, the identity matrix minus this tensor product of x divided by norm of x with itself, n minus j times. A minus j times. So this is an explicit representation for these function intrinsic volumes. Of course, we can also do this in the dual setting or in the primal setting. So here we were looking at finite valued convex functions. And the first result I had were on supercursive functions. And as I've said, there's a projection. Functions and as I've said, there's a projection. You can translate one class of results to the other. So, this is what you have in the dual setting. So, if we take one of these allowed functions in my class djn, and I now take a supercursive convex functions, then my functional intrinsic volume is an integral over R n alpha of norm of y d mu a j star of A j star of u and y with the same representation of alpha in terms of zeta as before. And this kind of conjugate motion pair measure is just defined as the motion pair measure, the major that we have introduced, and instead of u, you use u star and you will get this result. So this is all This result. So, this is, of course, maybe less explicit as before. Before we had this representation using the motion pair measure, and we knew how this looked in the continuous case, we had just the mixed discriminant. And here we have something different. But again, we can write it explicitly or even more explicitly in the smooth case. In the smooth case, we have now a convex function, again, supercursive. function again supercursive with C2 with positive determinant, we get here, this is some normalization, we get the integral over Rn alpha of the norm of gradient u of x times tau of n minus j u of x dx and the tau k of u and x is the case elementary symmetric function. Case in a mentor asymmetric function of the principal curvatures of the level set of u at the level t, where t is just equal to the value of u at x. So at each point x, we of course have a level set, and this elementary symmetric functions of the principle curvatures of this level set appear in this formula in this explicit representation of the function intrinsic volume, at least in the smooth case. And this is what we In the smooth case, and this is what we know in the general case. But again, this is a representation using an explicit Radon measure to describe this functional intrinsic volume. And of course, we can go back. We can now reformulate the Hartbeger theorem. So again, we have now it's a class of functionals. So let's suppose we didn't know the results. We didn't know the results from before. We could introduce a class of functionals through this new family of Montchampier measures and arbitrary continuous functions, this complex support. And why are these functionals called intrinsic volumes? Because we have the Hartliger theorem again. So this is a different equivalent version of the Hartliger theorem. So functional on the space of supercursive. On the space of supercursive convex function, is a continuous AP translation invariant and rotation invariant valuation if and only if there exist now continuous functions with compact support, such that set of u with a sum j is equal to zero to n integral over r n alpha j of norm of y d m a j star u and y for all u in my space. In my space of supercursive convex functions. So, again, this is just a different representation of these functional intrinsic volumes, but it has a property at the advantage that it's more explicit. So we really don't need an extension result, but we can write it explicitly. But of course, if I go back again to the dual case, if you look at this representation, the density function. The density function that we have has a singularity, but here we have a nice Radon measure, so we do have a nice explicit representation in this case for these functional intrinsic volumes. Okay, this is actually everything I wanted to say. Here's a bit of literature on this. We have this actually is what I've talked about today and this is in preparation, but we should put it online the next week or two. The next week or two. And thank you for your attention. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much for the nice talk. So any questions, comments?
