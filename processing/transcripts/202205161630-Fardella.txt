Tele University Autónoma de Barcelona. Actualmente is Professor Titular Investigador of the Eurocionist In Social Education of the University of Andrew. The Fardela participates in different projects of individual investigations and society. What we are culturally has in relation with atademic. Mucha gracias Carla, we have the palabra. Mucha gracias, Andrea, mucha gracio invitación. Well, honorazo estar confirmo con uste lovances de la investigación que mosido estarrollando acacon en el keyupo aca logimáño la que el día logo interdisciplinar funda. Interdisciplinar fundamental para can justice also the problem that combo ancesto as the general is the first gracious for the invitation and this one insume también or whatever for the discussions that have the proximity participant or have a Ten una veto, if possible, we have and that's one. Ojalabente, minutes for this time for a discussion. Fondo is Enfondo estevel que es pues meno también. Ya, no, super. Ya enton se convertía advantaga, tamos vena yo no. Y, but complete. Exundo tamos quendo que no se porque tengula la vara del A si sierto? I see. I see, but we're the pantallia moderator. As a formato presentation moderate, like this keynote or PowerPoint. Eso keynote with PowerPoint? Ah, aita, aya. Aisa. Yes, super. Magnifico. Yes, the logo gram. Bien. Legir es tones. Es una presentación bueno gelindo el pora yado ajunta, los frimero eso na legre muchos eludos. I think it seems to tremendous. Well, then this presentation la titula. So this presentation laid the importance of generalization in the scientific. I want to find an experience personal experience that share this with us. Myself, the verdict that I in the record that we are very in studies of generosity, what we see that many of the general science of the personal experience. And many experiences with what is happening. The people of study generate and that has information in general can see that there also generates it. So in this problem, the scientific queue. I want to say that I sociological work. Well, it is ecological, but I have a very disciplined por adoption that the sociological adjustment of the work. And I studied my doctoral study, and doctoral, of the postdoc, and the investigation, all measure for the sociology of the work, and in specific sociology of the academic work. If you prefer sociology academic, but not from a general, and there is the info, the piece of And this apart from it because I brazen my first place, and I think that there simply can be the work of camp because I want to brazen that I could make an academic. It is working of camp, and you can bear four camps or in a congress and In a Congress and not, but with the first, the idea limited to irrevocable manner, because the idea when I congressional and good, when you are more dimensional because all this is insolid because. Insolito because I know that embarrassing scientific. So, how do you do that? Because I understand that I are a scientific, but all this is difficult and all in general applicable to societies of work of science to an experience. Experiencia part of a personal experience. My general, what I want to do with you work the reorganization of science, from a sociological perfection. And everything that we work with theoria, social de laciencia or superiors, first have notified or documentaries. Or documentary documents that the organization of science organizations just change radical management. And this also does not organization of science organizations and also the superior education. In the case of particularly, what we have is that the interior: the superior, also like this. But the public policy also superior, also because there are unity of. Superior also, because there are massification of superior education, the diversification of financing superior chambers. It is also very important. And this is a repercussion very important for the academic. And because the university can change, if it changed its principles for the first time that are the scientific and academic science, how we do that theory of university changes. Cambie. Well, the more obvious that has liberal organizations are their instruments. And here, for the extra, is the intelligence of a series of instruments that have to promote the efficiency and quality of the efficiency in our context. In our context, I have a critic literature that the slaughter and lesser queen of the academic capitalism or the corporatization of the university. What is here is that the university will enter transfers, a series of instruments of financially by competence, or everything that idea investigates. When our work is a request in this work, to make a series of systems that will accompany monitored and medicine of the product and scientific product, and a caso una radical cases, the remuneration is associated with academic. Académica. This four instruments of the force of academic installed vajo three central arguments. And this I would say an global installation of how changed the university and how the university. First, in the name of excellence, we are going to be able to say the mechanisms. The mechanism of, for example, the ranking or the medication of Calida, or the security system of Calida, is installed that media that transmits more university. And I can transfer the science, my transmaster, but I think with a questionable maximum and more control, the product scientific product will be what. Product scientific product will bejor, what is questioning about the science of the law of scientific and science. Luego ogumento-central argument to your typopolitical has to see the idea of provided ideas. And the majority of the processes of rendition of processes or include the competence of the provider, the stadium and utilization. And for that And for that, however, transparent. And the last argument of installation has to do with the idea of the merit. It assumes that the distribution of the funds that are limited, it is going to represent the merit. No, in this debate, if this good males, if But I don't know if it is a very popular and that the ingredients of the women in the science and not lingers are the when we say, have to basically constitute it. And with the idea of And with the idea of the competition system or idea normal, visual, and indicated that they are transparent for all the systems also competencies are transparent. Now, we are saying that a competence just, but the establishment of a map of what evaluation of the academic social or facilitating some Do some forma ingresso de la mujiere y también la senseo de la mujereso a loto espace de la uniercia. Siento vía conquistar certos languar que sí en stando absolutely circado para linglos or mujer. Ya entos logo, say, yo seque pues generar certa in commodía, prodo alguna manera el system neoliberal distión de la unierci si al facilitate. If the facilitated facility the competence of women in the academic space. The obligation of summer in terms of people what the cost of star. And this is super interesting because the women are gathering, but report a more brutal. And that. Brutal and that male or the cost of this work to solve personal management. Yes? Ah, well, you work what have you considered, but also you are also like this in the link to women who have competitive sabia. And I think we have to use a little bit of this because the university for excellence is. Because the union por excellence in the public space, and the public also por excellence associated with the humbler, así como space private associated. So, the university is illustrative for the public, for the most legitimate public space, and social idea of economy and progress. And, In many public funding in not allowing the music, but a rally in a more negative university of age and necessary to advance and idea of the central segment that organized the university and also how the incorporation of other groups that. Incorporation of other groups, which allows neoliberal regime, permit or transformation and universal university. So, one thing that revives, breaks, that is this general evidence to organize the general life, and this is a masculine feminine. This organization, scientific, break also, the investigation and liberal solar como es investigation and reflections because it is important in focus generating the science. So, super corrupt, but the idea of the vinyl, yes, no, no, sandrea, but unideapo, como. Unida como popular, or frequently conversada la idea of the Vinome general, but repair for a como queen language. My then, there are authors that are more Spanish that Genial, who la recommended, Maya Perez order author colours also that economía feminine economy. Feminista. Well, the economist and feminist economy are also because of all your disciplines aid disputing a science that we have very masculine, which is the economy and productivity, or the world of production, certainly. But yes, that the world is organized by this general memory that you know we are the masculine. Masculine, I guess that is a cultural contrast, and it is not a query like the discussion of sexual discussions, not the sexual bin, but also the essentialism of discussion. So, if we want to be like the cultural vitamin organization in this binomial organization, where we have a very powerful thing that is the productive, the public, the The public, the following of the rentable, the autonomous, and the following marriage, the following capital. Constraint is the domestic, the private, the cuid, the vulnerable, and that is where one maintains the virus. It is efficient to unimagin in Blanco, Inegro, where Who appears the two polo? The superior of the summer apparently the public productive public visible. This video, I super interested in the web temporary, the private, reproductive, community, the case, the invisible case, the case. I think this is more familiar. The unit of this is that the economists are economic. This is what the feminist economist is saying, which is in economic terms that flexita achieve when, yes, that we are in the economic language public queue values that the puerta de la fárica del empresa, alimentado, vertido, vañado, y aviendo. And when the valor monetary, we have calculated the valor in our work so that age to school by Olympia and a hombre que noise of Olympia de la cyclo economy. That product cycle economic product. And this is what this work of visible. Debas the visible tenemos. Well, the voice will be a correction, the uralog. Guy with plants, all that. But also the papa, also the pantomime is inferno because it would be quite all this in a way, ajar that has been. In general, a lot of cuidan and tiene unrole independent if they don't. So, so that cyclo economic complete need or domestic demand of the life. So, the capitalism. The capitalism and the economy only visible the work that the capital, but the work that we have respected from the vida and the maintenance of the vida is fundamental to cyclo economic. So here, as a economist of music, who calculate the time that works in domestic space, and supervision because. And supervisor because well, if you go or the colleague, we have colleagues of Chile, but there are a group of colleagues just economists that are calculated the cost of this cost, and a queue percentage of the PI, the ingredients of Russia. That is more than what the mineral is. That is that the mineral is the same as TI, that is one of the ingredients more important. Well, if you calculate it, and the pony valor to the journey is. Cula and put the journey of work in Mexico. Very force law more important. But I wanted to ensure the work as the productive cuando polo queen domestic complete cyclo economic and impossible to social visit the visit. Ya? Yen, aura. La pregunta que nos wecemos nodra en el equipo nuestro.  Well, that is how disciplined history or economy, like a economist, like a social science, like a academic of mathematical, as academic ideas. Academic Uydal. Generalín general, when you can see this test that we have, like a scientific general because the scientific combat or withdrawals, also middle, that can be the idea. That can be passed in the diaper, including that with a letter, a little distributed, or also in the laboratory. We are in that figure that homes. It is a hombre queen. Osari is a hombre. Second, it's something that can bear a responsibility of cuidado y para se. And to see what I say, we are like a piece of visit the middle visit. This mythology, as great, so that they are a little distracted as inclusive as the generality with a cura, certainly, but estimation is not to do the feminine. How do we not see the relationship of equity relationships and dependence, nineteen. Dependency, nin la vulnerability. Delga man identify scientific ideas. It's a name, but our name. Adimás algien que puede como abandonar el world, real for the world idea, images parece que con este imagen que el pensamiento o que lasida se logra solo en una personal, individual and exilencio. And I don't know here in the Las Connega, but one of the things, or you also machine, also good conversation with a colleague, or when one is very cosaurous. So, this is a figure of the great pensador or the great intellectual, or the great scientific in the relationship possible, if it is hombre. Or if we don't have the relationship of God, or responsibility of cuidal. Or responsibility. General Bodia que laid scientific organizations in general, yes. Again, the Congress also are passing that only are possibly that not relations of dependency with our subject. Also, have a good thing that allows the refund of legal or negotiated, ya. And I don't know if they are the singularities that are canon, singularity that have to be in discipline, but what we have is that for example the Congress are the Congress in Guardia because there are congregosis unguarded. Other things. Other things, because the role of entropy of the academia and here to make a very simple figure because many colleagues very like in the world that will find investigation of the students. That is an imaginary work, but persistently understand the existence of. Forma dentender, the sexual tradition. So, the homes that will recognize, vana gain for the investigation, van gain credibility. Mientras que la académic academia sequencing, and this also parcel of a investigation. The academic will study the students, and Used to the studio, and we maintain the sales of the department, department. Other factors, in the puede ver el Vinome degenero, is in here that also collects members, that the colleague with the number that is investigable, which is the relevant investigator. And here is where you know that the object of investigation also allows us to info general. Info general. There is the history uste in the greater grand political history is a masculine, the time in the story of the story, the history of the Cova, the history of the coconut, no si en disciplines more abstract like this restera or there the different differences investigable. Ya? Well, in the success, but the investigable organization, the discipline that investigates the feminine society, informed sciences, ecology, tienda, recipient financially or financially much better. Much better. Ade more que son colleagues that have remuneration more vaja tienden men grace to entrop organization. Good aura, I want to continue a quito que es opinion algo interestante y es que uno pué preguntar bueno y cómo es para una mujer, como la experiencia laural experience una mujer que tragenciencia y por. And because I think, together, women who work in 16 and the request that we have worked here the time is that effectively we have a common significance that we have essentially within and the experience of producing with conditions of subternia. You are the science capacity of generating Degenerate with legitimacy. The science method that allows legitimate. But when a person is not the group, or not, aunciation that allows legitimacy, because the historical, nothing in the public space, like the parents, women that porous, also prepare to decide. Because they are, but we have a formation that is legitimate to be in this construction verdict. De construir verdades. Al termino osa paro study de genero important studio esta position in a woman, because it is not a position like a position for a woman or this category. So that has common aqueous women that are here that we are not entirely academic. A homogeneous. That is like a qualitative thing, we have tried in this interview. We have more discipline, and we are translated, and the summary of analysis of discourse. Other days, we have the strategic technology discipline, and we don't text analysis. We are textual data, and we are women, and we are with a category emergent from the data or interest in women. And here, for example, super good to do an analysis as well, which is a frequency. And then I share with the interests of the home and supervisor, because So, what intuitively, but many of the women will be able to escalate permanently. So, very good to women in the alliances and fundamental academic academia. Mucher don't secures like the great idea, but they have a non- With a nosotro la insecurity, there is a permanent period of change. But the first day that I was very, there is a permanent segment. This is not a word, I aquí extraneer, yo, yo uncorporated, in this way have many vistas, sexualized means the public insecurity or. Or interventendo perdon por el space that usando y in contraposition eso to se laza feminina como pa mucho mushier tener académic or simplemente tener colleagas académic es la el pie seguro pa seguira delante. Ya? Well, no solamento. But here we are not levitating as the patron narrative. There is only because the terminology is simple, like what is the history that is secures the academic story, or what they are the ideas that are the interest. And this narrative sequence: logic is divided. Look at this divide in sequence narrative in the narrative of the scientific trajectory and narrative that faculty or scientific trajectory. It is the innovative and interesting because the first a year, of the scientific child of the first year, I learned from doctor who post-doctoral and idea of a strange idea. I want to I aquifer my cuer, also known as with the homes that are thinking, many of the women in culture and culture, much of the academic relations like very much that are much, or not in the city, or not the curb or color neutral. That is the interview. Because it is que launta nuest osa la. Osa la idea no que sean libres de legir siquier en el legir una carra scientific orien el legir una familiar. The problem here that legir, no siloenos, no que una cos este por el otro, the problema que en que la cot two coso se plante como dod quarrela separa cuandondra la via no devira series. And other work narrative very typical idea of voluntarism in Mexico. Mexico. That is a concept that we have a philosophical concept. And the idea of the voluntary Mexico parcel as a patron idea that has to see that with the idea of yo coming for the child. And the voluntary Mexican volunteers because there is a attendance to think that the supermarket can log all. And in relation to this Mexico, because everything for many, we are logged in every day, and that. No, we are all, and that is a social problem, and it doesn't have to be with a personal competition. And no, I or the colleague more competent. This has to be with a social structure, for the social structure in our chambers, with the volume or with the force of a fort. But many narrative is also a question of force. So, I'm not going to have the triple. So, how do we function? How to function the idea of Máxica de Mientrama mejor me valir and many of us cannot go into the triple effort. The problem is that this personal problem that final and rebot. And it also is the force personal, if it could minute in the trajectory that nobody has, and that is like. But the universe, the facultative faculty or the promoter of scientific career is very unit because a certain point of the scientific trajectories of general visits of cadaver visits the women separate the family and the. De separate families and the work and general strategies of conciliation. And this for the general society looks like collective work to visualize linguistic language. And this supervision because in some minutes, women see here a conflict and people understand that there is a possibility of Joy Tim. Odros relatos que se writera en la académica algo que le llamamos sacar la go y aquí supervointo because what we have a patron bien recurrent also mujer en fundo la graduación como investigador la mujer en lo bien con tutoro de doctora sino que bien por logera with the adjudicación del firsto y la adjudicación del firsto qua And the judicación del first cuandoícen ah, enter yosi puedo sera autora y autoridad en miaría. Ya tante del firsto, a mer tienden seguir muy pega perdo entíblando in Chile. But very connected to their studio, with their tutor, with people who allow or sumentor. And there is a minute in queer music. I was because I lived here the voice, I know, my doctor are mijo, and it is a little because I will say metaphor that has to see with the idea of creating that creator of ellas. This is a metaphor supervised as a As a patent, when the unfortunate role of authority scientific, and here what is their idea of extraordinary as reparation, Imagine a stranger, I produced here and produced with the product. Other of the patrons like bonito of this relatives facultative, the idea of the reciprocity. Of the reciprocity, in general, the women in general relatives of many voluntaries in Mexico and recognizing that the possibility of vivid space of management. And I think that also in many ways, there is the final of the trial. The final trajectory is the idea of creating the pleasure, creating man, creative man, and that super good idea there is more time to say, well, a fragment of a colleague of philosophy that the principle of time is problemas philosophical problems that masculine problems. And I've also seen, like, all its first, in the philosophy, as How of a posture? And how final of their final permission to be in the campo of the philosophy to fruit? And you in the world of what is the world that the authors are, with the problem that the greatest place. This type of narrative in relation to emancipated rules. Narrative en relia son bien emancipador de lo que son una chara scientific pala munchier. Vienna yau terminando, ya, but what do we do as well? But because important this study, and because important recognition is what the science has a social group with us, that the science is neutral, and because it is one, what is the neutral? The scientific method has the capacity or the tramp of the neutral when a subjective tradition on what masculina: the first is naturalized neutral, and recognize that the science is with a condition. And that is social condition that in the fundamental college with a sexuality. Point not this has epistemic relevance, epistemic relevance in the sense that it is necessary that we know that the science is not objective and in relation to genericity. And if it's for example of class and And including indigenous diets, the science that in the center of Europe by all the other forms of known illegitimate channels, and that is what in the colleague, but the recommendation in chanta. Well, other things that we can relevant, because here we are, What we are not discussing the condition of the mujero lacien, we are not saying not of the mujero science. We are landing that the science parents who are not neutral, that social condition that the determiner. So also that allocation of officials don't know that they have a certain group of friends. And the more legitimate importance. And for the last reconciliation of manera, cotidian pornography. And for all other diversity that scientific championship, there. Yes, the verdict that I generated is restricted action, restricted conduct, and order, restricted science. A science that is liberally for the final or financial queue has more responses and impact with more calculations and much of what we have. And that's what I'm going to start for my part. Well, here you can micara, but I represent a tremendous colleague of colleagues and masses and other diversity that we work, and all this is a work. Yam of my colleague. Yes, that's going to compart so that we conversar. Mucha gracias. Gracias colegas mucha gracias have a cosa for sit, but I don't know the colegas and the zum. Well, in zum there commentarios. Voy pass for zuma ah for si trendio. Mecucha color la si, si ah buena ya. Ay una parte las gientento peso. When this comment is already, etc., ah, here well, that executive, we have to interdisciplinarize because here you have. Y eros es claro comes like the mathematico persona. But there is a question concrete and the vega contestar y vajo que criterios valida lo que es investigable por tito, pero seema que el meto scientific mete, certo. The meto scientific, but no meto 2, yo que porque una unidad para una. A unidad for a para que investigable to medible, or observable. So, it's super because I can discipline and clarify when I can imagine the study, but the psychology is a scientific discipline. But you know that the psychology has a sique, how observe the sique. No, no. No, no. So what you see the psychology is inventing a object. For example, inventor of intelligence. That is what intelligence is not what I say. So what is the most creative object? No que vaien recognition objects medible object in creating objects to their media that is distinct. So the object also. Yeah. Endos el objecto tamer una contrucción sugieta al albinomio. Endos elo investigable también es una contrucción sugieta to albinomio degenero. Marisabel, tiene el devantara manu. No solo quiería aquotar que estabregunta que estabadí estabadentre una discussion que que eso investigable mathématic investiga, que matifízil. Mathematical queen mathification. So, just because Andrea que nosotro nosamos meto scientifico, por esem pledges abstract don. So, this was perfect. Gracias, Isabel. Otrogunta in chat: que los hombres no communique en insecuridades en el las entrevistas, pregunta. Significa que tiene menos insecuridades, o que ana prendivo recogno ser. Or that ana brendido recognizer insecurities don't. Okay, ya la dra ve. Vua consto experiencia para resondre. La dra ve no lo trave, sino que wu do dandofo el mayo feminista in Chile que no fue trave, pu fa se motri año, Rali. Yes, the goses that are a assembler, with a colleague, and one colleague of assembled. De assembled all day concunta much, no sique, and the colleges, and spectacular, and I say because I want to tell you that I have a number, no hombre. But you don't come, but if the last year the universe Entonces in seguridad que tiene que ver concer una minoría. Obio, obvio si uno yo un pare que no conos tamienso sienti insegur, because no cono se los patrones de conducta decelugar. Soon, ser una aminoía es entir sin segura, because one el entono, uno no cono se naciaramente eso codigo. Y alguno selo, pués concer, pero cando, all colo son varoné. Colleague son barone claro a certain thing that of one who darfuera yo entre fragmentada es contexto laural. Ogultando parte del cuerpo, occultando parte la emotion, occultando se ya demas entra inventando odra. Ahora es vonito porque ah other studio que muestran como la inseguría el hombri bien en otra cosa for. For example, a lot of things. So, the articulate of a sociology that homes not the casa and the typical relativity of the women of a narrow vaccine, it is also generated a sensation of extragery, but in the case. In the case. So, well, admac and create the science also home, but it's a code like a coolino tamer of the competencia of the accreditation work, as demonstrations for a world for the current, since emotion in the homes in the champion, and it's a work, a question important to me. But So, So, no self-la graniometry, as mimaciences also construct. Well, I feel like many queer reflection queer questions or more reflection, I resonate much in the. This part in the reference to the idea of the great scientific, well, not a person, it is a name that can abandon the world. And that absolutely because I have this sensation, that is a sensation that has returned. Question reiterated how can the mathematica que pudira llegra ser porque no puedo abandon el mundo. Simplemente, no puedo. So la pregunta y la reflección sería. Emberdad, osa es como meque a loda emberdad necesitamos habando nar el world para ser great scientific obien. Obviously, and the segunda is depending on the responding of the first resource, it is odríamos, o que demos, or yo, almenos, como mujer, y mi vida abandonar el mundo entonces bueno ahí dejo esas prejuntas. Yu pienso que Andrea, repondora, omos comentando sí, yú crio que la. Or commento say, I cried that the mito del Geno que vandond el mundo para accedera la grandia enraía es mito. Y ito que tieni la function descluid aque ya que no puemo avandona el mundo por la grande. O que biieno que mos andona el mundo. E umito. Osa la idea, esta idea de que de que la brigantes y la generalida sepro en una cabeza en reposo solitaria colo. Repository solitaria with the tier - but I have changed, my meduito, or the plateau or my second queen that with affliction that the padences elite can be loomed. But all control with the dirt. Tyronía distraught with me. And many, and very good. What are you doing? Osacroconomiz grandes freenos ancient sensación de scientir que para estar el matemática, notca vandonar el mundos, yo que tonca cabando nar my vida de una manera, like don que paraderme de certos aspectos to idoo mucho como costo personal de. Much like a personal delays that we also want to have a person. Asido, I'm going to say, holy Carla, Quetal. Respect the estimate, I think, to complicate a little bit more intention, but if the women don't And capacity with some examples of colleagues who have the legido y can brilliant in their But if you put in discussion about their feminine, but what this can also be a social complicated enlightenment is compatibilizaro, compatibilizar representaciones. Say. Grego que avialana el zú que daniela. Mana. Grio que avialina el sun que daniela la mano levantada. Silvia crio? Silvia Fernande. Yo, la carla que vonita, que vonita charla. Este pues bueno mena tu vision optimista de que no que Cerlo yo siempre tado dejarme de la ideas que que Cerlo. Sienbargo, puedes nosamos las gusto, y as que la corriente administrative administration in the university. Administrative in the university, twoces, colleges, so everything that works, or if the door to do what we do, as we do other mathematics, if you could misjudge, my family, or inclusive things that want to do. What I do, like what we have already said for the queen without misjudging all chiquitos, and that myself convinced me that no aque de ja las cos, all the podcer constants, and the discipline and important yet things because, but just like the meadado much. Because the recipe in my redo, when I go in my presento, with my conference or cuidando de los demas, but the maner in the queen agent can, or the manager in the agent can receive the point of the investigation with momento or in that semana. In this way, can their perception of what work if you have my family? Silva, Mila, as we are in the reunion, can we just lose groups of studio groups? That are the groups of studio groups of Study of the stadium and are the groups that are the other financially. So, it disciplines a study and studies their logic. And in that study, we are very happy. And with this pandemic, we are all online correlating projects of colleges, power distributed financially, and the principles of the pandemic, every The pandemic, every general music, location like one like the tirada, babajos, like the camera, baray microphone, for culture, there are colleagues a project, the values of a project with a vet in Brazo, and the mama. I'm not saying and disruptive so that it would be scientific. And if you terminate, other colleagues, the first thing that first goes to certain and what I think. That is why it is tremendous, that is a lot of time that they are, and intelligent and ordinary. So, I don't want to work with one, well, that works, but I collect that, and we are working. No se, I want to say a blazo. No secondary unapplauzo de verdad amí, yo dabir nagante lo que ve une se colleagues es por que veensar solida en sirencio es vasta temas face or que veensar con crio saltando vía uno. Clar. Sí, que maploso. Y mi preoccupación es more en cuanto ajusto. La giente que toma decisions, porjempro para acceptar projecto or to acceptar que estipodo decisions laboral decisions. Decisiones laborales. Por eso que ten el mujeres en puesto de puder. Puerto mental que tenen en fundora la capaciada de la eso. Y eduación, educación se tamen fundamental. Tran versalizar la mirada de edo. Gracia. Gracias. Gracias, dos ahuna au y tana a preguntan el sum Adi Boliver. Carla, y a todar las colleagues que que vo aquín pantaya. Bueno, yo mi qui seera comentar un poquito acerja de todo esto que que comentan las companiers no que que es injusto no tener. In Justin, have the other work, your family, and us like women who are ten, the guy between a two to exit. I think that also is part of the social problems that we have. So, I think it is part of that circumcience to the society that we need to claim. Or do we imper que nos otros eljamos between two things and we want to serve? So, how opportunities so that we have women, we can say, that obliges to decide, that there is a podcast, more flexibility for us the women, society as. So, like in questions of this podcast, not that obliged to decide. And that is important that we also understand with people who are in the directive because we have the capacity to make this type of change of proponent, including the women, And include our women, we can proponent more flexible for us the women, because really consider that in Justo, who are decided. Gracias. Gracias. Well, I have a commentary because I record a moment in a conference. This completes contigo que. And I recuerdo hace no sequence of a colega que yego a de los congresos que teníamos decominatoria con suijo yoro y un colega hombre los hacerquo y. Because of these colours to say, super agrar vernos todas juntas y plantar world mejores, but we have many queer, much because I recorded yes, it was. Today, it was very personal, today. So, I think working. Well, we are a little bit, but there are a person who wants to laugh, and if the creator, if you're in that chamber, so that they can enter the contract. But that's why we have to, but it is a losing colleges that don't have nijos, the more queen others. It's a las cosas que nos dien para que nos creamos, que espor queenos dijas que na n estános.
