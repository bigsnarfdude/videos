So, am I audible? I have a bad throat, so I will try to shout, but at some point, my voice might go off. Okay. So, I quickly wrote this, I quickly came up with this title, and then I realized just now that it's kind of weak because lifting to work. So, yeah. So, yeah. Okay, so I'll start by saying what it is that I want to do. So, I start with an algebraic stack. And suppose I have an atlas. And suppose I have a point, a field-valued point, and I want to lift it. I want to lift it. And I want an atlas all field value points. Okay. Yeah. So, for instance, if you have a scheme, this is kind of okay. You have a scheme, this is kind of okay because, like, there are ways to construct this by, you know, doing these are called Nisnevich covers, like you have an et al. map and you can arrange it so that given any field or like any residue field lifts. The problem here is that we don't have to do it. No, no, no, no. Yes, the identity map, but you can also have non-identity maps, like proper non-identity et al. maps that allow you to do this. Right? The problem for stacks is that you don't have residue fields. So when I say all, I really mean all field. So, how do I do that? So, that's kind of the problem. Problem. And so there is so maybe I will say we call such Natalus smoothness in a which color. And I think this I think this notion is due to Pirisi. I'm not sure if this terminology appears in literature before him. But okay, so that's the idea. And okay, I want this. And so the next thing I'm going to say is that I can do this. Yeah. It's probably going to turn out to be a really short talk. Going to turn out to be a really short talk. So, yeah. So, let X be a quasi-compact quasi-separated algebraic stack with a separated diagonal. And suppose I'm over some base schemas over base. So I'm going to make two statements. One is about the general existence of such a cover, which is that it exists directly. Okay, like this X to X was this image and for note X will be a countable union. Union of countable disjoint union of schemes finite type sorry what yeah sure let's say that Why? No. Why? Yes. Yes, but this may not, X, I have not assumed X to be a finite fact. The stack is not a finite. So no. Okay. One exercise actually. Okay. The point is that okay, ignore this. The point is the way you get dx is by getting one x at a time based on like the degree of certain field extensions, which comes into the proof, which is why I wrote that it's going to be a countable disjoint union. That it's going to be a countable disjoint union. So, yeah, I tried to reveal too much information and everybody got confused. Sorry about that. Yes, thank you. But so that and so if this is material. Uh X is fine type over us and has affine stabilizers then X are can be arranged. Right, so that's roughly the idea that in general, if I have a quasi-compact QCQS algebraic stack with separated diagonal, the separated diagonal is really important. QCQS you can probably get rid of. Get rid of so, yeah. In that setup, you can always construct some large enough scheme which maps, which subjects onto your stack that will lift every field valued point. And if you have some additional nice properties, like you assume that your stack has affine stabilizers and is finite type, is Noetherian, then you can also. You can also arrange your X to have those kind of properties. So this is pretty good. This kind of interesting that this can work because like if you look at say Alperhalrid, then they have to do quite a lot of work to get Nisnevich covers of stacks using deformation. Using deformation theory, and then also they need that the stabilizers are linearly reductive. But if you just care about lifting field-valued points, then somehow just you can just do it with affine stabilizers. And I think it becomes slightly easier also. Okay, why do I care about doing this? So Yeah, we probably want to use it actually and not through I claim that that that one just finishes. I mean, it's I mean, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, that is what it is. Yes. Okay. So why do I care about this? Well, Colombia? Yes. At least that I know. There might be other people who prove this, because I don't think it's that hard. It's that hard? I don't know. Yeah. Okay. So, why do I care about this? Well, essentially, what this says is that if I can lift all field-valued points, I can also lift all Henserian local rings, which is kind of what I want because I want to study like motivic cohomology for stacks. And so, you so that boils down. And so you, so that boils down to somehow studying Nisnevich sheaves on the stack, which means I have to deal with, so I want to work with the smooth Nisnevich side of the stack and study Nisnevich shields on. Right. And so as I said, I think it's a very good idea. And so essentially, what this tells me is that if I have such a cover, then you should think of this as the statement that the associated check nerve to the stack is a weak equivalence. I'm not making this precise right now, but the idea is that you can essentially, instead of like when you try to do cohomology on this side, Like, when you try to do cohomology on this site, you can replace it by doing it on the simplicial object is a weak equivalence, which is essentially like, I'm chromological descent for the Nisnevich topology. And so, like, the kind of statement that I'm aiming for is: suppose I have, say, so, suppose this is. So, suppose this is some pullback Induce this an equivalence where uh my excitement. By x x i r like I don't know how to say this in the check note right so yeah basically I'm saying that some kind of homological descent statement works this is kind of good because for the you can do this in the smooth ital proposal Do this in the smooth ital topology by work of Laszlo and Olson, I think. And because you want motives to be kind of like the universal cohomology theory, so you want to know that this actually works for motives so that everything else is really a shadow of this. Right. And yeah, so the point of view is that really. The point of view is that really this is the correct definition because whenever you want to do cohomology, you want to be doing homology on a site. But now if you want to compute anything, you want to do this because you can really only say things about homology of schemes. So this allows you to bootstrap results that you know for schemes to stacks. So for instance, you know. You could naively just define motives and motivic homology for stacks. But if you want to say anything about it, like vanishing or the fact that it has the correct localization sequences, then you have to know that you can construct it via some kind of a limit construction by from scale. So this is sort of the thing that this result allows me to do. This result allows me to do. This is kind of work in progress. There are like a bunch of people working on it. There's me with Devzik. And then Chirantan Chaudhary told me that he's also working on this. So I should also mention him. Right. So this is one application. It's surprising that it has. I mean, I thought, like, this is only useful for doing something silly, like proving some weird statement about infinity categories. But turns out it also has some applications for the problem, which is, yeah. So, other consequences. So, other consequences. So, this is like this recent work of Krashmathur. Where they so the setup is you have X over spec A where proper. And is okay, Sid, you can correct me if I make any mistakes in the hypothesis. Yeah, and And then they can study the following they can study whether Whether it's injected. And I think they do this via some kind of Aten approximation arguments. Strong Aten approximation. Yeah. Okay. Where is it? Okay, where is it? And the other one is something that Elvin told me about computing. That Elden told me about a few days ago. Sorry? Thank you. And this which is the IPS egal completion theorem. Okay, theory stacks. Okay, so now I have brow groups and K-theory. And I must mention that I was specifically told by the organizers to mention these applications. Mention these applications. Okay, cool. So, some remarks about, I mean, now that I've said that, okay, this is some result and it can have some applications. So, maybe I will say some. Maybe I will say some remarks about is this the best one can do? So I think you can probably remove quasi drug QCQS thing. You will get an even larger covering. You can probably replace separatedness with something weaker, which is like you only assume. Weaker, which is like you only assume separatedness in every fiber over the bits. This sort of follows from an old paper of castrutis, but it's not super interesting to like just, you know, doesn't become extra interesting by assuming like separated in the fiber. I don't think you get more out of it. So So, I'm going to go to the next one. Okay, that's great. So, you do get more. So, nice. I thought you talked. So, okay, the point was that for one, if you assume. For one, if you assume that delta of x over s is fiberwise separated. Yeah, that is true. Could you repeat the comments? The comment was that this application or this extension is not a plant. Okay, I guess the most substantial comment was that assuming that the diagonal is only fiber-wise separated is good useful in practice because for some groups they need not be separated from a base, but if they are local types, their fibers can be separated. Right. So, in this case, also, maybe I will try. Maybe I will just so follow from this. Yeah. And then something about two. So the infinite field case is due to BDC. Exactly. Exactly. Yes. Yes. It's due to PDC some time ago, maybe 17 or 18. And then it turns out that you just take his argument and look at it closely and tweak it a bit, and then it just works in all generality. Yes. Thank you. So, can I ask just to make sure I understand the nature of the theorem? Yes. So, if I do the case where my stack is just BG for some finite group G, then if I understand correctly, the theorem is then saying that there's a certain g torsor over some scheme X. Scheme X such that all torsors over any torsors over any field, in other words, G Galois extensions, can be realized as fibers of that one torsor. Is that the kind of thing? Is that right? Yes, I think so. I mean, I don't think of it like that. I would generally say that if I have BG for a finite group G, then I would just embed it in G Ln and convert it, write it. And convert it, write it as X mod G L N, and then I have exactly this property. But I suppose that is the same thing. Okay, thank you. Yeah, so like along those lines, like in the kind of classical construction, the like GLN logi or whatever, if you have G embedded in GLN, is one of its classified spaces. In that case, it works not just for Enceladia. Just for concealing local rings, also works for local rings. I have no idea how to go beyond X mod G L and for that. For local rings. Maybe Zariski locally quotient stack? Right. That's not like, that's a question, right? Is every smooth Delinwumford stack Zariski locally a quotient stack? If the core space is an algebraic space, can anybody prove this? So, yeah. Right. So, that's a bit about the theorem and how it comes about. And then, maybe quick. So, now I have said everything I wanted to say that was not the proof. Now, I will just prove it. Now I will just prove it. And then in 15 minutes, I will be done. Oh, no, wait, I should introduce some notions before that. So yeah, so this condition that I have on my stack here for part two, having a fine stabilizer is being a finite type or an Stabilizers being a finite type or an Eulerian base. Like the idea is that you want to do some kind of stratification and show that in every strata, you have basically a finite type scheme that lifts k points. So this, in order to do that, I have to use this theorem of and recruit. Which is which exactly says that if you have an algebraic stack of finite type over S-Noiderian and plus A fine stabilizers. Then the stack admits a stratification by it admits an it admits a stratification whose opens are global quotient stacks. What does that mean? XI models Right, so some, and this I call stratification by global portions. I mean, that's kind of the idea that I want to reduce in the case of quotient stacks. In the case of quotient stacks to approximate the cover. Okay. Right. So, how do I do one? It's actually a very cool idea due to Kanutsa. Idea is due to Knutson, which I mean, this is the idea that he uses to prove the theorem for algebraic spaces. And it is that I want to lift a field-valued point to an etal cover, but I can't. What I can lift is an etal extension. I can lift a separable field extension. So, what do I do? Well, I can lift a separable field extension, but if I construct some moduli that parametrizes. That parametrizes finite atal extensions of degree D, then this extension is like a k point of that model aspiration. So, of course, he has to do more work because he wants to produce a scheme. So, in fact, even something quasi-projective. But I think in this case, In this case, if you're okay with just getting an algebraic space, then I think the proof becomes much easier. So yeah, there are these two constructions of moduli of sections. Maybe now I can already be within the and then I'll be like moduli of sections. Probably a bad route to go. So, what do I do? So, I have X quasi compact quasi separated with separated diagonal. So, I can find spec A mapping to X, which is smooth and separate it. This happens because you have separated, you have separated diagrams. Separated, you have separated diagonal and X is quasi-compact. And then I look at maybe I should call this something why. So I look at the following object, which is Which parametrizes D sections. So on any U it parametrizes, yeah, okay. And I have D sections, X1 to XT, such that XI and not XJ. Right? So I'm basically looking at the default fiber product of Y over X, and then I'm removing all the higher diagonals. And because the morphism is separated, what I remove is the What I remove is a closed substack. So I get like something that is also a stack. And I think in this case, because y is a scheme, you also get that it's an algebraic space. Okay. So once I have this, so this acts. This acts on say P this is the symmetry group of order D right and then I found the quotient at three because I've removed all the Because I've removed all the all the loci where the sections agree. And then I get this quotient which is and this is some Galen Mufford stack. This is some Galen Mufford stack. Okay. And essentially, the et d parameterizes degree D et al covers of objects over X. What? No, it could be a DM stack. Like if you have like a finite et al. cover to a DM stack from an algebraic space, and you try to do these constructions, then edd turns out to be the DM stack. So I get these objects over my X. Okay, and that's basically the idea of the first. So it's basically the idea of the first part that now if I have a k point of my stack, then there exists a degree D extension for some D there exists a T that well there exists an L extension of P. Extension of k which lifts to y how do I write this and say these the degree. D is the degree. Right? And this data is precisely the information of a k point of edd. So that's how you live. So that's kind of easy. Right, so this gives me a lift. Right? So this gives me a lift. Uh but this gives a lift. Corresponding to, I don't know what to call this. And now, the point is because this is a quotient stack by a finite group, by what I said before, I can write it as some scheme modulo GLN. So, this is, I can write it as some X mod G L N and then maybe X D. And then further lift this to xd. Okay, and so this is how you get the countable disjoint union that I was talking about in the beginning. This gives covering Right? Yeah. This is like I don't think somehow you start with a small object, you get a very large object. Probably not great. Probably not great. But I think for doing like sheaf theory, it is still okay. If you think of them as sheaves on the smooth side of the stack, then I think it's okay. Sorry, can I ask about the end of the proof there? I can't quite see the board now, but it's so you at the beginning you chose this filtration on the stack, yes? The on the stack, yes? So you reduced, is that was that to reduce? This is no, right now I'm just do, I'm just proving that if I have a quasi-compact, quasi-separated stack, then I can use this moduli of finite etal covers to lift any k-valued point. And the cover I get is a countable union of schemes, which is Which is indexed by the degree of the finite ethyl extension. Does that so sorry, what was the first scheme? So I guess the schemes you start that, okay, so the et al. D, that was not a scheme, right? So that was not a scheme, yeah. But so uh, but why did you say it was it was a it was a did you say it was it was a it was a quotient of this well because you construct no you construct it as a quotient stack by uh taking the action of the symmetric group on uh the some open of the default fiber product of the cover that you start with okay but that's that's a quotient of by of something that also is not a scheme right Right? No, it's an algebraic space. Because, yeah, yeah, it's an algebraic space. So until now, yeah, you're right. So I've produced an algebraic space, a collection of algebraic spaces. But because everything is QCQS, you can further go to a scheme. Does that make sense? No. Sorry. So I just. I just maybe, but yeah, like this, why was it why was the so before you took the quotient, this, this, the set, the space of sections, yes, you're saying, are you saying that that is an algebraic space? So the point is, the space of sections is an open set of the default fiber product of an affine scheme over the stack. So that will be an algebraic space because it's a default fiber product. Space because it's a default fiber product of something that. Oh, okay. I missed the beginning of that. Okay, okay. Yeah, I see. So, therefore, SegD is an algebraic space, and then the quotient that you get could be a Delhi-Mumford stack. And because it's a quotient stack, you can write it as X mod GLN. Okay, so this argument is actually not. Yes, there you have to use the result of Knotson, because there you really have to show that something is schematic. So it's not that easy. Right. So actually, this is just, this is written in LMB section 6.7 or something, but they don't state the result in this way because they're trying to do something else. So this part is not. So, this part is not, this is like classical. Okay, now the Noetherian approximation. Is that what it's called? I don't think that's what it's called. But okay. that's what it's but okay so now i so what i what you get now is that for any stack you can produce a countable like a countable disjoint union that lifts a points and now i want to somehow say that i can refine this to get a finite collection okay the great thing is if i start with something that's finite type the constructions tell me that each of the xds are going to be a finite type Therefore, so I have like a disjoint union of finite type objects over my stack. And if I can sort of refine this to a finite collection of X D's, then I get a finite type X. So that's what I will do next. And this is where I use Cret's stratification argument. Right. So, okay. So now proof of two, where I have hex, finite type plus affine syllabus. Right. So, what is this setup? And I also have that I have these X D's. These x d's that map to x. So, but because x has this property, I know that it has a stratification. What do I use? Let's say why mod gl. Okay. So now, what's going on? So, if I have a K-point of my stack and I have a stratification, I can assume that it lands in one of these strata, right? Because at any level, it's either going to be in an open or a close. So, therefore, So, therefore, it suffices to show that. For any there exist X I one One for Xi K such that the disjoint union How did I write this? Yes, and then this may be uh Is yeah, sorry about writing here, but yeah. So basically, I want to show that like for any stratum, I have a finite collection such that when I restrict it on xi minus xi plus one, it's a finite collection that lifts any k-point mapping to it. All right. All right. And but any of those strata are basically quotient stats. So I am reduced to showing that for quotient stats, I have the result. Yes. And yeah, so then taking union is the result. All right. So, therefore, I can assume that x is so now I am using the stratification to reduce to a quotient star. And so, what do I do? So, well, I have, let me write the following. Let me write the following diagram. I have this countable family and I look at the Farbo product and I want to now basically this is a countable union, this is a countable union. Union. This is a countable union. So, what I do is, if I take any point, a field-valued point here, I can lift it to Y because it's Y mod G L N, right? Because a quotient stack has this property. And now I'm going to somehow on Y, I'm going to reduce, refine this collection to a finite sum and then. And then observe that basically the image of that is what I want. Great. So how do I do that? Well, so the great thing now is that y is representable. So it has residue fields. So it suffices to lift all the residue fields. Okay? And so I sort of do this by lifting generic points. Yes? Maybe I'm not measuring things right. So that what these Xi Js, these are smith maps, right? So the like, what, what, what I'm. What's the issue? Tell me, what's the question? I'm not sure what they actually are. Like, why are these? Like, what? Like, are they this is smooth? This is smooth. Yeah, you restrict it to the strata. Sorry. Sorry if that was not clear. But that does. But that doesn't matter. I mean, this is still a smooth map to the strata. Yes. But to this, the original script X are not smooth. They're nothing. When you restrict it, whatever you've restricted is whatever. It's something. But that you only want to lift the K point, so that doesn't really. Oh, but oh, okay, okay. Just okay, it says number one: there exists X descript X. What does the word split mean? Or is it map? It's a smooth map. Oh, but that's not this map. No, that the X is the different union of D of X. What happened? Yes. Oh, okay. Did I put that right? I did. Okay. Did I write? Is it happening? Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Okay. I think that's okay. Maybe I should stop. Are there any other questions? Well, I didn't quite hear the answer to that. I was also a little bit confused. So I think you were going to, you wanted, in the end, you want to get a smooth covering, yeah? So I have a smooth covering. Here's what Sid said. Let me just like, so here's a here's a comment that Sid made. He said, He said those XI sub j's are the X D's from before that are smooth over the stack. But now all he needs to check is that, in fact, that is smoothness Nabich, which he will check on the stratified pieces. So the thing is already a smooth map. He's just checking it as a property with respect to stratification. Oh, okay. So I didn't realize you. Okay, you're taking the things from the previous theorem. Okay. Yeah. So I'm doing something like it is smoothness, maybe. Like it is smoothness may which also. I'm just going to show that from a countable cover, I can reduce to a finite collection of those. Okay, I sorry, I thought you were reducing the whole thing. No, I want to go from this. I want to go from this, which is countable, to finite. Because once I get finite, then I get the part two of the result. Yeah, okay. Sorry. Yeah, okay. Sorry. So, where was I? Okay. So I'm here. Where are the others? Are they also here? Okay. So now I want to. Now, I want to use the fact that I have a quotient stack to reduce the countable collection of Z D's. So, this is a Cartesian square, which means that each Z D is of the form, you know what it is. Right. So, I want to reduce from this countable collection to Reduce from this countable collection to a finite collection. And because I know that this is a representable object, therefore it has residue fields. Yeah, it has residue fields. So it suffices to show that I can lift all residue fields. And this I will do generically. So I will lift a generic point. That means I lift an open, then I look at the complement, I lift the generic point, keep doing this. And so that's basically the idea. The idea. Yes, and yeah, so exercise they base change well. Yeah, so yeah, enough to live generic point. So enough to live That the points of Y along right and so yeah, so basically you lift so suppose you have eta Y. Y and because this is Mudnistevich, there exists a Z D such that I have so I can lift that, which means I am able to lift and open and And open, and so thus, thus, there is a section. Right. So now look at Okay? So you're doing this inductively, and now the point is because everything is Noetherian, at some point, at some finite stage you will stop. So So that's all. Maybe I don't. Yeah. So as y is an avarian, we get a finite collection. Right, and now I just look at its image onto X. So taking so now. So now, because I have those, I can just look at their image on 2x. Right? And so now what do I have? I have a K point. I lift it. Well, I can lift it there and take its image. So I can lift any K point. So uh then this gives you the required object okay done. Yeah, I'm sorry if this was incredibly confusing. Rest assured, every time I have tried to go through this proof, I have been equally confused. Any questions? That's great. So I'm not sure what I'm doing today, but there is an Ethereum for positive compact by Eddie. I guess the half-point stabilizer is still somehow you should do good off point stabilizer, is it possible to sure like to you have a map from this x-classic conference to x0, or x0 is this finite file, finite subject over n. Represented over S. Can you apply the theorem over the thing and then just go back and get like a final? That's a great question. The answer is maybe, but I have not thought about it very deeply. Could I ask you to repeat the question? Oh. Okay. So now my question was, I think I saw. It's just hard to hear. Hard to hear. I can hear the speaker. Hard to hear. I can hear the speaker, but not everybody else so well. Okay, so I was thinking of this result by Erid, where there is a art, well, there is a noter approximation for quasi-compx, quasi-separated stack. Very general. It says that every confidence quasipated stack has a map, let's say we have a base S, has a map to a finitely presented stack over S. Now my question is: one can use an Ethereum. If one can use an econothere approximation first on S and then this notarian approximation on the stack to say that with affinite stabilizer one can prove one can remove I mean you can put a quasi-compact hypothesis for a finite number of components by using like criteria approximation first and then pull it back. I mean you still need to assume authentic because it doesn't give you authentic gender automatic. Automatically, but I don't know. Yeah. Any other questions? I thought it was better.
