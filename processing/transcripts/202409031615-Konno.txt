I'm going to talk about elliptic quantum toroidal algebra and its relation to geometry by using robotic operators. And I also construct the air operator of the elliptic quantum toroidal algebra. This talk is based on these works done with Kazuyuki Oshima and Andrei Sumirov. Okay, this is a program of my talk. Program of my talk. So, I'm going to start from a brief review of the elliptic quantum group associated with affine algebra G-hat and its relation to the equivalent elliptical homology of Kuiba variety and also to the homo W algebra. Then I will show quite parallel structure in elliptic quantum toroidal algebra by starting from definition. Starting from definition and giving some representation, I introduce the vertex operator of ID with respect to the inferred core product. Then I will discuss realization of the Jordan-Coiva-W algebra introduced by Kimra and Peston. I also discussed the very interesting application of this realization into the instant calculus in the 5D and the 6D leaves of the 4D. The 6D lifts of the 4D m equal to 2 star theories. Then I will discuss the vertex operator φ and ψ star of the same elliptic quantum toroidology GR1, but with respect to the standard co-product. Then so I will construct this button separator by combining the representations of epistemic quantum toroidal algebra and the knowledge of the The knowledge of the elliptic saving envelope for the instant of modular space. Then I will show that these vertex operators reproduce the Schufer product home error as well as a k-theoretic vertex function. And then I finally combining these two vertex operators, I construct an error operator. And if time remains, I would like to discuss the higher rank extensions. Extensions associated with affine n minus one que vaparity and infinity quiver variety by using elliptic quantum toroidal original GLN. Okay, so let's make a let me make a brief review of the quantum group associated with antiset affine the algebra. This is an elliptic and dynamical analog of the quantum The dynamical analog of the quantum affinity in the during free storization. And then our parameter p becomes the elliptic norm. And this is defined by using the During Filter generators and their relations. I will show a very explicit example for the elliptic quantum Troider algebra. Yeah, so here that's only Here just only look at very schematic things. But so as a generating function of this generator, we have so-called elliptic currents, EJ, Fj, F Psij plus minus. And we also have dynamical parameters, rank number of dynamical parameters. And in general, these dynamical parameters. And uh in general, these dynamical parameters don't commute with the uh uh other generators, so we need to extend the usual hopper hop algebra structure to the hop algebra structure. And there, as usual, the coproduct, it's an algebra homomorphism from U to U tensor U is uh very basic uh objects. Objects. And in this talk, we use both standard coproduct and Dorimferred Co-product. And they define different copper adjustable structure. And we use them for different purposes. For example, the standard cop product can be used to discuss relation to the geometric objects, right? Geometric objects like epic stable envelope and the Schuckle product homework, as well as the vertex function and their QKZ equation. On the other hand, during vertical product can be used to discuss the relation to the homos and instant tone calculus and the maybe accurate homozovz equation. And through this talk, I And through this talk, I'd like to emphasize the use of the vertex operators phi and phi D. They are defined associated with the different coordinator standard one and Doring Ferrari One, respectively. And they play key roles to discuss these relationships. Okay, and then this is an example of the biotech operator with respect to the standard coproduct or the elliptic quantum group SLN hard case. So let V A denote the evaluation representation associated with the vector representation and let omega be the level one highness rate representation with the highness rate omega. Then the vertex operator Then the vertex operator is an intertwining operator from here to here satisfying this intertwining relations with respect to the standard co-product. And this intertwining relation determines the vertex operator uniquely. And so defining the component in this way, then we have such integral expression for the component pi. The component phi mu. And this is an integral of the top component phi n times our electric current. And also we have such integration kernels. And it is quite remarkable that this integration kernel can be identified with elliptic stable envelope associated with this linear AN minus one quibba. One quiva variety. Here from first to the mu minus ones vertex have zero dimensional and from mu's to n minus ones vertices have one dimensional and we have one one dimensional framing and moreover by composing them and we obtained a 56 seven envelope for the cotangent boundary to the Cotangent boundary to the partial flag variety. So, yeah, we have such expression. And here, this stub is obtained by essentially by applying Shafir product formula. And yeah, this is an expressed expression of them. And yeah, as As Andrea Negu talked yesterday, this is section of line boundaries. And so, yeah, in this way, we obtained a stable end drop. And so I would like to say here is that through the burdeps operator, we can find the relationship between. The relationship between representations, theoretical objects, and geometric objects. And more precisely, through this consideration, we obtain such correspondences between representation and equivalent elliptical homologies. So, tensor product of our evaluation representation corresponding to the torus equivalent ellipse cohomology. Variant episode homology of the T sub flag variety. And our weight, this is a set of mu here, at the end here. This can be identified with a fixed point of this by this torus action. And this such correspondence can be obtained by defining such i. This gives an partition. Partition of small n. And yeah, yeah, it's defined in this way. And also, evaluation parameters appearing here correspond to equivalent parameter. And our dynamical parameters correspond to the Kerala parameters. And weight function. We should call hot stub elliptic weight function. Elliptic weight function. And the original elliptic stable envelope introduced by Aganajk and Okunkov, these are related by distribution. And here this part, theta square root of t means the tom sheaf of the polarization square root t. Square t. And yeah, this is a relation between elliptic weight function and elliptic several envelope. And we also have a correspondence between standard basis in this tensor product space to the stable classes given by stable envelope. And also we have Gervais setting basis here correspond to the fixed point class here. In here. And moreover, we found that such vacuum expectation value of our composition of vertex operator gives a k theoretic vertex function. It's a generating function of counting the core Z map from P1 to P star partial barrel. So in this way, the vertex operator with respect to the standard core product can be used. Product can be used to find correspondence between representation theoretical object and to the geometric object. Then what about Dorian Pherato product side? By using this, we can also define a vertex operator φD as an intertwining operator from here to here. But such To here, but satisfying this intertwining relation with respect to the Doring Ferd core product. Then again, this relation determines this 5D uniquely. And using this, and also we have done its shifted inverse, essentially in bus, and the argument shifted by P inverse. So we call this vertex. Inverse. So we call this vertex a shifted inverse of phi d. Then considering such combination, we obtain a generating function of the Dehomb W algebra. And here the usual Qt parameter corresponding to our PP star. And in addition, from the very beginning, we know that the LP2 currents correspond, give the realization of the Give gives a realization of the screen parents of the Homo W algebra. So, in this way, the elliptic quantum group SRN had to realize the Homo W algebra, SRN type. And in general, elliptic quantum group G HAT realized the homogeneous algebra of the concept type corresponding to this concept. And the reason why such happened is that. Our electric quantum group is really have the following two characterizations described by this picture. The first one is a p-decommission of the quantum affine algebra tense the dynamical degree of freedom. So it corresponds to this RO. And the second one is a Q-deformation of the W algebra of the coset type. The poset type, so it corresponds to this arrow. And to understand this diagram completely, you need to understand this arrow. This means that you need to recognize that the standard failing focus construction can be regarded as one parameter decommission. One parameter deformation say R deformation times the dynamical degree of eta. But unfortunately, I have no time to explain. So if you are interested to understand this diagram, please look at my survey paper appeared in archive. Okay, then let's consider the quantum elliptic quantum toroidal algebra GL1. And I will show that quite a parallel structure appears in this case. Okay, then maybe I can skip to this introductory remark on toroidal algebra GL and its quantum variant, but also except for Except for the last one. As you know, that many people worked on quantum toroidal algebra and its application to the instanton characters and to the AGT correspondence. And yeah, it is now, I think, established that quantum toroidal algebra gives a relevant quantum group structure to. Quantum group structure to calculate the instant partition function as well as to discuss the edge correspondence for the 5D and 6D leaves of the for the M equal to Suji gauge theory. That is known as linear quiver gauge theories. And uh in this talk uh I do I will introduce uh uh an elliptic analog of the quantum toroidal algebra. Of the quantum toroidal algebra, and we call it elliptic quantum toroidal algebra GL1. And we will show that it has a nice co-algebra structure by the Dori infrared core product, and this gives a vertex operator, 5D. And we also use a shift-Tedoimbus vertex operator. Then considering such combination, same combination as. Combination: same combination as I showed before for the elliptic quantum group SLN HAP. The same combination of 5D and its shifted inverse. Then we show that this gives a Jordan generating function of the Jordan quiva W algebra introduced by Kimmer and Peston. And then our parameter T1, T2, P and P star satisfying this one, two. is satisfying this one constraint one constraint play the role of the SU4 omega the Homerian parameter introduced by NecroSoft. So I think our elliptic quantum at this moment our elliptic quantum Troy algebra is a unique quantum group structure which possesses SU forming the formation parameters. Parameters. And thanks to such properties, we can apply this realization to the instanton calculus of the 5D and 6D of the ODM equal to star gauge series. That is known as Jordan-Quiver gauge series. And also, we discussed a construction of the With the vertex of radar phi and the precise star with respect to the standard coproduct by combining representation of elliptic quantum toroid algebra and elliptic stable envelope constructed by Smiroff. Then I will show that they can be used to derive the Shuffle product formula for the elliptic several envelope and derivation of the Derivation of the k-theoretic vertex function. And finally, we construct the error operator by combining these two operators. Okay, then yeah, so let's this is a definition of our LB2 quantum toroidal algebra. So let t1 t2 t uh t2 p be the generally complex number such as The generally complex number satisfying these inequalities, and we set h by equal t1 times t2, and we denote by z star the dynamical parameters. And later, we will identify this to the K rapp parameters. And also denote by this f the field of menop function of that star. Then elliptic quantum. Elliptic quantum torrential original GR1 is defined to be a topological original over this field generated by alpha x plus minus and e to q and c plus minus and gamma square root gamma plus minus. And as I said that we introduce the the the uh generating function. the uh generating function psi plus and psi minus and x plus minus and we call them uh elliptic currents then uh uh defining relation is like this uh so we have two central elements uh square root to gamma and c and our the to star and e to q satisfy such a high general relation but uh they uh commute with the other uh With the other generators. So, this is a reason why yesterday Andrea Negut doesn't consider Kerr parameter, dynamical parameters that to standard such E2Q generators. Okay, and we also have such Heisenberg subarge regenerated by alpha M and here kappa M. And here, kappa m is given by such combination of parameters, and we also set the p star in this way. And this p star combination, this combination. This combination appears commonly to the elliptic quantum group. And in fact, such P appears only in the relation between X plus here and this is the same relation here. So this depend on P star. Whereas the P appears only for the relation between Between x minus electric currents here and here. So, such structure is also common to the epidemic quantum groups. And we treat these relations as Homer Lorenzes in Z and W. And one can show that the coefficients are well defined in the periodic topology. Okay, this is the definition. Okay, this is the definition of our elliptic algebra. And then we introduce the hopper algebra structure by using the Dori-Ferret hop product. So first of all, we need to introduce the extended tensor product, which we denote by Jilda tensor. And this is a o ordinary tensor product, but with an extra condition given here. condition given here. So for the for any Meromeric function of Z2 star and P star we set such we require such conditions. And this means that if you move such factor from one tensor space to the other tensor space then you get the shift in P and P Zeta star. That star in this way. Okay, then you found that these give the During Ferrar core product, which means that they preserve the defining relation given in the last slide. Okay, so then let's consider a representation of our elliptical algebra. So since we have two central elements, gamma and c. element gamma and C. So any epitome modules can be labeled by a set of two complex numbers, say K L and they are related to the value of gamma and C in this way. Then we call such a module the level K L module. And in this talk we consider two different sites. The first one is an just an is just a direct elliptical analog of the one obtained by faking, fagging, gym for me and looking. This is a level 01 representation. And this is a representation on such vector space spanned by a vector level by partition and complex number u. And this is an exact action on such vectors. Action on such vectors. And as you see, that it is described by you in terms of the partition completely combinatorial way. So we expect that one can identify this representation as a geometric representation. So we obtain such conjectures. In such conjectures. And yeah. Fortunately, yesterday Andrey Negu gave us geometric action. So I hope that he will prove these conjectures. Okay, I ask you and please consider this problem. And okay, so this step. Okay, so this states that the last action can be identified with a geometric action of our G elliptic quantum toroid algebra GL1 on such equivalent elliptic cohomology of the Hilbert scheme by the correspondence between our vector lambda and the fixed point class. And yeah, actually this conjecture. And yeah, actually this conjecture is supported by trigonometric results obtained by Peggy and Tsimbaruk. They gave a geometric action of the quantum toroidal regular GL1 on an equivalent K-3 of Hilbert scheme. And combining this, their result with this Fegin-Feng-Jimbomia Mukin's That the regulatory case of this conjecture was established. And I also have a similar statement on geometric action with the ellipsoid quantum group GRN HAT on the such equivalent erectic homology with this partial Fourier variety. So, yeah, so please, Andre to. Prove this conjecture. Okay, so the second representation is level 1N representation. This is free-field realization on such a standard POC module. His algebra is not elliptical algebra in precise sense. He just takes a trace of. Of when one considers any physical object. That gives an epitome expression of physical things. But the algebra itself is actually one metric. Just well-known technique of Coraberi Shapiro. So, this is a free. So, this is a free field realization and this is a standard of OC module. And yeah, so and but but here we introduce the zero model C and C papendu cura and alpha h and lambda zero and lambda zero pap endocura and we set alpha prime in this way yeah and uh we we And already we will use this representation to realize the George and Cova W is worse. And there, since we consider level 1n representation, so gamma takes this value, square root of gamma, square root H bar. So we have such relation between P star and P T one, T two. And this becomes, yeah, Zapray is a Yeah, they play the role of SU for omega deformation parameters. Okay, then yeah, so let's consider the vertex operator phi D. So this is an intertwining operator from here to here, satisfying this intertwining relation with respect to the Dori inferred co-product. Then this determines the phi D uniquely. Uniquely in this way. And so defining the component phi d lambda in this way, this can be determined here, at here. And we have the operator part. This uh co uh consists of the uh pi empty operator. This is uh this uh exponential boson home. Exponential boson home, and we have advitic current x minus that is this one. So essentially, this normal order paths, operator paths, is an exponential boson home. And this will become important when one considers instant calculus. And also, we have a normalization constant. And they can be characterized, they C lambda and n lambda, and as well as their prime one appear in the next slide. And they are characterized in the relation to the Magdonal inner product homera. So you see, you have an So, you see, you have a standard McDonald linear product, then Mars prime this ratio of n lambda and n lambda prime, then you get an elliptical norm of the McDonald linear product. So, this is in such factors appears as a normalization factors. And then we also use a shifted inverse and we define then as a linear map from the As a linear map from here and here, and define the components in this way. And we define phi d lambda d as in this way. And here the operator part is just a shifted inverse of the phi lambda d in the last slide. And so this is essentially the exponential boson. And yeah, we also did. And yeah, we also determined the normalization factor uniquely. Then we can discuss the realization of the Jordan quiva pure. So let's start from the screen currents. So we consider the level one annual developation. So we have such relation between uh P P star and P one T two. And T1 T2. And then setting S plus and S minus in terms of our Heisenberg generator alpha m and alpha m prime, and then we can rewrite our electric current in this way. And we also find the commutation relation between S plus and S minus in this way. So these just coincide with the Kimberleton introduced. introduced. And here the our T1 T2PP star play the role of the SU form deformation parameters. And then how about the generating function of John Lanquiba doubles? So we consider such a combination of phi D and its shifted inverse. Then computing by using the components, we obtain this Components, we obtain this expression. And then taking a normal ordering, then we obtain such expression, a certain coefficient times the normal order of operator parts. Then let's consider the operator parts first. Then we found that this can be expressed as such a combinatorial product of the basic operator y. And here we set H. And here we set H box the u usual combination. And our fundamental operator Y we defined in this way. And small y is given by our Heisenberg algebra generator in this way. And we found that y satisfies such commutation relation. And this coincides with Q. And this coincides with the cumulative patterns result. So the remaining thing is this coefficient. So this part can be obtained as an OPE coefficient, which appears from when we take such operator normal ordering times the normalization factors of ID and its shifted inverse. Then combining them and make some And make some calculation, we obtain such very nice combinatorial product or the coefficient that. And actually, some norms that give us an equivalent to Hilover genus. In our case, Y should we take as P of the Hilbert scheme of K points on C2. So totally, we obtain such. So, totally, we obtain such expression, and this is nothing but Kim Rapeston, what Kim Rapeston introduced. And yeah, this is also nothing but operator version, full operator version of NecroState QQ characters. Okay, then we found a very interesting application of our QQ characters. QQ characters to the instanton characters. So we have such expression. And then it is easily you can obtain, you can find that if you take the vacuum expectation value of t, gives an instant compassion function of the 5D vector of the 4D n equals to star U13. To star E1 theory. This is nothing but the generating function of the chi P genus of the Hilbert scheme corresponding to this Jordan-Cuiber diagram. And so the calculation is obvious, but this is not the end of the story. If you recognize the following fact. So we realize the QQ character in this home, then we Home. Then we found that this realized topological vertex operator is described by this diagram. Here you see our phi d lambda corresponding to this lower vertex part and our shifts etc inverse corresponding to this upper part. And their product means these two lines should be good. And this topological vertex operate vertex is an The vertex is nothing but very basic building blocks of the instant and calculus for the n-equal to star theory introduced by Horod Ikubarpa. So getting such result, we can proceed with the further calculation of the instant Partium function. So for example we can So for example, we can take such composition. And as I mentioned, that our T is essentially an exponential boson home. So such composition can be easily calculated by using the standard weak theorem. So we obtain such a very nice combinatorial factor. And here And here this z is a nerve consists of the factor crossing two partitions, lambda and mu in this way. And again, by taking a blocking expectation value, we obtain now the 5D rift of the 4Dm equal to star Um sorry, higher rank to instant on partition function corresponding to this diagram. Corresponding to this diagram, Jordan diagram, Cuiva diagram. And we can also take a trace instead of the vacuum expectation value. Then we obtain a generating function of the elliptic genus. And so this gives a 60 lift of the body and equals to star U13. And again, this higher ranked expert. Arantic version can be also calculated, and we obtain such elliptic generating function of the elliptic genus for the general instanton modularized space corresponding to the general instanton modularized spaces. So this is the the use of our vertex operator with respect to the uh the infrared coproduct. Don't retro coproduct. Now, I'd like to discuss the vertex operator with respect to the standard coproduct. However, the basic problem here is that no one knows the standard coproduct for the elliptic quantum toroidal algebra. So, in usual setting, you can define the standard. You can define the standard coproduct as such an matrix tensor product of the error operator satisfying such error equal error salarations. But here, for the electrical quantum torrent algebra, we know neither the error operator nor the electric dynamical arithmetics. So we take another way. So, namely, we Namely, we propose a new way to construct the vertex operator by combining the representation of the elliptic quantum to algebra, as I showed in the previous slide, and the knowledge of the ellipsoid stable envelope or the instantal modular space. And remember that actually we know how to combine them into the vertex operator, as I shown as an example. I shown as an example for in the case of elliptic quantum group SLN hut. So we will do this. Then, okay, so then we need epid stable envelope for the Hilbert scheme. This was constructed by Suminov. And thi these are geometric data. Geometric data we need. Maybe, yeah, so Hiribeto scheme has a porous action given here, and its fixed point can be leveled by using a partition. And to describe the stable envelope, it is important to introduce the canonical ordering of the boxes in the fashion. So we define We define such ordering by defining a function row for each boxes. Each box, this is contents minus certain small number, epsilon, times height. They are defined here. So by using law, we define ordering of boxes in this way. And we also And we also use the chand xa and the polarization of the Hilube scheme defined and its opposite. We also use the opposite one data and they satisfy this direction. Then Smirnov gives such expression for the elliptic stable envelope. This has an This is a symmetrization of our channels X of S parts times sum of W parts. And in this talk, we don't need the detail of this W parts. So I like to skip all norm of them, almost all of them, but except for this the Kera parameter uh lima con the Kera parameter. We mark on the Kera parameter. So, stable MRO should depend on a Kerala parameter. This is identified with our dynamical parameter we introduced before. And this dependence appears only in this W part. So what we need to know is this fact. Fact. We don't need any other details or W part. And this is S part. So by using the ordering function law, S part can be given such a very nice combinatorial product of the theta function. And we define a hearted S by removing the Tom shift. By removing the tom shift of the polarization, it is given by expression in this way. And then we found that S hat can be written in such way. And we found that this and this part can be identified with the representation theoretical object. This part is given as a non-symmetric part of the OPE coefficient of our X. Of our x minus elliptic currents. And this part can be identified with exchange coefficient between y empty operator and x minus. Namely, yeah, so here we again considering a level one and representation. And here we have such opi operator product expansion formula. Expansion formula. And this is a non-symmetric part. Non-symmetric means non-symmetric in V and U. And also phi empty is the same as appeared in the phi d lambda. And it satisfies such commutation relation for x minus elliptic currents. And also, And also, you should remember that our phi empty doesn't commute with our dynamical parameters. Okay, then we define S stub hut by removing this tomch in this way. So then we define type 1 and type 2 dual vertex operator for the Hero Virtuous scheme. Operator for the Hiro vertical scheme in the following way. So we define type 1 vertex operator phi u as a linear map from here to here and defining the components in this way, we define the component phi lambda as such integration of operators. And here our epitome Epitical weight function or epithetic stable envelope. And this is type one. And also, we in the similar way, we define the type two dual vertex operator as a linear map from here to here and defining its component in this way. And we also defined it as a similar integral. integral operators times the elliptic stable number of parts. But here the stab hat and here we use opposite polarization for this star type 2 dual case. And yeah, again Again, sub hat to star opposite polarization is related to the stable envelope by removing the stomach shift parts. And moreover, this star means that we use p star as the elliptic norm. So to write down a theta function, here we use p star instead of The P star instead of a P. And also the dynamical parameter should be z star inverse that is related to the this z in this way. So this is a dynamical shift of the z standard that dynamic in the dynamical shift. Okay, th so th di this is our uh our definition. This is our definition. And then we make several checks. And finally, we construct the operator. Then we show that they are really intertwining operators with respect to the standard core product. So that is our strategy. So, okay, so the first check. Okay, so the first check is the shackle product formula. So we take such composition of two vertex operators, then make a rearrangement of the operator inside the integral. Then we get such stub hot parts by this homia. So this is nothing but the shape product home here. Product home here. So you see that these two stabs, this stub come from the first vertex operator, and the second step comes from the second vertex operator. And these extra factors appear when we rearrange the order of the operator in this way. So yeah, so our composition of our Composition of a vertex operator gives a shuffle product formula for the elliptic stable envelope. And moreover, one can identify such obtained stable envelope as a stable envelope for the higher length instant modular space. So we call this composition as a vertex operator or the in santum this higher line. This higher rank instant of modular space corresponding to this Jordan-Cuiva diagram. So by repeating such composition as many as possible, but if you repeat R times, we obtain vertex operator for the Operator for the general instant of modularized space that means we have R dimensional framing. And this in central modularized space has a fixed torus fixed point labeled by such article of partitions. So yeah, the vertex operator for such general Such general instant on modular space can be obtained, such a simple composition of our basic vertex operator for the Hero Vieto scheme. Okay, and we also have a similar formula for the type 2 dual vertex operators. Okay, and then the second check is a k-theoretic derivation of the k-theoretic vertex function. So here we take So here we take Jackson integral as an integration over the channel root. Then we found that such vacuum expected value with certain normalization gives a K-theoretic value function corresponding to P one to in general general in standard modular space. And this this result coincides with the known result obtained by Dinkins. Obtained by Dinkins. Okay, so then finally, let us discuss realization of the error operator. So for this purpose, we need to introduce the elliptic R matrix and exchange relation between the vertex operators. So we define elliptic instant on R matrix as such. As such, Torrangition matrix of the two stable envelope corresponding to the opposite chambers. So this is an and we also have such normalization factor which is defined by this relation. And actually this is the definition of R matrix is due to the organizic and Due to the agony and organ. Okay, then using this formula, or our last expression for the composition here of vertex operator, and compared that with the audit order of composition, then we found that. Then we find that this exchange. Sorry. This exchange duration between two buttons operators, which exchange by using the elliptic instant iron matrix as an exchange coefficient. Exchange coefficient. And we also have the similar exchange relation for the type 2 dual button spreaders. And here we have the R star normal polarization, not opposite, because we have such relation between them. So So yeah, okay. So this is not the opposite one, but standard polarization. Remetrix with respect to the standard polarization. And yeah, this is actually this relation is due to the the uh um proposition uh shown by a agaragiko and of all the several number of Of all the stable number of. And we also obtain dynamical Yambax equation given here by requiring associativity of the composition of three vertex operators. Okay, then we can define an error operator. So So let us define L plus mu nu component as such uh composition of the type 1 and the type 2 dual robotics operator with certain constant factors, G. Then by combining the exchange relation I shown in the last slides for the type 1 and the type 2 dual, we can obtain such. Can we obtain such a regulation satisfied by this our error operator? So, yeah, this is our construction of the error operator. And moreover, we can also obtain exchange relation between L and type 1 and L and type dual operator in this way. In this way. And yeah, these are nothing but one can show that these are nothing but intertwining relation with respect to the standard core product defined by air operator. So everything is consistent. So that is our desert. And maybe a quick look at the higher lung case. Look at the higher lung case. We consider such a fine minus one cyclic quibba variety and elliptic quantum toroidal average GRN. So we need such geometric data and elliptic stable envelope as part of the elliptic stable envelope can be expressed such a combinatorial product of the theta function. And the point is that we can identify And the point is that we can identify these parts as an representation theoretical object, like this. So here we consider the fully field realization. So level 1M representation. And as an OP and exchange duration among the elliptic current, we found that this factor appears. Appears in the epitup stable endorp. So we define a vertex operator for the generic cyclic quiba variety in this way. So this is these are composition of n operator, and each building blocks are given as such. Given as such, again, composition of basic most basic operators. And most basic one is given here. This is corresponding to this diagram. So you see that we for the so labeled vertex operator labeled by k corresponding to this. To this diagram, and this means that we have one dimensional framing only at the case bortex. This is a most basic building block button operators. And yeah, composing this WK times, we obtain we can increase the dimension of frame. Increase the dimension of framing at the case but WK at the WK. Then preparing such label K vertices from 1 to n minus 1. Then combining them, composing them, we obtain the most general. Obtain the most generic general path spread up for the general applying a n minus one cyclic quiver variety. Okay, so and yeah, and one can compute the case theoretic buttons function as a vacuum expectation value with this expression and also. And also we can discuss infinity query variety. So, the point is that for this, we can use the same elliptic stable envelope for the affine cyclic quiva barrier. And so we can construct this. This vertex operator for corresponding to this infinity coercive variety. And interesting application is that for 3D mirror symmetry. For example, T-star grass manang is known to dual to the Cuiva variety defined by such Cuva diagram. And then And then this the vertex operator for such dual equivalentity we obtain in the following way. So prepare the two vertex operator of the A infinity type, x minus x lambda prime and x two lambda two prime. to the lambda two prime and lambda prime is a partition with color k fitting into the this rectangular uh partition and lambda two prime is a complement complementary partition to lambda prime with colour n minus k and preparing such preparing vertex operators for such two a infinity coefficient and just take a composition of Take a compulsion of them, and then you get the vertex operator for this corresponding to this queerity. And then you can obtain a K-theoretic vertex function as a vacuum expectation value. So yeah, then you can discuss a 3D mirror symmetry in the level of the vertex function. So yeah, we found such. Found such interesting application. So that's all. Thank you very much.
