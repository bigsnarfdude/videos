I hope they hear me on the can everyone hear me okay so I am very pleased to present to you my work on the diet network which is a deep learning architecture designed to handle genetic data and its application to a complex genotype. To a complex phenotype. So, the development of complex phenotypes are modulated by the interaction between many genetic variants and environmental factor. Examples of complex phenotype are height and obesity, and complex phenotype also includes complex diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. And type 2 diabetes. And what you see here in the image is an individual that is healthy at birth and born with a given genetic background. And throughout his life and with the interaction of environmental factors, that person is going to end up developing a disease. And one important concept with complex diseases is genetic susceptibility. So depending on their genetic variant, some people are going to be more or less at risk to. Be more or less at risk to develop certain complex diseases. So, this is what you see at the bottom here. You have another individual that is also healthy at birth, but that is born with a different genetic background. And we could imagine that person having exactly the same environmental factors as the first individual, but ending up not developing the disease because his genetic background puts him less at risk of having the disease. And so, being able to build a model that can identify which individuals are at risk of developing a complex disease is something that really motivates research right now. And one thing that is done right now for building sole touch model is by using two methods: genome-wide association studies and genetic risk scores. So, in genome-wide association studies, or GWAS. Association studies or GWAS, what you do is that you perform statistical regression tests between genetic variants that are called SNPs and the phenotype. And for your list of tested variants, you obtain p-values that you can represent like this. And also for each SNP, you have the estimated effect of the SNP on the development of the complex phenotype. And so what And so, what people do, they have developed genetic risk score that uses information from GWAS to compute the risk of developing a complex disease at the individual level. So the idea between a genetic risk score for an individual is to do the weighted sum of all the SNPs that are found in the individual that are associated to the disease and to weigh that sum by the effect estimate. By the effect estimated in the GWAS. So those two methods have helped a lot our understanding of complex diseases, but they show some limitation. In particular, GWAS tests are confounded by a few things, including stratification that is due to population structure, assortative mating, and dynastic parental genetic effect. And recently, I went to a talk in biology of genome, and those were there, there are known. Genome, and those were, there are known effects, but they were resumed as the SAD effects in the talk. So I took the slide because I think it's quite a nice illustration. And you can clearly see the stratification effect in the genetic score. In fact, you can see it in the failure of genetic score to replicate across populations. So most GWAs and scores are developed in cohorts. Up in cohorts of where samples are of European ancestry. And what the image shows here is that you have a really poor portability across a different population of your scores. So what we aim to do and what my project is about is trying to work on an alternative method to build models that could be predictive of complex diseases. And we want to do this with deep learning. To do this with a deep learning method, we think deep learning methods are promising, especially because they have the ability to consider interaction between input feature in their prediction variant. So it's something that GWAS cannot do at the moment. So because they test independently every SNP, they cannot consider interaction between them. And so this is a great idea, but when you apply deep learning method to genetic data, you rapidly Genetic data, you rapidly encounter a problem that is called a FAD data problem. So, in our genetic data set, the number of features, which are the SNP, is order of magnitude higher than the number of samples we have. And this in the network is going to create a huge number of parameters that are in what we call the fat layer. And at training time, the tuning of those parameters leads to overfitting problems. Fortunately, we have Fortunately, we have an architecture that was designed to help reduce the overfilling. So, this is an idea that comes from Yeshua Benjo. So, the idea is to, I'm sorry, you don't see. Okay, that's better. So, the idea of the diet network is to keep the network that's going to make the prediction based on the SNPs. The SNPs. This is what we call the main network. And to add a second network that we call the auxiliary network that is going to be trained jointly with the main network. And the axiri network is trained on what we call the SNP embedding. So a representation of every genetic variant we use. And the goal of the axirine network is to predict the parameters of the fat layer to reduce the overfitting. The dynamic works method was developed. The Diane Works method was developed and tested on a genetic ancestry classification task in the thousand genome data set and it has proven to be effective at classifying individuals into 26 population using their 300,000 SNPs. And so here I just want to mention that we are working on developing the method with genetic ancestry as our phenotype just because Just because, by definition, this phenotype is entirely defined by genetics, so it should be one of the easiest or simplest polygenic traits to predict, meaning that if it doesn't work with ethnicity, it's not worth trying with more complex phenotypes. So the first thing I look at is the generalization capability of the method. So it's really important given that every data set uses different genotyping protocols and there's Different genotyping protocols, and there's a lot of missing values between data sets. It's important to assess if our method training platinome can generalize to other data sets. And I did this in Human Genome Diversity Project, or HGP, which is another populational data set that has population from around the world. And the second one I use is Cartagen. So, this is not a populational data set, it's a biobank of Quebec, but we have access in the data to self-reported ethnicity. To self-reported ethnicity, so we could use that. So, this is the generalization in RGDP. So, on the x-axis, you have the population predicted by the diet net separated by continent. And on the y-axis, you have the true level, so the population reported in HDP. And we see that the model makes reasonable prediction at the continental level. Okay, there's actually a live. And so, what you're going to see when the next figure appears. So, I compared the scores returned by the Diet Networks, which is the self-max probabilities of the 26th population. I compared this with the population genetic statistic. A population genetic statistic called FST that I computed for every thousand genome HGBP pairs. And this tells you the statistic tells you how similar to population, how genetically similar to populations are. And what we see is that the data that works gives high scores to populations that are genetically similar. For capital zones, so Jean-Christian Penny, a bioinformatician in my lab, did this new map using thousands. Using thousand genome data for population across the world and a Quebec reference panel, which contains French-Canadian, like you see here in red. And you have Cartagene here in black. So in Cartagene, most individuals are French-Canadian, which is a founder population from Europe. And you see on the UMAP that they cluster with European population of thousand genomes. So this is the prediction we expect the Dyet network to make. Expect the diet network to make. One thing to consider is the huge number of missing values that we had in Tertagians. So, this is the number of SNPs used at training, and we could only retrieve that amount of SNP at testing time. So, we train with input dropout to account for that number of missing values. And what we see is that doing this is really important. So, if we look at the classification without input dropout, many French Canadians are misclassified. French-Canadian are misclassified as South American, but within Pojo Part, you solve this issue and they're well classified into the European population. So this is a cool result. It shows that the dead network can generalize to other data sets, but also to a new population never seen at training time, which is the French-Canadian population. And so another thing I want to talk about is the interpretability. So knowing what information the diet network uses to make it. The diet network uses to make its prediction is really important. Of course, because we want to understand the biology better, better, we want to understand better the biology behind context phenotypes. But also it's really important because we need to be able to trust our model and to know what is used as information, especially if we want to use it in a clinical context. So we use the interpretability. We use the interpretability method of integrated gradients to compute attribution scores. So they are computed by features and they reflect how important a SNP is in the prediction of the network. And they're also computed by individuals. So they can vary across individuals. And Lio Shwania, which was a summer intern, looked at the relationship between genotype frequency and the integrated gradient values. Gradient values. And this was done in a binary classification setup to make the interpretation easier. So European versus African. And what you see here, so you have the attribution value on the x-axis and the genotype frequency on the Y. And what we see is that the integrated gradient, well, what you see is that low frequency SNFs have high attribution score given by the integrated gradient, which means Which means that low-frequency variants are important in the diet network's prediction, which is surprising because this is opposite to genetic population methods that usually use common SNPs to compare populations. So FST, for example, uses common SNPs instead of low frequency SNPs. And Matthew Sikuna, which is a PhD in my lab working. PhD in my lab working on interpretability of deep learning method just did a quick check to reassure us that integrated gradients were really in the identifying SNPs that are used by the network. So in his analysis, he took the test set in Thousand Genome and just removed some SNP based on their attribution value from high S to lowest. So this is what you see in gray, or they were removed at random. This is what you see in blue. Random. This is what you see in blue. And the plot clearly shows that removing SNPs based on their attribution values creates a higher loss in the accuracy, showing that integrated gradients do identify SNPs that are leveraged by the network to make its prediction. And so, what about complex kinotype? So, we tested the method on the first complex kinotype. We chose to go with obesity. So, at the time, So, at the time, the implementation of the diet network was only doing classification. So, we took a body mass index, which is a quantitative trait, and we used that value to create two classes. So, one class is with normal weight individuals, so BMI between 18.5 and 25. And the second class with obese individuals, so individuals with a BMI over 30. Over 30, and this gave us a binary classification task. We did this using the UK Biobank data set. In particular, we limit ourselves to the white British subset just to try to reduce the population structure effect for this first complex phenotype prediction. And what you see here is that we achieve on the test set an accuracy of around 61%. And of course, we cannot expect an accuracy of We cannot expect an accuracy of 100% because obesity is not entirely defined by genetics. So, we decided to compare our results with a genetic risk score. So, we took one developed for OBCT that's from a Kiera et al. paper. So in their paper, they use in their score, I mean, they use a SNPs effect that were derived from a previous GWAS. And for their GRS, And for their GRS, they also use the white British of the UK Biobank. So, in particular, they used the first part of the White British to create and adjust their genetic risk score, and the rest of the individuals were used just to test the scores. And so, what I did here is two areas under the curve that you see for the diet network. So, I took my white British samples and computed that curve. And for the Curve and for the genetic score, I computed the same score as they did for my test set of white British and used the score to make the binary classification. And this is what you see here in blue. Of course, they use some white British to adjust the genetic score, and I cannot know which one. So there's probably an overlap between when we do the test for the Between when we do the test for the rock curve and when the results that they use to develop the score. So there's a slight advantage given to the genetic score here, but still we see that the diet networks and the genetic score yields very similar results. And of course, with the diet net, there's a lot of work to do to make this result maybe better. So having the regression that would be more suited. That would be more suited for BMI and also modifying the SNP embedding. And the last thing I want to talk about is, of course, environmental factors. So as I told you, complex phenotypes are not only modulated by genetic, but also environmental factors. So how do we take that into account? So, of course, in the biobanks, we have clinical and lifestyle. We have clinical and lifestyle variables that are available to us. But one cool thing I wanted to present today is this paper that shows that we can retrieve environmental information from the built environment of individual. So this is an experiment that was done in cities in the US. So they took satellite images that represent the built environment of individual. Of individual, and they trained a convolutional neural network and extracted a representation for every satellite images. And with a simple regression model, they predicted the obesity prevalence in regions. So here you have, this is from the paper they resolved for Seattle. And so you have here the actual obesity prevalence, and here the estimated obesity prevalence. And you see that here. And we see that there is a good correspondence between actual obesity and the estimated one with their method. And so we thought this was really interesting. So we wanted to replicate the method with our data. So in collaboration with Marie-Gillie Farre, we tried to replicate this using CANPAT, which is the largest health cohort in Canada. So in this cohort, we have access to In this cohort, we have access to the body mass index of the participants, also their forward citation area, which is the three first digits of their postal codes. And so with this, MahiGD downloaded satellite images from the regions. And we kept only regions for which we had enough participants to compute the obesity prevalence. Obesity prevalence. And we ended up in the model using only participants from Ontario, which was the province for which we had the most information. So this is the replication of the method and the prediction of obesity prevalence in Ontario. And you see that around 30% of obesity variation prevalence was predicted with the method. And so And so, having said all of this, what are the future steps for the architecture in my project? So, right now we have implemented the regression and we're working again with the BMI prediction, but also height, because that phenotype has a higher irritability than obesity or BMI. We think that a multitask learning of several complex phenotypes can really help the architecture. So, in the main network, Architecture. So, in the main network, we can do multi-tasks instead of predicting only one phenotype at a time. And there's a lot of things to do with the SNPs embedding that hasn't been explored yet. So, this is the input of the Axley network. So, there's a lot of information, biological knowledge that we can put in there. For now, we only have used genetic frequency of classes when we're doing classification. Classification. And another thing I think is really important that we should try is taking into account genetic ancestry diversity. So with the main adversarial neural network, we would like to train the network to predict complex phenotype, but also at the same time, penalize the network for using SNPs that have large difference in alert frequencies between populations in the hope of making the network. in the hope of making the network selecting SNPs that are similar across populations so that the model could be portable across populations. And so that's it. I'm in the end. So I want to say thank you to you for listening and also to my lab. This work involves a lot of people from who I have a lot of help and support. That's it.
