In the abstract, because I based of of what I saw yesterday and the discussions that arise, um I changed a bit of things. So what I'm going to talk about today relates more to the title, which is good. Non-equilibrium processes and biological organogenesis. And I have a quick video down here of basically a cellular automata growing on a triangular lattice. And what you can see is that it's forming a non-looping. Is that it's forming a non-looping branched network. Today we're going to talk about that and how we can apply it to organogenesis, the formation of components. Why is this interesting and why branching structures? That's because in many of our organs, not only our organs but also the wider organs of other animals, whenever you want to transport fluid to or from an organ, the well evolved Evolution has come up with a solution, and it is to form ramified structures. And we see them in kidneys, functions, salivary gland, mammary gland, lungs, vasculature, even our brains are formed of ramified structures. So it's interesting to study branching. I don't need to convince you about that. Some of them might form looking structures, particularly the one I'm showing here, they don't. Maybe the pancreas does. They don't, maybe the pancreas does. And what we heard yesterday from Sharon is that in the lung in particular, there's been different modes of branching identified. I agree with her that maybe those modes are not actual biological modes and they just arise from the constraints of the tissue. Some of them have side branchings, like the first one I showed there, the blue one. Others are domain branches where things occur in a planner sense. Sense, others have some correlation between consecutive granting events, and those are quite interesting. And you might not see them in the model I shared with you, but you can see them later, in later stages of development. In the human lung, you can see this alternating modes of branching. You can even see a bit of domain branching. In one of the sites, you see one large duct that has many ducts coming from it. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. But we can discuss about that, and I can assure you that that has to do with constraints of the tissue and not an actual mode of branching. But that's for another topic. Today I want to focus on tip branching. So tip branching is the simplest mode of branching. In a tip, you would have a collection of proliferative progenitor cells. Those are actively dividing, and as they divide, they And as they divide, they um they are pushed out of the tip, they differentiate, they form a further ductile structure, and that means that the tip can propagate. So, as the tip cells differentiate, they form one duct and they propagate. So, this is an active process of elongation. There's also the branching process. There was some discussion yesterday about how branching occurs. The simplest idea is that there's a formation of a cleft. The cleft is an independent. A cleft. The cleft is an indentation in the tip that is caused by accumulation of extracellular matrix components that stiffens that region in the tip, and then due to proliferation of the cells around it, you end up with a branching event. And in addition to this, you need some sort of innovation, some restriction of how much the tissue can grow, because you don't have infinite space. You have a 2D or a 3D dimensional space that you want to fill. So you need some innovation. That you want to fill, so you need some innovation as well, and that innovation can be molecular, mechanical, a collection of things. We're not going to be talking specifically about the molecular mechanisms of innovation. And in reality, there's much more going on, right? Let's go. So let's go back. We have, at the beginning, I showed you this sort of acceleral automata, a very simple statistical mechanical. Statistical mechanical kind of model, and now I'm showing you this that has to do more with biology, but I'm sure you can see how these rules apply to the first model I showed. So, the first model has all the rules that I just discussed here. There is branching, there is elongation, and there is inhibition. So, you can see that this network now in a square lattice is not forming loops because every time a tip tries to propagate to an existing duct, then it just dies. That then it just dies. And that means that the system naturally self-organizes in a way that active tips accumulate in the propagating front, and all that is left in the center is kind of a percolating cluster. And yesterday there was some discussion about vasculator and how in 3D vasculator cannot meet other vasculator or is unlikely for a propagation. It's unlikely for a propagating fascinator to meet another blood vessel to close the loop, but that is not true. That would be true if this process was not branching. So if you have a non-branching random walk, then you know that the uppercritical dimension of that is 2. So in 3D, the process would get lost, and you would never have a closing loop. But the fact that this thing is branching, This thing is branching, it means that if you do the field theory and it was done by Cardi, and the results are wrong, which is unlikely for Cardi. But anyway, he fixed the results but got it wrong again because of a sign. And it was Janssen finally, by the end of that year, that corrected Cardi and said, well, Cardi's results are wrong. Anyway, if you know Cardi and Janssen, you know the big names I'm mentioning here. But what's interesting is that if you do the field theory, you're going to realize that. Is that if you do the field theory, you're going to realize that the uppercritical dimension of this branching random work is six. That means that correlations until dimension six are relevant. So they are going to meet. So it's not like in 3D you're not going to meet, you're not going to get lost in the tissue. You are going to meet because of this. Not after infinite travel. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, and and no because uh the darks have a finite width. The ducts have a finite grid. Okay. So, in biological systems, there's a finite grid. That's equivalent to what I'm saying. No, because in this sense, you don't need a homing mechanism. I'm sure there is, but you don't need it necessarily. Okay? So, I just wanted to mention this. I added this last night. There's a couple of things about the universality class that might be interesting. What's interesting about this is that what's left behind is What's left behind behaves like standard percolation. So, if you measure critical exponents of that, you will see that that follows at standard percolation. That means that we can use the exponents from standard percolation to just measure some things. What we've done with Marius, who finished his PhD last year, not with me, but at Imperial, with my former supervisor, Agunar Krusner, is that we measured a few things that are interesting for the Measured a few things that are interesting for the biology. And if anyone has worked in a model like this, you might have seen that density fluctuations play a big role. So, if you take the final state of this process and you think, well, what about I divide my system into smaller squares and I count how many particles I have inside each of these squares and I measure the variance of those numbers versus the length of these squares. Length of these squares, what do I get? And you should see some sort of scaling behavior. You can measure that from doing a field-theoretic approach. And what you see, for example, is that if you do the numerics, of course, if you do the theory and the numerics, you get pretty much the exponents that you would expect. The only reason I mentioned this is because when you look at the literature where we have used models like this to study random. Like this to study branching morphogenesis, there have been reports that when you increase the branching rate, somehow the fluctuations decrease, and that is at odds with these results from statistical free theory. So I'm trying to understand that at the moment. Why in tissues we see this decrease in density fluctuations with increasing branching rate? When in this case, if you increase branching rate, we should get to the mean field exponent, but then it shouldn't change anymore. Any more. So it's bigger adults. And because we're in the looping network, I just wanted to mention that because this is basically a percolating cluster, you can use known literature to study what's the... I draw them by hand. That's why they're horrible. But the idea is that because this process might close itself and leaving open spaces within, I'm going to call it the domain of the tissue, then you could study what are the properties or the sizes of the tissue. Are the properties or the sizes of these domains that are left unexplored? And there's results from a few years ago, 93, where they study, for example, what's the number of holes of a given size that you see rescaled by the size of the system. And that's only based on the fractal dimensions of this percolated cluster. So it's this is a really nice result. It's not mine, of course. But I thought it would be interesting for Uh but I thought it would be interesting for uh you because you're working on on analyzing uh also uh looping structures. Yeah? So there's there's results on on that. Okay, so now back to my talk. So what we what we have is a model that is a basic model of particles popping around, branching every once in a while, and then dying or becoming inactive when they encounter a trailing duct. Inductive. And it was Eduard Janesso a few years back when working with Ben Simons that came up with this idea that you can apply this model to study branching morphogenesis in tissues. And what they did was to take this model, which here is drawn in continuous space, not in the lattice. And you can think of applying this model. And you can think of applying this model to a tissue. And what tissue? Well, let's start with a simple one. What they did was study the mammary gland, the mouse mammary gland. Of course, the story is the other way around. They had data for the tissue and then came up with the moment. I'm telling it the other way around. So in the mouse memory gland, it's interesting because it's a two-dimensional tissue. The network grows in a preformed flat pattern. So there's a flat pattern. From the fat pad, so there's a flat pad where the network develops. This flat pad is not evolving over time in terms of dimensions, it's not changing drastically of size. And what you see is that if you label E4 EDU, which is a proliferative marker, you're going to see that all proliferation organizes in the front, the propagating front, which is consistent with the predictions of the model. At the same time, if you measure the lengths of individual ducts, you're going to see that they follow a very nice exponential distribution. They follow a very nice exponential distribution. This means that branching events tend to be uncorrelated. There's some process going on, consistent with the ideas of the whole I discussed. And there's also other signatures of stationarity. So whenever if you look at this process early on or later, you're going to see that the capacity of the tips has been changed, and that the widths and lengths of that also remain smaller over time. So it's a very nice model, and it's a very nice system as well. Very nice model, and it's a very nice system as well. The Maui Gland is not so complex as the land that is going around, so it's a very nice system to test these ideas. So, what I did next, also with Ben and Simos in Cambridge, was to study, well, and Limonia Shotzelli is a biologist, we studied a tissue that is not one epsilon more complicated, but a whole dimension more complicated. Dimension more complicated. That is a salivary gland. So the salivary gland is located in this region of the mouse. There's three of them, but we're going to focus on the submodular one. And it's very interesting. It develops here. It's embryonic day. So it's embryonic day 11.5 to 18.5. Around E20, the mouse is born, so development finishes. So you're going to see that in three days, sorry, in seven days, this goes from being just a platform. From being just a placard, so the delamination of a group of cells into a structure that has thousands of pads and tips. Your saliva is produced at the very end and is pushed through the hem. What's important for us is that there's an epithelium. The epithelium is formed of this ramified structure, and around the epithelium there's a mesenchyme, which is a it's not only a scaffold, but is interacting actively with the epithelium. Actively with the MCU. So that's key for us. So there's biological questions that you would like to explore, and we did, but I'm not going to talk about them today. In particular, what are the cell types that form this structure and how do they develop? Initially, you have a bunch of stem or highly repotent cells. At the end, you have a bunch of differentiated cells, and you would like to know how these stem cells operate. Stem cells populate the whole tree. So we did that. For that, we have to cement the whole tree. We did some clonal analysis, and the picture you see outside, it's the Christmas tree that I'm showing here, but in 3D. So you see that the salivary gland is like a pancake. It's quite wide, but not too thick. And what I'm showing there in points are individual cells that we were able to label. Able to do. If anyone wants to know more about what we did there, you can talk later. After a lot of analysis and also work from the molecular side, you can develop these sort of hierarchies of cells where you have these multiple precursors up here, and then you can identify what are the key markers and expressions that drive the formation of each of the cleanups in the tissue. Images in the tissue. That's for another story, and the details are in that publication. So, what I want to spend the rest of the time that's left is on studying this large-scale organization, hopefully convince you that I can use the model that I discussed early on. And for that, what we need to study is not the cell distribution, but the actual topology of this artery, maybe morphology and topology, where they are coupled in this. Well, it's quite there are a couple on this. This network is non-looping, so as you saw earlier, there's some indivision process going on. And what we can do is that we can hang this network from the main pack. So the main practice is down here. So what you end up with is something that looks like this. And I'm going to try to convince you, I'm going to ask you to be little. In the first six generations, there's no In the first sixth generations, there's no terminations. So the only thing that the tissue is going, is doing is branching. So increasing the number of tips in the system. But after generation 6, you start seeing termination. So you start seeing this inhibition process going on. There's a relation between that and how the sizes of the tips. It's very hard for a large tip to be inhibited. There's hundreds of cells in the tip, but when the tips get smaller, then you have only But when the tips get smaller, then you have only, let's say, 60, 50 cells, and there's a process of innovation that becomes inflated. What's key in the modeling that we didn't see before in the salivary gland is that this tissue inflates. So this tissue is not developing on a pre-formed domain. If you think of numerics, you fix your domain and then you run your simulations there. That's not happening here. What's happening here is that the whole system, the whole Is that the whole system, the whole tissue is expanding over time? Not only the boundaries, the whole tissue is available over time. And that we see it as an exponential increase in size of the tissue, but we also see it when we look at proliferation markings within the tissue. So now proliferation, which is red and it looks a bit saturated, proliferation is not confined to the periphery of the tissue that it was in the in the mammary plant. Now you see proliferation everywhere. Now, you see proliferation everywhere. And if I tell you that every element of volume in space is expanding over time, that reaches an exponential inflation condition. So it's consistent with exponential inflation. So we see pre-revariation everywhere, that's consistent with different indicators. So what we did next was, well, let's modify our simple system. System based on rules, the validation. There's validation, there's bifurcations, there's terminations, but on top of that, there's inflation. So the network itself, because the network is proliferating and the messenger in between is proliferating, everything is getting further away from everything else. That means that whenever there's an inhibition process going on, that inhibition can be relaxed due to the inflation of the tissue and there's reactivation of the tissues. The first prediction without any doing The first prediction without doing any simulations is that the tissue in bulk will still be proliferating, but at a lower rate than the peripheral, without doing any simulations. And I'm going to show you later that that's what's going on. So we can modify our reaction diffusion system. There's a bunch of things going on. What I put in blue boxes is just the same model that studied, Cardi studied. The only difference is now that we're introducing a species of cells that is Species of cells that it's in a pause, right? It's delayed. It's waiting to be reactivated once the tissue inflates enough. So we have a process of branching, we have a process of duct formation, and what happens in addition are these two new terms. So because the tissue is inflating, the ducts are not stationary, they also proliferate, they produce more duct at a rate that is proportional to the inflation of the tissue. And at the same time, there's reactivation of tips that is proportional to the inflation. Activation of tips that is proportional to the inflation of the tissue. This is because it's based, we're approximating this as a linear distance. It's a linear distance, that is proportional to the inflation. So now we have a bit more complicated system of reactions, but the truth is that it's all quite okay. I know. So if you can turn all this, you can see the... So you can turn all this into a mean field approach and you can say, well, we're in the supercritical regime. This is all branching a lot. So we can build a mean field level description. And what comes in from inflation are these terms. So this term, what you see here as U, that's a velocity field, that is just the velocity field induced by the inflation of the tissue. So particles are being affected due to the inflation of the tissue, and at the same time, they're being. Tissue and at the same time they're being diluted. So those terms include both elements. You can write then what's a stationary state, which is nice that we can do it. It's not a given that you can do these things in simpler systems. You can find new stationary states because of the inflation. Because of the inflation, the tissue will always remain proliferative everywhere. So what you see is propagation of a front of active cells that Front of active cells that are leaving behind in its wake a constant density of tacts, but at the same time, there is a constant density of proliferative cells that is reduced compared to the proliferative. So you can't really read that, but I just want to convince you that if you analyze the data and you see where proliferation is in relation to the boundary, there's a higher proliferation in the boundary compared to the bulk. And just to finish, And just to finish, I want to say that you can, of course, you can do the particle simulations. Our model is all based on things that we can measure in the experiment. So we don't have 100 parameters to really fit. We extract those parameters from the data, and we have this inflating tissue that is at the same time producing new branches. So, with this, I want to I want to leave you with maybe this picture. This is the next plant. So we take the salivary gland from the mouse. This is something I don't do. This is done by Demonia. She can take the tissue out, let it evolve for 20 hours or so, and then comes my part. Quite dramatically, the expansion. And we can analyze what's the branching of structures that are close to the Of structures that are close to the periphery versus further away from the periphery, and I can assure you that you see more proliferation in things that are in the periphery. If you want to see the details of how we fit the data and everything, I can do the publication on there. I just want to thank those people. And these are the people I wanted to talk about, but if I had an hour, I couldn't. Beautiful talk. Thank you very much. It's a question of ignorance. I mean, in StatMec, we learned that uppercritical dimension in phase transitions is like when mean fields work, right? So, what does uppercritical dimension mean in this context of branching? Yeah, so the first of all, yeah, the upper critical dimension means that below that correlations are relevant. And in this case, correlations means is the particle, an active particle, going to meet the trace or not? If you have a system that is dimension seven, then the probability of an active tip meeting attack is not one. Fatigue. So below So below, fixed and below, you would have a probability of one of a tick at some point, at some point in time, infinite time, meeting an actual attack. That is also considering the critical state. You need to be at a critical branching rate. And in biology, we don't see actually critical states in this sense. It's always supercritical. If I leave a tissue, the tissue will expand. It's not like it's going to attack immediately and die. So you're in the supercritical criticism. Immediately and die. So you're in the supercritical regime. That means that you can approximate the system in mean field safely. That's it, that's it. Yes, thank you. And my other question was, have you put flow? Because we are doing all the time that rivers shape the landscape, landscape shape the river. So this should be something similar, right? Like flow should somehow shape your That's a really interesting question. So, no. Actually, during development here, there's no flow. Lumen is just being formed. In the lung, there's peristaltic movement. So, there's movement of liquid within the lungs during development. But what I like to think about when you think of flow in the rivers, it's water that flows. Here is cells that flow. So, it's the flow of cells and proliferation of cells that produces. Proliferation of cells that produces the river, which is the network. After that, when function begins, so when you have production of saliva and so on, there is a remodeling process that takes on. And that's a reshaped. They're getting shorter or longer, the width changes depending on the function. But the formation of the structure is due to flow of self, not the flow of the there is in the line of flow. And the line of fluid, but not in this case. Thank you very much. So Veronica's outgrade, very cool. So I wanted to cover a little bit more the inflation part of it. So you sort of talked about the sort of the very local effect of inflation a lot and it's return on growth again. That's not too close. But have you thought at all about the sort of local or log scale effects where you could get, principle could get, there should be really scales generated to something like a causal horizon, where all the A causal horizon where all the correlations go to zero because they do move apart faster than any of the processes that are running locally. Do you see those length scales? Do you see? There should be something about some similarity as well. Yeah, I didn't study how how correlations is with with uh space because even even within a branch you see little correlation in this tissue. So Little correlation in this tissue. So, nothing pointing to this. And the tissue is in a state where inflation is not too large, inflation is quite low. And you need that to be the case because if you look at the stationary state, you see that the stationary state exists and they have to be positive because there are cell densities, as long as the branching rate is large enough compared to the volumetric inflation of the tissue. If if inflation is too large, then you dilute the tissue and the tissue gets uh lost. And the tissue gets lost in the messing cap. You need that to be sort of balanced. That's something I can tell you. So you argue the other way around. The inflation routine of the tissue is totally set, the growth of the tissue is set. Have one coherent coupled, you know, you don't want to call it residents. Also in the discussion phase or any questions or remarks anything that in the bifurcations it always happens from what I go in the mouth it always happens at the periphery so that in your model you can have uh growing tips and that greater volume or in my uh but I understood for this happening at a very So this depending at the very K of the market so in in the in the original model without inflation you end up with that state where branching occurs only at periphery. But when you include inflation then space is being continuously opened in bulk. That means that you can have branching events in the center of the tissue always. Although it depends if your if your tubes are going with the tissue or if they remain the same size. The tissue, or they remain the same size. If you have ducts and tips, and if the ducts grow with the tissue, then you don't need to reintroduce the tips. Yeah, if the ducts grow volumetrically and not only linearly with the tissue, then things change a bit. Because they're occupying the volume they're opening. So you end up with no actual increase in the so one of the indicators that is really changing. That is really changing when you include inflation versus when you're not including inflation is the sizes of these sub-trees. So you have the whole structure, and the trees get so much more branches, so many more branches when inflation occurs. Not so many levels in addition, because branching is still occurring, but they get wider, these subtracts. Like the topological measure of So many of the biological structures that you were showing, at least to my eyes, they grow in a less random way than the park-food steps. So I would like to link with the previous talks. There was a talk about vascular network formation that is growing in response to VGF concentration. There was a talk by Prancior where the feedback. Where the networks are growing with like a watted field, right? So, in a way, if you have such a field and the network is growing in response to the field, it goes less at random and in a way in a more optimized way, you know, like the branches go away from each other to maximize the facts and so on. So, would you think that these effects can be important? And if yes, then how can they be incorporated into that? They be incorporated into your model? Yeah, I think nature is quite evolution. It's been quite well optimized. So, tissues like the salivary gland, if you think, well, it's an interesting tissue, but if you lose the salivary gland, you're not going to die. But if you lose the lungs, then you die. So, the lung is a really essential organ, and for it to be optimized is good. So, when you look at the lung, you see that lung is occupied. You see that lang is occupying space really efficiently. The lengths of lats are way more stereotypic than in this library. And I think it has to do with the importance of the relevance of those tissues in evolution. And you can incorporate that. We're doing that with the model I shared. We're doing that for the human life. And you can see that in that case, the distribution of lengths, for example, of darks is way more strict. Tax is way more surprising. It has a clearly defined maximum, and there's also waves of signals in the mouse, for example, that time this branching event. So it's much more controlled than in other tissues like the salivary gland and the mammary gland. But I think the bottom line is that the rules are the same. Branching, location, termination. I was mentioning that you might want to have like an external field in order that it's not. You know, the obvious equation or Laplace equation that drives at least the directions of the growth because it's rather random right now in the unwater, but it can go anywhere. It would make more sense to go in the direction of gradient. Yeah, so in this case, we have no external fields, apart from mechanical stresses from the rest of the tissue. The rest of the tissue. But Mehmet is probably going to talk about that on Thursday, about optimal filling and also directional guidance. Because it changes the statistics. You can do nice forget languages, descriptions, and this kind of thing. Yeah, maybe connected to what was can't ask and to the modifier sign correctly, there is no width of the data, right? Not explicitly. Not explicitly, but it's contained within this annihilation radius. So whenever you have a tip, whenever you have a tip growing like this, you want to know at what distance the tip can feel. So what said the typical distance between plants? So for us... Can you tune that with your parameters? Yeah, yeah. So that's a key parameter actually for the topology, resulting topology of the tree. Montpology of the tree. In this case, I set it to the width of the tax more less. So you assume you can measure the width of the duct. So that's the width of also the tip. And what I do in my agent-based model is that I say whenever this tip is at a distance that is equivalent to the diameter of a duct, then you're experimenting. Okay. So you are setting. It's just a number that you put, basically. It's not a result of other parameters. No, it's not a result of other parameters because that would include maybe some fluid motion or some... So basically there is one scaling problem, but we don't know what this. Because I ask a lot of biology problem structure. There's just that one. I mean, when you look at this trivial. When you look at this three-bony brick section, this is actually the mean branch like that. Exactly. So then your question is very relevant, and I think you can do it for the discussion. What sets the minimum size of a tape tape? The minimum size of a tape. Because after some generation, tapes don't change anymore in size. And ducts have always the same diameter and you reach some sort of stationary state. So the question is, why are not continuously shrinking until some Continuously shrinking until some, I don't know, 10 cell size, and they reach a 50 cell size. Why that number, why that diameter? Because of the flow? There's no flow yet. Maybe it's just mechanical because cells don't like to fold so much. Maybe there's no, you cannot fill a cleft in a, if it's a reaction diffusion process, then if the tip is too small, then there's a If the tip is too small, then the reaction diffusion process cannot form a cleft. But to link it with what you heard yesterday, is there secretion too? Yeah, but it's very little in this tissue. It's very little. So I agree that in the lung, in the lung, there's much more
