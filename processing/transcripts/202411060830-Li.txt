I just want to start by using this opportunity to introduce a bit about Mechanical Biology Institute, which is on the campus of National University of Singapore in Singapore. And I hope all of you will have a chance to come and visit and even spend some time at MBI. So, we are a community of interdisciplinary scientists. Interdisciplinary scientists, about 150 people or so, including graduate students, postdocs, PIs, staff, and it's really a community that's dedicated to studying, to the study of mechanobiology on a very broad sense. One of our ongoing research themes, which you can see is very broad, mechanobiology in development, aging, and disease. So one of I just One of I just want to highlight a key word here: aging. This is sort of a new element or new focus of our research, trying to understand how mechanobiology can help us understand what aging really means and how that impacts cells and tissues, and how we can leverage our knowledge to treat age-associated diseases. And our basic assumption is that mechanical stress can be a major cause of. Uh, can be a major cause of wear and tear and damage to our cells and tissues. And at the same time, forces and mechanics really provide the means and signals for repair and regeneration. So, our goal is to, through our fundamental research, we can learn how to better tune biological mechanics to minimize the damage to cells and tissues during the aging process, and then how to promote repair, regeneration, and Care regeneration and to reduce the incidence of age-associated diseases through our research. All right, so my lab works on quite a spread out set of topics, but all have to do with the mechanics and dynamics of cells and tissues. And so originally, I was going to talk about an area of work. Talk about an area of work related to asymmetric meiotic cell divisions and how that can help us understand reproductive aging and how to rejuvenate aged eggs. But I kind of, it's a topic I've been talking about for a while and the paper has been published. So I kind of got bored by it and decided to talk about a line of work that's actually perhaps less, much less conclusive, very much ongoing. Very much ongoing, and it'll be really great to seek input from the audience. And this has to do with cellular stress and cellular evolution, especially cancer evolution. But of course, this is a very broad theme. I'm not going to come up with a grand conclusion, but hopefully at the end, coming from perhaps a bit of a chaotic talk, but hopefully at the end, I'll give you a more unifying. A more unifying hypothesis. And so the overarching motivation for this research is really trying to understand how cancer starts. In particular, how common risk factors, such as chronic inflammatory diseases, can predispose cells and tissues to carcinogenesis. One example is inflammatory bowel disease. So, this is chronic inflammation of Is chronic inflammation of the bowel, and patients can get this disease when they're very young for many, many years. If their disease turned out to be treatment resistant, and after 30 or 40 years, they have very high, exceedingly high chance of getting colorectal cancer. And the cancer that they usually get are very aggressive with a very heightened genomic instability and genome variation. And genome variation. And so, one of our interests is to understand how this chronic inflammatory conditions, which cause tissue damage and drives epicillo cells to undergo belts of injury and repair, carrying out proliferation or mitosis in this very highly toxic environment. And so, one of the known phenomenon is that during mitosis. Phenomenon is that mitosis during these under these chronic inflammatory conditions are highly error prone, often generate aneuploid cells or cells with micronuclei, and these cells are highly genomically unstable and continue to generate genome diversity fueling cancer evolution. So, one of our line of work is to try to understand what are the different kinds of factors of Different kinds of factors affecting cell homeostasis, cellular homeostasis in this environment. I just want to highlight one of the recent paper published by one of my former graduate students, Yi Dong, in collaboration with Tasha Larman, who's a pathologist at Johns Hopkins University. So this came out of my lab at Johns Hopkins University. So Yi was studying one cell types that's very One cell type that's very enriched in inflammatory bowel disease called inflammatory fibroblasts, how they interact with epithelial cells, affecting epithelial cell homeostasis. And so one approach he took is to grow patient-derived colonoids. So these are organoids from the colon tissue. We can culture them in 3D, and then we can co-culture with inflammatory fibroblasts derived from. Derived from IBD patients. What Ye found is that co-culturing with normal fibroblasts doesn't have much effect on colonoid growth and morphology, but culturing with inflammatory fibroblasts, the organoid seems to undergo the swelling phenomenon. And it turns out that this, the factor that causes colonoid swelling is paracrine. So here he can. So, here he can recapitulate this phenomenon by using simply a condition media from IAF. You can see it caused these rounds of colonial swelling, burst, and then swelling again. And then I won't go into all the details. You figure out that the pyrochrome factor is one of the prostlandin E2 through this receptor EP4, which activates the cyclic EMP, CFP. Which activates the cyclic EMP, CFPR pathway, leading to trans-epicilial fluid secretion. That's what drives organoid swelling. This is sort of a similar pathway that caused diarrhea, which is very common in IBD patients. And so this epicidal effect has many consequences. So one of the consequences is disruption of epicidal. Is disruption of epicidal barrier, which is actually due to bursts of individual epicidal cells occasionally in this epicillial organization. And so this is sort of a very dramatic event, but less dramatic events are the effects of mitosis. So these epicilles, when it's under this fluid stress, they are highly, they change their cuboidal shape into this very flat. Void of shape into this very flat, compressed shape. And when these cells undergo mitosis, they generate many errors, including lagging chromosomes and chromosome bridges. This is very similar to what have been observed and reported by a number of labs that when cells are under compression, when they undergo mitosis, mitotic process cannot occur normally. So the result of these. So, the result of these abnormal mitosis is this genomic state called eneuploidy. I'm sure you already have heard about this or familiar with it. It is a type of genetic variation due to unequal number of different chromosomes. So, a deployed human cell has two copies of each of our 22 autosomes and then two sex chromosomes. And you ploid human cancer cell. You put human cancer cell as an example here has varied chromosome copy numbers, okay, from you know, two, which is a normal number, to three, four, five, a crazy abnormality. And so, and this is, so aneuploidy is not just a single state, it's actually a very, it's a large repertoire, holds a large repertoire of genetic variation. So, if you consider if So, if you consider if the copy number of O22 autosomes, human autosomes, vary between one and four copies, there's a huge number of numerical combinations. So, enduploidy has been known to be associated with cancer for over a century and has been proposed to, in fact, might be driving carcinogenesis. Driving carcinogenesis. And it's also now known that the vast majority of cancers are aneuploid with different chromosome copy number abnormalities. But how aneuploidy actually affects cellular physiology, maybe promote cancer progression, really has not been so clear until probably in the last couple of decades where studies in very simple model organisms. Very simple model organisms have contributed to much of the fundamental knowledge. And the reason for that is that in the cancer genome, there are all sorts of genetic variations. So it's very hard to know what is really caused directly by just number chromosome number variation. So whereas in simple model organisms such as yeast, it's very easy to generate different strains or varieties that just differ in chromosome copy number, but not. Differ in chromosome copy number, but not in other kinds of genomic characteristics. So, this I just want to give you a very quick bit of a background on this, which will help me explain some of the recent work. And so, this is a very eye-opening study from our lab back in the early 2008, where we were actually studying a mechanobiology problem: how cells use. Problem: How cells use this contractile ring to undergo cytokinesis? And one of the very unexpected findings was that if we delete, so this was in yeast, we deleted the only gene encoding for the yeast myosin2, which is the motor protein for the contractile ring, most of the cells will die because they cannot divide. And then eventually they just become these chains and then burst. But there are a few of them can barely survive and grow into tiny, very small columns. Into tiny, very small colonies. But if we pick these colonies and spread out on the new plate, a bunch of colonies will grow up, and some are bigger than others. If we pick the biggest one and spread again, there are some more bigger ones will come up. So if we do this kind of passage and select the best grower over about 10 passages, we would get out variants that grow and divide as. And divide as beautifully as the wild type. So these, and still they don't have this myosin 2 gene. So they have somehow come up with new ways to divide independent of this very important contractal motor. And so that was very surprising. And then we found all these variants, adaptants, are endeploid. They don't have mutations. They just have different chromosome copy numbers. And then using east genetic techniques, we can actually figure out how. We can actually figure out how these chromosome copy number variation can contribute to a new cytokinesis mechanism. So, for example, we found one class of them all gain chromosome 16. And on this chromosome, the two genes carried on this chromosome relevant are don't have to remember the names. Basically, increased copy number of these two genes can lead to a way for E cells to divide simply by thickening. Simply by thickening, deposit a lot of the cell wall material. So instead of membrane contraction, basically the cell is just adding material to this septum separating the two daughter cells. So this was very eye-opening. And then subsequently, we did some general studies about how aneuploidy or different copy number changes can affect cellular phenotypes. So, for example, this is an So, for example, this is another study where we can use yeast to generate quite a large number of isogenic enduploid yeast strains. So, meaning that they only differ in different chromosome copy numbers, but not in DNA sequence. And then we can look at how these aneuploid strains grow under different conditions. What we found is that under normal conditions, most of these aneuploid cells, so these are growth curves. So these are growth curves. The reds are aneuploid and the black are euploids. So the aneuploid you can see always grow more poorly under rich media that it has been optimized for the normal euploid growth. So aneuploid cells grow more poorly, but under stressful conditions, either at lower temperature or in the presence of a drug, which actually has been used to treat certain cancers, certain aneuploid strains will grow. Euploid strains will grow much better than the euploid. So, under selective conditions, these would be adaptive variants. So, and in light of this study, we carried out another study where we take deep E cells. This study actually found that diverse stress conditions can affect, impair mitotic fidelity, generating mitotic errors, leading to karyotypical. Errors leading to karyotypically diverse population because of chromosome segregation are erroneous. And so now we take this heterogeneous aneuploid population, treat them with different drugs. We found that the aneuploid populations are much more readily to give rise to drug-resistant colonies. And these colonies are their adaptive phenotype is driven by chromosome copy number variation. So for example, loss of this chromosome 16. Loss of this chromosome 16 in this particular case caused cells to be resistant to tonicomycin. But then, if we allow these resistant colonies to grow under drug-free condition, eventually they'll gain back the chromosome 16, but then they will not no longer become no longer be drug-resistant. These observations also drove us to try to understand how aneuploidy can give rise to these diverse phenotypic have these diverse phenotypic effects. And the answer to that comes from how enduploidy affects gene expression. So this is one of our studies, but there are a number of other studies in the field that have come to the same conclusion. So here, for example, are five different aneuploid strains. Here's the Strains: Here's the heat map of their relative chromosome copy number of the 16 chromosomes. This is the RNA expression level relative to the euploid from each chromosome. And this is a protein expression level. You can see they mirror each other. Okay, so what this means is that every time you gain or loss a copy of the chromosomes, the gene expression on both the RNA and protein level, at least on average along these chromosomes, Average along these chromosomes would vary in a very dosage-related manner. So, this is the primary dosage effect, which can be very subtle because chromosome copy number usually only gains just by 50% or a few votes. And so, these primary effects, however, affect many, many genes. However, affect many, many genes carried on these chromosomes. So they can have much more dramatic secondary effects, which are unscaled changes of downstream genes, which have also been observed. And even more dramatic are tertiary, what we call tertiary effects, which are hormonal level epigenetic changes, which can profoundly affect cell identity. So, given this understanding of how enduploidy affects How enduploid affects gene expression on a very broad level. One of my former graduate students, Andrei Kucharabi, who's a very gifted computational biologist, working together with Boris Schrubenstein, built a very simple mathematical model to explore on a very fundamental level how chromosome copy number variation can cause phenotypic exerts. Phenotypic exerts its phenotypic effect. So, the model is based on two very simple assumptions. First, is that self-fitness is governed by a number of independent pathways. And the second assumption is that because every time when the chromosome is gained or lost, it affects so many genes in the genome. So, we simply modeled an anecdote effect on each pathway as a random process. And here's an example, a very simple example of an Simple example of n equals two. So the finness distribution is modeled as a two-dimensional normal distribution affected by these two pathways, just for illustration purpose. And so euploid with under stress-free conditions is that is at this fitness optima, as we have shown experimentally, whereas uneuploid has a fitness defect, so they're in this lower landscape point. Landscape point. And now, under stress conditions, now the euploid is no longer the fittest. So, whereas the fitness optima is now shifted away from this original peak. Now, this is just a way visualization of a slice of this two-dimensional distribution. So, now some enduploids are closer to fitness optima, whereas the euploid is some distance away, whereas some euploids become. Where some euploids become some enduploids become even further away from the fitness optima. So, if we plot this, we'll see exactly what we observe experimentally. That is under low stress conditions. So, here's this line across zero. This is the euploid fitness. And so, under low stress conditions, most aneuploids have reduced fitness, but very small. There's very small phenotypic variation. But as we increase stress, We increase stress by treating with different drugs or put cells into suboptimal conditions. Although the average growth of aneuploids are decreasing, the phenotypic spread of these aneuploids now increases and leading to the emergence of these adaptive variants. So the way to think about this is actually very scary. Imagine you have a tumor that has all sorts of chromosomally Normally, different aneuploid cells and kerotypically diverse cells, cell population. And so, if you just put them under a very harsh drug that will wipe out most of the tumors, some variants, adaptive variants will emerge and will take over the population, become drug-resistant tumors. So, with this understanding, we Understanding we and others in the field now want to ask another question. So, we know that these aneuploid cells, very diverse karyotypes, have very diverse phenotypes. So, the question is, do these diverse aneuploids, can they have something in common? Do they have a common stress state? And if we know what that state is, maybe we can target that stress state. That stress state. But that's actually a very difficult problem. So I like to use this analogy to show why that's so different. So you probably know these are Pokemons if you have little kids, and they're all very diverse. So this is how we think about enduploids, different cells with different number of chromosomes, have different phenotypes. And if you want to ask what they have in common, it's very difficult because they all have their own characteristics. Characteristics. And there's for experimentalists, there's also a sampling issue. So, if you, for example, if you only have this set of Pokemon cards and you'll say they have all have something round on their head. But if you have, you know, just happen to have this set, you say they have everything, they have something pointy on their back. So that kind of difficulty has been causing a lot of confusion in the fields because no one Of confusion in the fields because no one can have a bigger set of enduploid strains to work with, big enough enduploid strains to work with. So, a few years ago, we decided to solve this problem by taking a more unconventional approach. Instead of looking at individual aneuploid strains, we decided to generate a population of cells with random aneploids that reach over 500 different random. Over 500 different random karyotypes. So, this is just a copy number from some copy number profile. And so, you would imagine that the gene expression characteristics of each of these endeoploids would be very similarly defined by the chromosome copy number. However, we mix all of these 500 different endeoploids into a single population. Endeuploids into a single population. Now, this mixed population have an overall chromosome copy number like the euploid. So, basically, all these differences average out, yet every single cell is an uneuploid cell. So, now if we do gene expression analysis, comparing this population with a truly euploid population, such as a haploid population, then any gene expression changes cannot be due to these individual. Cannot be due to these individual chromosome copy number change, but rather reflect something in common for aneuploids. So using this analysis, we identified a common aneuploidy gene expression profile. And then we compared this profile with a very long list of gene expression profiles of E-cells under diverse stress conditions. We want to see how this matches with this stress condition. And the top stress condition that came Stress condition that came out to us was actually a shock. It's hypo-osmotic shock. It's a shock to us because we weren't expecting it at all. And so, and the correlation is very, very good. And so, hyper osmotic shock, this is what we call, that's why we think of this as when genetics meets mechanobiology. So, it's a mechanical stress when cells are, for example, put in a high. Cells are, for example, put in a hypotonic solution. And because of the osmotic difference, osmotic gradients across the cell membrane, there's water influx and cell swelling and membrane stress. And that leads to downstream responses such as gene expression change. So after we observed that with a gene expression analysis, we did perform a number of biophysical measures. Biophysical measurements to look at how that affects the cell physiology, biophysical properties of the cell. I see I'm running out of time, so I'm going to just very quickly go through. We found that there's an increase in Turger pressure as well as a decreased endocytosis, which is a consequence of the Turger pressure increase. And so then we So then we asked why would endoplasmic cells have experience a hyposmotic stress? And so the answer comes from this picture. So every time you have chromosome number variation, you have scaled protein dosage variation. And proteins is one of the major macromolecules that contribute to ospotic pressure coming from macromolecules inside the cell. Molecules inside the cell. And the magnitude of this pressure is proportional to the number of protein solutes, which is the sum of free proteins and protein complexes. So when you have a proteome in balance, many of the proteins that interact with each other cannot find binding partners. So here's a very simple illustration of a haploid and deeploid. So now you can see there are five proteins, for example, that interact with each other. Proteins, for example, that interact with each other, and from proteomics studies have shown that their expression are highly correlated. And now, if you have aneuploid situation where the genome size is actually in between haploid and deployed, but you have more protein solute due to these free proteins. So, we can, this is a very simple mathematical model, again, constructed by Andrei Kucharavi to depict. Ravi to depict this situation and also using very simple thermodynamic theories. And what we can show is that the model predicts this, what we call hyperscaling, where the cell size is bigger than what would be predicted by their genome size, which between Euploid genome, it should be more or less linear. And this actually can be validated by real measurements of these cells. Real measurements of these cells with different karyotypes. And another prediction is that the cells actually have different biophysical characteristics, such as they would have reduced density due to this hyperscaling of cell size. And this is just a density gradient where we can indeed show that aneuploid cells are lighter. So, this is in yeast. So, what about in human cells? And so, in human cells, we can also induce aneuploidy by using a drug called By using a drug called reversin, which is a mitotic inhibitor. So, this is some ongoing experiment carried out by my student Hong Ye Chu at MBI. So, Hong Ye used cell size, FXM to measure cell size of aneployed populations. So, this is their average genome size. What he can see is that the cell size increase is greater than the proportion of this genome size increase. So, this hyperscaling also exists. Hyperscaling also exists in human cells. And also, working with Joe Chan at MBI, Hong Ye measured the stiffness or deformability of aneuploid cells. And he found that aneuploid cells also have higher stiffness. And he also used this micro-Pepet method to measure cortical tension as well as cytoplasmic pressure. And both are showing an increase, although to different magnitude, comparing aneuploid. Comparing aneuploid to euploid. So, we've been actually talking to folks like Jacques Pro to try to understand why aneuploid cell human cells would also be stiffer and showing this increased cytoplasmic pressure. But you might be wondering that how does that compare with gene expression of human cells under hyposmotic stress? So, this is something that turns out was very difficult for us to do immediately directly because. Directly because there are very little understanding about how human cells respond to hyposmotic stress over the time scale of 20 minutes. So, most studies have been looking at this very short time point. Whereas we know in chronic inflammatory conditions, you know, hyposmotic stress is chronic. So, Bin in my lab, postdoc in my lab, has been looking at, develop a model to look at more long-term hypothesis. At more long-term hypoosmotic stress. So he put a human RPE cells under either isotonic condition or a hypoosmotic condition, and then did a gene expression analysis over several days. And what he found that one of the main pathways that really just jumped out at us was p53. And this is a pathway that's known to activate downstream effectors such as p21 cell cycle. A P21 cell cycle inhibitor to cause G1 cell cycle arrest. And so, and in fact, indeed, that's what we found. So, when cells are under osmotic stress for three days, they basically stop growing. And in fact, they arrest SG1 arrested cells. This is just using the Fuji indicator. So Okay, yes, yes. This is just the last couple of slides. And so, one reason for this is actually turns out that this first mitosis before a cell cycle arrests is highly error-prone. So, cells dividing in hypotonic conditions has much increased mitotic errors, including lagging chromosome and chromosome bridges. And this is the work of And this is the work of Courti Cessi in the lab. And what we found is that this is actually due to impaired chromosome condensation. So cells would go into endophase with partially condensed chromosomes. So I'm going to skip some of the couple of slides, just go to the very last model. Sort of not this is not a proven model, but really more of a hypothesis. So our current working hypothesis. So, our current working hypothesis is that under this hyposmiotic stress, as we know, can occur under chronic inflammatory conditions, can lead to erronous mitosis and generating various levels of complexity in aneuploid genome with different levels of complexity. In complex aneuploidy, what we show that can activate p53, and this is a piece of data I didn't have time to show you. Piece of data, I didn't have time to show you, but we also found that complex aneuploidy can also have hyposmotic stress itself can also lead to PFAB reactivation. And the importance of that is that red cells in G1 and prevent further mitotic errors to generate further genetic diversity. And this could be the real reason that why p53 mutation or inactivation is one of the main. Where inactivation is one of the major steps in cancer evolution downstream of chronic inflammatory diseases. So, with that, I will stop.
