So, hello, everyone. Thanks very much to the organizers for inviting me. It's a great honor to be here. So, I want to talk to you about recent work with Jacopo Berger, who is at the University of Zurich. And so it's been posted on the article. So it's been posted on the archive for two weeks now, I think, and there will be an update to the paper on archive soon. So okay, so this story is placed in the I mean it stems from a very recent line of work, which consists in looking at wait a minute, should I do Yes, sorry. Looking at families of restrictive permutations and looking at asymptotic shape for Asymptotic shape for the diagram of a permutation. So for me, a permutation is a bijection between the integers 1 to n to themselves. And I just write this bijection as a function, putting the i in the x-axis and sigma i in the y-axis. So that's how you involve a permutation. And for many subfamilies of permutation, especially those who are obtained by pattern avoidance, it has been quite interesting to wonder what the diagram of the permutation looks like when you look at a uniformly random large permutation in this family. So here So here I plot various examples of large permutations in pattern-devoting families. And really this whole story started with the class of separable permutation, which is in the bottom right corner, when in 2016, several authors, including the advisor. including the the advisors uh of of Jacopo, so Bassino, Bouvel, Ferret, Jurin, and Pierrot, showed that you have a random limit shape to the family of separable permutations. And which is quite strike sc striking compared to many other cases where you have concentration around the around the deterministic limit shape. Around the deterministic limit shape. So, to deal with such results, we have a very nice framework, which is the framework of permutons, which allows us to put all permutations of any size in the same compact metric space. So, to do that, you take the diagram of a permutation and you And you replace the points of the diagram by little squares. And in this square, and you rescale it by n, so it fits into the unit square. And in every square, you put mass 1 over n. And this allows to represent permutations by what we call permutons, which are probability measures on the unit square. Measures on the unit square with uniform marginals. And with the help of this tool, you are able to talk about scaling limits of sequences of permutation of increasing size. And you can have random scaling limits in distribution. So, the family that we are looking in this paper is the family. In this paper, is the family of Baxter permutation. So it's a family that avoids generalized patterns, so-called vincular patterns. So a parameter is backstore if you cannot find a sequence of four indices such that the two middle indices are consecutive. Are consecutive and such that the permutation reorders these syndices in the order 2, 4, 1, 3. And you have the same condition from for the each shall not reorder four indices with the two in the middle consecutive in the order 3, 1, 4, 2. So, and the Baxter permutation, they are a very nice family of permutations. They are equidument. Of permutations. They are equipped numerous to many other, to some other classes of permutation. It seems you froze, or is it just me? No, me too. I think he is crushed. Okay. Okay. Let's hope the connection resumes quickly.  I just got some internet connection at the end of the day. Sorry, I just lost my internet connection at the worst possible time. Very sorry. I hope it stays like that. Can you still hear me? We can hear you again. Yeah, that's great. Don't worry. Okay, excellent. Let me share my screen again. Okay, can you see my screen? Yep, yes. Excellent. Sorry about that. And so the goal was to prove a similar theorem for Baxter permutations, and this is our main theorem. So there exists a random permutant, such that if you consider a large uniform random Baxter permutation, you have convergence in distribution. You have convergence in distribution to this functor. So let me show you two simulations made by Jacopo of Large Baxter permutations. So of size 4000 or something like that. So here's one and here's the second one. So you see that there is something, I mean, it's not, you see that. You see that there is some limit shape, but it is random. Okay, so I will try to give you many ingredients of our proof and talk also about and this starts with combinatorial ingredients, which are two very nice remarkable bijections that we use to prove this theorem. So the first one is So the first one is a bijection due to Bonnichon, Busque-Milo and Fusi between Baxter permutations and bipolar-oriented maps. So I'll describe this bijection starting from the Baxter permutation. So this set of crosses here, this is the diagram of a Baxter permutation. So in particular, it avoids these two vincular patterns. It avoids these two vincular patterns, 2413 and 3142. And this tells you that if I take a descent in the permutation, so here's a descent, the two red crosses here, this cannot be the two middle indices of a pattern 2413. So you cannot have something like that in your permutation. This means, in particular, This means in particular that if you look at points that are vertically between these two points, they must be ordered, they must be grouped into these two rectangles, so one rectangle at the top left and one rectangle at the bottom right. And the other condition, the 3142 condition, gives you exactly Gives you exactly a similar property for descent. So for every ascent and descent in the permutation, so for every pair actually of consecutive indices, which is either an ascent or a descent, you will have this drawing. And I will put at this special point in between the In between the ascents and in between the descent, I will put dots, so a black dot for descent and a white dot for ascent. And I will do this for every point of the permutation, for every interval between two consecutive indices in the permutation. And I will also do it on the four corners according to I will add black points on the top left and bottom right and white points. Top left and bottom right, and white points on the bottom left and top right. This is just a convention. And so, actually, if you remove these four special points, this new set of points is this is actually what Baxter usually originally called a Baxter permutation. But nowadays, we just consider what happened with the odd indices in a Baxter permutation, and this is the crosses here. This is the crosses here. But okay, see that as some kind of enriched by star parametric. I will, for now, I will forget the black points, just keep the crosses and the white points. And I will draw the Haas diagram. So, sorry. And if you look at the arrow in the bottom right, you see that I will orient my plane. That I will orient my plane and I will take the set of my white points and crosses and view this as a partially ordered set. When I say that a point is above the other, if it is larger than the other, if it is in the northeast quadrant, starting from this point. So, this gives me a posset on my set of points, and I And I then draw the Haas diagram of the poset. So the minimal number of edges that I need to draw so that you have a north-east path that goes between each comparable pair. Okay, and now if I now this drawing gives me a planner map. map. It is a planar map and if I remember the ordering given by the poset which tells me that a point is above the other if it is in the northeast, I see that every edge is oriented from a lower point to a higher point in the process and this gives me an orientation in An orientation in my planner map. And there is a point which is minimal, which is on the bottom, and a point which is maximal on the top. They are both in the outer face of the map. And a planner map like that, I call it a bipolar oriented map. And the theorem of Bonishunguski Meleeweight Fusie is that this is a bijection. This is a bijection from backstopper mutation to bipolar oriented maps. So is the construction clear? So do people have questions about this construction? Okay. Sorry, I have a question. Sure. I mean, you said it's a bijection to a set. A set of bipolar-oriented maps, but I didn't. I mean, I didn't see you define a bipolar-oriented map. I thought you just said, Well, here is an example of one. So I don't know what's a bi-jection integral really is. So that's right. So I didn't put the definition of bipolar and pinpoint maps in my slide. So bipolar and peat maps, they are maps where you have an orientation. An orientation, a NASIKIC orientation of the edges, and you have a unique source and a unique sink, which should be on the outer face of the map. So this is what you obtain when you... Yes, and actually, this is the image of this bijection. This is what you obtain when you draw a planar Haas diagram and you have Planar Haas diagram, and you have a maximal point and a minimal point. But it, so it's with the planar embedding as well. Yes, exactly, exactly. You are, you also, so it's not just a directed acyclic graph, it's a directed acyclic graph, but drawn in the plane, and you have to take this into account. Okay, and okay, so let me. Okay, so let me continue. So what is very nice is that you have Baxter permutations, they have all the symmetries of the square. So you can also do this procedure with the rotated with the Baxter permutation rotated ninety degrees, if you want, then ascens will become descent, but you will become descents, but you do the same procedure. So this is where the black dots from earlier which were linked to descents come in. And you obtain another bipolar oriented map which is dual to the first one. And this ring is what I will take as my definition of the dual of a bipolar oriented map. So when you have a bipolar oriented map you have the You have the usual construction of the dual of a map, of a planar map, but you have two points in the outer face, one of the left and one of the right, and this becomes the sink and source of the dual map. And this is also something that you can view on top of the original Baxter permutation. And okay, and yes? Just to check, I understand. So there are some. Check that I understand. So, there are some looking at the picture with just the white points, that there are some pairs of white points which are south-west-northeast of each other, which are not comparable in the ordering given to you by the map. Is that right? So it's not that every... No, no, no, they are all comparable, but when you draw the Haas diagram, you don't put edges, you don't put all the comparisons. There's one roughly in the middle. There's one roughly in the middle, and there's one kind of near the one nearest the bottom left, which don't seem to get compared in the HESA diagram somehow. Sorry. Which one again? Sorry? The one nearest the bottom left, which isn't actually at the bottom left. Yes. Then you go kind of 45 degrees up from that. You are absolutely right. Just a second. Yes, you are absolutely right. This is a mistake in my drawing. So yes, yes, there should be an edge. So this perfectly diagonal edge should not attach to the bottom left vertex. I'm very sorry about that. But should attach to the vertex that is above it. So, do you see my mouse? Do you see my mouse or not? So, this edge should be attached to this point. Sorry about that. Thank you very much, James. Trying to work it out. I was also a bit confused when you put the red lines on, and I guess it's because of the same issue, right? Because with the red lines, there seem to be some that are sloping too much. So, like, in the same area. Like in the same area, there's this red line that goes way, way down. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. You are absolutely right. Okay. Yes, this is. Oh my god. Okay, okay, so this might mess most of the drawings that come afterwards, but we'll try to have. I mean, we're mathematicians, so I hope we are able to accept that. To accept that. Very sorry about that. Okay, so let me try to describe the inverse bijection now, which is the one we are interested about because it will be easier to understand bipolar maps than Baxter permutations. So I will take a look at my bipolar-oriented map, I will do a project. Bipolar-oriented map, I will do a procedure that does not depend on the way it is drawn in the plane. So you don't have to know the Baxter permutation from which it comes to do this procedure. So under every vertex, you will disconnect every edge except the rightmost. Okay, so if you take a look here, So, if you take a look here at the sink, you have four incoming edges in the sink. You disconnect the three leftmost one and you keep only the rightmost one. And this disconnects your map into a tree. And I call it T of M if M was my original map. This is something I can do with the dual map also. So I can do it on the map rotated 180 degrees, so exchanging top and bottom. And this is in green, and this is the tree of M star star, because in the case of bipolar orientation, the dual map of the dual map is not the original map. It's the original map rotated pi d r rot rotated Rotated 180 degrees. So I can do that, and I'll obtain four trees on the top of my original report orientation. And something which is quite nice if you look at this is that in the drawing given by the Baxter permutation, the end points of the Endpoints of the edges are oriented from left to right, are ordered from left to right by my drawing. And this order corresponds to the contour exploration of my tree. So this is something that you can see here. If I explore my tree according to the contour exploration, like this, I will visit the edges in the ordering given by the crosses. Crosses. This is also true for this red tree, which is the tree given by the view map. But here the ordering will be from bottom to top. So the inverse bijection of the Bonishon-Buss Kemilo and Fisi bijection is as follows. You consider a bipolar orientation. You draw the tree of the orientation and the tree of its dual. Of its dual. And it's the only permutation such that the ice edge in the exploration of T of M is the pi i edge in the exploration of T of M star. So this is how you obtain the Baxter permutation from the bipolar orienting map. Okay, so this is the description of the first bijection, the the first of the two bijections that we that we use. Projections that we use. So, if there are any questions at this point, I'm happy to answer them. Okay, so the second bijection is one due to Kenyon Miller, Sheffield and Wilson, which relates bipolar orientations to a family of walks in the quadrant. Quadrant. And by composing these two bijections, we obtain a very nice bijection between Baxter permutations and wolf-in the quadrants, which are a tractable object in terms of probability theory. So this projection is as follows. Remember these four trees that you could draw on a bipolar orientation, and you take the tree that goes to the bottom and the tree that goes to the bottom. tree that goes to the bottom and the tree that goes to the top. So T of M and T of M double star. So these two trees, from the same reason as before, you have the very nice property that these two trees, so they contain all the edges of the map, but some edges are disconnected from the vertex compared to the original map. And the ordering in which the control exploration visits the edges of the blue tree is the reverse of the ordering in which this control exploration visits the edges of the green tree. Okay, so something very nice that you can do is you can draw the hate process of the Bluetooth. Blue tree, draw the reverse of the health process of the green tree and make them correspond so that a step that corresponds to an edge in the first head process is in front of the step that corresponds to the same edge in the process exploring the the other tree. Exploring the other tree. And so this gives you a function that maps bipolar orientations to walks in the quadrant because his process are positive. And actually, you just have a small change when you remove the zero step at the beginning of each. And what is very nice is that the family of walks that you obtain is very simple. Those are very nice random walks that are in the quadrant, start on the x-axis, end on the y-axis, and with a family of steps, which is 1 minus 1, and all steps in the top left quadrant. So those are called tenderm walks by Mirabus Kemilu. And this is a family of walks that we are happy to analyze and try to obtain some properties on the Baxter permutations. Okay. So if there are any questions, you are feel free to interrupt me. You are feel free to interrupt me. So, now the next thing that we want to do is something that is when you have this connection with works in the quadrant, you know that you can use tools from I mean well known tools from probability theory to obtain the scaling limits of these works in the quadrant. And there is this was proved by Kenyon Miller, Sheffield and Wilson. It was proved by Kenyon Miller, Sheffield, and Wilson that this process has a scaling limit, which is a correlated Bronen excursion in the quadrant. But to recover what happens with Baxter permutations, we would like to be able to read the permutation directly from the wall. So inverted the bijection in a way that allows us to read the permutation very easily. So this is what I will try to describe now. Right now. Recalling that to read the permutation, you need to compare the ordering in which edges are visited by the tree T of M with the way they are visited in the exploration, in the contour exploration of the tree T of M star. So here I am drawing the I'm drawing the bipolar orientation. I am drawing it using the embedding provided by the bijection with the Baxter permutation so that the edges, the black edges, are ordered from left to right according to the exploration of the tree T of M. And I also draw in red the tree T of M star. And the construction that And the construction that I will that and I will construct something that I call a coalescent walk process from the walk that allows us to recover this red tree directly from the walk coding the black bipolar orientation. So I start with plotting the y coordinate of the walk in the the y coordinate of the walk here. White coordinate of the wall here, and in the bottom, the reversal of the x-coordinate of the wall. And I put points at every integer point of the x-axis. And what I will do is that each of these thread points will start a trajectory of my coalescent work process. And these trajectories will evolve as follow, as long as they are in the top part of the project. part of the of the in the top part of the of the graph they will follow in parallel the green walk and as long as they are in the blue part in the bottom part of the graph they will follow in a parallel fashion the blue the blue walk so i start with my first trajectory at the second time i add a new trajectory which uh evolves uh And so, when I am on the axis, I evolve according to the green rock. So, here it evolves in parallel, so it follows it takes a step zero. And I keep doing that. Okay, and you see that sometimes I have a coalescence. Okay, I arrive to this point, and at this point, I have somewhat of a I have somewhat of a I have uh there is a special case because the work starts in the negative part part of the graph. I mean these three trajectories here they start in the negative part of the of the of the graph but they taking the blue step brings them brings them to the to the non-negative part of the graph. So in here I have a special case in which in which these trajectories are forced to join the trajectory that is started at the same that is started at the same at the same time yes that just starts at the same time okay and I keep doing that and I obtain up to adding just up to joining the three remaining trajectories at the end I obtain I obtain a graph of trajectories that all coalesce together at various times. Okay? And the very nice property of this construction is the following, is that the branching structure of the trajectories that I draw is that of T of M. So probably there is something wrong because of the mistake I made in the beginning, I assume. I assume. So maybe if you want to convince yourself that this works based on the example, you should look at the right of the drawing and maybe something is wrong in here, probably. Okay, so the branching structure of the trajectories is that of T of M star, but edges are visited in the order given by By T of M. So, by comparing these two orders. So, if to do that, I could just look at the contour exploration of this red tree here. So, this would be my first edge, second edge, third edge, fourth edge, fifth edge, etc. etc. Edge, etc., etc. This will give me a reordering of the integers 1 to n, and this reordering will be my original Baxter permutation. Okay, so yeah, I think some physics is clearly wrong in the beginning. I can see it. Sorry about that. Any questions about this? Okay so yes, so this construction is very nice because it allows us to obtain scaling limits, to take scaling limits because as we will see the coalescent qual process itself has a scaling limit. So it was shown by Kenyon Miller, Sheffin and Wilson using works on Works on walks in the quarter plane by Durag and Vashtel that a uniform random tandem hulk converges to a pair of Bronian excursions with cross correlation minus one half, which is a very simple process, which is also what you obtain if you take a Bronian motion with this correlation. Take a Bronze motion with this correlation in the plane, and you require it to start at zero, end at zero, and stay in the quarter plane. So, and this was done in the in view of proving pianosphere convergence of bipolar-oriented maps. So, maybe I will not, I took a lot of time already, I will not talk too much about this. Okay, so here is a large tender mulk, the same. Large tender mulk, the sample of a large tender mulk, together with the trajectories of the coalescent hulk process. So this is something that is not very that, okay. We don't see much from this picture, but this is a process for which we want to prove that there is a scaling limit. Okay, so now what would be the continuous analog of this coalescent process? So in the literature it was studied this following SD called perchurbed Tanaka's equation was studied in the literature by Proquay and later by Sidler Ajri. and later by Sidler, Ajri and Kerakus. And this is what you obtain if you take a Bruni motion, a correlated Brunen motion, so XY, and you, so this is your noise from which you start, and you have this process Z which should follow the Y coordinate as long as Z is positive. As z is positive, and when it's negative, it should follow the x-coordinate. And it was proved by Proquay that there is pathways uniqueness for this equation. And the others proved that there exist solutions to this equation. And if you remember what the coalescent process was doing, it's exactly that as long as a trajectory is positive, it follows the green path, and when it's negative, it follows the pen. Path and when it's negative, it follows the blue path. So essentially, what we will do is that we will take a Brownian excursion of correlation minus one half in the quarter plane, and we will start different starting times, u for u in 0, 1. And for each of u, we will solve. We will solve the SDE with using the noise X, Y and the noise that we use will be the same for all the use at the same time. And this is something that we can do since the equation has strong solutions. And the main lemma of our paper is that this process is the Is the scaling limit of the trajectories of the coalescent wall process? So you have convergence of the coalescent wall process to this continuous coalescing flow driven by a Brunen equation, a Bronyen excursion. Okay, and this is And um th this is very this is uh this is very useful because this uh this process is is really uh obtained in a measurable way from uh the Brunel excursion XY. And the construction of the limit parameter is very straightforward and it's really analog to what happens in the discrete. So maybe I will I will uh I will go back to the discrete so if I take So if I take two starting points of, for instance, I take this one here and I no, maybe let's say this one here, and I follow its trajectory, I see that it goes above, for instance, this point. And the fact that it is above this point means that this. Above this point means that this point will be explored before this one in the control exploration of the tree. And this exactly means that the index of this point in the corresponding Baxter permutation will be smaller than the index of this point in the Baxter in the In the Baxter permutation. So in the continuum, this is what happens. If you have s smaller than t, s smaller than t in the usual ordering of 0, 1. If the trajectory starting at time s is below 0 at time t, then it means that s is smaller than t. That S is smaller than T in the continuous permutation that you create on 0, 1. Otherwise, you put T smaller than S. Then you transform this reordering of zero one into a function. So this is something that is analogous to the discrete. You just count. To the discrete, you just count for every t, you count the number of points that are before you, and this gives you a measure-presolving function from 0, 1 to itself. And if you look at the natural Lebesgue measure on the graph of this function, you obtain the Baxter parameter. The Baxter parameter. And it is a measurable function of x and y. So any questions about that? Can we see the picture again? This one? No, the Baxter permutation. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah yeah. So yeah, so this function phi is uh it's not continuous at all but it is I mean you still have convergence of this drawing, this picture to the graph of to the graph of a measurable function on 0, 1. And the convergence is in the sense of permitting. Is in the sense of permutants. So, yeah, actually, this is a very similar story as the one for separable permutations. You also have this kind of function, which is, I mean, which has many disconnections. It should be everywhere discontinuous. So, I mean, sorry, no, no, sorry. It should have a countable number of discontinuous. A countable number of discontinuity points. So, yeah, it's not continuous on any open interval. Is there some regularity that you can state, some regularity property of this function that you can state? Well, it should be that almost every point should be a continuity point. So, no, no, so no, we have proven nothing for now. No quantitative statement which is stronger than that. That's not a very strong statement. No, no, no, it's not a very strong statement. You don't, I mean, but so what was proven, this is a work of mine on the separable permutum, which looks a lot like this, is that the That the graph of the function has other dimension one. Okay. So this is expected here also, but we have no proof for now. We should write a proof, but we have no proof. No proof for now. But it seems to kind of have some hints of straight lines running through it. I don't know whether that's just the eye playing tricks. See what I mean? See what I mean? Lines of you know, diagonal lines of not too crazy slopes. I mean, it goes somewhere else, but then it comes back to the same line. Yes, yes, yes. So, this is something that maybe I will show you at the end. I need to find the email from Milacopo. But I mean, this corresponds to a door. Sorry? Yeah, we should be wrapping up soon, a few more minutes perhaps. Oh, yeah, yeah, okay, okay. But okay, okay, so basically this is the drawing of a bipolar-oriented map in the plane. And if you look, if you draw the edges, actually, so if you draw this Haas diagram, you will see that the faces are mostly re that, I mean, I mean, a lot of edges are vertical or horizontal. So maybe this is linked to that. But we have no, I mean, we don't know. To be honest, we don't know much about what happens here. Okay. All right. And so this is something that I have overlooked somewhat: is that Is that what we are doing actually is in some sense a generalization of something that was already studied by Gwyn, Holden, and Seon. Because you see, so okay. So you see that, I mean, when so if I go back to here, you see that the blue path encodes the bottom tree, the tree tier. The bottom tree, the treaty of M. The green path encodes the treaty of M star star, and the red coalescence process encodes the tree T of M star. So something that you can do also is run the coalescence process backwards and obtain the first tree, the yellow tree, if I remember correctly, T of M triple star. And so actually what we are able to prove is the gent convergence of this Is the joint convergence of these four trees together with the convergence of the Baxter permutation? And all the symmetries that you have in the discrete, they end up in the continuum also. And this was already studied by Gwyn, Holden, and Suhn in the case of infinite volume bipolar triangulations. So they have a restriction on the face degrees, and they did not condition. Degrees. And they did not condition. So they looked at tandem walks that were free, not conditioned on staying in the quadrant. And so our result, in some sense, extends theirs. And the coalescence process is something that is also present in their work, but seeing describing the Describing the limit using SD theories is something that is quite new. And so, in their work, it's described in a somewhat different way. But using the SD theory has allowed us to write simpler proofs. So, this is what we have brought with our paper. Together with removing this technical These technical simplifications of looking at triangulations and unconditional roles. Okay, so I have some perspectives, which is basically to say that we would like to look at other classes of permutations. We believe that many others have a coalescent wall process encoding and should converge to something similar, maybe with a different correlation parameter. A different correlation parameter in the Brownian expression. And maybe you could also have asymmetry at the origin, which is something which is observed in a paper of Lison and Watson, which study Schneider rules instead of bipolar orientations. Okay, I will stop here. Sorry, I took maybe too much time. Thank you very much. Okay, well, we can unmute and thank Mikhail very much indeed. Well, we've already had some nice discussion. If anyone's got burning questions, then do jump in. But otherwise, we'll maybe we can also discuss more at the end of the session. Anything anybody wants to add at this point? The obvious question is: other pattern avoiding permutations? I mean, is there any hope, or is it just this? This is very, very special. So, okay, I mean, there are specific classes which have bijection with walks in the quadrants, and we hope that for some of And we hope that for some of them, so they are listed in the paper, Yakopo knows more about them than I do. But those are quite specific classes of permutations, so they also avoid generalized patterns. It's not classical pattern-avoiding permutations. We don't know of pattern-avoiding permutations that so classical pattern-aviding permutations that would fit in this framework. That would fit in this framework, I believe. Yes, there are some families of pattern-of-evident paradigms that are in bijection with families of planar maps, but it's really unclear if there is anything anything like that.
