I'm pleased to introduce our next speaker, S Kiramets Vanti, and the title of his talk is Moment Functions on Hypergroup Joins. Thank you very much for the wonderful introduction. My name is Misa Vati. First of all, I would like to thank the organizers for the invitation and for doing the wonderful work. Today we are. Work today, we managed to finally attend the conference physically after so many years. Okay, so there's a joint work with Professor Azlosiklihid. He's a Hungarian mathematician. We are talking about the hypergroup, join. We change uh a compact type of group and then we have a discrete type of group and then there are enzymes that are supposed to be satisfied for us to say we have a hypergroup drain which is sort of a new hypergroup. I mean a hypergroup drawing is simply an extension of a compact hypergroup by aging Hypergroup by adding or uniting it with the discrete hypergroup. So, in this case, we're going to in our talk here, we're going to let C to be our compact hypergroup with a normalized high measure omega C. And star C is the convolution or the compact hypergroup. And then at the discrete case, we have D will be our discrete hypergroup. Be our discriminatory group, and the stat D will be our convolution on the type of group, such that the intersection of C and D here is our identity. Here, this will be our identity. And then for us to say that for us to define the To define the convolution on the new hypergroup, this new hypergroup I'll refer it as K. I mean this will be C V D or simply C union D C union D. So these isomes are supposed to be satisfied for us to say that this indeed this is That this indeed this is a hypergroup join, but on the new hypergroup join. Okay, and then we let we take an element X and Y from the compact hypergroup such that the composition of delta X or the compact hypergroup delta Y, this is the first isom, and then the second isom. The second isom is we take an element x and y from the discrete case such that y is not equal to our identity which is E and then we have delta X composition delta Y to be equals to delta Y convolution of delta X to be equals to delta sorry to be equals to to be equals to delta y and then the third iso when you take an element when you take an element x and y from the discrete case such that y is not equal to x involution then we have delta x convolution delta y to be equals to delta x convolution on the discrete case delta y this isom These enzomes, you can find them in the book by Blom and Hare, which you consider it to be the Bible of Hypergroup, or in the famous paper by Jawat, I think it's 10.5. Yes, theorem 10.5. He defined the hypergroup joint. And then the fourth isom, we take an element. take an element when you take an element x from the discrete case such that delta x convolution of delta y convolution is constrained the summation of az delta z plus az delta e for az to be a complex number then we have delta x composition of delta y delta x composition of delta x in volition to be called so the summation Evolution to because so the summation this is just simply an exp uh we are expanding this because in this case here in this case here we are saying that is an element of DE yeah in this case here we are saying that is an element of DE but then there was an there is an error here Z supposed to be an element of D E and all such that The first case here is supposed to be Z is an element of DE and then we will end up having this whereby Z is an element of DE. I mean where Z is not equals to E and then Building up to the moment function on hypergroup drawing, first of all, we are going to need the basic functions or the definitions of certain basic functions on the hypergroup drawing. So now, I saw it's very important for me to talk about the exponential function. So we say that given the hypergroup K, the continuous function M mapped such that K is not Mapped such that k is mapped to C is called an exponential even only if satisfies x composition of y to equals to m of x m of y for x and y in k and then we have this theorem we have this theorem on on the exponential function on hypergroup rate we we let C and D to be a compact hypergroup And D to be a compact hypergroup and D to be a discrete hypergroup, respectively, and that the continuous function, which is our new hypergroup here, K is exponential on hypergroup during C V D even only if one of the following possibilities holds. I mean the restriction of M to C is equals to, it's not equals to one, is a character on C, and then the restriction of M to D E is. M to D E is identically 0. The second one is the restriction of M to C is identically 1, and the restriction of M to D is an exponential on the discrete case. And then we have also the additive function. For us to say that the continuous function is an additive function, it's supposed to satisfy A of X convolution of. A of x convolution of y to be equals to A of X plus A of Y. And then also, same thing follows like the previous one for the exponential. We let C and D to be as above, and then the continuous function of function A, such that C union D is mapped to C is an additive function of the hyperclubbre C V D. CBD if the restriction of A to C is identically zero and the restriction of A to D is additive on the discrete case. And also we have the same thing applies to the paddy function and the M sine function. Yeah, the M sine function is like sine of X plus Y is. Plus y is going to sign x cos y yeah and then this lemma this is yeah this lemma oh by the way this theorem this this theorem here and the theorem here we proved this theorem when we were checking We proved this theorem when we were talking about the functional equation on a hypergroup drag. So now this is an extension. Now we're talking about the moment function on hypergroup drag, but that we need some of this lemma to be able to prove some of this lemma and theorem to be able to prove the moment function on hypergroup draw. And mind you, the moment function and the functional equations are very very important. And the functional equations are very, very important in the concept of spectrosynthesis and spectroanalysis. These are the building blocks of spectrosynthesis and spectral analysis. And then the main idea was to try and find the behavior of the spectrosynthesis and the spectral analysis on the hypercup joy. So now, without wasting time, let's just go to the moment function. The moment function. The continuous function fn such that k is not to c is a natural sorry on the hypergroup K from a moment function sequence of order n if f0 is non-identically zero and if f n x convolution of y And x convolution of y equals to this summation. And then the first alignment that we have, we let x to be a hypergroup and fn a moment function sequence on x and then fn of e is equals to zero. This one is easy to prove because, first of all, we are going to prove it by induction, so it's easy to prove. So it's easy to prove. And we have another lemma. We let C be a compact hypergroup with a normalized high measure omega C and F and B a moment function sequence on C. And then we have if F naught is equals to one, then F naught is equals to zero for N and for N equals to one, two, three. And then the second one, if F naught is not. One, if f0 is not equals to one, then the integral of f n in the omega c is to zero. So, this for you to prove this, you need this, this lemma. So it's uh the proof for the proof for for this is here. Is here. I'm not going to go through it. So, this is the the proof. And then the main theorem, we let C to be a compact hypergroup and D to be a discrete hypergroup. And let F n such that C unit D is mapped to a compact be a moment function sequence on the hypergroup joint C V D O K. Then we have the following possibility. We have the following possibilities. I mean, the restriction of F naught to C is not equal to 1, is an exponential. And then Fn restricted to C is a generalized moment function sequence on C. And also Fn restricted to DE or the restriction of F n to D E is equals to 0. For N equals to 0, 1, etc. and etc. Etc. The second one, we have the restriction of F naught on the compact case is equal to 1, and also the restriction of Fn on the compact case is constant to 0. For N equals to 1, 2, etc., etc. And also, Fn related to D is a generalized moment function sequence on D. I mean, the proof for the proof for The proof of this theorem is here. This is our main theorem. First of all, we need this exponential proof here. By the help of this exponential theorem here, we managed to come up with come up with the result for this theorem for this theorem which is here so I think I've already sent my my document you can see this online if you are interested and then the example for the example for the moment function The moment function on hypergroup join. First, we let first of all we let T to be a complex unit circle with a group operator of multiplication on the complex number, and we let n to be. And we let N to be uh oh sorry still on t on on uh on T T has to be T is a sorry T is a compact Euclidean topology and and then N we let N to be our shape-shaped hypergroup such that uh N has a discrete topology. A discrete topology. And then we have for this for n equals to n not equals to m, we have this equation here, which is the Chevy-Shev hypothetical structure. And then when you have, when you take n to be equals to N to be equals to n m to be cross to n, and then we're going to have a DC. So now this signal structure is simply this part. So this is our example on the hypergroup on the moment function. So the hypergroup, we have our unit circle here and we have our natural Natural number here, which is the which is our dispute case, and this guy here is our compact case. And then the identity in here has blown up to be a bigger identity, such that we have that bigger identity, it is in here, which is our identity. In here, which is our K here. So now we have a new hypergroup join. No, we have a new hypergroup which is called a hypergroup join. So this is basically the idea. First of all, we take the compact case and then we take the discrete case and then these enzymes are supposed to be satisfied. Satisfied. Most of the time, when you are proving, the isom that we do, the isom that we do consider is number three and a number four. Like, for example, when you are proving this theorem, we're focusing on enzymes number three and number four. So now, just to explain everything in short, those starting with an exponential, this we have to maybe try and understand this proof first, and then after understanding this proof, this will be. Understanding this proof, this will be very easy to understand because generally the hypergroup join part when Joet's paper when Joet introduced this concept or when he wrote his paper in this area. In this area, what she was focusing, it was this part. The media focus was this part. And then later on, after Joe's paper, I think Michael Voigt also wrote something on the hypercontroinant. And habit also roots something in this area. So, this is just basically what I wanted to talk to you about this afternoon. And then this same area, you can, I did try the exponential, or I did, I tried and I managed to prove the exponential function, exponential monomials on hypercomputer. Exponential monomials on hypercup joy and the functional equation on hypercup join and the moment function on hypercup joy. So I think there are still a lot of things that you can do with this concept of hyperbook dry. So that is it for today. Okay, thank you very much. Are there any questions or comments? From the Zoom audience? Actually, I have one question. So when you do all of these sort of functional equations, are you assuming a priori that these are commutative abelian hypotheses? To needed an abelian hypergroup? No. But, I mean, like the exponentiation question would certainly have a large kind of in the case of hypergroup, right? We do not assume that the compact case is quantitative or the descriptive case is commutative. So typically these equations would then lose a lot of information, right? Because if you try to exponentiate on something non-commutative, On something non-commutative, those are just some sort of characters, right? You lose much, I would guess. Yeah, yeah. I mean, if it was a compact group and you took only characters, you're losing the whole commit yourself. Yeah, because as you know, that for the new hyper group, which is the hypergroup drain for you. Which is the HAPA group for you to be commutative. First of all, discrete case and the compact type of group has to be commutative. So we do not assume the commutativity on that part when we're dealing with this concept. But then, like you are saying, I think you have an interesting point because if we do not If we do not if we do not consider competitivity, more especially on the compact case, and also a lot of information you might lose a lot of information on it. Yeah. Thank you. Are there additional questions? No, let's Let's thank our speaker again. Thank you. And our next talk is in about six minutes, I think.
