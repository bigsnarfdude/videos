invited to the blackboard to go first uh a teacher because my last name starts with a and ends with a so but it's uh it's okay i'm indeed really happy to speak here and thank you very much organizer for inviting me to this wonderful workshop full of very interesting talks according to the program and in such a fantastic place. Place. So I'd like to mention that part of these results are obtained jointly with Boris Rogan from Louisiana State University. So this is the title of my talk. And so the main object, the main subject of my talk is very well-known classical funk, sometimes it's called Funk-Minkowski or Funk-Minkowski Redden transform, which is well known. Radon transform, which is well known, which was invented by Paul Funck in 1911. But in 1904, Minkowski was first maybe who considered this transform. And how this transform is defined? Actually, a classical Fung transform deals with integration over intestine. Integration over intersection with hyperplanes. But in my talk, the dimension of the sections is going to be arbitrary, just from 1 to n minus 1. So the transform integrates functions, which are defined on the unit sphere in Rn in the following way. So what you do, you just take a k linear space in Rn, K between In Rn, k between 1 and less than n, you intersect your sphere by this k space and you obtain in the intersection k minus 1 dimensional sphere and you evaluate the integral. And this is the value of the Foun transform on k-space E. Of course, if If k equals l minus one, you can parameterize the sections by normal vectors and you can think of the image as a function on the sphere as well. Otherwise, it's much more convenient to view this transform which acting on the function on the sphere but taking value on the functions on the Gauss miner. So uh So uh this is the classical transform. So just uh very briefly uh what is known about this transform actually. It's very well studied. So first of all the kernel of this transform consists of odd functions. Each odd function obviously degrees to zero and vice versa. If all integrals are zero then the function is odd. Now if you got if you restrict this transform on even function Take this transform one even function, then this transform is one-to-one injection. And the image consists of all even functions. If k equals n minus one, and you regard the various function on the sphere. Now you can write inversion formula, very nice formula in integral 4, in closed 4. For example, this is how Helgeson's formula looks like. Looks like n equals 3 and k equals 2, it's hyperplace. And this is the inversion formula. Now this inversion formula provides you with the right inverse operator. So if you take a function, the Grassmannian, you apply this operator, and then you apply the fluid operator, you will get the initial function. So this is a right inverse. If you add Inverse. If you act by this operator from the left, then the situation is as follows. Take a function on the unit sphere, apply Foun transform, apply the inverse according to, for example, this formula, and what you get, you get the even part of your function. Okay? So you can reconstruct even function, even part of any continuous function from the Continuous function from the funct data and applying this inverse operator. Now, applications, very briefly. First of all, there are applications in medical imaging, a so-called Q-ball method in diffusion MRI. And that is applied in intercerian convex geometry. Due to this, I'm sorry. And due to Due to the following simple fact that if you integrate k minus first power of the radial function, then you will get the volume of intersection of intersection of your body with k-dimensional plane. So if you can invert fund transform then you can do something with intersection body problems. Okay and now closer to the subject of my talk. So recent several years people got interested in Years people got interested in the case when the center of your transform is not at the origin. So, instead of considering sections by linear subspace, you can fix a point in the ball and consider all k-dimensional affine planes through this point and ask the same question. So, more precisely, Now, the non-central Funk transform or shifted Funk transform is defined as follows. So, just a pick up point in Rn, it's not necessarily the point in the ball, it can be outside or on the sphere. And then the shifted Fun-transform center at this point is defined as follows. You consider the Grassmannian of all the affine Grassmannian, of all affine k. Many and of all a fine k-dimensional sum spaces containing the point A, like on this picture, where the point A is inside, and here is A is outside. And then you consider all k-dimensional fine cross-sections through this point. And you integrate over intersections with the unit sphere against the ellipse measure. The elliptic measure. And this is shifted from transform. Normalize the big measures. Probability measure or from Riemannian measurements. Just Riemannian measure. Just the big measure. Surface measure. Okay. Now, so this is the main object of my talk, actually. So what are the questions? What the equations are typical questions for integral geometry? First of all, what is the kernel of this transform? And what is the range of this? What is the range of this transform? And now, what on which subspaces this transform is injective? And if you know where this transform is injective, how to invert it without write the inversion formula. Or just to suggest a procedure or algorithm. And then a little bit more delicate question. The point is that we will see that. That we will see that actually, in most cases, the transform is not injective. There is non-trivial kernel. The question is: how to reconstruct your function from fun data? And the natural idea seems to be the following. Instead of one transform, take two transforms with two different centers. And try to reconstruct the function from two or three or more from multiple full transforms. If it is possible, always. Always or not always, in which case it is not possible and when it is possible. And if the kernel, the intersection of kernels is trivial, then how to reconstruct your function. Okay, so now a brief review of what did we know before recently. First of all, if the center is located on the sphere, Is located on the sphere. So you consider all cross-sections through the planes going through the fixed boundary point. Then the transform is injective. It was known. So here are the authors. Just first it was done for N equals 3 and then it was done by Helgerson in 2011. So it is injective. Now for the Now uh for the interior circuit you mean injective for given functions uh no for all two No for inner for interior center I think he was the first to consider the entire problem with shifted center I mean the unit on sound Circle. I mean, the Jonathan Salman, young Israeli mathematician, he considered just simplistic n equals 3 and intersections with hyperplanes. He used stereographic projection to the plane. He didn't describe the corner or whatever, but what he did under certain restrictions on the support, he proved that this is injection. I mean, this this this uh condition just kills the the kernel. The kernel. Then for hyperplanes, Q miles, he just wrote an inversion formula, similar to one in the classical case. And then Rubin did the Quilma did first for N equals three, and then they simultaneously they treated the arbitrary dimension, but K equ uh equals N minus one. So you deal with hyperplanes. So, you deal with hyperplanes. What they did, they constructed a special transformation of the ball which allows you to link the shifty transform and the classical one. This transformation transforms one transform to another one and changes the the center. The nature of this transform was not that clear. It was just uh done by by And done by hands, I mean, just certain transformation, and indeed it worked. And of course, this link between non-shifted, central and non-central transforms gives you a possibility to write in Persian form. But what eluded from attention that actually there is a group behind all the programs. So actually, the So actually the transform they wrote comes from a certain group which acts transitively on the ball. And this is what I'm going to explain now. So group action on the ball is behind all the problem. And actually the problem, this problem is a shifted center is the problem. The center uh is related to hyperbole uh structure on the real ball. On the real wall is a hyperbole space. So let me explain briefly what is the groove which is inside the problem, what is the point of view I'm going to explain. As far as I know, it is called Cayley model of hyperbolic space. Cayley model of hyperbolic space. What you do is the following. Consider the Lorentz group. It's just a pseudo-unitary group which preserves, consists of all unit transformations, preserving this quadratic form. Okay, and then what you can do if you take the section, so this quadric, of course, an error, n minus, n plus one. So if you So if you take x0 equals 1, then you will get a sphere and the ball can be identified with the intersection of the solid light pole with the plane x0 equals 1. Now, this group acts on the family of straight lines through the origin, and therefore it acts on this interception. Perception. And then you will get a transformation group of your bow. So this group is SON1 and it acts on the real ball. Okay, and what is important to us, that this group, this is automorphism group. The action is transitive. And what is important to us is that it preserves the fine structure. So it moves the fine sections to a fine sections, planes to planes. Planes, two plates of the same dimension. And which is just relevant to our problem. And now, what is the strategy? First of all, let me explain how does it work for the interior center. So, what you can do, you can move the center A to the origin by some transformation phi A. And phi this transformation phi A uh can be written explicitly. Uh can be written explicitly. So, and this transformation delivers link between F A and F zero, non-central, non-central function. Now for the external center F B, where B is outside of the ball, you do the following. You want to move B to the infinity. How can it be done? So just consider the inverse point, V star, which point, B star, which is B over mod B norm B square. Okay, this is just inversion. And then move the point B star to the origin. Then the point P goes to infinity because the inversion of infinity is just the origin. So in other words, you consider that the transformation phi B star. That transformation phi B star, I will write the explicit formula for this transformation, which moves B star to the origin and B itself to infinity. So what happens, you see, it can be explained as follows. This is exterior center. This is a bunch of k planes through P. If you move P to the infinity, then the bunch of the family of this k plus. The family of these k planes just becomes the family of parallel sections with the orthogonal vector B. This is what's going on. Okay? And now the key calculation, if you went, because we need to link transforms, central and non-central, the key calculation is, of course, Is of course you have to understand how what is transformation of integration measures. So you have to compute corresponding Jeepels in the intersections because all the time you integrate with respect to the big measure. And so this is the program of the strategy which was realized. So and here are the results. The results. So, this is the result joint with Boris Rubin, myself. So, this is the relation between non-central and central Foun transforms for the case of interior center. Now, and this is the relation for exterior center. Now, what is intertwining operator which is denoted by MA? By NA. It looks like this. So this is substitution, this Schultz transformation, which is written here, I will show later. And this is the wave function. And the transformation VA, the automorphism Phi A, is given by this form of. So everything is explicit. Okay? And then once now, also, what is phi? phi capital phi capital is just induced operator on the Gross mineral, which is induced by automorphism phi small A. Phi A is isometry of the pole. Yes, it's isometry. Moreover, it's involution. Here. Phi A twice just A. I mean, just identity. 0 to A and A to 0. Composition V A with V A is identical. Okay, so of course, once we have intertwining relations, you can immediately describe the kernel. Because the kernel for the classical case is known. So what is the description of the kernel? First of all, we know First of all, uh we know that the kernel for the classical transform consists of odd functions and the kernel for uh the transform with parallel sections consists of odd functions with respect to reflections around the plane which are orthogonal to B. So, in both cases, uh kernel are well described and uh it uh leads to description of the kernel of the shifted transform. The shifted transform. So it looks like this. So take the point, any arbitrary point in Rn, which is not in the sphere, because with the sphere everything is clear. It's injection. Okay, now then the kernel of the non-central transform center at A consists of functions which satisfy this relation, where the weight function rho A is given by this formula. Given by this formula and the tau A symmetry is given by this formula. Tau A is a transformation of the sphere which can be explained in geometric terms. It's very easy. So suppose consider the case of interior center. So how tau A works. So take X and consider the straight lanes through X and A and the second intersection point. And the second intersection point with the sphere is tau A. It's just symmetry around A. So the points xA and tau AX belong to the same straight line and X and Tau A X points up on the unisphere. So this is the symmetry tau A. Now, then you can write inversion for both. So the right inverse operator So the right inverse operator is given by this. Now everything here is written, can be written explicitly. MA was given before, tau A also, there is a formula, rho A also. And then, so you can write, so this is inner separator for the case of exterior center. In this case, you deal with the transformation over parallel. Parallel planes, which was defined before. And now, this is important. If you act by the inverse operator from the left, what's going on? So you can reconstruct the even part with respect to point B. What does it mean? So if you take function F on the unit sphere, apply non-central Fourier transform, or F B out here. This is the interior center. Here. This is the interior center. The formulas are the same. Just apply F A, then apply the inverse operator, and what you get, you will get such a function, which we call A even part of A. And so that's that's the end of the story with the shifted transform. So everything uh is uh the range also can be described, I just don't want don't have time for this. I don't have time for this. Now, what's more interesting part of my talk is a multiple function transform. So, suppose you have you consider a set of func data, and you ask when the intersection is zero. When the set of funct data determines your function uniquely. And so, the motivation is that you want to reconstruct your function from funct data. function from funct data. If one single funct data is not another, then why not today? Multiple funct data. So of course we start with two points. So you have two non-central functions forms. So and here is the result. First of all I have to define some billiard-like self-mapping contingent sphere. It works like this. works like this. So it's a composition of two symmetries. So this Mappian is defined like this. I'm sorry, one can I put something wrong? So take X and go through the point A till you intersect the unit sphere. Then start from this point and go the direction B till this next intersection is the unit sphere. And this is Tx. So it's just like Tx. So it's just like it's like the V, you know, you go this way and then this way. This is Tx. And so, and here is the result. First of all, so I will formulate this theorem in three equivalent forms. The first one is group theoretical form. In algebraic terms, the answer is a Prayer terms, the answer is as follows. Given two points A and B, the following conditions are two centers, IQ. The first one, the pair transform is injected, which means that intersection of the kernels is zero. The second one, the group generated by the reflections tau A and tau B is uh infinite. And the third one, the uh this Billiard V mapping, uh is non-periodic. Uh is non-periodic. Uh this is uh necessary sufficient definitions. Now on the analytic formulation. Given A, B, define such a number. And then if this number is real, it can be actually it can be it's not necessary. can be it's not necessarily real because if this expression if one of the centers outside and second the second was in inside it's negative so it's uh imaginary and and so if it is real and between minus one and one then consider our cosine of this uh number and divide by pi it it is called rotation number and the answer is as follows at the intersection of two non-central transcripts Of two non-central transforms is zero if and only if one of the volume conditions is fulfilled. Either this number theta AB is either imaginary or real, but with models greater than 1 outside of the interval minus 1, 1. And if it is real and belongs. If it is real and belongs to the interval minus one, then the rotation number is irrational. That's if and only if. In other words, the pair shifted Funk transform fails to be injective if and only if the rotation number is defined and real and rational. And now geometric formulation. Uh so the part where Per transform is injective if and only, first of all, the inner product A and B is not one. If it is one, it's the kernel scenario. And in geometric terms, the second condition is a forward. There are two cases. Either the straight line which joins two centers doesn't meet the unit sphere, then you have rejected. sphere, then you have rejectivity. Or I mean meets the does meet the inertial sphere, then you have injectivity. If not, if it is the joint with the sphere, then the rational number, the rotational number must be irrational. Now, constructing the reconstruction, very briefly. So if you have two funct data, you can From data, you can reconstruct A even part and B even part, as I said. And then you can substitute from one expression, express F and substitute in the second one. Then you will get such a relation. Can't you see? Then you can iterate this relation. And what you get, H plus W. What is W? W is just composition of two operators, and each one is WH. And each one is WA is this one, and WB is this expression. Okay? Then you will get F equals H plus W. Then you repeat again and again and again, and you will get the formal series. And the question is, of course, if this series is formal or it converges in some sense. Here is the answer. So we consider the case when k equals 1, k greater than 1, the intersections just don't work. Than one. The intersections just not by straight lines. Okay? Then, in the case of, I call it stable injectivity when the straight line joining the two centers intersect the sphere. And this Neumann series converges in LP with P in this range. Moreover, what is interesting is that once it converges for this exponent, the function is zero. For this exponent, the function is zero. So it's it's it's the it's o all the time diverges for this exponent. Okay, so and in the case when the straight line doesn't intersect the unit sphere, the conversion should be understanding in Cesarea sense because some ergodicity is behind it. And one just maybe one second, the strategy of the program. The strategy of the proof. First of all, as I said, so if you if the function belongs to the common uh kernel, then it satisfies two conditions, A evenness and b evenis. Substitute one condition into another one. You will get such a condition, where a rho is a new function. So you deal with automorphic functions on the unit sphere. Automorphic with respect to the mapping t. You can check that rho is a character of this. A character of this action of this group, of this transform. And now the size, so now we see that the kernel is subspace of the space of automorphic functions. Now the size of the kernel depends on the size of the space of automorphic functions. So we are led to the study of dynamics of this method on the unit sphere. Now, how these dynamics can be understood. Can be understood. First of all, the first observation is that all the time this billard acts just on the two-dimensional planes. You never leave the two-dimensional planes through X, A, and V. All the time all the reflections are there. So you can consider the dynamics in each two-dimensional cross-section. And then, of course, the question is: what's going on? Of course, the question is what's going on with orbits. Okay? Now, after scaling of this section, which is a disk and capsification, it's interesting that our mapping becomes just a mirror transformation, just from the SL to C. Okay, and we know that the dynamics, dynamics in SL to C is well studied, it depends on the trace. Trace of your transform and rotation number. So there is a classification of these types. There are four types, hyperbolic, parabolic, oxygen, and elliptic. So everything can be studied. So the situation, I mean, you have to study fixed points, repairing attractive, and so on. So all this work should be done. And finally, you will. And finally, you will get the transfer. And this is just the end, just the types of the dynamics. So these five types correspond to injective player of full transforms. So when two centers are outside, you deal with hyperbolic type. As well as your centers, both of them are inside. This is hyperbolic type of your dynamics of this magnetine. Dynamics of this magnitude. Now, if this line changes this unit sphere, it's parabolic type. If one of the centers is inside, the second one is outside, it's axadronic type. And in this case, this is only case when you can have non-injectivity. So now in this situation, everything depends on the rotation number. So if the rotation number is rational occupied, rational occupy, the kernel is the common kernel is non-trivial. If it is a rational, it is trivial, you have ejectivity. And that's that's it. Well, there are open questions for more than two transforms. It is related to the study of paxilator groups, but I have no time to thank you very much. Any questions? Could you please show open questions? Could you please show open questions? Okay, thank you very much. Well, you see, suppose you have S transforms, okay? So you want to understand when the intersection is non-zero, yet. Now, consider the group. Now, consider the group which is generated by these reflections around all the centers. Now, you see, if at least two generators generate group, I mean, generate infinite group, then you have rejectivity. So, two is enough. Therefore, the kernel is non-trivial if and only if these relations are fulfilled. Why? Because this symmetry involutions is clear, there's a symmetry. And this is T exactly, you see? This is T, this composition of two symmetries, must be periodic. And these two relations exactly defined so-called formal pacceter group. So which says. So, which says that if the kernel is non-zero, then the group generated by these translations must be capseter group. And the question is the converse is true. Suppose there's a certain capseter group, which means that each subgroup generated by two generators is finite. It doesn't imply that there is a common non-trivial curve. Material curve. Because in this situation, the dynamic of this bidder is very complicated. It goes in all directions, you see. Thank you very much. We don't have time for other questions, so let's then be very and we'll resume in in in a minute.
