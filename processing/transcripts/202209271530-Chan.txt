And so, what I want to talk about today concerns the arithmetic case. So, this is something that I guess when we started looking at this, we thought perhaps there wouldn't be too much interesting when you go to arithmetic surfaces. But hopefully, I can convince you that that's not the case, that there's some interesting new phenomena that's come up, arise. So, some of the material here may sound a little bit old-hat, but I'm hoping in the second half I can show you that some rather interesting. Second half, I can show you that some rather interesting phenomena does arise. Okay, so also if you have any questions, just ask me. I'm not too sure whether I can work out how the chat is and whether I can see that, but yeah, just ask me. Okay, so let me just maybe, I'm going to have to put my tablet down. So I'm going to just switch off my video feed so that you don't stare at the top of my head. Okay. So what are the objects that So, what are the objects of interest here? So, as I said, this is about birational study of non-commutative geometric objects. And we want to look at things which are fairly close to the commutative case. So, we're going to start here with something I'm going to call an arithmetic surface. It's not the usual term for it. My usual notation for that will be x. And well, when that's going to be affine, my notation will be. affine my notation will be for that will be just spec r so r is going to be usually either the corner ring of an affine arithmetic surface or x will be arithmetic surface and there's a lot of adjectives that go with that so um so it's basically going to be something that's nice so a nice will be normal it'll be integral surface of course two-dimensional I want excellent so I can do resolution of singularities and just some technolog And just some technical things, it has to be quasi-projective over an Ethereum affine scheme. And the arithmetic bit here, that's the most important thing that's kind of should be mentioned. I just mean here that the residue fields, I want them all to be finite residue fields. So that's the main sort of hypothesis that I want to assert here, the finiteness of the residue fields. Fields. Just for notation, I'm going to let the function field of this arithmetic surface be denoted by k. And basically, the non-commutative object that I want to put here is just some coherent sheaf of algebras a, which is an order on x. So usually I'll insist that that's maximal. More general, it will be something called normal, and I'll say what they are. So, firstly, let me just say what. What they are. So, firstly, let me just say what an order means here. Okay, so for an order, I just mean here means a torsion-free coherent sheaf of algebras on X. And if it's a cohesion, a torsion-free coherent sheaf of algebras on X. Torsion-free coherent sheaf of algebras on X, we can go to the generic point. So look generically here. So we take this A, we can tensor over this X with the function field of X. This is going to be is a central simple K algebra. So this is really about birational. So, this is really about birational geometry. And the way I want to think about this is that I want to think of this as being like a non-commutative function field, okay, a central simple K-algebra as being a non-commuter function field. And I want to globalize it along x. And so the way I want to globalize it along x is I want to think of this coherent sheaf of algebras A on this X. When you pick models, When you pick models, normally you want them to be rather nice. So, I guess in the commutative case, you pick normal schemes with a certain function field. Okay, so in this case, the analog of that will be a maximal order. So, that just means that if you fix this and you look at orders inside there, it's maximal with respect to inclusion. More generally, we'll insist on this normal condition here, which will be not so critical for this talk, but it's part of the general theory. Normal here. Theory, and normal here just means that firstly, so it should be kind of a generalization to a non-commutative case of size size criterion for normality. So in this case, the condition S2 will just correspond to the fact that A is reflexive. And then you also want regular in co-dimension one. So what we're going to do is we're going to look in co-dimension one by looking at all the localizations. So in this case, So, in this case, we're on a surface, so at irreducible curves. A C. So, basically, you want this to be like a discrete valuation ring, okay, to be regular in code dimension one. So, the way we'll do that is that the radical of this is going to basically be a principle, and in this case, because it's non-commutative. It's non-commutative. It's just going to be generated by a normal element, by a single normal element. Okay, so maybe that's the best way to say it. So equals pi C A C, which is also AC pi C for some pi C. Okay, so unfortunately, we have to put a few more restrictions on this to study these objects. These objects. So, the restrictions that we put on this will be firstly that with this central simple algebra, you can talk about its index. We want this index, I'll always denote with this P here because it's going to be prime. And it also has to be co-prime to all the residue characteristics. And in fact, I'll furthermore want existence of enough roots of unity. So, enough roots of unity just means I want pth roots of unity here, primitive pth roots. Pth roots of unity here, primitive pth roots of unity here. So that'll be denoted by omega. Okay, so they're the objects of interest, these orders or these certain sheaves of algebras on this X. Okay, so if you don't play around with this sort of thing much, I guess this is the only example that you need to know. And I guess we'll start with the classic construction of central simple algebras, which is the cyclic algebra, and we'll just try to globalize that, okay? Try to globalize that. Okay. So, what we're going to start with is consider here. So, when you construct a cyclic algebra, you need a cyclic field extension, and we want to globalize that to this. Let's just do it in the affine case. So, the affine case here, we'll look at spec R. So, we'll have a cyclic extension like this. So, cyclic extension of arithmetic surfaces. Of arithmetic surfaces. And since it's a cyclic extension, we can talk about its Gabo group. And that's going to be generated by a single element. And I just want to give it a name here, sigma. And then consider also, consider, then we're just going to pick a join. going to pick adjoin a pth root of something consider a an element of R here then then suppose that then what you can do is you can form the cyclic algebra I'm going to use a symbol here I'm going to use a symbol here, S-R-A. That's going to be defined to be. Well, basically, what you do is you take this S and you join in a certain way, a pth root of this A. That's going to be my Z. But of course, you want something non-commutative, so you make the Z skew commute by this Galois action. Okay, so the Z commutes through the elements of S. Commutes through the elements of S via this Galois action. And so I guess this so if if so what should I say here if S prime equals R adjoin Adjoin. So basically, you're going to get two cyclic covers. So the other one is this one here. So maybe I'll just write let here. So if this is arithmetic surface, so it's nice as well. And you can look at both S of R of R of S over R and S prime over R have distinct ramification curves, then this cyclic algebra as over R A is normal order. So that's the type of example that I'm looking at. Okay, so it's a simple start. Okay, so this is simple cyclic algebra, and you can just restrict your, if you don't play around with these sorts of things, restrict yourself to thinking about this type of rather simple algebra. That's all that we'll need. Okay, so how do we study things like this? So the point is that we have generically a central simple algebra. So in other words, when we globalize along X, we should get something which is generically Azumaya. And so the way we'll study it is via looking at where it fails to be azumayay. Looking at where it fails to be as you might. So that's what we call ramification of the order. Okay, so this ramification we want to look at where it fails to be as you might in codimension one. So what we'll do is we're going to look locally at irreducible curves C on our arithmetic surface X. Okay, so if you look there, so what does being as you might mean? That just means that you want it to be a central. Be a central simple algebra, so it should be a central simple algebra at all the at every point, and in particular at the generic point of such a curve. So we'll look at the generic point of such a curve, and it will have some, this curve here, it will have some residue field at that generic point. And you can restrict your attention to that. And the way we'll do that is we'll just localize our order A there, and then we'll just mod out by the radar. And then we'll just mod out by the radical. And if it's as you might, then you'll get a central simple algebra over this kappa of c. And if it fails to be as you might, there's just a fact about normal orders that I don't want to go into here about the structure of what that will look like. And it's quite constrained, what that will look like. And the point is that there's a jump, there's an increase in the size of the center. Increase in the size of the center of this when it fails to be azumire. Okay, so this is what we refer to as ramification. Okay, and what it turned out to be is that when you look at the center of this, so instead of being a central simple over kappa of C, this the center of this, I'll call it kappa tilde of C, is now a product of isomorphic copies of cyclic field extensions of this residue field. So, in particular, it itself is. So, in particular, it itself is a cyclic extension of this kappa of C, although it may be semi-simple. So, it basically has the form, so it's like kappa prime cross kappa prime. Okay, some number of copies of that. That's the type of thing that it has. So, that's the first thing is that there may be places where. are there may be places where it fails to be um as you may where there is a change in the the this um this the center of this ac mod the radical of ac and the other thing is that there's actually extra structure on this um so this is a cyclic field extension and it actually comes with a um a chosen uh generator of the galois group Generator of the Galois group. Okay, so let me just explain a little bit about how that is. So, this remember I said with normal orders, this radical of ACS principle, say generated by pi C and conjugation by pi C gives chosen generator of Of the Galois group of this kappa tilde of C over kappa of C. We won't use it too much, but the main thing to realize from this is that there is some this is actually a cyclic extension that also comes with this chosen element of the Galois group. So just some more terms. So, just some more terminology that comes with this. So, the other thing is that you've got this cyclic extension of this residue field at the generic point of this curve. So, of course, you can try to look at a normalization of that. And you've also got the curve downstairs. So, basically, you can talk about, well, let's look at this curve downstairs, the C as our global curve. Okay. And then you can look at its normalization in this capital. Normalization in this capital tilde of C, so it could be some copies, and then that's some sort of extension, some sort of morphism of curves, and it may or may not ramify. So that gives you, so you can talk about the ramification of these curves. So this up here, upstairs here, you may Here, you may get a curve like that in the normalization of this curve here in capital of C up here, and that may ramify, and that's called secondary ramification. So, we can also talk about secondary ramification. Okay, so hopefully, the following definition makes sense and is a way. Definition makes sense and is a way to measure how far this order fails to be at an Asium algebra along various curves. So we say that A ramifies along C with ramification index E C. So, of course, So, of course, you have this cap of C and you have this cyclic extension. And if they're equal, then it's going to be as you may are. But if they're not, then you get a number that's bigger than one. And we call that the ramification index. So when this is bigger than one, okay, we say that A ramifies along C and that also the amount And that also the amount to measure that, we have this ramification index. And it's just the degree of this extension, this cyclic extension here. And well, I guess one way to try to understand this a little bit in the simple example of the cyclic algebra that I gave before. Okay, so remember, basically, this is built up of a cyclic extension S over R, and also we have another extension where we basically are joining. Where we basically adjoin a pth root of this A, and these two cyclic extensions, they skew commute. So there's a Galois action on that, and the pth root of A skew commutes through the S via this Galois action. This is going to be Asume, I guess, hopefully it's fairly clear from the construction of cyclic algebras. You can look at closed points, and this will be Asume wherever. Wherever S over R, and when you look at this other cyclic extension where you adjoin this pth root of A are unramified. Okay, so maybe it's good to have a little look at an example so that we can see what's going on and to see the types. See what's going on and to see the types of situations that I'm interested in. So, the example that I want to go here give here is of an arithmetic nature. So, we're going to start with the Z L hat, the L addict integer. So, L is going to be some prime, L L prime, and it doesn't equal, does not equal the fixed. The fixed prime, that's the index of my central simple algebra here. I want to make sure that I have enough roots of unity. So remember, omega was my pth root of unity. So I'm going to throw that in there. And so let's O just be the integral closure of the Z hat L inside this Q L hat omega. So we should be thinking of that as a complete local neighborhood of the spec of a finite field. So maybe we think of So, maybe we think of that as something like this here. There's a curve here. And then for my actual x, I want something that's two-dimensional. So, I'll just take this O, which I'll write like this, and I'll join a single variable. Okay, so X like that. So, the type of thing that I'm looking at is like that. There's my X. Okay, so the example, I just want to give an example. I just want to give an example of a symbol here. So I need to give a cyclic extension of this. So the cyclic extension I'll give here is S over R. Maybe let's just write S. We know what R is. It's just going to be R, and I'm just going to join an Z equals a pth root of X. Okay, so it's going to be ramified on such that. So it's going to be ramified on so this is ramified on C and nowhere else. Okay. And then A, what I'm going to pick for A, A is going to be an element of this discrete valuation ring here. And so in particular, also inside this R here. And I'm just going to make it some unit inside there. And so, of course. And so, of course, when you join a P3 of this, it's going to be A tau. And so, the only ramification, so we can look at A equals this symbol, S over R A, it's going to be unramified except along C. And let's just see what the ramification there is. So, ramification So, ramification. So, what do you want to do? You want to basically look at so let's call it EC. Okay, so that's going to be some degree of some cyclic extension. So, what's the cyclic extension? So, you look at kappa of C here. So, the kappa of C here. So, the kappa of C here is just you look at the residue field along C. I should mark that out properly as that's where X is equal to zero. So that's my C here. And when I look at the residue field there, I just have I quotient out by this x equals zero. I get this O here and I look at the Get this O here, and I'll look at the fraction field. So I'll get this Q L hat X, the omega. And then here I'll have a Q L hat omega will be some extension here. And what do I need to do in that extension? So basically, I look at this order. Extension. So basically, I look at this order. When I look at the order, what I'll have is I'll have all of s inside here. And I want to basically kill off this x equals zero. So since z is nilpotent modulo, this x, I kill off the z. So I'm left with this, basically this O here. And I've also got adjoined a pth root of A. So I've basically just adjoined this pth root of A. So essentially, the extension that I get is it comes from having adjoined this. It comes from having adjoined this pth root of A. Okay, so that could give you something non-trivial along here. Okay, so that's the type of example that we can get and that we've been playing around with. Any questions before I keep going? Okay. So, okay, so that's the way that we're going to study These orders is via the ramification. And the key point is to say, well, in the birational geometry of surfaces, of course, we focus on the smooth ones. And one of the things that Colin and I realized is that if you want to go non-commutative, the correct way to do this is via the minimal model program and to mimic the definition of a terminal that we see there. And so that's the approach that we'll take. Approach that we'll take, and as usual, this is going to require looking at the canonical analogs of the canonical bundle. So, in this case, we have something called the canonical divisor of this order. So, I'll denote this by KA. And this is going to be, at the end of the day, it's going to be some sort of divisor down, honest to goodness, a commutative thing, okay, divisor down on X. So, what's that? So, what we'll do. So, so what's that? So, what we'll do is, so remember, A is our order on X, it's an order on this arithmetic surface X. So, we have this Kx. So, basically, it's going to look a lot like a, what you call it, the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. Okay, so we have Kx plus the sum over certain curves, okay? So these are irreducible curves, and it's given by this formula that looks similar to what you get in the Riemann. Looks similar to what you get in the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. The coefficient is given by this one minus one on Ec. So remember, most of the time this order is going to be Asiumaya. So that means that these ECs for all but finitely many of these irreducible curves C, these ECs will be one. And so when you look at what this coefficient here is, this coefficient here is going to be zero. So for a Freitnite number, where it ramifies basically, Where it ramifies basically, you'll add in a certain number of those curves where it ramifies, and that number is given by this one minus this reciprocal of that ramification index. Okay, so in particular, it's going to be some fraction between half and it can get up to one, but not actually equal to one. So, if you're wondering where this comes from, there's a very good reason for it, just to let you know, if you haven't seen this before, what you This before. Well, you can actually define omega A as something which is a canonical bimodule for the actual order. Okay, you can do that since we've got a coherent sheaf of algebras A on X, the logical thing to do is to use the junction formula, which means that you just look at the sheaf harm of A into omega X. And if you use the theory of orders, you can say a lot about what that is. So you can, in fact, give it a formula for that in terms of the In terms of the ramification data. So that's basically what we have here in the sense that if you take this A by module here, omega A, you look at its p tensor power, then it's actually just going to be A tensor, something from downstairs on X, something commutative, and that's OX PKA. So if you kind of just take the pth root of this equation here, you'll get this here. Okay, so that's where it comes from. So this isomorphism here is only in codimension. Isomorphism here is only in codimension one, but I guess here we're just looking at the canonical device. That's all we're going to look at. Okay, so what's the definition that we want? Just to be brief about that. Oh, did something funny happen to the screen? Let me just try to fix it. Maybe I'll go forwards and backwards. Yeah, okay, that seemed to fix it. Okay. Okay, that seemed to fix it. Okay, so what's the definition of terminal? So we want an analog of what it means to be smooth here for an order. This order A is on this X. And just to, if you're not familiar with the minimal model program, I guess one way to kind of think of it is that, well, if you have some differential form down on X, okay, and you can talk about it nicely when this is smooth, you should pull back to something which is a differential form on Y. On y, and there shouldn't be any poles for that differential form. So, this is the type of idea that you have. Okay, so in this case, here we want to say we can pull back this K upstairs. Okay, and the pullback of this A upstairs, it's going to be a little bit funny. I'm going to have to define it later. When we pull back this A up to this Y, okay, so here Y is just some proper birational map, okay. Okay, I'm going to have to define this F plus A a little bit later. What you basically want is that this K for this pullback normal order is going to be of the form F upper star K A plus there'll be some exceptionals here, so some A I E I Uh where B I are exceptionals and the AI are positive okay and so the only thing that's missing from this definition um so yeah so you want this always to be true and the only thing missing from this definition is I have to define what is this F plus A okay this F plus A here so so that we can talk about normal orders and rapid About normal orders and ramification and all that sort of stuff, this f plus a will be a normal order, and you may think, well, why don't you just use the pullback of a? So that's certainly something, and you could use that, but we don't. That's not the intelligent thing, it turns out. So, what we want it to be is the following. Certainly, most of the time, you might expect this f plus a to equal f star a. Okay, so f. Okay, so F plus A equals F star A on non-exceptional curves. But on exceptional curves, but on exceptional curves, F plus A is, so there's a choice here is any maximal or Maximal order containing f upper star A along exceptional curves. Okay, so this is a normal order, it's reflexive. Okay, so we just need to define this locally on irreducible curves. Okay, so we can look at irreducible curves for the one. Uh, at irreducible curves for the ones where it's non-exceptional, okay, it's just going to be f upper star a, but unfortunately, we have to make it a little bit bigger along the or possibly make it a little bit bigger on exceptional curves. Those exceptional curves, you just make it, you pick some maximal order. Okay, so this is a little bit of choice that's involved there. Okay, so one of the theorems that Colin and I proved is that terminal resolutions exist. Terminal resolutions exist. Okay, so you can find some proper birational map such that this F plus A is going to be terminal. So that's one of the things that you want, remember, in the birational geometry of surfaces is you basically want a nice class of surfaces, the smooth ones. You want to say it's rich enough, so there are enough of them that you can resolve to them. And you want to say that they're nice. Okay, the class is small enough that they have some nice properties. So the first thing here is that they're rich enough that these terminal resolutions exist. These terminal resolutions exist. Okay, so let me go on to the first deviation from what we saw in the geometric case. And that's the following example of a terminal order where the center is singular. Okay, and it's actually going to be a Herzegovinchung singularity. And it comes from the easiest one to describe, this comes from a contraction of a minus p curve. So I think I'm probably going a little bit slower. So I'm going to probably draw more pictures. Probably draw more pictures rather than write things down. Okay, so we're going to start with basically some Hertz-Bruch-Jung singularity. So this is spec R, where R is hence or local. And let's suppose it's a Hertz-Bruch singularity in the sense that it comes from contraction of some minus P curve E. And this P is the prime of the. Of the index. Okay, so one of the things that we show is that in this case, you can find some S here which is regular. And this is a Mu P covering. And then when you have that, I guess you can blow up and you get a minus one curve up here. And so the actual order, so we need an order, and it's going to be an order on this R here. And what is Here, and what is the order that we're interested in here in this case? So, we're going to pick A is going to be A is going to be an element of R cross, but it's not a pth root. It's not a Pth power, rather. And then, what we're going to do is And then what we're going to do is we're just going to form from that symbol. Okay, so A is equal to S over R A. And I claim that this is actually, this is going to be terminal. Okay, so it's the center will be just R, but it's going to be terminal. And I guess the way to do that is let's call this Y. And we can just, I guess, I can't do the full. I guess I can't do the full proof of this, but let me say some words about why it's true. So let's look at this KY. Okay, and so here, yeah, okay. So this S to R, firstly, it's going to be unramified. It's going to be atal away from the single point. Okay, so this is kind of what you expect. Okay, so this is kind of what you expect from the theory of Hertz-Bruch-Hung singularities in the complex case. So there's no ramification in co-dimension one. So that's going to tell you that there's no ramification of this order. Okay, so it's unramified in co-dimension one. It's maybe, so to speak, ramified at this point. So one of the things that we have is this KA is actually just equal to K of this spec R. Spec R. Ky, what's happening with Ky? I guess you can write this as F upper star K of this. Let's call this X here, spec R as F upper star KX plus, and there's a single exceptional curve, and you can compute that it's 2p minus 1e. And I guess the easiest way to do this is you just take the dot product of both sides of this with E, and you get Ky dot E here. This dotted with E is zero. This dotted with E is zero. E squared is equal to minus P, so you can work this out. And then you use just the fact that you've got the junction formula. So to work out what ky dot e is. So this gives you the correct answer here. So I guess the other thing is that you need to look at what is this f plus a. Okay, this is the so you've got a which is downstairs on this x here, and you want to look at. X here, and you want to look at this f plus a up here, and that's quite easy. So basically, this is also going to be a cyclic algebra, and it's just basically given by this, again you adjoin this pth root of a, but now the cyclic extension is of this y, and it's given by this one here. And the point is that if you look at this, it's actually ramified along the minus one curve up here. Minus one curve up here. So it's actually ramified along the E. So this now has ramification. So this is K of F plus A is equal to Ky. But you've got 1 minus 1 on P E and now you can write down this K F plus A in terms of this F upper star of K A. star of Ka this is same as Kx so this is and if you work out what this is is f upper star of Ka which is f upper star of Kx and then when you put together this two minus P minus one and you throw that in what you get is you get one on P e which means and note here the key point is that this is positive right so the point is that this one minus So, the point is that this 1 minus 1 on p, it's big enough to cancel what you get here. Okay, and in fact, it still leaves it positive. So, this suggests, and in fact, we can show that from this calculation, it does actually show that this border on this Herzebook Jung singularities is actually terminal. Okay, so Okay, so um yeah, okay, so let me um say some things uh perhaps fairly briefly about um uh the classification of these terminal maximal these terminal orders, at least in this local case here. So suppose Rm now is the Hensel local arithmetic surface. I'll restrict my attention to maximal R orders, and unfortunately, we'll need the index of this p to be greater than 5. Since I'm running out of time, I'll just basically draw what's going on rather than saying too much about this. So, the possibilities are a lot of the time this R will be regular. Okay, so let me just fix my pen. This R is regular, and in that case, it can either be ramified on a single curve with multiplicity one or a normal crossing. And in this case, there'll be a secondary ramification. So, let me draw a So let me draw it like this. So either you have a single curve, so this was the example that I gave before, or you have a normal crossing. But you also have this Hertz-Bruchun singularity, which is the other situation. So in that case, you can take the minimal resolution. And what I mean by Hertz-Bruch-Jung singularity, I guess there are various definitions in the literature, but here there's a quite sort of simple one. These exceptional curves will form a string of P1s, okay. P1s. Okay. And there's an extra condition on that. And that is, if you look at the determinant of the following matrix, where you look at the negative self-intersections on the diagonal, and you put in minus one on the just above and below the diagonal, this determinant has to equal p. Okay, so in the case of Okay, so in the case of the previous slide, I just had a single one. So you just had a minus p curve, so you just had a single entry like this here. And so that had determinant p, but you have, in general, you could have longer strings of these Hertz-Bruch singularities, the longer string of these exceptional curves in the resolution of this Hertz-Bruch-Jung singularity. Okay, so this is the new interesting sort of case that we sort of. Interesting sort of case that we sort of like rather intrigued us when we found out about this. Okay, so it's nice that you can classify these. So this is, you can also classify the maximal orders, but I'm just writing the normal ones here. And the other thing that we want is that we want these terminal orders to be rather nice. So under the same hypothesis, how are these nice? So the first point is that in this case, these terminal maximal orders, actually this is also true in the normal case, the global dimension is always equal to two, so they're smoother. Is always equal to two, so they're smooth in that sense. And in fact, you can say more about them. So in this case here, A is isomorphic to a full matrix ring in delta, where delta is one of these cyclic algebras. And so there are two, remember, two cases. So either is either regular or it's some Hertz-Bruch-Jung singularity. And so let me just tell you. And so let me just tell you roughly what happens here. So then there exists a regular system of parameters uv inside, well it's inside M such that, well, the S is just going to be you adjoin to this R, some pth root of U. And A is either, well, there are two possibilities. Well, there are two possibilities. You have either normal crossing, in which case you have V, or it's a unit in R. So that was the other case. And then in this case here with the Hertz-Bruch-Jung singularity, it's similar to the example that I gave before. In this case, if R is a Hertz-Bruch-Jung singularity, then S. S is regular MUP cover of R a tau away from singularity and A is a unit here. So I guess the main takeaway from this is that these This is that these terminal orders in this arithmetic case, too, they have a very nice simple form. And I guess the key thing is that they are always smooth. So this geometric quantition always gives you smoothness like this. And we can say that they're a simple algebra, essentially, up to this full matrix algebra. And I can say what they are. That's the main content of this slide. Okay, so what else do you want to do in birational geometry of surfaces? Geometry of surfaces, you want to have Castel-Noevo contraction. And this is rather interesting how it pans out in this case here. So, firstly, let me just give you the definition of what it is for orders here. So, suppose you've got some order A on this X as usual, and you've got some map from X to this W, which contracts a single irreducible curve X E on there. And we'll say it's a Castel-Nurovo contraction of that terminal order A on X. Of that terminal order A on X, if the following holds. If KA dot E is negative, so you've got a K A negative curve, okay, and that's the type of thing that you like to contract in the minimal mod program. Then we'll say it's a Castel Nova contraction of terminal order. Then if you look at F lower star A, maybe you need to take the reflexive hull. Maybe you need to take a reflexive hull. I haven't thought too much about this here. Is a terminal order on W. Okay, so you can contract it in the sense that if you had terminal upstairs and you contracting this type of curve E here, you get something that's a terminal downstairs as well. Okay, so that's rather nice. And the theorem that we have here is that Is that if you're given a terminal order A, and here the index P is greater than five, and you're in this sort of like Hensel local situation, then there exists a unique Castel Nova contraction from f from um y to x okay uh with respect to well the pull you just pull back this a up says f plus of a and um well normally of course in in in commutative uh uh surface theory this is you know nothing much you can actually build this castel novo contraction um you just blow up a smooth You just blow up a smooth point on a surface, right? And then that's going to be something that's smooth upstairs, okay? And that gives you your Castelnova contraction. But here, actually, it's quite interesting what goes on. So let me just draw a picture of what goes on so that you can kind of see. Okay, and the picture is the following. So if you have this example where I'll just draw the example downstairs here, there's my X, and you've got just a ramification along a single curve, then it's got some castral nervous control. Then it's got some castral nervous contraction here. So there's the strict transform of that curve is here, like that. And you've also got some exceptional curve up here. But the point is that this upstairs is not smooth. There's actually a singular point here. It's a Hertzer Buchung singularity in this case. And the Herzegovin singularity is contraction of Of p minus one minus two curves. Okay, so that turns out to be the one that you have here. So I don't know how to sort of like construct this in a sort of like blowing up type of construction, but I can say that this is the one that is the right one. And so in a sense, if you want to blow up the order A, which has this ramification downstairs, okay, this is the one that you want. Okay, that's the correct notion of a. That's the correct notion of a blow-up. Okay, so I guess in the last three minutes, unfortunately, I'm getting a little out of time, so I have to go a little bit faster than I would like. I want to give you a very simple example because one of the things that we like to do in the minimal model program is we like to run the minimal model program. So I'm going to start with a certain order, and it's going to be the one where, kind of like the one that I've given you before. Okay, there's a single curve here, that's where you run from. Curve here. That's where your ramification is. It's the example I kind of gave you before. So it's going to be a cyclic algebra. So basically, what's my R? So this is my R is my spec R is going to be given by this X here. So I'm going to start with some prime L, which is congruent to one modulo three, just so that the roots of cube roots of unity are already there. So this is an example where the prime index P is equal to three. Is equal to three. And I'm just going to give you the example I had before. So, C, so I'm going to take this L Adic integers. I'm going to look at the affine line built under the polynomial algebra. And then I'm going to look at the order, which on that is just ramified along C equals zero. So it's going to be A equals S F R A, and A inside this units in the L addicts is going to be a non-cube. cube and that's uh that's given by well you take this ramified cover of this um this r here this z hat l w ramified along this c and the ramification there is best given by um this alpha you should think of this as a modulo the uh the cubes inside this uh the units in z hat uh l okay so i'm just going to write a little alpha here Going to write a little alpha here. Unfortunately, I won't can't get to explain this. So, what I want to do here is I just want to blow this up. Okay, so I'm going to blow this up once. So, now I have this curve here, and I have a minus one curve. And it turns out the ramification here will be given by an alpha. And there's also ramification up there as well on the exceptional curve. And now, what I want to do is I want to just blow this up again at this point. So, what will happen? Point. So, what will happen is you have an alpha here, and now what you get is this minus one curve will become a minus two curve. Now, you have a minus one curve here, and the ramification up on here becomes the one here, so that's given by an alpha. And the way the ramification works is the exceptional that you get on minus one, you multiply these two alphas to get alpha squared here. To get alpha squared here, and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to just blow up the two nodal points again and get something that's a lot bigger. Okay, so I'll have this here, I'll get a minus one curve here, and there's a minus three curve, and I'll get a minus so I'll have that one there, and then I'll have this one here, and this one here. So there'll be a minus one. So there'll be a minus one curve there, a minus one curve here. And then this minus one curve that with alpha squared on it will become a minus three curve. And those minus one curves are now unramified because you're going to basically multiply alpha by alpha squared. That's alpha cubed and that becomes a cube. So it turns out that that's going to be unramified. So let me just finish. Um, let me just finish up by saying that, um, well, we can do uh when we run the minimal model program, right, we can contract all these curves. So, this is actually um not terminal up here. So, so, or rather, yeah, it is terminal because where are the ramification curves? They're here, here, and here, and they don't intersect. So, that's going to be terminal. But when you run the minimal model program, rather than going around here, what happens is that remember, you can contract because p equals 3, this minus 3 curve. Contract because p equals 3 this minus 3 curve and this minus 3 curve. So the correct way to do this turns out that you contract the two minus 3 curves to get you a singularity here and this 3 curve to get you a singularity here. And then the next thing that you contract is you contract this one here. So this is a curve which has two Hertz-Bruch Jung singularities on it. You contract those ones down to something like this. Okay, and then the last one is you contract this curve here, and this is the type of caston-wide contraction that I gave on the last slide to get this one here. So, I guess that's the main thing. I wanted to show you this rather interesting example in this last slide. I guess I've gone over time, so thanks for your patience. I'll stop there. Any questions? I guess. If you look at your terminal order, like when can you say you get some sort of uniqueness of terminal orders if you work with the same burden of chromosome? I'm sorry, I missed one of the words. Can you just repeat the sentence again? I mean is there what are there nice criteria for when you get a unique terminal order if you work with some radio equivalents or something like this? Yeah, so I mean essentially you get yeah you do get uniqueness and this is the if I go back to that slide yeah and certainly you do get uniqueness. We haven't looked so much in the global context for this arithmetic case but I think Global context for this arithmetic case, but I think it should go through. And essentially, it's given by, let me show the right slide here, this one here. Okay, because as you can see here, this is fixed, right? You essentially just have four matrix algebras on this fixed delta. Okay, so up to merit of equivalence, they're going to be the same. Yeah, so you do have uniqueness. And I'm pretty sure that this also will hold globally as well. So if you're Globally as well. So, if you want to look on a global and not in this sort of hence or local setting, yeah. Any other questions? See any, so let's thank Daniel for this.
