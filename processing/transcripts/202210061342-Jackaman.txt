For the invitation to come to this workshop. It's been a great experience so far. I've learnt a lot and I'm especially appreciative of the location. This is a very beautiful place to visit. So I am going to talk today about using final elements to model physics transitions, but for semantic C liquid crystals. And the meaning of this talk really is to try and get some help from you from the experimental people. From you from experimental people as to what these parameters for these kind of models should be. It seems from kind of preliminary discussions this isn't so achievable, but hopefully, there's still some, hopefully you still have some interesting thoughts on what I'm going to present. So I should also acknowledge the Tron Moyne Foundation who covered my travel to this meeting. So thank you to them. So just to give you some context, there has been Context. There has been. Sorry, is there a question? No, okay. So, just to give some context, so studying 3D transitions numerically, there's been a lot of work on this for the pneumatic problem, and this has been done quite well. And recently, there's been a lot of interest in the semantic A case and developing this, and we've heard a lot about this at this workshop. At this workshop, not specific to the feeder transitions, but in general, there's been a lot of focus on semectic A. But here we're going to do something a bit different and focus on semectic C and see what we can say and how far we can get. So what is the setup that we are using? So we have solving for some vector A and C, where A is the layer normal and C is Layer normal and C is the orthogonal projection of the director N onto the symmetric plane. And in particular, we can describe the director here, N as being A cos theta plus C sine theta, where theta is our symmetric tilt angle. And typically in this talk, this is going to be pi over A. And here I've just stolen a figure. And here I've just stolen a figure from Stewart's book to kind of describe roughly what this is in a picture, because I think this is more understandable than just abstract words. But I should say that my starting point for this problem is minimizing this functional here, which we pulled out of the book of structure. Book of Stuart. And really, the way that we're thinking about this is: this is kind of somehow a more complicated version of the pneumatic case with a lot more complications. We now have nine elastic parameters and we have our A and we have our C, which we're solving for. We also have a B. We also have a B, which is just the curl of A and C. So we never need to really compute this. And A, B, and C are orthonormal, and A is curl-free. And this term here is our electric potential, which I'm going to talk about a bit later. So just a pause for a second, I realise I forgot to mention my collaborators. So this is kind of important. So this project is collaborative work with Scott and Tim. Feel lucky you might get a bit offended here. You're like, you might get a bit offended if I talk the whole way through and don't mention you. Or maybe you'll think this work is terrible. It's good he didn't mention us. Right, so. Sorry, B isn't a unit vector either? B is unitary, yeah. But we never we never actually we never actually actually see B. This is just we just we just define this through A I A A cross C. A cross C. So we're only dealing with A and C here. So because of this problem, it looks a bit like the pneumatic problem. We're going to try and come at this by making comparisons with the pneumatic case. So just to kind of give some context as to what I'm going to be doing, I am going to start by talking a little bit about how we solve, or how this problem has been solved in the pneumatic case, which Pneumatic case with respect to the director N. So when we're in the pneumatic case, we have our free energy given as follows. So I think probably you're all familiar with this, but this is somehow a simplified version of the synthetic C energy that I previously showed. And one important detail to add is that we have to... Is that we have to, so this R director has unit length, and in the diagnosically, we have to do this by adding a constraint. And this constraint is a Lagrange multiplier, which you heard about in the finite element tutorial of Patrick and Scott. So we have to introduce an additional term into our free energy in the form of a Lagoon multiplier to ensure that that N really is. That n really is unitary. So, yes, I should probably just point this out again. So, the terms here are somewhat similar to semantic C. They're not completely different. But the difference here is that our velocity constants are much nicer. And you'll see what I mean here a bit later. But the point is that in the pneumatic case, these are all on the same order of magnitude. Okay, so also if you want to interrupt me at any point to ask questions, please feel free. It's always better this way. So I'm now just going to briefly introduce the electric potential, probably the sort of sub that you're relatively familiar with. So this is the electric potential contribution to the free energy, where here our epsilons represent our electric. Represent our electric constants. And how are we going to actually enforce this electric potential? Well, it's going to be, well, how we so this is this is the contribution here to the energy that we're adding and then to actually make sure that something is happening we enforce boundary conditions to ensure that a electric code is being run across the domain. So on one boundary they we fix the electric potential fire just to be zero and on the other one to Just to be zero, and on the other one, to be fixed, it to be some constant voltage frequency. And if we assume that our A and our C don't have too much of an effect on the electric potential, then this is just going to behave linearly over our domain. So it's just going to increase from zero up to the voltage of V. And just to get these out of the way now, so I don't have to talk about them later, our electric parameters are as follows, and these parameters As follows, and these parameters are exactly what I used in the paper applying the same kind of idea for Matics. And I believe the parameters there are pulled from the paper of Friedrichs. If I read the references correctly, this is always the question. Okay, so now before I introduce what we're going to be doing in the selected case, I just want to say. In the semectic case, I just want to say what we're going to be doing, what has been done in the pneumatic case so that I can draw some parallels. So, here we're going to be solving for this director n directly, and we're going to be using the edge potential that I've just shown you with the Gauss multiplier enforcing the unit length. And the approach that we take is we extramize this energy functional omega, Omega multivated over the domain, where we are assuming, so n is going to be in some function space which is vectorial and contains functions which are h div and h curl. And what this means is that the divergence of n and the curl of n are going to be L2 functions. We're going to look for electric potential, which is in H1. Potential, which is in H1. So this is differentiable. So the derivative, the gradient of this is going to be in L2. And we're going to look for a Lagrange multiplier which is just in L2. And this is because we don't need to take any derivatives of the multiplier, the formulation. So, what does this mean when we start talking about finite element spaces? Well, we're going to be discretizing. We're going to be discretizing the director n with piecewise continuous quadratic functions. So, in annotation from Tuesday in the finite element tutorial, this is just going to be CG2 in each vector component of the solution. So, normally we'll have a three-dimensional director, so there'll be three different CG2 spaces. Electric potential is going to be discretized with just the space of quadratic continuous functions, so CG2 again, and the multiplier is just in L2, so we can discretize this with just the space of discontinuous constants. So this is dg0. So here we don't need to differentiate anything, and the natural space is L2, so we don't need to add continuity. Okay, are there any questions at this point? Is this all making sense? Good. I see nods from the numerical people. That is something. So what we're going to do in the semantic C case is follow the same kind of methodology, but with some caveats, which I will discuss now. So the first one is that we have a lot more constraints to enforce, so we need that. So, we need that the A and C and B are all orthonormal. So, this means that we need to enforce that C and A both have a unit length and that they are orthogonal to each other. So, here we have to introduce three Lagrange multipliers now instead of one. The problem is getting a bit bigger. And for the function spaces for A and for C, we're going to use the same. C, we're going to use the same function spaces as we did for the director n. So we're just going to be CG2 in each component. And this vector B, we don't need to explicitly discretize because of its uniquely defined just through taking the cross product of A and C. And again, for the electric potential, we're just going to use the CG2 space, so the same as in the MATIC case. And for the And for Lagrange multipliers now, we're going to use CG1. So this is the space of piecewise continuous linear functions. Why did you switch space for the Lagrange multipliers? Excellent question. I will now answer it. So this is purely implementational. So I can talk to you. If you ask me this question again, I can explain exactly why. But it really is just, it was just easier for us in practice to use. For us in practice to use CG1. It avoided rewriting some code, which we didn't really want to be rewriting. And it works as well. In practice, it works pretty much as well as DG0, even though DG0 is the more natural space. Just remind us what you can tell us. DG0 is just the space of discontinuous constant functions. So we've been. So it's constant over an element. Yes, exactly. Yes, exactly. And you're not really known before. There's no continuity. Yeah. So this is why this is the natural space for functions which are L2, because there's no notion of differentiating if we're not globally continuous. I made a big fuss about discontinuous being important, and then I don't use it. But maybe that's another aside. So just one more thing to talk about, which was covered again in the Fun Admin tutorial. So I'm just giving you a bit of So, I'm just giving you a bit of a refresher here. So, the way that we've pose this problem is through minimising a functional. But, of course, this isn't exactly what we do in practice. In practice, what we do is we say that the dependent variables, so our A, our C, our phi, and our multipliers, these are all our finite element trial functions. And then we actually form a problem that we solve by taking. Problem that we solve by taking the variational derivative with respect to test functions which are in the same space. And for anyone who's interested, this is equivalent, or this is equivalent to solving for the Euler Lagrange equations. At least, when I say equivalent, I mean it's solving the same problem. Not that you always get the same crystalization. Okay, so now I'm going to talk a bit about the domain that we're actually going. To talk a bit about the domain that we're actually going to be solving on. So, first of all, we're not solving in 3D, we're solving in 2D. So, we're making the assumption that in the Z direction, the solution is going to be constant. And the setup here, or the setup that we're working with here, is a wedge domain. And this wedge domain has some angle theta, which is between. Feta, which is between zero and pi by two. So it's given by this wedge here, if you assume that it has been completed. And it has a distance of one from the origin. And we are cutting off the bottom of this domain. So we're turning it into an annulus. And the reason for this is so that we can enforce the electric potential in a sensible way, as I will show you. As I will show you in a slide or two, I think. So, what do we do here? Well, we want to enforce some boundary conditions on this domain to make our problem more interesting than just recovering a trivial solution. So, for A and C, we enforce boundary conditions on this boundary here and this boundary here. So, we're not worrying too much about the So we're not worrying too much about these two boundaries. And for the electric potential phi, reinforce that it's zero on this boundary and that it's equal to this constant voltage V on this boundary. And this is exactly the reason why we've had to remove the bottom from this wedge, because if we have This wedge, because if we have a voltage of zero here and a voltage of B here, then we have a singularity in the corner. So we can't find it to be zero and b at the same time. Okay, and I should say something about how we're actually going to be meshing this domain. So one thing that we felt was quite important was that the number of elements which touch the top boundary and which touch the bottom boundary. And which touch the bottom boundary should be the same because we expect some dynamic behaviour going from left to right. So we've fixed the number of elements touching the top and the bottom to be the same as each other. And of course, this means that we have quite different resolution as we move throughout the annulus. And so as we move towards the origin, The origin, the identity of the elements is increasing. So we're getting more and more defined. And in practice, just to ensure that the meshes that we get are quite regular, so that we don't have any strangely stretched or missing information in the elements, we always mesh over a domain of pi by 8, which is what you're looking at now. And then if we have a much thinner domain, we'll remap the coordinates. So we always have, that is if we So we always have panelists free uh regular uh elements. Yes? Just to be sure that I understand the geometry. So electrify, even if it directs. So it it's not it's it's uh it's zero here and it's um it's uh it's uh it's a constant here. Okay. Any other questions? So I'm going to start by just. So I think I punished you quite a lot so far with lots of words and lots of technical terminology. So I'm going to show you some kind of picture on this slide. So something to look forward to. I don't promise that it's exciting, but it's something. So an important simplification that we're going to make is that we're going to fix our A. We're going to fix our A. So we're going to fix A to just to be pointing in the radial direction. So a unit vector pointing in the radial direction. And our reason for doing this isn't that we are forced to in some way, it's just to lower the computational complexity. Because this is quite a large and expensive problem to solve, and we're still working on solving it in the simpler case. But this is something that definitely can. Case. But this is something that definitely doesn't need to be fixed. It's just to make our life a bit easier here. So now let's say that we want to find all the possible solutions that we can get with this unit with A fixed where we don't have any electric potential. Well, we can do this, and we can do this thanks to deflation using this very nice software. Using this very nice software developed by Patrick. So, just pretty much stealing from Patrick's slides yesterday, what is deflation? Well, deflation lets us modify the non-linear system that we want to solve to avoid convergence in linear roots. And we do this by modification of the non-linear system with some deflation operator. And this deflation operator, so if the solution we're looking for is u, and we have a known solution. u and we have a known solution u1 then this deflation operator is just multiplication by 1 over u minus u1 squared plus 1 so if we're close to the known solution this term here blows up and if we're far from it it behaves roughly like one yeah so it has the same solution has it has the same solutions as the original system exclude excluding u1 okay so Okay, so here's the promised picture. So if we use deflation with no electric potential and we don't enforce any boundary conditions on C, these are the possible solutions for C. I think you can vaguely see it. So we can either have C pointing in the angular direction, so just the unit vector pointing in the angular direction. Are pointing in the angular direction, or we can have C pointing at us up out of the page. So these are the two possibilities that we get if we don't enforce any electric potential or any boundary conditions. So now I'm going to talk to you about parameters. And this is where things get a bit difficult. So our last, I don't want you to I don't want you to kind of go too deep into reading exactly what all of these terms are, but our elastic parameters are defined through combinations of A's, B's, and C's. And I'm sure that all of the experimentalists know this a lot better than I do, or at least maybe the meanings of these parameters better than I do. And these A's, B's, and C's in turn can be represented in terms of Can be represented in terms of A bars, B bars, and C bars, which are multiplied by the semicill angle. And these bar parameters have, I mean, I claim they have the approximate values of B1 is 1, B2 is 1, B3 is 1, and the rest of them are 0, excluding the A's. And this is. And this is one in the units of piconewtons. So this is 10 to the minus 12 Newtons, all these parameters. And as you can probably tell by how nice these parameters are, I have pulled them out of the hat, and I am crossing my fingers. So these parameters are all close to the acceptable range in the back of the book of Stuart. But this is all I can really say about my confidence. Is all I can really say about my confidence with this. So, one other thing that we know is that A11 bar plus A21 bar and A11 bar plus A21 bar are on the order of 10 to the 8. This is a pretty big difference. And this is measured in piconewtons. So these values here are given in the book of Stewart as ten to the minus four Newtons. Drewer as 10 to the minus 4 Newtons. But this is a pretty big problem. This is a very big difference. This is beyond most, well, it depends on what you're doing, but this is often beyond a solver tolerance. So this is the kind of main crux of the difficulty in this problem. Unless I'm misunderstanding something, which I hope I am, and really this value should just be one, and then everything is great. And I thank you for telling me. And I thank you for telling me this. Okay, so just to get kind of an idea. So I told you something about these A bars and B bars, but we haven't spoken about what these elastic temperatures actually are. So just to give some idea, I'm going to show a quick test case or quick experiment for how the free energy behaves and how these k constants change as we vary the symmetric tilt angle. Tilt angle. So there are three cases. The first case is when the two large quantities are both positive, and there we have a stable equilibrium angle and we have maximum at zero and pi by two. Alternatively, if the first is positive, the second is negative, and we're stable at theta is zero, at a maximum at pi by two. And the final case, if the first is negative and second is negative. If the first is negative and the second is positive, then we're stable at pi by 2 and we have a maximum at 0. So we're most interested here in the first case, but I just wanted to display all cases to you to show you that what we're obtaining in our functional is what we expect to obtain. We're not getting something completely crazy. Okay, so let's take a quick look at the parameter values that we get if we just plug these into our functional. And I think this. Are functional, and I think this has come out a little bit small. This is maybe a bit hard to read the axis of this plot, but I'll tell you the size of it, so don't worry too much. So if we're in case one, then we have our free energy in black here. So we do have maxima at pi by two and at zero, and we have a minima at And we have a minima at pi by 4 in this case. And the terms k5 and k6 are significant. These are the biggest. And they cancel each other out at pi by 2. And just to tell you the scale of this, so this is on the scale of 10 to the power of 8. So these are very big constants, and the remainder of the constants are very small. And equivalently, if we're in the second or the third case, then now K5 doesn't play as much of a role, and K6 is big, and roughly the same magnitude as the free energy. But the main takeaway is this figure here, I think. That we have two constants which are daily big, and we have a free energy which is daily big in magnetic. Okay, so what do we do? So there are two things which come to mind. So the first one is to neglect all of the terms except for k5 and k6. This isn't what we've done. Because then we run into problems with the elastic parameters and the other parameters of the problem of the problem. But this is an option. The second option, which is what we're going to do here, is parameter continuation. Is parameter continuation. So, what do I mean by this? Well, again, I'm going to rely on the work of Patrick. I'm giving you lots of references in this talk. So, we're going to introduce some new parameter, which I'm going to call this horrific M. And we're going to replace all of our A bars by M A bar. So, basically, we're going to hide the magnitude of the parameters in this. The magnitude of the parameters in this m term here, which means that we can start off with all the parameters on the same scale. And then we're going to perform continuation in this parameter on a logarithmic scale, starting from m being 1 and going all the way up to making m very big. Are there any questions about this? But if you start with m equals 1, you haven't changed anything? So, this is maybe a bad notation. What I've done here is I have something here, I have a term here which is of the order of 10 to the 8, and I'm replacing it as, so I'm putting the 10 to the 8 into this M, and replacing A as being order 1. So, what I'm doing is I'm just removing the difference in magnitude from the problem and hiding it inside this n parameter. I see what you mean, I don't know what's written down. I see what you mean. I don't know how to speak now. I may have bad notation. This is always possible. Same M for every coefficient. Yes, yes. So this M is something which changes the order of magnitude rather than trying to kind of tune different parameters. So this M is chosen to be the same for every parameter, but it only affects the A bars. So A11, A12, A21. So that's why I've just A two was so that's why I just refer to it as A bars here. Okay, so before I go on to talk about what we're doing in the spectrum C case, I'm going to bring it back a bit and talk about the pneumatic case and how we how energy replication is obtained in the pneumatic case. So here the electric potential runs from zero to one between the two boundaries. Between the two boundaries, and these are the parameters which are used. So, compared to what I've just shown you, very, very nice parameters. And in the case of nematics, we have a Friedrich threshold of pi times the square root of k1 epsilon zero, epsilon zero, epsilon a. epsilon A and in practice this number is 0.7752 and we want in the semantic case for our transition to be in roughly the same position. So how are we going to do this? Well from the from a Carl Stewart and Leslie paper in 91 we expect the semantic C transition to be to occur when this equality is satisfied. When this equality is satisfied, and this equality here, unfortunately, has this M term coming into it. So where the transition occurs depends on the magnification of the solution. Okay, so for a transition to occur, we need that second term We need that the second term is smaller than the first term or negative, but we want to be in the first case because we don't want this transition to occur too far away from zero. Eddie said this. So if we want to remove this increase in size from the transition threshold, we need to remove this M from the second term somehow, which means that we need Which means that we need for the angle of the annulus to scale like m to the minus half. So if we want our parameters to be very big, we need our annulus to be very, very, very thin. Yes? Sorry, I just realized that I don't have too much time, so I'm trying to speed up a bit. So how can we compute this in practice? Can we compute this in practice? Well, we're going to use phase of continuation. Again, thank you, Patrick. I've stolen a pickup from the paper here. So you have some initial parameter continuation, and then after you continue, you deflate all solutions at a new parameter value, and then you continue on again with any new solutions which you've found. So, what are we doing currently? So, what are we doing currently in terms of the phase continuation for the synaptic C problem? Well, we want to look for energy bifurcations as we vary the voltage, and this is enforced through the boundary conditions. So, what are we going to do? So, first of all, we're going to set up fated continuation, starting with a value of m is equal to 1 and v is equal to 0. So, this is the easy case. So, this is the easy case. This is the case that we should be able to solve without any problems. And then we fix m to be equal to one. So, we keep we're sticking in the regime of having all the parameters of the same magnitude. And then we run deflated continuation in the space of the voltage with linear spacing. So, we basically do parameter continuation increasing the voltage for the problem. And then, after we've obtained all of the solutions here, we Here, we fix the voltage and we run again the freighted continuation, but now in M. So now we take the solution on the simple case where we have our parameters which are kind of self-similar to each other, and then we are going to increase the difference in order of magnitude of the parameters. And once we get to this point, we want Once we get to this point, we want to perform the phase of continuation again at the maximal value of M, so at the physical parameters, in reverse. So we go from the largest voltage to the smallest voltage. So what do we get? What are the results? So if we have that m is equal to 1 and that the angle of the angulus is large enough, so let's say pi by 8. So let's say pi by 8, then we get some nice biplication diagrams. We get something which you look at it and you say, yes, that's a nice figure. We don't know what the constants mean, but the figure looks nice. And if we increase m to be very large, then we lose all of the interesting solutions. So we end up with just the solutions which point directly out of the annulus, which are kind of the easy solutions to capture and not the interesting ones. To capture and not the interesting ones. So, what happens if we have m is equal to 1 and the angle is equal to pi over a? Well, then we have, as we increase in voltage, we get a bifurcation at around 0.4, which is roughly where we expect it to be, and we get additional. And we get additional bifurcations later, and it's not clear yet if these are completely physical. But this, again, this is not within the parameter regime which are claimed in the Stuart book to be physical. Okay, so I'll just quickly summarise what we've spoken about. So in this talk, we attempted to extend the work on simulating fidget transmissions. Simulating fidget transitions using finite elements to the synaptic C case. There are several problems which come up, which are pretty much most of the significant ones all come from this difference in parameter values. And we talked about some approaches to overcome these issues. So now instead of you asking me questions, I'm going to ask you questions. So my questions for you are: do you have any ideas as to what these parameters should be? I'll cross my finger. I cross my fingers. Can any terms in the electric in the energy here be neglected? So we have nine elastic parameters, but we don't know which ones are more meaningful than others, or if we can just drop all of the small parameters. And do you have any recommendations for improvements to make? I think because of time I will stop here. So thank you for listening. Great, questions for James? Francesca? You're not gonna like this question. Actually, I know not so much about Smet Xi and I've never worked with them, but what is like, do you have an intuition of why this parameter should be so different in your so many others? So, I have no intuition and my intuition and my my uh my only reasoning for them for them being different is that uh Stuart said so um but maybe Tim can speak to this more than I can as to why this these parameter values are so different from each other but I really have no intuition yeah I think we have to move that list but I I think we don't have a lot of time so let's go have one question I I I will have a um a question which is possibly equivalent but said differently. A long but said differently. In fact, I did not understand very well why you decided to study first smectic C and not smectic A, which may be seen as simpler and less anisotropic. Well I mean I think the motivation here is that it's the actual the problem setup is more similar to phonematic case. So the functionals that we're looking at So the functionals that we're looking at, they kind of the same order, whereas symmetric A, at least in the models, is a quite... From the physics point of view, I can understand that these are different... that this is the more the orientation of the electricity with respect to spectral impact. Indeed, for some Indeed, for some orientations, it is true. It's equivalent to the pneumatic, and I guess this is what you have chosen. This is why you have considered that A does not vary. Well, I mean, if this is the case, I'm very happy, but this wasn't my reason. My reason was just to make things a bit more simple. But I think for some geometricists, but I'm not specifically. Any other questions? Any other questions? Oh, please. Yeah, sorry. Your M parameter, if you set that to zero, does your free energy become the pneumatic free energy? Or that's a good question. Well, the question is a comment as well. Then, if it doesn't, then maybe you want to. It might be useful to have a parameter which essentially when it's zero, you go back to the mass. When it's zero, you go back to pneumatic because you know how to solve pneumatic, it's nice and simple. And then that this new M parameter would actually be like a temperature. Because then you go into a phase transition to get into semantic C. It might be a might be a better, well a more physical continuation parameter. M is buried in the A bar. Yes, so it's hidden here. Oh, I see. So it's, it's not so clear where. So it gets it gets it's not so clear where it comes in unless you go unless we write it all down, unless you can see things very quickly. But it kind of has to it gets fed back into these A bars here, which then get fed into these K5 and K6 terms. But no, that's an excellent point. Thank you. All right, well let's thank James again. Thank you.
