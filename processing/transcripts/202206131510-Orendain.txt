Okay, well, thank you very much. Thank you, everyone, for coming. I'd like to start off by thanking the organizers, Robert and Christian Malis. So it's been, I know it's been very challenging to organize this workshop under this condition. So yeah, thank you very much for putting it together. So the title of my talk is Quivariant Functorial Quantum Field Theory. This is joint work with Quantum field theory. This is joint work with Robert. We're carrying this work at CCM at Centro Ecciencias Matem√°ticas at UNAM as part of the QISS initiative. My original plan with this talk was to give a very short introduction to GBQFT, to quantum field theory in the general boundary formulation, and then give a detailed introduction. Give a detailed introduction to our equivariant functorial quantum field theory formalism with some concrete examples. But when preparing the talk, I realized it would be better to sort of give a very sort of informal and panoramic introduction to GBQFT with the goal of introducing equivalent functorial quantum field theory. So I'll be a bit informal. I'll be a bit informal. I'll be giving some examples of GBQFT of computations that you can do in GBQFT. And in the end, I'll say a few things about EFQFT. So, yeah. Okay, so general boundary quantum field theory, or GBQFT, is a compositional framework for studying quantum field theories. So the word compositional theory refers to this notion of compositionality. So for us, compositionality means So, for us, compositionality means that if a system, whatever that means, admits a decomposition, also, whatever that means, into simpler systems, then information about the original system can be deduced from A, information of the simpler components, simpler system components, and B, information on the way the simpler components are put together. So, essentially, we want to play a sort of Lego game with information. So, we have a big thing, we decompose it into A big thing, we decompose it into smaller pieces. We have information on each of the smaller pieces, and together with that information, together with the way the pieces are put together, we get information on the larger thing. So, GBQFT builds on Atia's topological quantum field theory or TQFT framework, but improves in crucial aspects. So, first of all, so very the formulation. So, the formulation, so the Atiya formulation for TQFT is, in my opinion, very elegant and beautiful. So, you can just say that a TQFT is a symmetric monodal functor from the category of orderisms to the category of vector spaces, if you know what that means. But so essentially, it depends on some structure that is built in or assumed on space-time pieces or on manifolds, which is this in-out structure, which in mathematical terms that translates. Terms that translates to saying that you're considering covertisms. So GBQFT is basically or has the same ideas, but does not assume in-out structure on space-time pieces. So one of the important things that the in-and-out structure or covertism structure on space-time that you get in the TQFT formalism is what is known as duality. So if you don't have that, then you don't have duality. That, then you don't have duality. And one of the important consequences of that is that space-times in TQFT are infinite-dimensional. So, by sort of circumventing this, GBQFT, in principle, would describe at least, if it's done right, infinite dimensional theories. Also, it's closer to actual examples. So, for example, 2D quantum Yang-Mills theory with corners can be phrased. With corners can be phrased in terms of GBQFT very naturally. Well, TQFT does not describe TQFT, sorry, 2D quantum YAML theory. There's been some recent work on that, but it's not as natural. Also, and very importantly, GBQFD admits a probabilistic interpretation. So Robert will talk about this on Thursday and the positive formalism. But yeah, this is a very important part of the program. Approximately, very appropriate. Uh, approximately, very approximately, we can think of uh GBQFTs as quantum field, the quantum field theory version of the positive formalism, which, uh, yeah, again, Robert will talk about on Thursday. You can also think of GBQFTs as square roots of certain theories in the positive formalism. Um, this is very approximate, but yeah, you can think of GBQFTs like that. Or I suppose the right way you should think about GBQFTs would be as minimal compositional models. Minimal compositional models of QFTs were two-dimensional quantum diamonds theories, an example. So I think that's the right way to think about GBQFTs. Okay, so I'll explain these ideas with a little bit more detail. But yeah, GBQFT is again sort of approximately the minimal compositional model for QFT, where 2D quantum YAML theory is an example. Okay, so the basic setup. Okay, so the basic setup for GBQFT is the following. So, as always, you choose a notion of spacetime. So, this takes the form of a notion of space-time region, which is usually modeled or it's always modeled as a compact-oriented manifold. Well, in our case, compact, but oriented manifolds with certain structure. The certain structure or the structure can be whatever, an area function, a metric, spin structure, string structure, principal bundle, connection framing, etc. So we choose manifolds with whatever structure we want to study them with. We choose them in a certain dimension, let's say n, which is the dimension of our spacetime. Okay, so we choose regions and then regions have boundaries. So the model for boundaries of regions is again manifolds of codimension one, probably with a little bit less structure than regions. For example, and again, For example, again, in topological quantum 2D, sorry, sorry, in 2D quantum Yamuel's theory, you study manifolds with boundary and sorry, manifolds with area or region, sorry, surfaces with area, and then the boundaries or the hypersurfaces don't have an area function. So sort of hypersurfaces are modeled as manifolds with a little bit sort of the same structure, but maybe sometimes a little bit less. Okay, so these are hypersurfaces. So we choose a new Are hypersurfaces. So we choose a notion of region, a notion of hypersurface. And the third ingredient, the third basic ingredient for GBQFT is space-time operations. So space-time operations are disjoint unions, which allow us to speak of locality gluings, allow us to speak of compositionality and orientation changes. So these operations are defined on regions and hypersurfaces alike. So we consider these operations and we. We consider these operations and we assume, or we define them in terms of the structure that we consider on our regions and hypersurfaces. So the space-time operations are or form the arithmetic, allowing us to decompose complicated space-time systems or pieces of space-time, regions and hypersurfaces into simple or simpler space-time systems. And so these operations allow us to speak of composition. Allow us to speak of compositionality in the sense that I mentioned before. Okay, so the basic idea of GBQFT is that GBQFT associates algebraic data, which in this case take the form of state spaces and amplitudes, to space-time data, to hypersurfaces and region. And it does this respecting space-time operations. So it does this compositionally. So yeah, this is GBQFD in a very, very Yeah, yeah, they can have boundaries. So they are not boundaries of regions, ah, well, okay. So you there are pieces of boundaries of regions. So I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah, hypersurfaces can have boundaries. Okay, so the basic geometric setup is the following. So these are the drawings. So in GBQFD, again, we start with a notion of hypersurface. So I'm sorry, yes. Hypersurface. So, I'm sorry, yes, as Close Antonio pointed out, these can be. So, these are sort of the pieces of boundaries of regions, not just boundaries of regions. So, manifolds of codimension one with certain structure with possibly, well, sorry, with boundary or possibly boundary. So, if you have a hypersurface sigma, then GDQFT associates the sigma state space. So, if you're in a bosonic theory, this will be a Hilbert space, or in a Fermionic theory, a Krine space. So, if a drawing Theory of crime space. So the drawing sort of looks like this. And if x is a region, then GBTFT associates to it an amplitude, which is a map from the state space of its boundary, the boundary of x to the complex numbers, usually an unbounded map. So the drone sort of looks like this. So we consider, yeah, so regions, patches of space-time. And so we associate to that two things to the boundary, a state space, and we associate. Space and we associate an amplitude map. Okay, but again, we do this compositionally. Now, what does that mean? So, suppose we have a GBQ of D and we're given a region X. And so, of course, what we want to do is we want to compute the state space of its boundary, number one. And number two, we want to compute the amplitude of the region. And suppose we're given this, but we don't know how to compute number one. We don't know how to compute neither the state space of the boundary nor, of course, the amplitude of the region itself, but we know how to do this in simpler regions. So, this is sort of the problem that we face in GBQFD or that we assume that we face in GBQFD. So, we're given some rules for state spaces and regions. We know that we can do this, but suppose we're given a region that is sort of difficult to describe or to understand, and we can't really say explicitly what this. Can't really say explicitly what the state space of its boundary is, nor we can say anything about its amplitude. So, what do we do now? So, we use this notion of compositionality. So, I'll try to explain how we use this notion. And in the process, I hopefully will explain exactly what we mean by this. So, okay, so the drawing looks like this. So, suppose whatever, that's a cartoon of what we're facing. So, we have this region, and okay, if we know how to compute. Okay, if we know how to compute state spaces of simpler hypersurfaces and we know how to compute amplitudes of simpler regions, then the strategy here is to cut our region along an inner transversal hypersurface, let's say sigma. So we just have this complicated region. Somehow, if we're smart enough or not, we just take a transversal hypersurface along our region and we cut along it. And then if we do that, Along it. And then, if we do that, we obtain two new regions. In this case, let's call them x1 and x2. This x1 and x2 have boundary decompositions here. Well, they have boundaries, of course. We have the boundary of x1 and the boundary of x2, and the amplitude of x1 and x2 is evaluated on the state space of the boundary of x1 and the boundary of x2, respectively. But the cut gives us boundary decompositions for x1 and x2. Decompositions for x1 and x2. In the left-hand side, we have the decomposition of the boundary of x1 as whatever sigma means. So, again, this is a cartoon. But sigma glued along lambda one. And the boundary of x2 is decomposed as sigma with its subset orientation because we glued along sigma glued to lambda two. So, yeah, the idea here is that I assume we've done this. We've done this in a smart way. So we decomposed X as X1 and X2 glued along some hypersurface sigma in a way that X1 and X2 are somewhat easier than X. And of course, the boundary decompositions or the boundaries of X1 and X2 are also easier than the boundary of X. So if we do this, the goal is to reconstruct the amplitude of X rho X from the amplitude rho X1 of X1 and the rho x1 of x1 and the amplitude rho x2 of x2 from that information and from the information of the cut or of the gluing of x1 and x2 into x long sigma so this is the game we play so suppose we're we have on this so if we want to compute the amplitude of x in terms of the amplitude of x1 and x2 we first have to describe the state space of the boundary of x The state space of the boundary of x in terms of the state space of the boundary of x1 and the boundary of x2. And so we have to describe the boundary of x again, this thing here, in terms of the boundary of x1 and x2. So yeah, so we have this drawing here. So in this drawing here, we have these pieces here. So we have what I call lambda one and lambda two, which are the Call lambda one and lambda two, which are the leftover pieces of the boundary of x after the cut. And so in this disjoint union here, we have, of course, lambda one, sorry, oh, lambda one and lambda two. And suppose we know how to compute states or we know how to say things about states in lambda one and lambda two. Of course, we now want to say things about states in lambda one, this joint union, lambda two. Okay, so. Okay, so this is already something expected as always. So states in Lambda 1 and Lambda, disjoint union, Lambda 2, or as always mixed states in Lambda 1 and Lambda 2. So the state space of Lambda 1, disjoint union of Lambda 2, and this thing here is a tensor product of the state space of Lambda 1 and the state space of Lambda 2. This is actually wrong. We don't really want this. We will want an approximate version of this, but this is essentially the idea. And so this idea implies Idea. And so this idea implements locality in the hypersurface level. So we GBQFD gives you this. So it gives you, in this situation, an approximate version of this formula here, which we understand as locality. So suppose we can do this. So suppose we can write every state in this disjoint union as a state here, hence there, a state here, or as a sum of states here and states here. Okay. The thing here is that we can express the boundary. Can express the boundary of x as this lambda one hypersurface glued to this lambda two hypersurface along this blue dots. So again, we can describe states in this whole thing as states here mixed with states here. We would like to describe states here in terms of mixed states here. So GBQFT says that states in the boundary here, if we can express this boundary of x as Boundary of x as lambda one and lambda two glued along some boundary piece, then states in the boundary of x can be written in terms of states in this whole thing, and thus as mixed states in lambda one and lambda two. So the way GBF does this is through a map from the state space of this disjoint union to the state space of the boundary of x. This is in general linear and surjective. And so we understand. And so we understand the existence of this map here that is guaranteed by GBQFD as compositionality in codimension one or in the hypersurface level. So again, we're playing this game of, sorry, having this complicated region. We want to recover its amplitude in terms of this cod. And so we have to piece together the boundary. First thing we have to do is piece together the boundary of Piece together the boundary of x in terms of the boundary of x1 and x2. Okay, sorry. Okay, and so GBF tells us how to do that. Okay, so the second thing, so we already know that we can express the boundary of x as this piece glued to this piece, and GBQFT tells us if you can do this, then every state in the boundary of x can be described in terms of states here and states here. And states here through this gamma map and through this identification of states in the disjoint union and mixed states in lambda one and lambda two. Okay, now there's a missing piece here. We cut through sigma or thawed in the other way, the other way around. We glued x, we glued x1 to x2 along sigma with its substate orientation and got x. So we need a way of an algebraic version. Of an algebraic version of this identification here. So, again, we identified sigma with its substitute orientation. So, this should come, or this should define an identification on the state space of sigma and the state space of sigma with its substitute orientation. And this should be done in a way that it expresses the fact that this is done with opposite orientation. So, yeah, if you are thinking of Hilbert spaces, the Hilbert space. Spaces, the Hilbert space, if you have a Hilbert space H, then it's itself with its opposite orientation, it's its complex conjugate. So we should be able to identify each state in sigma with its complex conjugate. So GBQFT tells us that you can do this. Not actually this, this is a stricter version than what we need, but we have this approximately. So we call this the involution property. Okay. Oh, I don't know what. Did I do something? Yeah, I don't know what. Yeah, it's sort of fixed. Okay, there you go. Yeah, I can. Thank you. I'm sorry. Uh-huh. Maybe here. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, I think. Okay. Yeah, yeah, I think it works. Yeah, I think it works. Okay, maybe I should do it here. I don't know what I. Solving some technical problems, ah yeah, we're having some technical issues here. So sorry. Okay. Ah, yeah. Thank you. Yeah, okay. So I'm sorry. Okay. So again, we're in this situation that I mentioned. So we have x glued from x1 and x2. We have an And x2. We have an identification of the boundary of x in terms of lambda one and lambda two, blue along those blue things. And we have an identification of sigma and sigma with its subset orientation. And we assume an algebraic version of this identification, which is this equation here that, as I mentioned, we actually want an approximate version of this, not the actual equation, but yeah, that's the idea. Okay, so with this ingredients, I can tell you sort of again very approximately what how Approximately, how we recover the amplitude of x in terms in this cartoon picture, how we recover the amplitude of x in terms of the amplitude of x1 and x2 through this operation here. Okay, so in the previous drawing, so of course, if we want to compute the amplitude of x, then we have to evaluate it on a state of x. So, choose phi a state of x, so an element of the state space of the boundary of x that g b q of p. Of the boundary of x that gbq gives us. So, write this step, this state as gamma. So, recall that gamma is this map here of a mixed state in lambda one and lambda two. So, there should be a sum here between, so in here, but let's just assume that psi can be written as gamma psi one tensor psi two. So, psi one is assumed to be a state in lambda one and psi two a state in lambda two. And now the third step. And now the third step is to choose an orthonormal basis for H sigma. In that case, observe that if we conjugate, complex conjugate the elements of the base of H sigma, then Yoda of these things, oh, sorry, I didn't mention Yoda. Well, I mean, the psi i's with its subset orientation are basis of h of the of sigma with its subset orientation. So in that case, so if we apply tau. We apply tau. Sorry, I think I here forget about this. So psi one tensor psi i is an element of, so gamma of this is a state in the boundary of lambda one. And so again, forget about this tau, gamma of this thing here, and forget about this Yoda. This thing here is a state in the boundary. So it's an element in the state space in the boundary of x2. Okay, so what we just did was, so in this case here, we So, in this case here, we considered a state in the boundary of x, and we wrote it as a state here, tensor a state here, and we sort of chose something with which we can average. So it's this orthonormal basis in here. So we have our state chosen state here. For every basis element here, we can put these together and we get a state in the boundary of x1. And we can do the same thing with x2. So we choose a state in the boundary of x. A state in the boundary of x, and through those decompositions, we obtain a bunch of states in lambda one and lambda two parameterized by the orthonormal basis basis that we chose for the state space of signa. Okay, and so GBQFT tells us that in this situation, the amplitude of our state psi is some constant, which we call the gluing anomaly, which depends on the gluing situation that we're in, of the sum. Of the sum times the sum over the orthonormal basis of, again, forget about this tau, gamma, of the amplitude of this state here that we produce times the amplitude. So this should be here and this should be just a tau of the other state that we produce. So basically, we again have a state. We have a state and the whole thing. We express it. So from it, we extract a bunch of states here and a bunch of states here. States here and a bunch of states here parametrized by an orthonormal basis here. So we just apply the amplitude of x1 to each of those states, the amplitude of x2 to each of the states here, and we multiply them parametrized by the orthonormal basis here. We sum and up to some constant, the gluing anomaly of this situation, we recover the amplitude of x on the state that we started with. So this is what GBQFT tells us. So the actual axiom sort of looked like this. Again, this is. Axioms sort of look like this. Again, this is an approximate version of that. So a GBQFT consists of the following data. So state spaces, a Hilbert space H sigma for every hypersurface sigma. So GBQFT, if you give it a hypersurface, it gives you back a state space, a Hilbert space. Number two, you can identify, so this should be the tensor product here. So an isometric associative isomorphism, tau sigma one, sigma two, from H sigma one tensor. H sigma one tensor, I am sorry here, to h sigma one disjoint union sigma two for every pair of hypersurfaces, sigma one, sigma two. So in our cartoon drawing before, we assumed that these two things are equal. GBQFT tells you, okay, they're not equal, but you can, with a canonical isometric isomorphism, identify them. And this satisfies some condition, which we call associativity. Number three, involution transformation. And so GBQFT, if you give it GBQFT, if you give it a hypersurface, it gives you a way of identifying the state space of the hypersurface sigma with its substate orientation with the state space of the hypersurface with its complex conjugate. And this satisfies some condition, which you call involution. And finally, well, not finally, I'm sorry. So gluing transformation. So if you give, if you have sigma and sigma prime. if if you have sigma and sigma prime two hypersurfaces and you assume that sigma sigma prime is obtained from sigma by some gluing along the boundary as i described before in the in the boundary case then gbqft gives you a way of writing every state in sigma prime in the glued thing uh in terms of a state in the unglued or the cut um uh hypersurface so we call this the gluing transformation uh so this thing this four acts Think this four axioms here tell you a GBQFT gives you state space for every hypersurface, and two, three, and four tell you how to construct state spaces from hypersurfaces if you use this space-time operations. But it does it in a sort of non-strict way. And finally, an amplitude, so a linear map rho x from the state space of the. x from the state space of the boundary of x to the complex numbers for every region x. We assume that this data satisfies the expected coherence conditions, so this might or might not mean anything to you, but of course we have this word here associative, we have this word here involitative, and we have a bunch of ways of identifying things that we want to identify, and we want these things to relate in the way that you would want them to relate. And so, yeah. And so GB2FT does this. So, GBQFT does this and in such a way that the composition formula holds. So, this is again an approximate version of this. There's a very key axiom that I'm not mentioning, the slice region axiom. But this is the game that GBQFT, so the game that GBQFT allows you to play is the game that I described. And an approximate formal version of the axioms of GBQFT is this thing here. Okay. Yeah, what kinds of things? Yeah, what kinds of things can we do with GBQFT again, playing this game that I mentioned before? So, for example, suppose you have a two-dimensional GBQFD, and suppose we're given a disk, we can cut the disk. Oh, sorry, no, this is, yeah, I wanted this. Suppose, again, we're given a disk, and we can cut the disk along an interval here, and we can open it up into a pizza without a slice. Pizza without a slice. This is, if we're in a topological setting, this is homeomorphic to this, so it's a disk. And so, using this compositional formula, we would get we should be able to take a state here and compute the amplitude of the disk on that state in terms of the amplitude of, again, the disk on a different state. And if we do that, then we would get a sort of internal formula for GBQFT, a formula related. A formula relating the amplitude on the disk with the amplitude on the disk, and that would be sort of that would define a sort of internal logic on a GBQFT. So how does this work? Suppose psi is a state in the circle, so in the boundary of the disk, choose an orthonormal basis for the state space of this interval here. Again, if we apply the Yoda, we get an orthonormal basis for this thing here, and we have a way of identifying. thing here and we have a way of identifying the two orthonormal bases and choose a state in this blue thing here a state in the in the in the interval such that our state here can be written in terms of this state here so in that case the amplitude on the disk on psi is the same thing as this gluing anomaly times the sum over the state space of the disk with this new presentation of this thing this thing Of this thing here. So this is tau. Now tau is right. I already said what that is. And gamma with era. So this element here, this state, this sort of averaging with respect to the orthonormal basis. So this is a formula that we always get with a GBQFT. And so again, this sort of gives us an internal logic of what a GBQFT does. So yeah. Does so, yeah. Another formula that we can get through this gluing game, and again, as an internal logic thing, suppose again we're giving a disk, and we can now cut the disk along an interval, but like the interval would go along all the disk. So we would get two disks here. So, in that case, if we take a state here and the boundary of the disk in the circle, and we choose an orthonormal basis corresponding to this red line, which is Red line, which is psi one and psi two. Two states corresponding to this interval here and this interval here. The orthonormal basis would correspond to this interval here, such that, yeah, psi, the state that we chose here, can be written in terms of this state here and this state here. So, of course, again, there should be a sum here that I'm not writing for simplicity. Okay, in that case, the amplitude of the disk in this psi is And this psi is some complex number, the gluing anomaly times this sum here. So again, the amplitude of the disk on the state that we reconstruct from this data here. So psi one, the state here, times the corresponding orthonormal basis here, times tensor, the orthonormal basis here element with its substitute orientation, tensor psi two. We can convert this formula into this formula here, and again, we obtain a formula. Here and again, we obtain a formula involving the amplitude of the disk on both sides. And so, again, we get this sort of internal logic on GBQFD. What other things can we do? So, gluing a cylinder, for example, take, suppose again, we have a two-dimensional GBQFT, take the torus, cut it along a circle, and what you get is, of course, a cylinder. One axiom that I didn't mention is that the state space of the empty manifold is. Of the empty manifold is, or the empty hypersurface is, so here it should be boundary, it's a complex numbers. So, yeah, choose, take an orthonormal basis corresponding to the circle. And so you'll get the amplitude of the torus on, well, you evaluate it on one in the complex numbers is a complex number. And so that complex number is the gluing anomaly of this decomposition. Anomaly of this decomposition times this sum here. So it turns out that using the slice region axiom that I didn't mention, because I didn't have time, this actually you can prove that this is essentially equivalent to the inner product, sorry, the dimension of the state space of the circle. So what we get is that a number equals a number times the dimension of the circle. That is, if we assume these axioms as they are. So again, we try to circumvent this problem with TQFD. This problem with TQFD, where you get finite dimensional axioms, then we get finite dimensional state spaces. So we're very sad here. So the thing that we do with GBQFD is something that people do in general, which is you don't allow or consider some gluings, especially this gluing here, because you don't want finite dimensional theories. Yeah, so there are some obvious questions and observations. Questions and observations with respect to GBQFT. So, first on the compositionality issue, the maps tau, Yoda, and gamma in the definition of GBQFT allows us to speak about compositionality in a sort of lax way, not strictly. What do these maps mean? What do we know by coherent? Oh, sorry, what do we mean by coherence between these maps exactly? So, this was built in the axioms of GPQFD. Can these maps be understood within a larger mathematical context? Again, Larger mathematical context. Again, recall that this tau was something that would allow us to talk about locality. This Yoda would identify a state space with or change the orientation of a state space in gamma, would give us compositionality. What do these maps mean? So, identifications in the formulas I defined before, we identify regions and hypersurfaces freely. So, here, yeah, well, if you caught a torus here. Yeah, well, if you cut a torus here, then you get something homeomorphic to the cylinder, not exactly the cylinder, but I spoke as if those identifications had already been defined. So do we want GBQFT to do this or do we want GBQFT to be defined on the nose, but be able to say things up to isomorphisms when we want it to? Can we describe a formulation where this is done in a precise and flexible way? Space-time regions admit symmetries, but these are not taken into account in the formulation. Also, hypersurfaces admit symmetries, but they're not present in the GBQFD formulation that I presented. Can we implement symmetries and diffumer of this invariance natively in our formalism? Also, admissibility self-gluing of a cylinder makes state spaces finite-dimensional, as I mentioned. So, this sort of implements duality as in TQFT in a hidden way. So, can we In a hidden way? So, can we consider theories of this sort where some gluings are not allowed in a formal way? Can we define a GBQFD formalism flexible enough where we can describe precisely which gluings, hypersurfaces, regions, etc. are admissible? So these are obvious problems that were presented with. What is the precise mathematical structure underlying GBQFD? Can we handle GBQFDs as mathematical objects and study them in a larger mathematical context? So people do this in top. So people do this in topological quantum field theory in quantum mechanics. So you use operators and you can manipulate them mathematically. And you can manipulate Hilbert spaces mathematically. Can we manipulate GBQFTs mathematically? In categorical quantum mechanics, people do this as well. So can we do this with GBQFT? Can we develop a way of answering the following questions? Two GBQFTs define when do two GBQFTs define? two q two gbqfts define the same information when do they not define the same information so if we're given two gbqfts where so we can understand them as games that as i mentioned before but when are they the same when are they essentially the same when are they uh explicitly so strictly the same and when they're not we want to answer those questions so we in general we want to describe ways in which gbqfts are related um as robert will tell As Robert will tell you about, every GBQFT admits an interpretation as the theory in the positive formalism. We can say what sort of positive formalism theories are GBQFTs or are coming from GBQFTs. There are obvious questions here, which again, Robert might talk about. Are these all the positive formalism theories coming from GBQFTs? Classical field theories, also the fine theories in the positive formalism. In a sense, classical field theories and quantum field theories are. Theory and quantum field theories are polar opposites in the positive formalism. Can we make this statement precise? And of course, we want to develop mathematical technology to provide toy models to answer some of these questions. And if we have this developed in a good mathematical footing, we might, we also expect some mathematical applications. So, okay, so this was the title of the talk. So it would just be one slide. So equivariant functorial field theory or EFK. Factorial field theory or EFQFT is a reformulation or refinement of GBQFT, allowing us to answer the above questions precisely all of them. So in EFQFT, we can provide space-time structure-independent framework for treating cutting and gluing of space-time regions and hypersurfaces, which is precise in that it is formulated in terms of general properties of space-time compositionality. So essentially, what we do is. Compositionality. So essentially, what we do is just provide a formalism that allows us to just work in a sort of structure-independent way with space-time. So if you have a region or hypersurface model for GBQFT, let's say, or that you would think that it would fit into the GBQFT framework. If it fits into certain rules that we developed, then we can do GBQFT with it with no extra work. No extra work. So, this framework focuses on identifications rather than the fact that something loops into something else. So, this, I'm not sure how much sense this makes, but this is sort of one of the core ideas of our formalism. This new formalism that we developed and in which EFQFT is based seamlessly implements symmetries and if you're morphism invariance. And this idea that we sort of identify things up to Identify things up to isomorphisms or diffeomorphisms or whatever, but we don't, but we do want it. And so, this is not an issue in this EFQFT program. Now, this also, this EFTQ of T, sorry, EFQFT formalism provides a mathematical framework for GBQFT in terms of category theory, in particular, in terms of these things called involved symmetric model functors. Category theory is especially designed to answer questions as the ones. To answer questions as the ones that I posed above. So it's designed to compare things precisely and to understand relative position. So it provides tools for constructing examples. It gives a precise interpretation of these maps here that were very strange before. And it gives us tools to answer questions or to sort of formalize statements, such as the fact that what I mentioned in the beginning, that GBQFT is sort of the minimal model that is compositional. Model that is compositional and contains two-dimensional quantum Janwiels theory. We can make that precise with category theory. So, EFQFT is in its early stages. We'll publish a couple of preprints on this in the next couple of weeks, hopefully. So, we have this paper here where we introduce EFQFT as derived from GBQFT as a first principles axiomatic theory with examples and computations. And in particular, we provide And in particular, we provide a homotopy theoretical algebraic structure on the state space of the interval with area into the Young-Mills theory. This is the second paper where we prove that the axiomatic presentation of EFQ of T is in codimension one equivalent to the data to this categorical data that I mentioned before. We expect a seamless extension to conformal field theories and theories in the positive formalism, classical field theory, etc. And we expect almost immediate applications to problem. Almost immediate applications to problems of extensions of group actions to wordisms and factorization homology. And yeah, so there's more a promotion of EFQFT, but if anyone has questions and wants me to be more precise on whatever things I'm around and you can ask, of course. So thank you. Please ask your question. Please ask your question. How you have to stay close? Okay. All right. So just to clarify, understand the meaning, when we have a region, We have a region, say the space-time region, and you have a boundary, and you have a Hilbert space on this boundary. So, this boundary, at least as you drew it, it's not a space-like surface, right? In general. So, we have states not on space-like surface, it can be on a general surface, right? Okay, so I mean, this is new, for example, to me. I mean, I don't know how to interpret this. Physically, you have states at space-like surfaces. Space-like surfaces, usually. Well, the standard formulation. So, is there some, I don't know, example, let's say, of what this type of states might be that are not in a space-like surface? Well, yeah. Sorry. So, yeah, so this is essentially something that, so the, so GBQFD has. So GBQFD has been around for since the end of the 2000s, and there's been a couple of papers on examples on this. But yeah, as I mentioned a few times, 2D quantum Yamuel theory. So you can have states of 2D Yang theory even on a non-spit, non-space-time-like surfaces. That's it. I mean, it's surprising to me. That's also. That's also yeah, just to continue the same question: is that the only case only for 2D Jung Mills theory you can have states spaces associated to to time-like surfaces, or is there some more general down-to-earth example? Well, yeah, so yeah, I suppose, yeah, no, maybe. So, we're working on this conformal field theory examples, and well, maybe. Examples and and well, maybe yeah, probably Robert can answer this a little bit better. Um, yeah, well, yeah, okay, so yeah, so let me give a short answer to this. So basically, this has been around since 2005, where the first examples with time-like hyperplanes and things like that, and the way how you can how you talk about probabilities. How you talk about probabilities in this case. So that's called the general boundary formulation of quantum theory. And you have probability formulas that are more general than in the standard formulation of quantum theory. And so an important example is, for example, if you think of if you think your experiment is spatially confined, let's say, like a typical experiment, if you think of a particle collider or something, so you have to. Particle collider or something. So you have spatially confined experiment. You could idealize it as a sphere. And the experiment takes place during an extended time, but in a confined space. So for example, if you think of a collider experiment where you have your detector and you shoot in particles and on the boundary of the detector, they are detected. They are detected. So you have, if you idealize this topologically, you have something with the shape of a box or a sphere. And on the boundary, stuff comes in and stuff goes out. And the boundary in space-time is the boundary of this box or the sphere, but extended overall of time. So you can think of it as a hyper-cylinder in space-time. So in particular, it's a time-like bound. So, in particular, it's a time-like boundary. And so, you can describe the incoming and outgoing particles in a Hilbert space associated to this time-like boundary. And then you can extract the scattering formulas from this time-like state space. And you can even go further, as Daniela and I showed in 2007-2008. 2008, that in general, in quantum field theory, you can. So, if you start by thinking of amplitudes associated to this boundary, and now you extend the radius of your sphere to infinity, you take an asymptotic limit, you can show that this is in one-to-one correspondence to the usual S matrix in quantum field theory, where you also have. Where you also have a time interval and you send the initial and final boundary to infinity. And so you can show that there's a mapping one-to-one between the states on the boundary of this hypercylinder and the initial and final states in the usual S matrix. So you can reproduce the S matrix one-to-one in this way, but now with a spatial infinity limit. And so one advantage of this. And so, one advantage of this is that you can generalize this to space-times that are not globally hyperbolic, like ADS. And yeah, also you can look at scattering at finite distance. And the difference is that you have states that don't appear in the usual transition amplitudes because you have so-called evanescent waves that. That I mean, we know them in classical electromagnetism, and they are not visible in the standard S matrix because they are not well defined at spatial infinity. But in this case, with this time-like hyper surface, they are well defined, and you can describe also their scattering at finite distance. So, that's one application. Okay, yes, okay, yes. All right, so maybe I should give it back to Juan. There was a question by Olaf. Are you there? If you are there, you have answered. Hello to everybody. Has been answered already. Has been answered. Thank you. Nice to be here. Yeah, thank you. Any other questions? Okay. Any other questions? Okay, so that was a nice talk and a very nice advertisement. I have to now read your papers. I could not understand really the new how it all works, but I'm definitely curious. I was just wondering about the following issue. Is there any, like, if I understood correctly, the way you described the blue? Understood correctly the way you described the gluing of hypersurfaces when you cut them into pieces. Basically, I felt there was a tensor product assumed between the Huber spaces of the parts of the boundary and they form a new Huber space, which is the tensor product. So about this Huber space, is there any issue with this construction in terms of? Well, you assume that they're separable. Irreparable, and uh, is that consistent in the sense that, like, if you imagine cutting into some kind of sequence, smaller and smaller regions, you get an infinite number of things, the tensor product of an infinite number of separable Hilbert spaces is not separable. Yeah, well, sorry, yeah, sorry, thank you. Thank you. Yeah, so far, I think my answer would be so far we've only thought that you can thought about the case where you can't do this. We haven't thought about, or at least in this context, about infinite cuttings. But my answer there would be the point of the one of the main points of this program is that you can, if that's an issue with Hilbert spaces, then you just reformulate, you have a sort of formal axioms for sort of machinery. Axioms for a sort of machinery that tells you what are the necessary technical things that you would need for that to work. So there is a sort of a mathematical structure, the target of your field theory. And if you want to do those kinds of things, then you would have it reflected on this thing and you would just adjust to get those formulas corrected. So in this case, I suppose there would be an issue with separability, but we haven't thought about it. But we haven't thought about that. But yeah. And if you just call the subspace, like a box space in each case, that's right, right. Right. Yeah. And put in the in this language, in this sort of mathematical language, you would just substitute your category to make it work, the target of your theory. So yeah, that would be exactly that. Any more questions? Maybe we should mention that the gluing is not just a pencil product. Yeah, no, it's not. Yeah, so if you glue two things. Yeah, I'm sorry. This is something. So when you glue two things in the way I described it, it's not exactly. Yeah, it's not the tensor parts. It's a map from. So in this case, it was a tensor protein. So, in this case, it was a tensor product because we sort of cut into two pieces. But again, there was another example where you cut one piece and then you had just one hypersurface and you got states on that hypersurface and you associate that to the glued thing. And so it's not necessarily tensor products. It's just the map that tells you the witness that it's gluing things. So, yeah. So, tensor products are sort of the tensor products on those. Are sort of the tensor products on those formulas, are sort of incidental to the way we cut, but that's not always the case. And the important thing is the map, the surjective map. And so, yeah, I don't know if this is relevant, but one of the main ingredients of EFQFT is that this sort of cutting and cutting into pieces is sort of made precise by sort of certain functions. And so that makes it even less, even more. Even less, even more, even less close to tensor products, let's say. That's related to it. Yeah, I don't know if that answers the question. Okay, yeah. Olave, go ahead with your question. Yes, I think I do have a question. So, like, thank you very much for the talk. It was very, very interesting. interesting. I would like to understand what a measurement corresponds to in this framework. I mean, and like, for example, what does a classical observable mean and what does a measurement mean in this in this framework? So, yeah, I think maybe Robert can answer that better than me. I'm sorry. Yeah, okay. Sorry. So in that, in the pieces that Juan was presenting, this was not explicitly included, how this works. And it's not something that you can explain with just one sentence. So I don't know if it makes sense. It makes sense. Let me let me give it a quick try, and then on Thursday, there will be in my talk, I will come back to this question also to some extent, although in a slightly different context. So a very quick version of an answer is if you have a space-time region, so your states are on the boundary of this region. And so, one thing you can think about is boundary measurements. Think about is boundary measurements. So you're thinking of your measurement as located on the boundary of the region. So if that's the case, then to define the measurement, you need two ingredients which are positive operators on the boundary. And so one describes the measurement apparatus, if you want, or the kind of measurement you're doing. And the other operator. And the other operator describes also the measurement apparatus, but on top of that, you impose a certain outcome that you are asking for. And then the probability that this outcome occurs is a quotient between two. So the numerator includes the operator that corresponds to. Operator that corresponds to the question, and so basically, you have to evaluate the amplitude on an you choose some autonomal basis, which is just an artifact to make the formula work, and then apply the operator to the basis and evaluate the amplitude on that. And you multiply it with another copy of the amplitude, which you evaluate. Of the amplitude, which you evaluate on the same basis, but with a complex conjugation, and you sum. And in the numerator, you do the same thing, but with the other operator. It sounds a bit strange, but that gives you the probability. So that's a very quick thing. And anyway, we can talk also in the discussion session about this. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Juan again.
