to thank the organizers for this hybrid hybrid meeting made it much more convenient than otherwise um so the project i'm gonna speak about is joint with leo kanda just a second let me try this yeah this is thinner um rio conda Rio Conda and Paul Smith. And it's not quite on archive yet, but we're hoping soon, soon enough. And ultimately, the results I hope to have time to state are pretty much just algebraic geometry. But before I get to those, by way of motivation, I want to say enough. That'll bring. Enough that'll bring in some non-commutative geometry, some Poisson/slash symplectic geometry as well, all of that nice mix that should be topical for this meeting. So we were motivated by this construction due to Fagin and Odesky. Odesky, I think, is the standard. I think it is the standard anglicized version of a deformate, well, a family of deformations of polynomial rings that have been somehow the gift that keeps on giving. They wrote these extremely insightful papers, which in their details, after you've done enough work and check them, turn out to be correct, but very few proofs are present. But very few proofs are present. So there is some sort of magical store of insight that has not been exhausted even close to it, actually. So the general flavor of the construction is as follows. You fix an elliptic curve, which for me is going to be E throughout the talk. So this is an elliptic curve. Is an elliptic curve curve, and I'm also going to give myself on it a line bundle of a fixed degree n, also fixed, line bundle on it, on e is where the line bundle lives of some degree n. It's going to be at least three, and the line bundle isn't terrible. And the line bundle isn't terribly important. You can modify it without the constructions changing substantively. The n is what matters. And then, out of this, and also let me give myself a point on E as well. And out of this package, they made an algebra that I'm going to call Q sub n of E and eta. So you notice I'm taking n as my parameter. I'm not mentioning L explicitly. Parameter. I'm not mentioning L explicitly because it doesn't play a crucial role. And if you read my abstract, this would be Q sub n, one. There's more general construction that has an extra parameter, K. Time constraints require brevity, so we'll just stick to the one parameter. This is a deformation of the polynomial ring. The polynomial ring. And I can be a little more specific. Polynomial ring in n variables, but actually it's this polynomial ring. It's the symmetric algebra on the space of sections of the line bundle. If you think about that, where I'm on an elliptic curve, line bundle of degree n has an n-dimensional space. Has an n-dimensional space of sections, and some positive n, whatever, has an n-dimensional space of sections. So if I take ds means symmetric algebra, that's a polynomial degree, a polynomial ring, sorry, of in n variables, say x naught up to x n minus one. And what I mean by deformation, deformation. Deformation, deformation is sort of vague here. What I mean by it is if you flow n back to zero, think of V as an algebraic group. It's a compact, complex algebraic group. So it has a trivial element that I'm going to note by zero. You take eta back to zero, you get a polynomial ring. So Qn is a polynomial ring. Is a polynomial ring. So, in that sense, it's a deformation. Now, you can do all sorts of things with this. I'm not going to write down the formula for the multiplication. As I said, it seems like an absolutely astonishing piece of insight. It's a complicated formula involving theta functions. Of course, the formula is going to involve eta as well. You take these theta functions, you evaluate them at eta, do all sorts of things. It's unclear how they came up with it. Clear how they came up with it. It's a bit like those formulas Ramanuja kept churning out. But it does work out. And now, if you do this, what's the usual piece of commutative classical geometry that are not That a non-commutative deformation of a polynomial ring purchases. It's usually a Poisson structure, right? You take your non-commutative multiplication now. I had those variables xi and xj upstairs. It's right here. Now you're in a non-commutative polynomial ring. You can take a commutator, which depends on eta, and you can divide. And you can divide by eta, which is nonsense, but just go with it for a second. And then, when you converge to zero, if you played your cards right, this is going to be convergent to an actual formula involving only the xi and the xj that you can christen with the brace because it's going to be a Poisson structure. Structure. So, by this is the definition of this Poisson structure definition. Now, what do I mean by dividing by eta? Well, eta was a point on an elliptic curve. You can divide by it as such. But an elliptic curve looks like this. Yeah, it's C modulo lattice. You can take your eta from up from down here. Your eta from up from down here and lift it back up to C and still call it eta because you're sloppy, and whereby you I mean me. And then you can divide by complex numbers, right? So that's the sort of thing I meant. Whatever goes in here, this numerator is going to be some power series in eta, in this eta. And you then it makes sense to divide by. Yeah, so this can all be made. Yeah, so this can all be made proper sense of my own sloppiness notwithstanding. So you get a Poisson structure, Poisson structure on the polynomial ring. And in fact, it's homogeneous, meaning it stays the same if you scale it. It stays essentially the same. So you get a Poisson structure. On a projective space, Pn minus one, by which throughout the talk, I will mean the projective space that houses E embedded via the complete linear system produced by the line bundle L. So, if you think about it just a bit, take into account all Take into account all of the various annoying dualizations, vector space dualizations. This is the projectivization of the dual space of sections. Or also by shared duality, it's the projectivization of the space of extensions of L by the trivial sheaf on E. Equal so extensions that class that look like this yeah L goes on the left in x1 but it don't it goes on the right in the exact sequence so this is the pn this is the the pn minus one I mean right right over there gives you a Poisson structure on there so now that you have a Poisson There. So now you have a Poisson structure on this specific projective space, it's also sort of geometrically motivated. You could have just defined the projective space starting from the bundle. Forget Fagin Odesky, whatever. Well, it turns out that the Poisson structure they came across invented whatever your view is of a Plato's world of mathematical ideas. Maybe they invented it. Mathematical ideas, maybe they invented it, maybe they discovered it. In any event, it turns out that Poisson structure can also be recovered geometrically, or at least Fagin and Rodesky claim it can. So Fagin and Dodesky make this claim. And again, maybe we're missing it, but we can see no traceable proof anyway. That the symplectic leaves of this Poisson structure on Pn minus one symplectic. Let me give this word another go at proper spelling. Symplectic leaves. Of this Poisson structure, I'm going to denote it by races on Pn minus one, have the following geometric or algebra geometric if you want interpretation, interpretation. Interpretation. Somehow, when you're actually spelling words for a talk, they all become too long. Take a rank two bundle that fits into such an extension. So E, it's a curly E is what I was going for with that bizarre character there. Bizarre character there. So curly O, O is the trivial bundle on the elliptic curve. Curly E is a rank two vector bundle, rank two, rank two vector bundle bundle. And L is the L I started out with. It's a line bundle. So line bundle, line bundle. Of course, what goes in the middle must be one of these rank two vector bundles. Pick an E and the symplectic lead. And the symplectic leaves are exactly the things of the form L of E, which by definition is going to be the space of all extensions. So all extensions Zero O goes to a middle term. Goes to a middle term, goes to L, goes to zero, such that this is set builder notation, this is a vertical bar, such that the middle term is isomorphic to E. So it's all of the extensions that recover E as the middle term. Yeah, so by Fagin and Dodesky, by their claim, these are supposed to be the symplectic leaves. Now you see one thing that's absolutely obvious is that the L of V partition P of n minus one, of course, each element of P of n minus one is up to isomorphism, one of these extensions. And what I mean by up to isomorphism is this: you call two of them isomorphic, if they fit. If they fit into this sort of commutative diagram with isomorphisms here, not identity necessarily, right? Because I'm taking, I'm not, X1 classifies them up to stronger isomorphism, where these vertical, these two outer vertical maps are identities. Pn minus one. Pn minus one, which is projectivized X1, classifies them up to isomorphism in this sense. So you mod out a further, it's a coarser equivalence relation on extensions. But in any event, given such an equivalence class of extensions, the isomorphism class of the middle term is uniquely determined. So it makes sense to define a specific. sense to define a specific isomorphism class of E for every point in P. And every point in Pn sits in exactly one of these L of E's. Any questions so far? So good, exactly midway through the talk. Okay, I will take that as a no question indicator and proceed. Indicator and proceed. So, right, so this was our motivation. Quite recently, 2018, 19, so these problems stayed, as far as we can tell, open for quite some time. Fagin and Odesky were publishing their papers in 89, 90, thereabouts, but initially in the late 80s and then midway through the 90s. So much more recently, Hua and Polishchuk have done some work on this. Hua and Polishchuk. But as far as I can tell, they also don't quite prove Fagin and Odesky's claim that these guys are the symplectic leaves. They prove something much more sophisticated. They prove something much more sophisticated. They prove some sort of derived algebraic geometry version of this. There's some derived stack, whatever, of which this thing L of E is somehow only the underived shadow. It's the naive version thereof, sort of like a coarse moduli versus a fine moduli space. That's roughly speaking the relationship between the notions. Relationship between the notions. And they get their results at the derived level, but to bring them down over to the standard more down to worth level, you need to know some things about these LOVs. Maybe something, niceness conditions, maybe smoothness might be enough. It's not clear. Maybe it's not enough. I'm not positive. But motivated by both the claim itself and this more recent work. And this more recent work that seemed to require knowledge of the LOV, we just decided to look into that. What can you say about these LOVs? What can we say? Inane as that might sound right now, this is a non-question, right? It can mean anything. These L of E spaces. Of E spaces. And by the way, we're calling these, I think the term was coined by my collaborator, Paul. We're calling these homological leaves because they are homologically motivated, right? They sit inside a projectivized X1, so that's the homological bit. And leaves because they're trying hard. Because they're trying hard to be symplectic leaves, but that part is still a bit murky. So, homological leaves is what we're calling these. Okay, so I will just state some results and fingers crossed, get you guys to an early. Crossed, get you guys to an early coffee break, and that'll be it. So, um, uh, first, let me start this discussion sort of from the other end. You see, what we did here in defining L of E is we started with L and among those extensions of L by O, we searched for the ones that have E sitting in the middle. Now, I'm going to fix E. So, fix. Fix E, so fix E fix an E that fits into some exact sequence with O and L as its extremes. And there's an abstract characterization of these E's. You know, much of it has to do with the Much of it has to do with a TS classification of indecomposable vector bundles, rank two vector bundles over an elliptic curve. These we're considering don't have to be indecomposable. So you have to also consider decomposable ones that would look like this: O of D direct sum O of D plus or D prime, rather, where O of D plus D prime. Of d plus d prime is isomorphic to l. So you will also have to consider these in addition to the indecomposable ones. But there is an abstract characterization of these of such ease that doesn't require me even mentioning extensions. There's a list. And then, having fixed E, I can consider all of those. So consider, consider. So consider, consider. Suppose consider starts with a C. Consider the subspace. Let's call it Y contained in H naught of E. So this is what? This is a set of sections of E. Now, not of L. There are no typos. There are no typos here, I think. Consisting of sections, what's a section? Well, it's a morphism from the trivial bundle to E. And I want only those sections whose co-kernel is torsion-free. So, this is familiar to people who like to play with modules, modulized spaces of torsion-free sheaves, etc. Of torsion-free sheaves, etc. It's very, very reminiscent of that. For which the quotient, let's call this S is torsion-free. And also, let me fix the determinant. See, if E fits. The determinant. See, if E fits inside such an extension, that forces the determinant of E, which is just the exterior power, the highest exterior power of E. That's what determinant means. It forces this isomorphism. So we're looking at rank two vector bundles of fixed determinant L. L is fixed. So the determinant has been fixed. Okay. Okay, so now I have this space of sections with torsion-free quotient. From it, I can map to my Pn minus one, which I will remind you was projectivized X1 of L by O by sending my section. I'm going to tell you exactly. I'm going to tell you exactly what this morphism does. You have to show that it's a morphism of varieties. That's a lemma. You're sending a section. This is a thing in Y, that's an element of Y. I'm sending a section to the class in Pn minus one of the extension O E with the S here. And then completed to a quotient ms. Now, if you think about this a little bit, I have imposed the condition that S have torsion-free co-kernel. So, this co-kernel is torsion-free, so it's a line bundle. And because that's O. Because that's O, and now this is an exact sequence of bundles. This line bundle is actually isomorphic to L. So I'm in here. I land in here. I get an extension of L by O from such a section. In other words, take your section completed to an exact sequence. That's the morphism. And it can be shown again that this is a morphism of algebraic varieties. Y is not a linear subspace, obviously. This is a non-linear. Obviously, this is a non-linear having torsion-free co-kernel is a non-linear condition. It's a sub-variety of a vector space regarding itself as a variety. So that's a morphism. And our theorem, well, it says a bunch of things, actually. I'm just going to try to squeeze as many as I can and then end it there. Our theorem says that this map. This map Y goes to P n minus one identifies L E well takes values in has image L E has image L E identifies Identifies the latter, it's L E, with its subscheme topology. Here's Zariski topology as a subspace with a geometric quotient in the sense of GIT theory, in the sense of Mumford. Y modulo automorphism group of E has a natural linear algebraic group structure. It's not reductive always. That's speaking of a to a call back to the preceding talk by Travis. We know a lot about quotients by reductive algebraic groups. Non-reductive ones are a lot less amenable. Less amenable to general results. So you get this guy as a geometric quotient. L E is in particular, as follows from this stuff, is locally closed in P n minus 1. The way I defined it, even that wasn't obvious. It wasn't even obvious it had some natural scheme structure. I just defined it as a subset of Pn minus 1. It wasn't clear it's even constructed. Minus one. It wasn't clear, it's even constructible to begin with. It's locally closed, locally closed in Pn minus one. It's smooth as well. So if Hawaiian Polish Chuk can use smoothness to complete this characterization of leaves, great. That's not so clear at this stage. Clear at this stage. A bunch of times, I'm not going to specify when or where, a bunch of times. Bunch of times, depending on E. For some E's, this happens, for some, it doesn't. It's affine. So this is an affine scheme, actually. Affine smooth scheme. L of E is affine. L of E is affine. In more cases, strictly more cases, so we know cases when it's quasi-affine but not affine. It's quasi-affine. And we know some cases when it's not even quasi-affine, not always. Not always and just to so I'm I'm gonna end the theorem here just one last sentence though I'm a bit long-winded so it might be kind of a long sentence um this issue of when it's sapphire when This issue of when it's saffine, when it's quasi-affine, again, depends on E. We can classify at this point this case, where you're of the form L of D, sorry, O of D, direct sum O of D prime, with this D of small degree, the smallest interesting degree. In this case, we can classify the situation completely. The situation completely. We know exactly when you're affine, when you're quasi-affine, and when not. You're affine exactly when you're quasi-affine, exactly when D prime is not a multiple of D. So when you do not have this sort of situation, n prime d for some n prime, for some n prime. In this case, you're affine. When you do have this. When you do have this isomorphism, you're no longer affine. So it's a bit like the pathologies that occur in Q deformation situations where Q is a root of unity. This should remind you of that. Okay, I will end. This is it.
