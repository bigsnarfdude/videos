And so, the subject of my talk will be a very classical one about irreducibility of parabolic induction. And it's a work which was prompted by a question of Madir, Matrange, not a long time ago. So it's a recent work. And I'm not sure that it's completely new. I think it's known by a lot of people. And so we will see. So we will see. But so let's say that G is a reductive group and P is a parabolic subgroup and pi is an irreducible representation of L. Of Erla. Um, so excuse me, I take the wrong set of notes. So, the goal is to give sufficient condition. On pi, and by this, since I will speak about real reductive groups, I will mean on the infinitesimal character of pi so that the induced representation is irreducible. So, it's a very classical subject. And so, now assume that G is real. So, in that case, I have long-lamps decomposition of the P factor. It's a direct product here. So, I can write pi as an external tensor product of an irreducible representation here, pi m of m. Here by M of M, and here some character of A, and A is a split group. So let's write it as exponential of its Lie algebra, A0, like this. So the character chi can be parameterized by a parameter new and new. Parameter new and new is in the dual of the Lie algebra. Okay, and the first result I want to state is that for generic new well, the induced representation Is irreducible. So, what means generic here? So, the parameter new is in a vector space, a complex vector space, a star, and so it's for new outside countable. Countable locally finite union of hyperplanes of affine hyperplanes. Okay, so that was the question asked by Nadir. He asked me about a reference for this. Me about a reference for this result in the real case because in the PIDIC case, so we have the analog result for in the PID case. And for PIDIC, the result is well known. There is two proofs published to my knowledge. The first one is by François Sauvagot and the second one is by Jean-François Dat. Is by Jean-François Dat, which is actually a beautiful proof, very algebraic in nature, using Bernstein technique. But both of these proofs are quite difficult to adapt to the real case. And I was surprised not to find a reference in the literature about a statement like that. Okay. And also Also, here I will give sufficient conditions, and I hope that they will be flexible enough to have other applications that this one. And another application will be to give a simple proof of an irreducibility result that we use in our work with Colette Moglin on outer packets. So, there is still a connection with the main topic of the conference here. Because, well, I'll talk about that later. So, what are my assumptions on G? So, G here will be a linear connected excuse me, will be a finite index with here G With here G a connected algebraic reductive group defined over R. So in particular, G is linear and it has abelian carton subgroups. And all of our favorite groups, like the classical groups, GLN, SLN, SOPQs, SOPQs, sympathetic groups are in that class. What are representations of this group for me? I will mean a finite length Arichandra modules. So it means that I choose a Carton involution, theta. And K is the maximal compact subgroup, and I have a Carton decomposition of the Lie algebra as usual. Since the letter P will be used for parabolic, I will use the letter S here for the other. For the other part of the Carton decomposition, and I will so this will be the category so of this Arrich Chambre modules of finite length Arrich Chambre modules so here I could put G of K, but I will just simplify. Just simplify the notation by just putting a G here instead. And I will need also the Grottending group of this category. And if I fix an infinitesimal character, chi, then I will just denote by Just denote by I will add the subscript chi everywhere and so irreducible of G chi will be the equivalence classes of Of irreducible representations in this category, and by a result of Arish Chandras, we know that this set is finite, and thanks to And thanks to the work of many people, so Arish Chandra, Longland, Kinap and Zuckerman, and Vaughan. We have a nice set of parameters for this set of representation. So the set of parameters, I will denote it like this. So I won't be too specific for now about the parameters, but let me just say that they look like something like this. First, we choose a carton subgroup, which is data stable. Status stable carton. Then there is a character. of this of this Carton subgroup, then something which lives in the complexified dual realgebox, which will give the infinite decimal character of the parameter. And sometimes we need some extra data here, depending on so plus some conditions. And so all of this is in is in a vogel. All of this is in a Vogan green book. And so the from a parameter one can construct a standard representation. Presentation. So first, H is equal to TA. So this factor A here gives a parabolic parabolic with central split part A. And so the parameter here Allows us to construct a representation, a standard representation, which is induced from a limit of a discrete series of M and then some parameter here on A and nothing on A. Matter here on A and nothing on L. So the usual construction. And inside, attached to this parameter, there is a unique Longlands quotient, irreducible quotient. So it means that the N here, the polarization of the parabolic has to be. The polarization of the parabolic has to be chosen to be negative or positive, so that it's a quotient here. And so the theorem is that this map here induces a one-to-one map, not between the set of parameters as I defined, but I need to take. As I defined, but I need to take K-contrécy classes of parameters to the set of irreducible representation of G with infinitesimal character chi. And yeah, here in the parameter set, there is a condition on gamma bar so that the infinitesimal character of the representation here is really. Of the representation here is really tight. Okay. So now in the Grotendic group, I can decompose a standard representation. In terms of, so this bracket here just means that I take image of the representations in the Grotendic group. So here I have some. I can decompose a standard representation into irreducible for gamma in the parameter set. And in fact, this system of linear equations can be inverted because, for instance, we can introduce a length function on the parameter set so that Uh if the multiplicity is non-zero, then the the length of uh gamma has to be smaller than the length of delta and if the lengths are equal then Then gamma has to be equal to delta. And also the multiplicity one of the Long Lance quotient in the standard representation implies that M delta delta is equal to one. Okay, so it's a triangular system with one on the diagonal, so it's invertible. So we can write also that Also, that the irreducible in the Groton D group, we can write irreducible as a linear combination. Of standard representations. Okay, and so now we have the cache downstick Vaughan theory. Let me just call this JLV for cash diagnostic volume. L V for cash-dagnostic Vaughan. So it's a cash-dagnostic theory adapted by Vaughan to the case of real reductive groups. And one of the results of this theory is that these multiplicities are computable. In fact, they are given by cache-dynastic polynomials. So let me call this Chasland Music Vogue polynomials at one. So, in fact, what the cash dynamic Wagon algorithm computes is really these polynomials. So, now, how this applies to the irreducibility problem? So, let us fix. Now, I will add a symbol flat here just to fix this parabolic subgroup because I will need also variable parabolic subgroups. And so it's And so it's L flat and flat and pi is irreducible for this L B model with this L flat with an infinitesimal character chi. Up to conjugacy I can I can assume that L is a theta stable. So, there is a maximal parabolic K-flat, which is just a K-intersected flat, and it's also K-intersected with M. So, these are maximal compact subgroups of M and L, respectively. So, now if pi is an irreducible representation. Is an irreducible representation, it means that I can write it as irreducible of delta for some parameter delta, but now for the group L. Okay. So I can write pi uh as before. Write pi as before, but this time I will put L here as a subscript to say that we are in the in the power in the leg factor Levy factor L And now, since a parabolic induction is an exact functor, I can just induce. So it will mean that the induce from p flat to g of pi in the Grothendieck group can be written. With the same coefficient, and here what I get is the standard, is the induced of standard of gamma so now chaia was an infinite. Was an infinitesimal character for L, but through a rich chamber isomorphism, it also defined an infinitesimal character for G. And furthermore, if if I have a parameter like this For L bemo for L flat, uh, well, it defines uh it's also it's also a parameter for G. So, in fact, uh, what I get like this is a map. What I get like this is a map from the parameter set here up to a contricacy in L to the set of parameters in G up to conjugacy like this. And this map is not objective because the two parameters could be conjugate two parameters for L could be conjugate in G without being conjugate in L. Can conjugate in L. Okay. And but one important thing is that the induced representation of the standard. So let me call this in fact this correspondence is just the identity on the for parameters, but I will distinguish by a letter G to say that it's now I consider To say that it's now I consider it as a parameter for G. And by a transitivity of parabolic induction, here what I get is just the irreducible standard representation which corresponds to delta of G. Okay, so excuse me, I will just maybe use that again to write it. Again, to write it here multiplicities, but now here what I have is the standard representation of but here is the delta G. Here is the delta G standal representation of gamma G. Okay, and so now I could compare this to maybe just let me what is detailed after No, no, no, no, not yet. So uh pi uh pi was a representation of L. Uh so it's uh I I I I wrote pi as uh irreducible f of delta. irreducible of delta where delta is a parameter for L and now when I consider the induced representation the induced representation of pi I induce everything in that formula and here what I get is a linear combination of standard representation of G after induction okay and and so now I can compare it with the fact that irreducible of delta G Of delta G is also equal to let me call that eta now in the parameter set for G of Mg of eta delta G standard of eta so let's call this two so now if I compare If I compare one and two, I see that I would get irreducibility if I can prove the following two things. If I have the following two conditions, first the map from the parameter set, so from L to the parameter set for G. For G is one to one. So I get really a bijection between the two parameter step and two for all gamma delta in the parameter set for L. The multiplicity are the same. Okay, because then, so here it's if I have these two conditions, then I see that the induced representation from P to G of From P to G of pi is equal in so in the Grotend D group, but at the end, so I get an equivalence with the irreducible parametrized by the parameter delta G. Okay, so this idea to use the cache diagnostic algorithm to get some irreducibility result is not new. Not new. It was known by David Vaughan, for instance, of course, because all the theory is due to him. But I could also find this idea in published work, notably Matumoto in a paper in 2004. He used exactly this idea to prove irreducibility result of parabolic induction. And more recently, in a paper. And more recently, in a paper of Ichino and Gano, Gan and Ichino, which also uses this idea. So, this idea is not new. So, the only thing I want to stress here is that I want to give flexible conditions, really, for these two conditions to be satisfied, so you can have it can easily be applied in other contexts. Easily be applied in other contexts and for other problems. If well, I don't know what I want to give is sufficient condition, so it could. It could be it could be that without this condition you still get irreducibility, but I don't know. I haven't studied the converse. Okay. So let me explain how it works. So we will start by fixing a fundamental Carton subgroup. H gimo H flat H flat M sorry the note the notations are not uh are maybe not uh very light. Uh I could improve that, but uh and uh so now H And uh so now H uh H B is uh if I if I add the the the the split component of uh of the parabolic it will give me a decomposition like this for this fundamental Carton subgroup in L. And so now the And so now I can fix the infinitesimal character chi. So this is the infinitesimal character. By Arichandra isomorphism, it corresponds to an element ψ in the dual of the Lie algebra. And I will decompose it as the part which lives on M and the part mu which lives on A flat. Be more A flat and this is in uh in H M star so let me give uh first uh a set of hypothesis of hypothesis which will guarantee that uh I get the the conditions of I get the conditions over there. So, the first one will be that this part here of the infinitesimal character is non-singular for the for the levy factor M here and equivalently. Is non-singular for L because the parameter new here is central for L, so it doesn't play a role here. And condition B is that for all root of alpha of H of the My Carton sub algebra in So, n is the Lie algebra of the Nipotent part of the parabolic. When I evaluate alpha on Xi, it's not an integer. Okay. So, with these two. So, with these two conditions, I get the following. So, let me call R of G what sita. So, this is the integral root system of chi. So, it's inside the root system of H in G. Well, it will be. Well, it will be also the integral root system in L. You see, because the condition I impose, the condition B here I impose says that all integral roots come from L and no extra integral root can come from M. Well, it's usual, it means that for all roots, but here for alpha in the root system in L so it's a regular infinitesimal character if you Yeah, so the integral root system are the same. Then also the infinitesimal character is also non-singular for G. Then the map here is really one to one now and uh here I will be uh And uh here I will be uh a little bit vague, but uh the the cache dynastic Vaughan algorithm in L and G are the same. So I need to explain this a little bit, but uh for for so so the consequence will be that the the the the cache dynastic polynomials Polynomials will be the same for the parameter consider as parameter in L or as parameter in G. And so it implies that the multiplicities will be the same. And you see that the condition condition B here is generic in U. So, ah so condition B has disappeared. What was condition B? Condition B was alpha. Condition B was alpha not in Z, so it avoids a countable number of hyperplanes. So, this is this is already generic in new this condition. Okay, so this. So this gives a sufficient condition, these two conditions, A and B, which were here. In the case, we start with non-singular infinitesimal character on the PV factor. For singular infinitesimal character Things are a little bit more complicated. We need to use the Zook command translation functors to reduce the problem to the non-singular case. So use German transition so we introduce So we introduce a regular non-singular infinitesimal character chi prime, and we have our chi here, and there is a translation. And here I refer to the book by Adams, Barbash, and Vaughan, chapter 16, I think, where all of this is explained, how you use this. Where all of this is explained, how you use this translation data to get results about the cache diagnostic algorithm from the non-singular case to the singular case. But so the set of hypotheses here is a little bit different. So Here, the hypothesis are the following. Well, the first one is the same actually. So, B. So this really ensures that the integral root system are the same in L in G, and this is fundamental for the cache dynamistic algorithm to be the same in L and G. And I have two other sets of hypotheses: C or D. C or D. So the first one is for any W in the while group such that if I take the the the m part of the parameter xi uh minus w minus it's translated by w. Translate by W okay is non-zero such that if this is non-zero then new is not in the strict a fin subspace. Subspace of solutions of the linear equation w nu minus nu is equal to this second second term. Okay so if there are solutions the the There are solutions. Uh, the dimension of this alpha in subspace is the dimension of the kernel, and the kernel is strictly smaller because we assume that this is non-zero, so this has to be non-zero too. And C2 is for all alpha a root in N Well, it's a regular with respect to new is regular with respect to this. And I also have condition D, which is simpler to state. Is that I want if I have an element w which fixes my infinitesimal character, then w has to be in L okay. So then if B and C Or D and D are satisfied, we get the same result as before. So at the end, we get the equality of multiplicity. And uh, so the first condition B and C that's that's good for the statement of generic irreducibility because you well it was there, but you can see from what I wrote for condition C that that it's really generic in parameter new. So for generic new. So, for generic new, this condition is satisfied. And this one, well, I will give an application of this sufficient hypothesis. So, how it works. So, it's based on the cache-dynamistic Vogan algorithm. So, I won't explain this, but associated to the integral root system of our infinite. system of our infinitesimal character there is an echo algebra so first there is a while group and then there is the corresponding echo algebra which is over z of u one half u minus one half okay and and we can form also for For our parameter set, let's say for G, we can form a how do I call that? Some echo module. So it's a free module of this this ring. This ring with basis this parameter set. But so it's also a module for this EQ algebra. And so the structure of this module is really complicated. It's done in the work of David Vogan, how to define this EQ algebra action on the ECU module. And so everything, the So the everything, so the cal dynastic polynomials are really completely characterized by this Ecker algebra structure on the Ecker module. Okay, so now we see that since the integral root system are the same for L and G, so the EK algebra will be the same. And since the parameter set are in one-to-one correspondence, the module will be the same. The module will be the same as free module of a D string. So we have to check now that the AQ algebra structures are really the same for L and G. And this is just bookkeeping. You have to read Vaughan's paper and just check that everything works well with this condition. Okay. And since I have still some time, I can. Since I have still some time, I can explain maybe another. So, before I discovered that this idea was already used in papers by Matsumoto and Gian Ichino, I had the idea of using this in a work with Colette Moglin about the construction of archer packets for classical groups. So So in the it it simplifies uh It simplifies the last step of the construction in the way I will explain. So, how it works. So, it works for real classical groups. We construct outer packets. To fix ideas, let's say it will be the same for all classical groups. So, I take my favorite one, SP to N. So, that the dual group is SOP to N plus 1. So 2n plus 1 C. And so I consider an outer parameter for this. So it goes from the value times 2 plus 1. And here I compose with the natural inclusion into GL to N plus 1. And I see this as completely reducible. Representation of WR cross SL2. Okay, so I reduce it in irreducible components. So from the decomposition into irreducible components. In the decomposition, there will be two kinds of terms: the one of good parity and the one of bad parity. And the one of good parities, there are two different kinds. There are two different kinds: the unipotent ones and the discrete ones. So it means that my parameter here as a representation of this group can be written as the part of bad parity plus a part of a uniparity. A discrete part which is of good parity and a unipotent part. Okay? So, how our construction works? First, we so first we have to start from the unipotent packets, meaning when the parameter psi is equal to its unipotent part. So, the first step of Part. So the first step of the construction is the case of a unipotent good parity. It means that the orbit here is even, I think. And so we get the corresponding packet PIPSIU of some syncretic group. Then from this, From this we get to the case where psi is of a good parity. So we are the discrete part. And so psi u now becomes a parameter for smaller or smaller SP and we call And we construct the members of the outer packets here by homological induction by adding this discrete part. So this is the part I want to talk about today. But so we get a construction of the outer packet psi when psi is of good parity. Okay, so here it's we go to psi. We go to psi u to psi u plus psi d using homological induction induction and it's really the the the the crucial uh the crucial step. Uh I must say that uh Unipoton packets are still a little bit mysterious to to me. Uh I consider them as given as a black box. That them has given us a black box. Colette Moglin knows much more than me about unipotent packets, but I don't think there is a complete result somewhere, written somewhere for classical groups of unipotent archer packets. Uh one w would have to use um recent work of uh Chenbo and his collaborators to to really uh uh see what are the the unipotent packets. Are the unipotent packets? Okay, and the last step is to go from now from a parameter of good parity to a general parameter of bad parity. But the part of bad parity has the following property: it can be written as rho plus its contragradient. You can it's a it's even dimensional and you can. It's even dimensional, and you can split it like this. So, rho is a representation into some GLN rho of C, and so it's the alpha parameter for a representation of G L N of G L N rho of R. Of R that I will denote by the same letter Rho, just to confuse people. Okay. So now so now we have we have we have this we have our group sp to n r and we have sp two n minus n rho r and g l And G L and Rho R. And this is a Levy factor inside this one of a parabolic P is equal to, let me call this G and this one G prime. So G I'm just G okay. Okay. And for this, let's assume we have constructed the packets corresponding to the good parity part. So it's a packet for this group. Okay, so now I can take an irreducible representation in the outer packet here. Okay, and to construct the corresponding representation in the outer packet for psi here, what I just do is induce. Just do is induce from P to G this representations. So it's obvious that the conditions on outer packets will be satisfied. It means that this representation will satisfy the standard endoscopic identities and also the twisted endoscopic identities. Also, the twisted ion scoping identity. But what is not obvious is that this is irreducible. Okay? And now, so in another paper with Colette, we gave an argument for the irreducibility of this parabolic induction, but it's a very complicated argument. It's based on a result of Matumoto on irreducibility for unitary groups, and then there is a long argument using intertwining operators and things. Using intertwining operators and things like that. So it was very complicated. Colette found this argument and it's very, very nice. But now this irreducibility here is, I think, is a consequence of what I said before. Because what happened here, what does it mean? Good parity for the infinitesimal character. So good parity for sp For sp means that the infinitesimal character which corresponds here will be with integers entries. So the coordinates in the usual coordinate system will be integers for the good parity part and for the bad parity part. Well, the coordinates of the infinitesimal character will be anything but in Be anything but integers. Okay. So, ah, excuse me, here I forgot something. Because we want to induce from this levy factor, so I missed the row part here. Okay. So, here it's the representation of this part of the Levy factor, and row is the representation of this part of the Levy factor. So, now you see that here we have an infinitesimal character with An infinitesimal character with integer coordinates, and here an infinitesimal character with non-integer coordinates. So the preceding conditions I stated apply to this immediately. Especially, we see that if we have something like that, it implies that W is realized. that w is uh is realized in the in the l part because it acts by uh the value group acts by uh um permutation of coordinates and sign changes so it cannot mix these two kinds of of of coordinates for the infinitesimal character okay I think I'll stop here
