So we'll talk about non-local invection diffusion models. Just a few words about while poseness. This is a rather subtle question. Some kind of straightforward linear analysis of pattern formation. And then some weekly nonlinear analysis trying to look at what happens near bifurcation points. And then it turns out that for these systems, there's a very nice energy functional that we can use to try to gain insight. And then some numerical simulations, which are a lot of fun. Which are a lot of fun, and then returning to something closer to biology by simulating an associated stochastic process that is approximated by the PDE. And so this is the model here. And we have greater than or equal to two populations, and u is the density for each population, and there's some random component of motion, and then there's some induction. And the thing that's a little bit interesting, or something. And the thing that's a little bit interesting or subtle is the form of the invection term. And the invection term is nonlinear and it allows sort of cross-interactions with the gamma ijs. And so you can interact with yourself or you can interact with other groups through this kernel, spatial kernel K. K star U is the spatially averaged Spatially averaged density of U. And so we have a diffusion coefficient and a spatially averaging kernel. And so one... K could be the same for all of the J's. It could be the same for all the J's, or it could be different. Yeah. And usually we use it as the same when we do our simulations and so forth, but it need not be the same. Yeah. And the gammas can be different too. And so depending on the sign. And so, depending on the sign, you're going to have attraction or avoidance. And it's a direct nonlinear interactions that are non-local in the advection term. And so, maybe the simplest kind of K is just a top hat, or we could have a bell curve or something like that. And so, we're thinking of K typically as being monotonically non-increasing and integrating to unity. And so the detection mechanisms for interacting at a distance could just be direct observations, it could be visual observations, it could be indirect communication. You can come up with kind of more complicated sub-models that allow for scent marking and things like that that would then fit into this. And it could also possibly include memory of past interactions. People have worked on that, like myself and Howe and Bill. Myself and Howe and Bill and others. And so now the gammas are really the interesting part. If the gammas are negative, there's attraction. And if they're positive, there's repulsion. And so if we have self-attraction, we can show it with the gamma negative. Repulsion would be positive gamma. If we have two groups, then we could have. Two groups, then we could have mutual attraction or mutual avoidance or pursue and avoid. And mutual attraction would have both the gammas negative, avoidance would be both gammas positive, and pursue and avoid would have different signs on the gammas. And so we're kind of thinking as a fairly general non-local interaction term. But these are kind of new models. They haven't been widely used. And so what I want to talk about today is just to advertise. What I want to talk about today is just to advertise them and to talk about the properties a little bit. And so, and of course, you can have more complicated things. You can, depending on how you think groups are interacting, you could make it more complex. And so, what we've done is we've done everything on a torus, not particularly biologically reasonable, but it allows us to sidestep the issue of boundary conditions. Of boundary conditions, and because we have these non-local terms, they just sort of wrap around. So that was for mathematical convenience. But hopefully, if you have a sort of a large enough domain, and if you're interested in what happens in the middle, then the boundary conditions don't drive the process. And there's a kind of a conservation of total mass because all these terms are doing are describing movement in space, and there's no creation. Space, and there's no creation or destruction of individuals. And so there's applications shown here to predator-prey dynamics, territoriality, cell aggregation, and even human gangs of sort of related models to these. So we're not the first to do it, but I think we're kind of just trying to pull these things together. The issue of well poseness is an interesting one, and I'll just go back here. Back here, there is a very strong nonlinearity in this advection term. And you can imagine if k kind of approached a delta function, then it would just give us the value for u. And you'd be moving up gradients of your own density or gradients of other animals' density. And you could imagine there'd be some kind of blow-up issue that would occur, much as there is in chemotaxis. Much as there is in chemotoxis. But then K is like spatial averaging. So it should kind of regularize things a little bit. And so the question is, is that spatial averaging kind of enough to prevent blow-up? And so, and I won't spend a lot of time on this. This was mainly spearheaded by Thomas. But we do have a global existence theorem for weak solutions. Theorem for weak solutions in arbitrary space dimension with constraints on k, though. So they're quite strong. K has to be twice differentiable. So that top hat distribution wouldn't have done the trick. And with the gradient not blowing up. And in one dimension, we can show that the solutions are classical and strictly positive. Solutions are classical and strictly positive. Do you think that that condition is necessary? Like, if you take a Top Hat kernel, just do some things numerically that seem bad? Yeah, no. So very good question. So I think what we need to do is to prevent k from looking like a delta function. And I believe if you have steep edges on the pot hot, it shouldn't make a difference, but we couldn't get there all the way. Get there all the way. And so if you let k go to a delta function, it's possible to show that you can get finite time low-up in space dimension two or higher. Yeah. We have done that for the top hat one. Oh, that's good. Good. Okay. That's wonderful. Okay. Okay. So when we look at this, we know there's a conservation of total density. We know there's a conservation of total density, and so there's an integral condition that says the total mass is conserved, or the total number of individuals is conserved. And so there's a spatially homogeneous steady state. And so the first thing you might think about doing is just looking at the potential for pattern formation from a spatially homogeneous equilibrium by getting a sort of Fourier type analysis. And so that's what we would. And so that's what we would do here. These are the stars show the equilibria, and there's a wave number q and a wave growth rate lambda. And so we would plug this into the linearized form of the system. And so we get what we'd normally call a dispersion relation here. And the growth rate depends on the wave number. And it's sort of interesting that this is degenerate in the sense. This is degenerate in the sense that because the total number of individuals is conserved, there's going to be always a zero eigenvalue that comes up here for q being zero, associated with the constant solutions. And then there's this other part here, L, which is based on the linearization. Okay, so the linearization just involves these terms here. And so if i equals j, And so if i equals j, it has a diffusion term. And if it doesn't, then it doesn't have the diffusion term. And so we can kind of think about what might happen here just based on the linearization, which is a nice way to start. And so if we have no self-interactions, we can get stationary aggregates if we have this interaction positive. So either both mutual avoidance or mutual avoidance. Mutual avoidance or mutual attraction. And so these are the kinds of patterns that arise. This is space here, and this is time. And so this is a mutual avoidance. And so we are getting things that sort of look like territories just based on this linear analysis. And the mutual attraction now, they both line up. Yeah, okay. So then we can take it a little further and look at what happens if we have, say, Happens if we have, say, strong self-interaction and pursue an avoidance. And so here, the product of the cross terms is negative. And so we get these kinds of ripples, wave-type solutions as we go forward in time. So that sort of tells us a little bit about potential for pattern formation, but we'd like to take it a little bit further. We'd like to take it a little bit further and look at what happens near the process of pattern formation. And you could sort of try to use some kind of center manifold type theorem or results, or you could do it in a more formal way using weakly nonlinear analysis, which is sort of an asymptotic method for trying to achieve the same goal. And so we assume we're in a particular situation where there's no self-interactions. Self-interactions, and the interactions with other groups are symmetric. And your gamma value is just a small distance away from the critical value that's going to give you an unstable wave number. And we define epsilon. And then we look on certain time and space scales to see what kinds of patterns might arise. And so it turns out to look like this in terms of a regular asymptotic expansion. Of a regular asymptotic expansion. There is your constant term, order epsilon term, order epsilon squared, and epsilon cubed. And I mean, these methods are quite old. I remember learning about the work when I was a graduate student from Bertie Matkowski, who was a Northwestern who had done all these things like physics. It's very similar that way, but Valeria was also an expert on this, and she did some beautiful work on that. And so, what we have. And so, what we have is we have these order epsilon terms and A or amplitudes. And we also have some other term here, which is a little bit more exotic, which is a constant term here in the order epsilon squared. And this arises from the fact that we have a zero eigenvalue, and so we have to account for that somehow. And so, when we kind of use the machinery of regular asymptotic expansions, and then we have to have solvability. Then we have to have a solvability condition and so on and so forth, then we get these equations on a slow time scale for A and B. And so you look at A here, there is a linear term, and then there's a nonlinear term, and then there's a final AB term here. And so the sine of sigma and lambda are going to be important in terms of the structure near the bifurcation pole. And so we can actually, we've got these parameters. actually we've got these parameters sigma lambda nu and well and gamma and we can interpret what they mean here and so we have the interspecies interaction parameter and then this is called the stewart landau coefficient it's positive then we are unstable and if it's negative we're stable and then this is the interaction from the nonlinearity here Linearity here, and it'll tell us if we have a supercritical or subcritical bifurcation. And then this term gamma, which is a composite of parameters, will tell us some things about the stability when lambda is positive in terms of if we have stable or unstable or so supercritical bifurcations. Okay, so this is sort of the machinery that we can use to look at things a bit. A bit. And sometimes it works great. And so this is the analytic solution. These are the numerical solutions. These are showing how it shifts very little over a long period of time. And this is a case where we have a small sensing range and a supercritical light variation. Sometimes we have a discontinuous phase transition, is what we call it. Our analysis. Is what we call it. Our analysis shows us something like this: supercritical unstable bifurcation. But then, what we're picking up is another branch that's far away from the equilibrium. And so that's what we see. So that gives us a little bit of a hint of what we might be seeing. But it turns out, like, for many of these things, like we heard about the kind of talk yesterday that. About the talk yesterday that was using energy functionals near the end of the day that were related to the Kant-Hilliard equation. And so, in physics, this is often what people do, and they have an energy functional. And it turns out that there is an energy functional for the system, which is quite beautiful. And so we just focused on this case where the gamma ij's were equal to the gamma ji's. And so then we can show actually that. We can show actually that this energy functional is not increasing in time and it's bounded below by a constant. And if it is a constant, then the system is at steady state. And it turns out that for appropriate initial data, there's a local minimum of the energy depending on the initial condition such that we approach that asymptotic limit on time. That asymptotic limit of time. And so these are local minima are steady states. So it's quite interesting to be able to do this. It turns out, you know, when we had, when we were doing this, I got very excited and I thought we were done. And then Thomas said, no, no, no, no. You need a little bit more. And indeed, it's true. And I'll just point that out here and direct the questions to Thomas. And direct the questions to Thomas on this. But there is a little piece missing in terms of being able to make a global statement about converging to every solution converging to a steady state as opposed to fluctuating in perpetuity. But we conjecture that that is true based on a mixture of optimism and numerical simulations. So interesting. So, interesting, maybe that we could call it an open problem, right? For someone. But then, if you have these minimum energy solutions, you might wonder what they look like. And it turns out we can, so what we're trying to do is we're trying to find the u's that are going to give the appropriate value for the energy. And so, there's a particular case where we can do things analytically. Yeah. Finny. Um you said uh there was something missing that didn't allow you to make the desired conclusion. What was the something that was missing? I'd like to defer that to the question period and then have Thomas answer that because it's quite a long lengthy discussion and uh but great question um and uh so uh yeah so here uh we we Here we thought about this case where the kernel got closer and closer to a delta function. So we know if it is a delta function, we can have low-up. But we might consider a case where it's just close to a delta function in some sense. And in that limit, we're able to calculate these solutions analytically. So it's a subtle limit because we can't take it all the way, but as we approach As we approach delta functions for the case, our solutions approach piecewise constant solutions. And so these are the kinds of things that we'll see. And we've sort of gone through and categorized what they are. And this is one that we would think of as a classical territorial pattern formation situation. Here, it's just aggregations. Here, what is aggregation? Here, one is aggregating and the other is spreading itself uniformly. And then here, they're both aggregating together. And the final one, they're both sharing space equally. And so I probably have five minutes, right? A little more. Okay, then I'll just kind of point out that Valeria was able to map out these different kinds of. map out these different kinds of solutions in parameter space here. And so we, this is a case where the gamma11 is equal to the gamma12, okay, and the gamma12 is equal to the gamma21. So it's symmetric interactions. And so you could consider a case here, say, where you see these sort of territorial patterns. And so they're basically found over here where you Over here, where you have mutual avoidance and you may or may not have mutual attraction. So, mutual avoidance is kind of key for these. And then, if we're going to this area here, you want mutual avoidance and self-attraction. And so you'll see that here. And then similarly, we can find these other ones in here. For example, if I were to take the case where there's no patterns at all. The case where there's no patterns at all, there's self-avoidance is the key element here. So there's a sort of way to kind of tie in these patterns in the limiting case to the parameters qualitatively. If we look at this case here in two dimensions, it looks like this. So these are computer simulations for n equals 3, 4, and 5. For n equals 3, 4, and 5, just based on mutual avoidance. I'm going to try to run a couple little videos here. This is for pursuit and evasion, or chase and run. And A is the chaser and B is the runner. And here, the sensing range for the chaser and the runner is the same. And so this sensing range refers to the kernel that Abner asked about when. Asked about when alpha A is the same as alpha B, the kernels are essentially identical. And so let me just try to run that. And get these pretty pictures, seasick pictures. And these are, I'm not really involved in this part of the work. It's hilarious work with Thomas and others, but I just thought I'd advertise it because it's so fascinating. Let me just say. So fascinating. Let me just say this case here is where the chaser has less of a range of sensing than the runner. And we get, so the runner just goes to the middle, and then the chaser can't find it. So it's just sort of elsewhere. And then this is where the chaser has a sensory range that's larger than the runner. And we get these kind of interesting patterns. Of interesting patterns here of like we might think of those more as classical pursuit and evasion patterns. And so the last thing I want to just mention here is we can sort of try to relate these more to real biological systems. And of course, biological systems are comprised of individuals. And so we can sort of look at point processes that are approximated by the reaction diffusion model. The reaction diffusion model and look at the individuals and simulate them over time. And we can see aggregation and segregation and pursuit and avoidance type patterns also in these related point processes. And so somehow these PDEs aren't just limited to these function spaces that we know they exist on. They're somehow analogs for real things that we are interested in scientifically. And one thing we're And one thing we're most interested in here is this story about Yellowstone, where initially there were coyotes there, and then the wolves moved in, took over the good territory, and kind of pushed the coyotes out. So we tried to simulate that. And here we have a solution after a long period of time where we've included environmental preferences. So the green areas are nicer, and so the wolves and coyotes are happily coexisting in the darker green areas. Areas. And then this is a case where the coyotes avoid the wolves, but the wolves aren't being territorial. And the coyotes are blue, and the wolves are magenta. And you can see that they're kind of being pushed out to the hinterland. And then this final case, we're letting the wolves self-aggregate with the purple colors. And now they move in together, and then the coyotes sort of move in these spaces between the birth colors. So, just in conclusion, the model supports kind of stationary and oscillating patterns, and we can understand a little bit with these weakly nonlinear analysis methods. The energy functional is quite useful, although we have to be really careful about the way we're taking limits when we do that analysis. And I think we've sort of at least initially demonstrated this connection. Demonstrated this connection to processes that are a bit more reasonable biologically. And so there's some work in progress. I have this student, Johnson Yu, who just finished at the University of Victoria. And he said, well, what happens if we add growth to these equations? Because everything was sort of just spatial, right? So he just looked at this very simple equation that had logistic growth and the terms that we saw for a single equation. And he thought of that. Equation, and he thought of that as some kind of perturbation of Fisher's equation. So, if there were no vection, it would be a classic Fisher equation. And he could actually prove the existence of trial and wave solutions, existence of solutions and existence of trial and wave solutions, and come up with approximation for that. And he just graduated, and hopefully, that'll be a paper forthcoming, maybe in the Journal of Math Biology. I know Valeria is working with Thomas and Jonathan on further analysis in 2D, and she's working with Jose Currillo on these energy minimizers, which are quite subtle. And then some of the pictures I showed for the chase and run were actually from this work here. And the thing I'm really excited about is adding another level of interaction where individuals can tune their kernels. Where individuals can tune their parameters for how they move, so as to try to maximize their fitness and to think about that as a game. But we're not very far on that. These were some acknowledgements. Okay, thanks everyone. Questions for a couple of minutes? It's really beautiful the kind of information you have. So I have two questions. One question is: so Is so how you able to classify the values of gamma ij, I assume it's a constant, right? It's not dynamic. Gamma Ij, the attractions and the gamma ijs are constants that are either positive, negative, or zero. So is there any way to classify the value of intensity such that you have different patterns? Is any correlations there, you know, how many of them or how much, such that you are able to have even too much without you know, they are going to be. People too much without separate our UI. Yeah, yeah. I I think if I understand your question right, then I you know this might this might help a little bit. This is a particular case where we assume that gamma 12 and gamma 21 are the same, and gamma11 and gamma22 are the same. So they're symmetric interactions. But in that case, we think of these as the We think of these as the nonlinear patterns that can arise, sort of territories, mutual aggregations that are separated, one aggregation, one territory, mutual aggregations that are on top of each other, and constant space use. And then what Valerie managed to do is to then divide up this parameter space for gamma 1, 1 in the vertical direction and gamma 1, 2 in the horizontal direction. To in the horizontal direction, and see how these parameter combinations would lead to different figures here. Is that kind of what you're thinking of? Yeah, I think we can see that. But sometimes also gamma ij can be time-dependent. So I just. Oh, if the gamma ijs are time-dependent, yeah. Because nothing will always avoid, sometimes they can. Yeah. Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah. That would be very interesting. We haven't thought about that, but I think it would be a great extension of the model. And potentially. And potentially, the last thing I talked about, where you'd have sort of like a game, right? Then you're thinking of each group as changing their gamma IJs over time. So let's try to increase their fitness. And then we'd see an evolution of those over time. Yeah. One more point is at the beginning of this last picture, right? So is it that the blue have different size? Oh, for the wolfpacks? Yeah. Yeah, they are different sizes, yeah. So is it sometimes the territory of the population? Is it sometimes the territory also proportional to the population size? That's a good question. Yeah, not entirely. No, there is often people have found these power law type relationships between area and pack size, but I didn't include them. But in our model, though, we could have different amounts of each group, like gamma one could sorry, U one could have more mass than U two. So there's lots of things to do. We're we feel like we're just scratching the surface actually. I feel like we're just scratching the surface actually. Thank you. Okay, here, thanks. Great question. Yeah, for sure. Related to some of what you asked. So, yesterday we heard about fish spoils and other things. I know you've been interested in those. And sometimes they use kernels where there's short-term repulsion and long-term attraction. If I said correctly, your kernels between a pair of species, it's either positive or negative. Are there any chances of including both? Oh, my goodness. Yeah. Oh my goodness. Yeah, yeah. I think you could, right? I mean, you could potentially, for each interaction, you could have one kernel that's describing attraction and one kernel that's describing repulsion. And then take a weighted combination of those. And those kernels could have different shapes. And that would be interesting. So I actually don't think that the existence. I actually don't think that the existence results would apply because we require the kernels to be positive for a weak solution in what we showed. But if you had a kind of one of those. Oh, no, I guess, no. Yeah, I guess we'd have to extend it somehow. Yeah. So yeah, you're right now. So we know we can convert this to the set of constant states. We don't know what the set of steady states is. So good. And if that's continuum, we don't know which steady state is converging or even if the circular orders are set of steady states. Oh, yes, I'm symmetry. Okay, it's my pleasure to introduce the second speaker this morning, Yuan Liu, who's at Shanghai Jiaoatong University. And continuing on the theme of spatial ecology, he's going to talk about dispersal and group economics. About dispersal and growth, induced growth, and principal ideologies. It's all yours, I'll wait. So, can you hear me? Yes. Okay, I think that's Sebastian. Thank you for the introduction, Sebastian. I'm sorry that I cannot be here, but I see so many faces of all friends. So, the talk of today is also induce. And this is a phenomenon in population dynamics. It simply says that this phenomenon occurs when populations that have become originally say without dispersal and isolated, all species will become extinct. However, with certain However, with certain dispersal rate, the whole species can persist. So this phenomenon actually has been studied for quite a while. As far as the list goes back to the Jensen and Yoshimura in 1998. For, I believe it's for stock extra environments. And later on, I think a lot of hold and buff yield. Roll of Holt and Barfield, and Matthews and Gonzales, and Christopher Christmeyer, and Sebastian, and also Sebastian and his collaborators, Adams. So there's a long history. Most of these studies focus on when the environment is strongest. More recently, I think, at least as far as I know, for example, the work of For example, the work of Esanier and Lambert, the last rate, are not for stochastic, more focus on time periodic variance. So the question is for time periodic variance, can disposal induced inducibles occur? So that's the question I want to discuss today. Originally, I was. Today. Originally, I was thinking to talk about this in terms of PD models. I lied. So what I'm going to do is I think it's way better to talk about the patch models. So I'll focus on just two patches. And this is a collaborative work with Shang Liu, a very young mathematician. Brandy young mathematician in China, which I was fortunate to be his, I was lucky to be his advisor. And also, Adrian Lam was his co-advisor when Professor Di was visiting Ohio State a while ago. So these two touch models, I think it goes back to Crossmind and also revisited by Quattrill in Tunisia June. control in 2020 in JNB. So assume there's two matches and the population will do a random will be do a symmetrical movement. So the D is a disposal rate. And also assume the environment is time periodic. So C1, C2, these are periodic functions with unit period. So one can see this as a growth rate. This has a growth rate. It's the gas rate minus the birth rate minus the gas rate, for example. And for this parameter variable here, of course, this problem has many values. And there's one special eigenvalue called the principal eigenvalue. It's real itself, it's a real number. And that's the smallest real part, about all eigenvalues. Values. For these discussions, I will first denote this principal value as lambda of d, as a function of disposal rate. This principal value essentially tells you whether the population will grow over the end. It is also related with something called a the upload for exponent. The upload exponent. So if you forget about the value and just look at its ODE, and this OD, you look at its OD, it simply means there's two patches. The organic is move between the two patches with the same rate, D. And also the growth rate within the two patches are different, are given by two different functions, C1 of D and C2 of D, are time periodic. Sequel of the a time periodic. You can see it this way. So now one can define so-called Lyngonov exponent capital lambda of ui as limit of ui of t divided by t as t by t goes to infinity. As limit exists and it is equal to the piece of equipment value actually for both i equals 1, 2. So you can see the connection between the The connection between the so from here, you can see this random dot t indeed somehow matches the growth or the decay of the population. So, how to rephrase the question of disposal-induced grids in principle-in-values? So, I try to modify this a bit. So, in my talk, in this talk, I will say this. In this talk, I would say disposal induced growth occurs if the limit s d equal to zero of lattime is negative and s deggle to infinity is also negative. And the question is, can I find some d star such that this remote d star is positive? So in other words, I try to make the dysportion useful. Maybe the disposal induced growth is a bit harder to occur. Because now I assume that disposal occurs, DIG, which is disposal-induced growth occurs from populations that would become extinct when either is it or well-mixed. Because when Digo will fit it, well-mixed environment. So in other words, I'm trying to make the life harder, a little bit. The life harder, a little bit harder of ourselves. Say the population cannot grow for small diffusion and for large diffusion. The question is, can it grow or can it persist for some intermediate disposal rate? That's the question I'm seeking to address. So, a more general question is how does this value or the angle exponent depends on the parameter D. Originally, I thought, oh, this is, you know, it's a 2x2D, it should be simple. But it turns out it's a bit harder, it's a bit complicated than what I thought. So, let me go back. Go back to this eigenvalue problem and this randomized eigenvalue. It turns out there are three quantities, three numbers, which are important, which pretty much can tell what we want. So let me define a Ci hat to be the average in time of Ci. So it's like the, I'm averaging in time the environment. The environment. Then one can define swim numbers. This A lower bar is like the average of the environment.
