And last time in Cambridge, I had a number of questions related to the problem formulation. So my today's talk is a kind of an introduction to my previous last talk in Cambridge. So I will make an overview of our waveguide model, namely matrix Klinger. Namely, my matrix Klinger Don equation. Then I'll tell about its properties. After I will tell about description of lectural waves with matrix fingertone equation. And if I have time, I will tell a few words about practical applications. So we can see the general waveguide. It has a compact cron. It has a compact cross-section, but it's homogeneous along the longitudinal coordinate x. So, this waveguide can be of any nature, and it can have a complicated cross-section, or it may have may be composed of different layers. Some of these layers may be of composite media. So, this waveguide can be difficult for analytical description. For analytical description, so we need a model, and we propose to model a waveguide with a system of interacting quartz. These quartz, so we concentrate the mass of the waveguide in these chords, and these chords are interconnected with each other by some elastic connections. Well, I prefer to think about elastic wave connections. To think about elastic waveguides. So the waveguide is described by the field in all these quartz. And if these quartz can move in different directions, we can consider all components of these displacements in each quartz. So instead of considering a continuous function of x, y, and time, we consider a vector. Time we consider a vector which is continuous with respect to x and t. So we discretize the waveguide along its cross-section only. And this system is described by matrix Klingardon equation. So this equation is called like this because it has a general form of a usual Klingardon equation from Klinger-Don equation from quantum physics, but its coefficients are matrix d2, d1, d0, and m. Also in literature, you can find in other names of these equations and of such a model of waveguide. There are weight theorem, wave theorem, and semi-analytical final method. So let us go to the properties. Let us go to the properties. First of all, matrix coefficients should be real because they are determined by parameters of the waveguide such as its density and elastic moduli. Secondly, if we write an expression for the kinetic energy, we can consider that it should be positive and Should be positive and non-zero. Yes, it should be positive and real. So that means that the matrix M should be symmetrical and positive definite. After we can write an expression for the potential energy, and so I think that I don't have time to describe this formula, but if we put if we consider the state. If we consider the state vector equal to be like this, so u0 and u1 are constant and real vectors. And we put, we reformulate the formula for the potential energy like this. Then we consider u0 to be zero and afterwards to be u1. To be u1 to be zero. So we can obtain that the matrix D2 is also symmetrical and positive definite, and matrix D0 is symmetric and is negative semi-definite. And then we can calculate the matrix coefficient G1. To do that, we need to build the Lagrange. Need to build the Lagrangian and to find its variation. As a result, we obtain the representation of coefficient d1 as written here. So this means that d1 satisfies this relation. So it's anti-symmetric. Let me tell a few words about term with D1. So it breaks the symmetry along the line. Symmetry along the longitudinal coordinate. And the presence of this term may be explained by two reasons. The first reason for this term to appear is physical non-symmetry of the vehicle. So if it's not chiral, so it's not coincide with itself when we mirror it with respect to the plane x equals. The plane x equals zero. So, in this case, of course, we obtain the term d1. And the second reason is that if we change x to minus x and the state vector doesn't change similarly, all components of the state vector doesn't change similarly. Let me show an illustrative example. If we consider a ring. If we consider a ring and we can see the deformation of this elastic ring, then we need to consider deformation along the radial direction and along the azimuth angle. And if we change the azimuth angle to minus phi, then the displacement along the ring changes to minus u phi. To minus u phi, but the radial displacement doesn't change its sign. So this transformation needs to be explained, needs to be described by some matrix D1 with non-diagonal elements. So I described why all the terms in the matrix. The matrix-Penger Don equation is unnecessary. So, now let me describe why no other terms are unnecessary. And to do that, let me consider flexural waves in a plate. All we know is that flexural waves in a plate are described by this equation. Zeta is a displacement of the middle plane in the vertical direction, and this equation has the fourth order of the derivative with respect to x. And the question is, can the matrix Langardon equation describe such motion? Because the matrix Lein-Gardon equation has only Equation has only the derivative with respect to x of the second and the first order. And to answer this question, we will consider the dispersion relation. For the classical plate, the dispersion relation looks like this with coefficient A. And this coefficient, let me know that this coefficient has a number of factors. Efficient has a number factor 12 if we consider its representation through the Young moduli and Poisson's coefficient. And we need to represent it through the Lame moduli, it will be convenient for us. And this representation has three values. So let us start to derive. Let us start to derive the matrix Hangerton equation for the plate. First of all, we model the plate by two quarts. Each quart can move along the x direction and x2 direction. So the state vector has dimension 4. The field in the middle points we interpolate by linear functions. It's written here. It's written here. After we need to build Lagrangian, we need to write expressions for the kinetic energy and potential energy. And after we calculate the variation of the Lagrangian. And here are the results. The matrices, matrix coefficients have a block. Have a block structure, and we can see that G1 has non-diagonal blocks. So these blocks connect the two parts. So let us represent the field in this plate as a sum of symmetrical motion and anti-symmetrical motion. So we change the state vector. We change the state vector to this one. These are amplitudes also symmetrical. S means symmetrical, a means anti-symmetrical. And we reformulate our equation. As a result, we obtain these new coefficients, and these coefficients have blocks only on its main diagonal. And these parts These parts correspond to the anti-symmetric motion. So, and we are interested in the anti-symmetric motion because the flexural waves are anti-symmetric. So, here we write the dispersion equation for the anti-symmetric motion and we consider its solutions. Since the classical formula for the flexural waves is for k approximate. K approximately equal to zero, we consider the same approximation and we obtain the dispersion equation like this. So here we obtain 12 and I told that it's wrong. So this coefficient is wrong. And actually this means that the real plate is softer than the plate described. Than the plate described by the matrix Kling-Gerton equation. And I can tell an analogy that it's called share locking, and it's a common effect when you try to discretize some object and model it with a finite element method. So let us try to model the waveguide. To model the waveguide by a matrix fingered on equation of dimension six. So we can represent a waveguide, for example, as a system of three parts. So as a result, the field in the waveguide is approximated by quadratic functions. And if we repeat all the procedure from the previous slides, we can obtain the Can obtain the new relation dispersion relation and it has the right coefficient. And also, it can be shown that if we consider the equation of height dimension, it will give us the right coefficient. And I suppose I have enough time, so let me tell about practical applications. So, our first motivation for developing this model, for considering this model, was cut tires. So, a cut tire is composed of different layers of rubber. It has different metal parts, they are directed, they have different directions, so it's quite a complicated system and. And well, even though the eti is a resonator, so its longitudinal coordinate changes in these limits. We can consider it as a tire to be a waveguide with longitudinal coordinate changes, which can be real. So, our waves propagate along the tire in the Along the tire in the radial direction. So, and we are not the first one who can see the tire as a waveguide. Here is a link to a paper of other people. And also, here I can show some other applications and links. So, the first link. So, the first link describes the matrix link that equation application to description of boreholes, and the second link describes rails. And also, there are many other applications, such as long bones or well waveguides everywhere in nature. So, the question also can be. The equation also can be can have many implications. So, and here are the conclusions. So, the main conclusion is that this equation is useful and it can describe flexural waves correctly and it has many practical applications. So, that's all. Thank you.
