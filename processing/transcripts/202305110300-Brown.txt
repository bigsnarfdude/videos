We have three speakers. So, first one is Simon Brown. He would be talking about estimating severity, frequency, and duration of passenger heat waves from the metal piece in the UK. And then, after him, we'll have Michael Wiener and in Lee Grand. Well, thank you very much for inviting me to speak. I work at the Met Office Hadley Centre, which is the climate division within the UK Met Service. Vision within the UK Met Service. It was set up in 1990 by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to provide government with climate advice but also projections so that adaptation and impacts could be discussed. And this is probably more the focus of this particular talk. I am a physicist, I'm not a statistician, that'll become quite clear, I think. And this sort of linking to the previous And this, sort of linking to the previous Tuesday discussion about the different communities and communicating, this talk was very much designed towards communicating within the climate science community. And I think that's quite, well, become quite clear about what the sort of things that I've found useful to try and communicate. Maybe something a little bit more statistically challenging for them, but you're obviously seeing that it's compared to what we've seen this week so far, this is relatively simple. Okay, I'm looking at. Okay, I'm looking at the severity, frequency, and particularly the duration of heat waves. So I'm looking at temporal dependence rather than spatial dependence. There we are. It's not spatial, but it is temporal. And I thought I'd just start off by looking at just some sample data to give some context. This is the daily T max from Moscow for 50 years or so, above 94th percentile, or 90th percentile, I think, with respect to the day of year. With respect to the day of year, so we've got day of year along the x-axis, and this is the annual cycle of daily T max. And in 2010, there was a significant heat wave for Moscow that lasted most of the summer, but there were two particularly long, very high-valued periods, eight and ten days. But as you can see from this data set, sits well outside what they were expecting, but also very. What they were expecting, but also very, very persistent. So, this is work and particularly trying to look at that persistence through time. So, sort of vague introduction. So, focusing on duration. And this work came about from an ambition to develop a tool that can be used in many, many different contexts and which is agnostic over heat waves and definition and those use. Because if you do a review of the heat wave, Because if you do a review of the heat wave literature, you can see there's a myriad of different definitions about what's sensitive to that particular application. So, things like crop yields, they're going to be very, very sensitive to the flowering season, so like early season heat waves, but obviously for human impacts and animal impacts, this would be where the maximum temperatures of the whole annual cycle occur. So, this tool would have to have the annual cycle within it, and so it could be used at any time of the year. Within it, and so it could be used at any time of the year, even winter if you're interested. Um, it would have to be able to cope with past observations and future projections. Definition of the heat wave has to be at least flexible enough to accommodate a certain number or quite a wide range of heat wave definitions. And this all came out of work that was set off by Hugo Winter and John Torn. Hugo was a joint PhD student in this paper here, so this is like a derivative of that work. Here, so this is like a derivative of that work, and it results in a simulator for all the days above that percentile that I showed you. So, at whatever time of year, any hot days, and I came up with this really clever name for the simulator called Hot Days. I saw Raphael nipped hot at the beginning of the week. But anyway, so this particular characteristics of this is well, it's going to have to capture the temporal dependence, and this is captured through a happenment on conditional model, conditional streams model, and it. Model, pollution extremes model, and it constructs sort of Markov extreme chains for each event. And what's irrelevant to the previous discussion on Tuesday, I think, was how do we validate these things? Here I use a long pre-industrial control run as my sort of truth, and I try and emulate that using this simulator. And hopefully, I'll get to the end and show a bit more about some other meteorological effects that affect heat work. Ecological effects that affect heat wave systems in Europe. Wrong way. Right. So this is the schematic I came up with to try and describe to non-statisticians about how this whole picture will work. Because I find it very easy to lose people along the way when you start talking about this sort of stuff, that they don't get the big picture very well, and then they can easily lose it. So I came up with this. With this diagram. So we have to start off with data on the observed scale. It happens on a particular day of the year and it has some sort of climate change signal within it. We transform it onto the stationary scale, either unit or Laplace in this case. We fit this hot days model capturing the impacts of the covariance that you're interested in. We then simulate from this model a large number for specified values of the covariates. And from this simulated data, we then do the inverse track. This simulated data, we then do the inverse transform back onto the observed scale from which we can then select the heat waves which we wish to look at. So, as long as you simulate at a low enough level, then the people who have interest in heat waves can then pick out their ones that they're interested in. And I just sort of wanted to emphasize in this talk that there's obviously a significant technical hurdle in getting a space-time extreme models working in a practical sense, but there is an equal, if But there is an equal, if a challenge, of actually getting them ingested or used by sort of practitioners and non-statistics practitioners in the community. And that, you know, I find it challenging. I find slightly nervous people view me. So in this context, I'm a physicist, but in work context, people see me as a statistician, which is disturbing, I think, in terms of their concept of what statisticians do. To what statisticians do. So I'm training my data, my model on a future projection of the same model, same climate model, forced with the SMS-82 emission scenario, which is quite a high emission scenario, so it goes from 1990 to 2100. These are the daily T-Max temperatures for a rib box in France, central France. On the left, it's against the daily year, and on the right, it's the year through the record. Right, this is the year through the record, and the curves are the annual cycle of the 90th percentile at the beginning of the record, and the red is at the end of the record. And on the right-hand side, it's the mid-winter 90th percentile, and the red is the mid-summer 90th percentile. And you can see that both changing with day of year and changing through the record of the model, as you'd expect. How do we get those curves? Those curves. So I've got 110 years of this T-max. I fit a non-parametric quantile regression for all percentiles using Passiolo's Q-GAM package. And I also fit a non-stationary GAM-based GPD to the upper tail, which is based on Ben Youngman's EV-GAM package, which is heavily dependent on Simon Woods and GCV. And covariates are incorporated in the Covariates are incorporated in the GAMs via this sort of structure where the covariates are there's the smoothers which are functional covariates, which are splines. And in the case of the day of year, it's forced to be cyclic, so it joins up at the year boundaries. And so I can, for each time, therefore, I will have all these values of the percentiles and the upper tail distributions, so I can. So, for each point, on each time, at each point of time, I can convert that into the unit scale and then onto the mass scale. This is what the function of the covariance effect has on the EV gamma smooths. The left is on the log scale with regard to day of year, and the middle is with respect to time. In actual fact, because of the validation I wanted to do, I haven't used. I wanted to do, I haven't used time explicitly, but a temperature which is very dependent on time, which is the mean value of temperatures for that grid box. With GAMS, it's really weird. It doesn't matter so much of what time covariant you put in because the GAM will adjust it to whatever it thinks it should be anyway. But I needed to do this because I needed to then trace back to the pre-industrial climate and I needed some value of the covariate at that point. So that's why I use the mean temperature. We also see an impact on the shape. An impact on the shape parameter with regards to the day of the year, which is interesting to quadrature to that, slightly which I don't physically understand as yet. The way parameters are chosen, I do a sort of hierarchical AIC sort of testing where I allow one, I add one one by one as I think physically makes sense, and then see if it makes a bit significant impact and include it. These all seem to be significant in that sense. And just to test that it's working. And just to test that it's working, I then refit the same models, the transform data, to see if there's any temporal dependence left or non-stationarity left, and fit the same quantiles. And we find that that's doing a pretty good job. Let's get confidence that with these two particular metrics, they're stationary. Once I've transferred all the data, I can now extract the temperatures I'm interested in. So I do that in a very simple way. I just go when they're on the Laplace scale, I go to the hottest valve. And then, when they're on the Laplace scale, I go to the hottest value, go walk backwards and forwards until it falls below a particular threshold that's quite low. Take that out, go to the next one, same thing, until there's no events left that are above the threshold that I've chosen. I've also here restricted to just the summer half year. That's because I'm interested in the dependence of anticyclones in summer, which might be different from the dependence of persistence of anticyclones in winter. And then I'm just to illustrate what they look like. To illustrate what they look like in the observed space, I've transformed them back for two particular years, say two years. You can see that they're sitting in the summer half year, and the heat waves in the winter aren't being picked up. So now I've got all my, I've extracted all the heat waves from this data set. I now have to fit this hot days model, and here's the structure of it in a quite simple way. I just basically divide it into four different chunks. I say, does a heat wave begin or appear at a high temperature? I then see that. I then seed that temperature and I propagate forwards in time by sampling from this condition extremes model that I'll fit. And then I then consider after that's happened whether it will then terminate. And all of these have to then capture the effects of the various covariates that might be of interest. The beginning and end or genesis and lysis of the heat waves are modeled as Benui random variables in a logistic GAM and so the co-variable And so the cogrets I put in appear in this here. And again, these S, the smoothers, are these penalized cubic regression slides. And the various covariates are put in for either the heat wave threshold or temperature, depending if it's genesis and lysis, some measure of climate change, the day of year, and in terms of lysis, also the. And in terms of license, also the age of the wave seems to be makes an impact. And then I see this day one temperature using another GAM GPD fitted to the extracted events with the relevant covariates. Here's the effect on the heat wave beginning on the covariates. On the left, the probability with respect to day of year. The different lines and different values of the climate change covariate. The climate change covariate, which is normalized, and we have a little bit of an annual cycle with respect to day of the year, and obviously some impact on probabilities from climate change. On the right-hand side is the effect on the seeding temperature with respect to day of the year. And again, again, there's a more stronger impact of the annual cycle. So I see them. And then this is the termination covariant effects on the top. On the top left is the effect of the temperature. So, basically, saying if it's hotter, it's less likely to terminate. The different lines, different ages. The top right is the annual cycle, which you see is not particularly strong. And then these are just different temperature values, and it's all quite sort of linear. The bigger effect seems to be from age in terms of how longer it is, the less likely it is to terminate. And then there's a weak climate change. And then there's a weak climate change in terms of the termination effects impact. So, propagation, this is the sort of, I was slightly, I thought this equation might have, some sort of conditional model might have been put up already this week. But anyway, this is the heavenly torn model. And we make the assumption of P et al that we assume that Z is some normal, which allows us to then Allows us to then estimate the parameters by standard likelihood approaches. We then discard this Gaussian assumption and recalculate the distribution of Z in a non-paratrometric way using the physic parameters. We also allow parameters potentially to vary with covariates, as in the Jonathan Dowell paper. In reality, I don't end up using mu or gamma to be, I force them to be staying. To be force them to be stationary just because this adding in multiple covariates, this model fitting gets quite tricky. You have to be quite careful and sort of impose a bit of structure by physical considerations rather than just purely goodness of fit, just to get something sensible to come out. And so, here's an illustration of what that looks like. So, on the left, the black dots are the observed data. The black dots are the observed of day two against day three of the heat wave events that have been extracted, and the red is simulated values, and it seems to be doing quite well. I did find that this fit is actually into all day n and day n plus one for n greater than two. I found that for day one, day two transitions, we had to do a slightly different model because there's a bit of lag in the system, I think, that it takes a while for the region to heat up. A while for the region to heat up, and so there's the second day tends to be have a slightly less strong dependence than the future days. So, there's two pepenator models, one for day one, day two, the rest for day n plus one. It's the impact of the day of year. It is significant, but and it just fits outside the one-to-one line here on a PP plot of spring days against summer days. Clearer is the age has a bigger impact than longer ones. Has a bigger impact that longer ones have a slightly larger likelihood of high temperatures than shorter ones. So the heat wave simulation step is relatively straightforward. We decide how many events we want. We distribute them over the range of days of year that we're interested in. We initialize them on day one using the fitted GAM GPD with the appropriate covariates. We then prop it forward And we then propagate forward sampling from the Hafn and Tworm model. We make this draw from the Z and then propagate forward with this equation here. And then once we've got the temperature, we say, according to the fits of the termination gamma, does this particular day continue or does it terminate? And if it continues, then we just go back to step two, step three, and go around the circle again until there's no events left. The circle again until there's no events left in your simulation data set. So now we get to the validation point. So when I simulated for this validation, I chose the covariates that are appropriate for the pre-industrial, which I took from the mean temperatures from the control run. I also passed through all the control data through the stationary and heat wave extraction process. So those are the values in these QQ. Those are values in these QQ plots on the x-axis. And then I compare them with these metrics for the simulated data. If we just start with the duration, I've added plus or minus half degree noise just to make the plots look nice for each day. And we can see that in these QQ plots, it looks pretty good in terms of simulating this pre-industrial climate. Severity is the integrated anomaly above the threshold. So I just sum up the anomalies. So, I just sum up the anomalies above the defining threshold. And that looks again, looks doing pretty well for the wide range of values of this severity metric. The hottest day of each heat wave, we have a little bit of a dip here, which is interesting, but given what we're trying to do, that's probably not too bad. It manifests slightly larger in the mean severity, which is obviously that divided by that. And if you look really carefully, the durations are slightly large here. The durations are slightly large here, and the severities are slightly low here, and that comes out as being this dip here. But again, not too bad and not too worried by that, given what I'm trying to do. Individual day for duration heat wave, looking at individual days and comparing the temperatures. So for the first day of heat wave, fourth, ninth, and fourteenth. For the higher ones, it looks pretty good. For the higher ones, it looks pretty good, a bit of a low bias, maybe. But there's a bigger impact, it seems, in the first day temperature, which is interesting because that's just comparing the GPTs of the two. And this turns out to be just a sampling impact. So if I do this whole process again, but sample from within the pre-control climate, I can get similar results, but I can also get results where the simulation is positive. So it's just a sampling noise issue or uncertainty in fit. Noise issue or uncertainty in fitting the GPD, and hopefully, if that was deemed a problem, we could perhaps get a better impact or idea of what those initial day GPDs by doing a bit more of a spatial pooling and what first day temperatures. That might calm down that uncertainty sampling in there. So, oh, this is the last validation plot. Those are all on the Laplace scale, which climate scientists. Climate scientists don't really feel comfortable with, so let's have a look at the observed scale. And so I've transformed all the data back onto the observed scale, plotted predictors expected day of the year. The grey are 10-year events from the control run. Black are individually sampled greater than 10-day events just to show what they look like. Red are equivalent from the simulated data. But the smooth lines are 10th and 50th and 90th quantile estimates. And 90th quantile estimates of the two different data sets for events over 10 days in length. And to me, this looks pretty good and quite a reasonable thing to work with. And particularly because what I'm actually attempting to do is quite challenging. So we've got this future projection with a very strong forcing, trying to emulate something which is pre-industrial, with very little companies, little no forcing. I couldn't think of a more difficult thing to try and do in terms of validating. It seems to work quite well. So in terms of application, in the paper that this came from, I looked at the 20 most populous cities in the globe, limiting one per country. Quite a justification was actually most people do live in the cities. And so not having the spatial impact so much. The spatial impacts so much is less of a problem if you're just trying to look at human impacts. So, on the left is from one member of the CMIP-5 forced by the RCP 8.5. And this is for Tokyo, which is currently the most populous city. And the bottom set of curves are for 2006, the top set are for 2099. And this is the mean temperature for heat waves of different durations represented by the different colours from two, three, four. Different colors from two, three, four, five to six day durations. And you can see that we're getting, we can, by this large sampling of this model, we can determine with some precision at the very rare return periods for this particular these metrics, and that in the future they obviously get warmer as you would expect, but also they seem to be slightly closer in this particular model. If I just look at the five-day durations and do it for the whole ensemble of the CMIC-5, so that's Ensemble of the CMIC-5. So that's from 28 climate models and totaling 44 members just for day five durations. That's 2006 in black and the 2099 in red. You can see there's substantial scatter over the ensemble. But if we take the difference between these two, that removes some of that. And that gives us this next figure. And so this is return period against mean temperature change for five-day heave up events. And the first thing to sort of And the first thing to sort of point out is that it's incredibly flat, which I wouldn't necessarily pre-conceive as being the case. In terms of the rarity of heat wave, the changes once you get above the threshold seem to be fairly uniform, irrespective of its rarity. This also seems to be to across duration, so for changes in 10-day and two-day, seems to be the same, mean temperature changes. The other thing you can notice here is the clustering within the The other thing you can notice here is the clustering within the ensemble. I guess a low cluster, a high cluster, and a sort of middle cluster. These are somewhat kept due to the GCM families, that there are certain GCM families that end up here and certain GCM families that end down here, not exclusively, but predominantly. And in terms of durations, most cities don't show any change in terms of the distribution of short to long heatways. Short to long heat waves, but for six cities, we see an increase in the proportion of days longer than six. Sorry, heat waves, which durations are longer than six. The largest changing one of the 20 was Paris for all the metrics actually. And it shows that heat waves longer than 10 days are expected to increase by this ensemble by over doubling, really. But all these metrics are, again, with respect to the thresholds, so the thresholds are changing, and these are the changes. Thresholds are changing, and these are the changes that are seen above that threshold. Another application, going back to the original data that I showed at the beginning, was looking at the Moscow summer heat wave. And this is the original figure that I showed earlier. Just looking at the two shading bands that are put here, these are looking at the 20th to 80th range and temperature of heat wave events longer than 10 days. So the orange is for the 20th. The orange is for 1950 and the purple is for 2010. So you can see how we can diagnose using this approach the increase in these long heatwave events changes from 1950 to 2010 showing that the likelihood of such an event like this has substantially increased. That's what I want. So, just to conclude the modeling side, this hot days simulator, I've got a statistical model on hot days that can simulate hot temperatures throughout the year from which you can extract your heat wave diagnostic of choice. This contains the annual cycle of climate change and realistically recaptures any extremal dependence within the heat wave events. Dependence within the heat wave events. You can use whatever definition you like, well, within reason, and it seems to faithfully reproduce this pre-industrial simulation that we have. And so from which you can look at changes in duration distributions, severity, and rare event probabilities as you require. This also provides actual event sets that you could use for impact studies like thermal response of impact. Studies like thermal response of infrastructure. We almost had a project to look at the nuclear with the nuclear industry about how their infrastructure would respond to a long heat wave and how they might respond to that. This is the paper that is all described in in more detail if you're interested. So now the other thing that I've now added in is both a diurnal cycle so that you can get the minimum day nighttime minimum as well as the daytime maximum. Nighttime minimum as well as the daytime maximum during a heat wave, and also the humidity, which is obviously very important for animals and humans, but also a lot of the evaporative cooling infrastructure depends on humidity as well. The last thing I wanted to look at was now looking at what other things might be affecting the duration of heat waves over Europe. And one thing I did find was this summer NAO, the North Atlantic Oscillation. Summer NAO, the North Atlantic Oscillation is a bipolar pressure pattern in the Atlantic with a center up near Iceland and another center near sort of Lisbon. And it determines the sort of anomalous flow, you might say, within the region. And looking at these curves of, these are now an observed scale of temperatures on day t and day t plus one. And these are the like a mean impacts of the both the plus and minus MaO versus the Or minus NaO versus the sort of normal, and that during positive phases of this summer NaO, the next day temperatures are significantly elevated with respect to both the average and the negative NaO. What this process allows me to do also is to separate that impact from the dependence change and the marginal change. And so, here on the right, we have the two figures for separating that out, and this middle figure is the dependence impact, and in the right. Dependence impact, and the right is the margin impact, and you can see most of the impact is coming in the dependence, which I wasn't necessarily expecting. The reverse is this weird. And that was just for one grid box on the coast of France. If I do it for the whole of the European region, this is the same sort of figure showing the difference between the positive and negative NaO impact. And we can see that this increase in T plus one day temperature. T plus one day temperature is quite widespread and but at a maximum on the on the west coast. And again, if we separate these two from the effect on the dependence and the effect on the margins, it is mostly coming from most of the region from the dependence. Now this actually fits in quite well with what we understand about the summer NAO. So finally it's the meteorology. This comes from a paper from a figure from Folland et al. on the summer North Atlantic Oscillation and this is a cluster, so the average mean sequel So, the average mean sea level pressure on the black contours for positive NAO, summer NAO values. And the coloured is the anomaly with respect to the average. And this positive pressure anomaly results in anomalous easterly winds. So, in meteorology, the direction of wind comes from its source. So, we've got a stronger flow from the centre of the continent to westwards, which sort of now makes sense. Which is sort of now makes sense in terms of those previous figures that you're invecting hotter temperature air westwards during positive summer NAO. In normal NAO, the flow is more northerly, so it comes down the coast of France. So when you get this anomalous westerly flow or easterly winds, you affect these hotter temperatures from the interior towards the coast. And obviously, that is greatest up the coast, which would have the most cooling effect from the sea. Cooling effect from the sea. So that removes that cooling effect. So I just thought this was quite a nice physical, you know, linking up the physics with the statistical metrics of the dependencies. And that's it. Thank you.
