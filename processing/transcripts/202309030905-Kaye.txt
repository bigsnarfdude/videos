Computing last year. And the program is part of the National Quantum Strategy, or at least it's funded through the National Quantum Strategy, the NQS. And so the funding for the program runs for a total of six years from when it was launched. So it will run until 2028. And it's structured the same way that other challenge programs, so-called C-STIP programs at NRC, collaborative science and technology innovation programs. And so the approach. And so the approach for the program is that it supports collaborative RD projects between NRC researchers and researchers from the research community. So from Canadian universities or startups or other not-for-profit organizations across the country. And so what the program brings is, well, it brings the collaboration. So it brings together the NRC researchers with other researchers, but it also sort of incentivizes others to work with us by providing grants and contributions funding. Grants and contributions funding to offset the project costs of our partners. And so, for that, that typically is, at least for a program like this, is mainly to pay for the salaries for postdocs and researchers that are working on the project. In other programs where there are more sort of hardware costs or lab costs, then these programs can also support that. Of course, with this kind of a program, which I'll describe. of a program which I'll describe as more of a an algorithms program so that typically the funding would be to be to offset salaries as well as travel and you know publication costs and other things. So all of these challenge programs are driven by a sort of challenge statement, something that we're trying to focus on. Each challenge program has its own sort of theme and its own focus area defined by a challenge statement. And so for this program, the challenge statement is This program, the challenge statement is: I'll just read it here. The Applied Quantum Computing Program will deliver quantum applications and software that will enable the efficient simulation of complex physical systems that pose significant difficulties for classical computers. These simulations will deliver new technologies for human health, climate change, advanced materials with far-reaching benefits to society. So I should say that was the original statement when the program was launched. Since then, over the last year, the program has that is the simulations aspect is still a key element of it, but the program has kind of Of it, but the program has kind of broadened a little bit, and it's not strictly about physical simulations anymore. I'll get to kind of the scope in a minute. So, there are three, typically the challenge programs have themes or pillars or master projects, whatever you want to call them, and they're not meant to really constrain the program, they're just meant to sort of as buckets, conceptual buckets, to organize the program and organize the projects. And so for AQC, there's three themes. The first is algorithms and simulations, and that's, I mean, it's sort of self-explanatory. It's the applications that run on, or the algorithms that run on a quantum computer to solve some problem or to simulate some system, et cetera. So these three themes really are kind of, they follow the stack, if you will, this is this sort of software stack of a computer, a quantum computer in this case. So the next theme is a little further down the stack. Next theme is a little further down the stack, and it's sort of we call it enabling technologies. And that's sort of the algorithms and software that enable the quantum computer to run, to run efficiently. And so that would include things like error correction, quantum compiling, resource allocation, benchmarking, all of that kind of stuff. And then the third theme is sort of the most abstract or theoretical theme, and it's sort of at the very bottom of the stack, if you will. And it's the sort of fundamental models of quantum computation and the architecture of a quantum computer. And so that's more. Of a quantum computer. And so that's more very low TRL foundational research into different ways of thinking about how to harness quantum physics to solve computing problems. For example, annealing is an example of that, or quantum diffusion is a new one, or neuromorphic quantum computing, for example, as well as looking at things like restrictive models of quantum computation. If you have an architecture where you only have, for example, nearest neighbor coupling or you only have sort of certain restricted forms of Sort of certain restricted forms of control over the qubits. You know, what are the implications of that for fault tolerance, for universality, et cetera? So, those are the program themes. Early in the program, I mean, we're still early in the program and kind of getting it going. We've launched about six or seven projects so far. But the early focus is more on the lower on the TRL scale, if you will. Lower on the TRL scale, if you will. And so it really is more about expanding what we know about quantum algorithms and what will be possible for quantum computers, which I think is an area that hasn't gotten enough attention lately because there's been such a mad rush to commercialize and to develop these sort of technologies further up the stack and programming languages and toolkits and all that kind of stuff. And so for this program, For this program, we want to focus more on the fundamentals, at least early in the program, on the foundational stuff that maybe hasn't, or a lot of talent has been distracted away from that. And I still think we need a lot more work for quantum computers to actually have a real world impact in the future. We need to know a lot more than we currently know about quantum algorithms. There are really only a few. There are really only a few things that quantum computers are known to be good for at this point. And so we need to expand that. And so, in that direction, in the next couple of weeks, I think the 12th is our current date, but it could shift. We're going to be publishing a call for proposals. And it's really meant to, I mean, in a sense, the program is open for proposals at any time. And so, you know, we've been having people put proposals forward and been improving projects all along, but this is kind of meant to kind of be a This is kind of meant to kind of be a to invite proposals specifically on three areas, and also that we've decided to earmark a good chunk of the program funding for projects and proposals along these three specific areas. So the overall banner for the call is quantum algorithms for scientific discovery. And the three specific areas that we're looking for proposals on, the first is quantum algorithms for linear algebra. And so if you're familiar with the HHL algorithm, With the HHL algorithm for linear systems of equations. That algorithm has had very little, there have been very little use cases identified where that algorithm could actually be useful in practice because it comes with so many caveats. And there's, you know, even computing the condition number of a matrix is something that I don't believe we know how to do efficiently. And so even knowing when the algorithm could work and be applied is actually problematic. And so that theme. And so that theme, that quantum algorithms for linear algebra is kind of about, you know, part of it is about, okay, trying to find more use cases and working through in detail where HHL might be able to be applied in practical scenarios. Also, perhaps expanding HHL itself, maybe weakening some of the conditions or the caveats that come along with it. So anything along those lines. I think it's potentially a very interesting area for quantum computing because it is one area where we can prove that we can get an exponential advantage. That we can get an exponential advantage uses phase estimation. So that's one. The second one is kind of more out there, I suppose. There has been some early work in quantum algorithms for solving differential equations, in particular Navier-Stokes equations. And so it is an area that maybe hasn't gotten a huge amount of attention, but I think it could be a very potentially important area. So that's the second sort of thread of the call for proposals. And the third is one that, of course, gets a lot of attention. And the third is one that, of course, gets a lot of attention and a lot of excitement, and rightly so, is quantum algorithms for simulating Hamiltonians. And so, what's important, I think, is that all three of these are areas where potentially, more than potentially, where there's good significant reason to believe that quantum computers will actually be able to provide a super polynomial speed up over the best things we can do classically, where a lot of the quantum algorithms that everyone's been getting excited about over the last few years, the variational stuff, the NISC stuff. Years of variational stuff, the NISC stuff really are so heuristic, and really a lot of people are. It's not clear that we're going to get a significant super polynomial speed up with some of those other NISC heuristic type quantum algorithms. So this is meant to kind of focus people back on sort of what I see as the core quantum algorithms that we should really be excited about that could really make a significant impact in the future. Impact in the future. So the call will come out and it'll be published on NRC's website, on the program website. NRC will put it on their various social media channels, LinkedIn, et cetera. I'll have it on my own LinkedIn. So if you're not connected with me on LinkedIn, please feel free to connect with me and you'll see the call. Of course, Sergei will also have it and be able to send it to this entire group. But I would definitely invite and welcome any proposals once the call comes out. There will be a specific window of time. Call comes out. There will be a specific window of time where the call is open and then we're inviting proposals and then the call closes and all of that. In a sense, that is a little bit artificial because, of course, the door is never closed. The program is going to be running for a few years until 2028. And I would welcome proposals at any time, especially along one of these three areas or other related areas. So I just wanted to briefly kind of give you an overview, make you aware of the program, make you aware of the specific things that we're interested in. Specific things that we're interested in in the program and invite you again to reach out. And so I don't really have anything else in the way, by the way, of slides to present right now, but I'm happy to take any questions. You missed the nice part yesterday. It was kind of very nice. We enjoyed the place, but thank you for presentation. But thank you for presentation and if somebody has other plans. I have a question. Could you comment on budgets of typical proposals? I'm sorry, I'm having a hard time understanding. It's a bit echoey. And maybe somebody close to a microphone could repeat the question. I don't have the microphone at once. Or maybe it could be chat or The question was about the budget. What is kind of typical amount? Yeah, okay, for a typical project. Right, so there's a range, right? I think for this specific call, we're going to be earmarking six or seven million in total over three years for projects on these three areas. Three areas. A typical project would be anywhere between $50,000 to say $250,000 per year per project. But of course, it really depends on how many students or how many postdocs are going to be working on a project and what the size and scope of the project is. One of the things that, of course, the grants and contributions, as I said, can be used to pay researcher salaries, but they can't be used to, obviously, to pay. They can't be used to obviously to pay the PI salary, the professor's salary. A project would have to have a professor, a PI who's kind of supervising and collaborating, but that salary wouldn't be offset. But you can imagine a project where there's three or four postdocs working 50% of their time, and that 50% of their time would be able to be reimbursed through the program. And the life of the typical project is three years. Yeah, but is it two years long? Is it tedious long projects? Sorry? What is the length of the project? Again, a range. Really, between one and three years would be typical. We wouldn't commit to anything beyond three years at the outset. That being said, if a project starts as a two-year project and it's going really, really well and there's a lot of momentum, then it certainly could, a follow-on project could easily. know a follow-on project could could easily be uh defined to keep it going uh one more thing is like uh some company startups were mentioned that i was just wondering uh would the preference be given to proposals that involve uh industrial component or i mean it's nice if a startup is involved perhaps but not necessarily um especially because these are very theoretical topics Very theoretical topics for this call. You know, we do have, for example, Xanadu got a proposal with the University of Toronto. And so that is nice because Xanadu obviously has some very strong talent and well-known and they're working with some very well-known researchers at U of T. So that is nice, but it's not a requirement at all. In a sense, a project, because this program is not as applied, it's called applied quantum computing. Is not as applied, and it's called applied quantum computing, but
