  There it is. Why don't we get started with our parts? So Falki's gonna tell to us about it out of their To us about the patient induced chain of points and chains. Here's a pretty nice picture of how Marvel. Okay, thank you. So, thank you, Robab, and I first of all I'd like to thank the organizers for this very nice workshop in a wonderful phrase. Yeah, I think I I have attended the workshops in this phrase. Box or displays a few times in the past, but it was in summer or older. I think this photo is from 10 years ago or something. It's my bike. But this is my first time coming to the workshop this place in winter. So I'm looking forward to skiing. But last time I came here for skiing was like 30 years ago when I was a postsoccer. Ago, when I was a postdoc at UBC, and I drove 1,000 kilometers in the snow just to ski here. So I was in UBC 30 years ago because I was a postdoc of Lija Maplek, who unfortunately passed away last October. So I have many, many memories about him. I'm trying to write up something. I'm trying to write up something work in progress. But I also discussed with JS and a few others to make some kind of memorial correction in Cypos. As Cypos is founded, run by Jazz. So Cypos is very flexible, online platform. So you can submit scientific papers. Scientific papers. Yeah, scientific paper as usual, and just dedicate some papers to Ian. It would go through regular review process. It would be published online as soon as it passes review. You don't have to wait for other papers to be published. Same memorial, but then it will be included in. It will be included in the collection. And also, you can submit some essays, like your memories about here, something like that. So, okay, so we haven't completely fixed the details, but we will announce the details. So, if you are interested, please contact me or JS. So, yeah, so maybe, yeah, I have many memories about IAPA. Actually, my first paper was. But actually my first paper with Ian was this defect trying in Isaac model, which is based on boundary safety. The subject I learned largely from Ian. And I appreciate that yesterday you mentioned this paper. Thanks for that. And so this is I think one of the early examples of conformal defect, which somehow became popular topics. Which somehow became popular topics these days among 15 people. So, yeah, so now we are getting more citations compared to 30 years old. I'm happy about this. And also, this boundary safety is now a mature subject. We were working only in Satiya because it was started by Cardi and other people. Cardi and other people in the 1980s, so pretty much our subject. But recently, we are finding new applications of boundary CFD to new program, quantum information, like program, quantum measurement, and so on. I'm also very happy about it. So, today I'm going to tell you about one recent application of boundary CFD to Public safety, we are doing research. So, my talk is based on this paper with a very young student. He is still first year grad student, he will be right, and my younger colleague, Ashida-san, in Riyasoku. And uh the title of the paper actually says uh Entanglement Swapping, but actually I never heard about this uh word before. About this word before you doing this collaboration. So, maybe if you are from quantum information, probably you are quantum information, but if you are from condensed model or some other more traditional field of physics, maybe this is new to you. So, let me briefly explain what is entangled. So, um suppose that uh there are four people, Aris Mogul and Kara Antani. Group and Kara and Danny, whatever. And initially, this Arisan group had the entanglement qubit, right? Because Kara and Danny had the entanglement qubit. And then between these two qubits owned by Bob and Cara, you do the projective measurement of bed pairs. So after the measurement, the qubits The qubits owned by Bogara are completely endowed. But you don't do anything about the qubits owned by Ari Sand. But after this projective measurement, project to repair state, maximally entangled state, somehow the qubits of Aris and Q bit of tunnel are now completely entangled. So this is called entanglement swap. So this is called entangment swapping because initially there is an entanglement between these two and these two, but after the measurement, now you have entanglement between these two. So this is entanglement swapping and what I'm going to discuss is many body version of entanglements. So as an example, we considered a very simple setup. So you have two So you have two contact speed chains, Spina Half XX chain, XACT SOVARU, favorite of quite a few people in this room. And so initially they are in the ground state, completely independent, no entanglement at all between these two chains. But then you separate this system of two chains into two different. Of two chains into two regions. And in one region, you pick up one spin from each chain and you perform the bird pair measurement between these two spins. And likewise for this pair of spins, and so on and so forth. So you perform bare pair measurement between two chains in this region. But you don't do anything on spins in this region. But this visually. But uh after this very pair measurement, so each spins uh e e each pair of spins are now maximally entangled after the very pair measurement. But then these spins and these spins are now entangled with P channel. Because initially there was some entanglement between these guys and these guys. But now after the measurement these things are These things are entanglement entangled with these guys. So, this is similar to the four-qubit entanglement swapping problem I just described. So, after this measurement, somehow these guys entangle with these guys. And the problem I want to discuss in this talk is how much entanglement will you have after this measurement. After this measure between this group of spin after this group of spin delta group and okay, so this is an XX chain. So initially you have two independent XX chains and both chains are in the ground state. And by now it's very well established that low energy physics, including the ground state and low energy excitation. The ground state and low energy excitations of this exact schema have changed can be described by Tumodala injured kit, which is nothing but the free boson conformity CLB 1 plus 1 dimension. So the Lagrangian density is like this, just a free boson. And each spin operator can be written in terms of this boson field. So sigma z, the alternating part is cosmic field. The alternating part is cosine of phi, and there is a uniform part which is derivative of phi. Sigma x and sigma y their combination basing lower or greater. The dominant part is this alternating part, which is given by exponentials of seta, which is a dual field to five points. So if you are uh you have worked on this uh latency you should Platinumics we should familiarize this, but uh if you are not uh this is basically free boson field service with some subtle. Then uh so this is uh what we know about single one-half spin one-half XXC chain and in the initial function we have just uh two XXC chain in the ground state. So we need uh two So we need two boson fields, like a phi one and phi two. Phi one describes chain one and five two describes the other chain, chain two. So we start from two components, three also. Then uh we performed the Belpair measurement. So Belpair means uh this uh maximally entangled uh pair of two spins. Pair of two spins. And there are four of them. So B1 and B2 take 0 or 1. So there are four of them, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1. And for choice of B1, B2, either 0 or 1, you just plug in B1 and B2, 0 or 1. And this B1 bar is 0 bar is 1, 1 bar is 0. So for example, 0, 0 per pair. 00 per pair is you probably 0 to b 1. So you have 0 0. And this minus 1 to b 2 is just 1 if b two is 0. And b1 bar is 1. So this state for 0, 0 is just a superportion of 0, 0 and 1. And this is like a quantum information, qubit type notation. So going back to spin one curve, in magnetism. Curve in magnetism, up zero is up and one is down. So this is upward plus downtown. So one of the triplet states, but the maximum enterprise. So this is, for example, Berlpia 00 state. And if you perform Berlpia measurements, you obtain one of these four outcomes: 0011011101111111111. And if you happen to obtain 00 outcome, then after the projective measurement, the pair of spins should be in this state. And in terms of quantum spin chain, you have two x-axis chains, and you pick up one pair and perform the pair pair measurement. And if you get this 0, 0, then those pairs. Those pairs of things subject to the measurement, after the measurement, should be in this particular thing. And in terms of this low-energy field theory, this may be described in terms of some boundary condition because this means that the sigma z should take the same value, but the sigma z is represented by this. is represented by this and uh more dominant part is is cosine two phi and uh because cosine two phi should take the same value for chain one and chain two means that basically phi one and phi two should take the same value and also this is a triplet set meaning that uh at least roughly speaking uh the pair of spin has uh expectation value in x direction. Value in x direction. Total xx is plus 1 or something. So if you look at this expression of sigma x, then you need to maximize total SX, which gives this theta 1 plus Î¸2. The sum of dual view should be 0 or something like that. So you can replace this particular state with this kind of condition. This kind of condition locally. That's the basic idea. Yeah. What's the relevant part of the yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course, this is kind of guesswork. We need to examine this. And if we measure, for instance, not that then I can yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, so if you do different measurement with respect to different bases, we need to find a different simple description works. But at least we can try to guess some especially because it's a projective measurement part and 5Q. Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I completely agree. But uh we can still try to make a case uh uh test whether this kind of description works or not. So you're now picking just one pair of states or this is one pair of states. Then, you know, as I mentioned, we are actually doing measurements for many, many pairs within the southern region. And actually, we can And actually, we haven't solved completely the genetic problem, but I want to start from the simplest case. That is, I can consider some extreme situation that for every pair you perform the measurement, you always get 0, 0. Of course, that happens with very low probability. You can do post-selection or mathematically. Or mathematically, you can imagine just that you apply the projection operator to 0, 0 pair for every pair of spins within this green region. So, this is extreme situation, but theoretically, this is the simplest setting to consider. So, in that case, I introduce this simple boundary constant: phi 1 minus phi 2 equals 0, and theta 1 plus theta. 2 equals 0 and theta 1 plus theta 2 is 0. That a particular boundary condition is now imposed over this green section. And the remaining part, you are not doing any measurement, so they remain free. So that's a center. And so we start from the ground state, by the way, can be regarded as. The slice at imaginary time zero or the pass integral. So you can imagine some initial state at imaginary time minus infinity and do the imaginary time evolution and the reach tau equals zero, then you should have the ground state. So the ground state wave function corresponds to the time size of this pass interval of a cylinder. Of a cylinder with half a cylinder of infinite length. And then you do the measurement on the green section, which imposes certain boundary constraints on this section. But this purple section remains free because you didn't do anything. But because we are interested in entanglement entropy, so we need to deal with density matrix. Density matrix. So initially, the density matrix is composed by projection operators of the graph. So we need a two-component, two-component free border field theory. And we also need a double copy to represent the Bura kit appearing in density matrix. And also, eventually, we want to consider the Eventually, we want to consider the culprit entanglement entropy and so on. So, using the replica trick, again, we need to prepare n replicas because we want to compute something like this. So, in Toda, we need 4N copies of 4N components to Navarat in Java Picture, 4N component revolves of music. And then at the boundary, on this green. Boundary on this green section, you impose this delivery type boundary constraint. And then, oh, this unmeasured section, if you take, okay, so this row is the DC matrix, which initially was the ground state, projection to the ground state, but then you impose certain boundary constraints on this green section. On this green section, but the purple section remains free. But then so this law is such a density matrix you obtain after the measurement or imposing this perfect function. Then you take the n spa of such density matrix, then take trace. Then in this purple section, you didn't impose any boundary constraint, but when you take the n spar of density matrix, you need to connect You need to connect one replica to the next because you are taking in small. So the J's component of ket field should be identified with J plus 1 bra component of next replica. And you need to impose this kind of boundary function. This segment. Then you compute the partition function. That's how you. Partial function. That's how you compute the partial function. And from this partial function, you can derive the integrand to be. But initially, I didn't know how to compute such a Passion function. So it looks like a simple problem, but I got confused. So I went back to the better-known program, the entanglement. Problem, the entanglement entropy of finite segments in infinity long conform field theory. This was already mentioned yesterday. And probably everybody knows that the full conform field theory in one plus one D, if you take the finite segment of REM2L, then this segment is entangled with the rest of the system. And the entanglement end to this follows this famous C over. This famous C over 3 times log L, and the C is a centroid. And context matter people often cite correctly, but this result was obtained earlier by Jose Ransen, who said in 94 paper, High Energy PFU. Although, of course, Clabrezekadi did many important contributions. But of course, I knew this result, and I went through. This result, and I went through, you know, corroborated Cardi paper about the derivation of this result several times. But honestly, speaking, it was not something I understood by heart, because often my students came to me and asked me, Professor, how to derive this formula? Then I couldn't go to Graphboard and show how to derive. And I I just told them to you can check this color cardio. You can check this calibrated cardiac paper to the extra. So I was kind of evading that question. But now I had to understand this formula better in order to solve our new problem. And by the way, so this paper is of course very, very, very well known. And of course, we know Frank Wicek, you know, November Royal, very central time. And the recent time freezer, everything. And when I say I didn't know this Finn Rao Sen, but he's a high energy theorist, and now he's a professor at the University of Michigan. I think he's a typical successful theoretical physics. But what about the fathers? Christopher Julce, this guy? I didn't know about this guy, so I just googled. So, I just googled and found something very interesting. So, actually, he's still in academia, but he's now director of some institute, Kruto-Rabble Institute for Cultural Inquiry in Berlin. So, apparently, he studied Oxford and then went to Princeton and got a PhD and Frank Reusek and wrote this famous paper on this. This famous paper on this entropy and safety. But after that, he went to Columbia University to get a master's degree in German literature. And furthermore, he got a PhD in paradoxical pressures in aesthetics, whatever it means. And then he went to German, he went back to Germany and did postdoc at Max Planck, but not in PKS or Optics or. PKS or bookdeaks or whatever, he he did postdoc at the Max Pramp Institute for History of Science in Berlin. And now he's a director in this cultural institute. He seems to have had an interesting career, still successful. He wrote a very important paper in PhD in physics, and he's doing some German literature or philosophy or whatever. So that's impossible. So um anyway, so so so so I I wanted to understand uh this famous result in my own way or maybe at least some way more familiar to context butter people like me. Um yeah, of course it's completely equivalent to what they did, but uh at least I I feel I done I und understand better. Let me discuss Let me discuss here. So, the phononga entanglement entropy is as usual derived as n goes to one limit of this Rainy entanglement entropy. The Rainy entanglement entropy is obtained by this. So, you first from the projection to the ground state, to CFD ground state, and then trace, take a trace for Traceful visions outside your segment, then take install this video static, then take look. And again, I use replica trick, introduce n replicas for brand kit. So I need a 2n replica field. And then, so similar to earlier discussion. Um outside the this vision A. So you first take trace, which means that you need to identify the bra field or tet field within each replica, this blue region. But in this red region, you didn't take trace when you define rho A, but you take n power of this rho A, then take. Power of this rowette and take trace means that you need to identify cat fields of one replica to draw field of next replica. And you impose a cyclic boundary constraint in terms of the replica. So n plus 1 goes to goes, it's related to n. So that means that you have one particular boundary function on this blue region and another different kind of And another different kind of boundary function on this red region. Then, between these two, you have a twist operator or a boundary constant changing operator. And once you formulate in this way, this replica culture function can be interpreted as a two-point function or this twist operator or boundary with an unchanging operator. And for this tense, And for distance between these two twist operator L, this behaves like a one over L to some power. And this power is determined by the boundary scaling dimension of the boundary constant changing operator. So the problem is deduced to finding this scaling dimension of boundary constant changing operator. And actually, for this, we can look up how this. Look up Cardi's textbook on Bongbang CFD or whatever. Then you can do the conform mapping from half infid frame with boundary constraint and two boundary constraint changing operator. Then you can do conform mapping so that one of these boundary constraint changing operators goes to imagine a time minus infinity. Imagine time minus infinity, and the other one goes to imaginary time plus infinity. Then you can map this system to the strip. And on one side of the strip, you have this red boundary function. And on the other side of the strip, you have blue boundary. So this is an infinite strip. Then you can consider transformatrix in this vertical direction, which you can Vertical direction, which you can interpret as a Hamiltonian with these two specified boundary functions. So, in this way, the scaling dimension of this boundary function changing operator is determined by the ground state energy of Hamiltonia with this particular boundary function. And I use subtract as a reference ground state of the street, well, ground state of the Hamiltonian with boundary function. Of the Hamiltonian with boundary constraint, same boundary construction opposed. So if you subtract ground state energy for this from ground state energy for this set of boundary functions, then you subtract this ground state energy. Then this determines the scaling dimension of the boundary function. And for our problem, we have to So, our problem with this entire main entropy safety is kind of easy to calculate because first let me start from this blue-blue boundary constant. Then blue boundary constraint means that you identify bla and ket within the same replica. So, in this case, let's start from bra field. Draw field of one replica, let's say replica, then you hit the boundary, then you are smoothly connected to t field of the same replica, let's say replica one. And then you come back, then you hit the other side of the boundary, the other boundary, then you are again connected to Bura 1 because Buru boundary concentration connects Bura and Kate Field within the same replica. Same replica. So for this combination, you know, ground k fields are connected within each replica. So this becomes equivalent to just a periodic boundary function, but with circumference 2L, because you go to right and transfer connected to kit. Transfer connected to ket and you come back to left then connected to ground. So the ground state energy for this set of boundary condition is equivalent to ground state in the circle, periodic boundary condition, but with circumference 2L. And you have n biblicals. So for circumference 2L, so there is a famous formula for the graphite. As formula for the gravitate energy with periodic boundary function, first derived by Gray Day Cardi and 19 Herr and Young Affairs 1986. So they did this independently, but those two papers were published back to back in PRL, the same issue. But this is another very well known formula. And you just have, we need to use 2L because the circumference is now 2L. And then you need And then you need to put n because you have n replicates. So a ground state energy is n times the ground state energy of a single component. So this is a reference energy. And on the other hand, for this pair of boundary functions, you start from, let's say, t field of J replica, well, first replica, and follow this to the right, and then This to the right, and then you hit this red boundary, then you are connected to a BRA field of next replica five bra2. Then you come to left, and then if you hit when you hit the left boundary, you are smoothly connected to ket field of the same left bar. So phi ket of two. Then you are reflected back. Reflected back, and when you hit the right boundary, now Phi2KED is smoothly connected to Phi3 bra because of this boundary control. So you go back and forth between these two boundaries, then now every field is connected with each other. So now you can dig out this system as a again as a link with a periodic boundary. But the whole two end components of the field are connected. Component of the field connected one by one. So this is single conform field theory, but with on a link with circumference 2 and L. You go back and forth and you change the component one by one and eventually every connect component is connected and you have a single wing, single ring, but with Ring, but with a bigger circumference, but of the single components. So the ground state energy for this pair of boundary functions is famous pi C over 6 but times 1 over 2 M L because now circumference is 2m. So if you subtract between these two then you find this pi C over 12 L and you can identify this as with bound With scaling dimension of boundary constant changes. And in this way, we can see naturally why this combination n minus 1 over n appears. Of course, this is known for many, many years. But now I feel like I finally understand why this must be the case. So yeah, so this is again by one of Ian's most important contributions to physics. To physics. Okay, so now that I found the dimension of the scaling dimension of the boundary constant changing operator, I can plug into this formula. Then the Rainy entanglement entropy is like this. And taking the limit of n goes to 1, I can reproduce the famous Jose, Rassen, Mujek, Carabrezi, Cardi Focum. And maybe I spent too much time to just re-derive Just a re-derived very, very known result. But now I can use a very similar way of calculation to my new program. So now, so this measurement gives one type of boundary function, but still kind of simple G3 type boundary constant. And this part, you know, I'm measured. So this is similar to the So this is similar to the late section I just discussed. So then we can identify two boundary function changing operators, which is very similar to the previous one, but not exactly identical. But in any case, the scaling dimension of this boundary constant changing operator can be related to the difference in the ground state energy for this open strip. For this open strip with this green-purple boundary constant, then you find the ground state energy and you subtract the ground state energy for this green-green boundary constant. So, very similar calculation, some difference. But you can easily do this because these boundary conditions are simple Dirichlet type. So, yeah, in the end, you can find the scaling time. The scaling dimension of this boundary constant changing operate rather easily. And this turns out to be n over 6 minus 1 over 24, which is similar to the scaling dimension of the previous one, but not exactly the same. Idea is very simple. So now I can plug in and do very similar calibration then by taking Then tip by taking a Fonnumer limit. So, this is what I find for the entanglement entropy between two unmeasured sections of XXZJ. So, initial data in the ground state, then you did the bare pair measurement in one region. And suppose that you always find 0, 0. Then, after that process, two remaining sections of XX. Sections of XXC chains integrate with each other. This is what I find from boundary CFT. This is very similar to this Jose-Russian wheel check result, but with different coefficients, one six. And my co-operator Hoshino-san did the numerical corporation. And yeah, basically, okay, so numerically, he found. So, numerically, he found some subtle even odd effect, but on average, you know, it follows this logarithmic form very well. And he introduced extra term for better fitting, which I don't quite understand. But anyway, overall shape agrees very well with this CFT form, and he fitted this coefficient. This coefficient numerically, then he found a 0.165, 168, 170, and theoretically, we have 16, which is 0.166. So the agreement with CFT and new legs looks very good. So what is E level up? Little L? Uh yeah, I think the legs of the interval. Yeah, so there's small L. Yeah, yeah, small L. And uh Talking about the when the even or the required combinations in modes between the chains. Well, yeah, maybe we can look at it in this way, but we just started from, you know, each chain belongs to C1. So, oh, yeah, actually, we did use some free work. Yeah, actually we did use some free WoSOM properties. So I have to say that our design, I'm not sure how general this is. I mean for port sizing this may not work, but this is what we derive for the entangling current between the even combinations with odd combinations of them. Yeah, yeah, but but uh we we we we computed the entanglement between chain one and chain two, so we didn't change our basis to us. That's okay. Yeah. So should I understand this result as the measurements on the B parts glue essentially those CFTs together? Yeah, in some sense maybe, yeah. So then I expect this to be very general. Well but we we did Well but but uh we we did use this uh change of basis kind of trick, so yeah, actually we we we did similar num numerical experiments or similar setting in Ising, but I it didn't match quite well. So yeah, we we have to think about other cases. Didn't work? Like yeah, didn't work. Ah, at least in straightforward way, yeah, so so yeah. Yeah, also depends on which basis also. Basis of truth. Can I add something very stupid? So the setup is you measure in an interval and then you the entanglement entropy that you compute is by partition that corresponds to the same interval. Well the the final uh question is entangled entropy between this interval and this interval. Interval and disintegral. I see. So it's between the two. Okay, yeah, yeah, I can. And at least for uniform outcome, you know, we projected this part onto one particular set. So entire system is PRC. So entire maintenance would be still will be fine. But sorry, but then this looks quite different from what you introduced any. Why don't I twist at all? Why do you need twist? Well, yeah, because this measurement introduces certain boundary constraints on this section. So so at this point, you know, to the left and right, uh you have different boundary constraints in our code. Boundary constraint in our conversation. So you have some kind of boundary constraint changing operator between how we view the problem. If you consider other uniform betterment outcomes post-selection calling like zero one or something, your boundary function boundary function but Somewhat different boundary function, but the outcome should be the entanglement should be the same. Boundary condition changing operator will be different. Yeah, yeah, different, but kind of equivalent you can map with each other. Sophie, can I just about the numerics on the slide before? So there is this sort of E0 effect. Is that sort of similar to what you see in recall that sort of ELF? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, and introduces exactly this. Yeah, I think my corroborator imported this from some earlier similar issues. Yeah, I think it was recently open shading. So maybe I'm just ignorant, but I don't know how to quickly just at least phenomenal is correct. And also I have to mention that so this agrees with DCFD. Agrees with PCFD. Also, our theory predicts at least this main part is completely independent of the Latinja parameter or this anisotropy parameter of the X execution, which roughly is consistent with experiment. They basically found the same coefficients, one over C. Two are different. Yeah. This fitting coefficient here is which order of magnitude are they? Which order of are they related to are they negligible or are or are they like an unimportant? Oh, you're asking whether this part or this part is dominant? Yeah, okay, so this curve corresponds to this overall shape. So the this difference is more like curve. Okay, so maybe I won't need this one, but but uh yeah, so it's overall curve. This overall curve is explained by this. So I would say this is more to me, but yeah, also, yeah, he also calculated Rainy entry, which roughly agrees with this theory. And finally, I have to say that, as I mentioned, this theory is for very special situations where all the measurement outcome is. Measurement outcome is supposed to be the same, all 0, 0, which is, of course, very special case, which can happen with very, very low probability. So, more realistic, at least in measurement context, is that every time you measure, you get one of the four results. And almost randomly. There is some correlation. Every time you measure, you get one of four results. And that That may be modeled by imposing many different boundary constraints. Then you get many, many boundary constant changing operators. Then you need to compute a correlation function of those many point correlation function of boundary function changing operator, which I still don't know how to calculate. I have some idea, but it looks different difficult. But the question was my collaborator, anyway, did the numerical essay. The numerical estimates of the entanglement would be for all possible measurement outcomes, then took average of possible measurement outcomes. And after the averaging, he found very similar curves as in the uniform case. I don't know exactly why, but he found okay, so the C-SM size is small, but he found this 0.17 0.17 times log blah blah blah blah. So this question 0.17 seems pretty close to 1.6. And for that, we don't yet have explanation, but maybe even if you consider more general outcomes, but by taking the average, maybe the result is the same. Or maybe there are some small differences. We don't know this is our status. Status. So, okay, so as I mentioned, we tried, or he tried also, I think. He found some strange results. We don't yet have it. So, to summarize, yeah, I introduced a problem of many-body version of internet swapping between two schema cards fixed in keychain. And I could map this to boundary safety problem correctly. These two boundary safety problem correlation function of boundary function changing operator. And actually, for me, it was important to understand, at least better for me, it's a classic result. Once you understand this, it's kind of easy to compute this. That seems to work, very good agreement with numerics. But I don't know yet how to compute the average entanglement of theoretically using public safety. Using public safety. And more generally, so for this problem, at least for uniform outcome, this approach replacing the measurement post-measurement state with certain conformally invariant boundary constraints. Of course, that's very non-trivial assumption. But this hypothesis or answers seems to work well. But I'm not totally sure I'm not totally sure whether this kind of description is always valid. Maybe for some problems, some measurement outcome, this kind of simple description does not work. But then I don't know when it does, when it doesn't. That's very interesting question. And yeah, finally, if anybody is interested in skiing this afternoon, let me go. Thank you. Can you please show the previous slide with the Isaac? So what is the blue is yeah, so this is for uniform outcome zero zero and this is for uniform outcome zero one. Okay, so for the left one let's say yeah this maybe yeah look similar. maybe s yeah looks similar to this log error. I I forgot the coefficient, but uh for this one maybe it's working, but uh for this one maybe it looks more straight. It's promising. Oh yeah, yeah. So maybe this one maybe we can describe right. I think it's like gluing the two and you get the C yeah yeah perhaps I should think about this seriously. And just hoping the new memory now. Now is the issue for the number one measurements that don't have the right boundary condition and changing operators in the contingent. Yeah, maybe so. So, yeah, there is some even odd effect or something and for odd or even I forgot, but one of these odd-even lengths, you always have log2 for something. Sorry, can i don't understand what is the UB4? Measurement for each pair of spins. So w you pick one spin from uh chain one and uh another spin from chain two. Yeah, yeah. Then uh if you Then, if you do bare pair measurement, the outcome is that always one of these four. And after the measurement, you project onto one of these four very pair states. And uniform 01 means that you project onto 01 state for all the pairs in measured width. Yeah, so in your expressions you had a plus constant at the end. Is that all just non-universal terms or is there could there be a log D? You mean you're asking about this concept? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I think, yeah, okay. So here we didn't discuss the concept, but of course if you If you yeah, in general, there must be some constant which you can't. Yeah, yeah, but uh when we had a hundred when you have this logarithm term, this constant is always kind of washed out by this logarithm. This globalism, because there is some universal universal constant coming from this logic. But if you consider a uniform system, then this constant boundary entropy becomes important. But for this particular problem, if you do bepiri measurements, you know you are projecting to but still if if measured Measured states can be described by boundary safety, then it should have some universal operation. Usually it shows up so that you can get it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Other constants would cancel out. Yeah. Yeah, I agree that generally we should expect some constant which is universal. I mean, in this case I'm a bit confused how we just detect this, but How we can detect this. Generally, I agree with you. That's the other question. Yeah, but also about this formula. So it's boundary. I mean, to me, it looks, I mean, dispute remember, but almost like exactly the formula for open boundary conditions in the 1 over 6, and then as Eric said, you have the log g term, right? So, and then you also have this alternating term, actually, exactly, which is minus k. So maybe. By this case, maybe because it is a boundary conformal feature, or you may be the same, same result as we should think about this seriously. Also, another comment I want to make is that so this one six is smaller than one third, famous this older. Uh, all the research, which is, I think, uh, the guy actually, I I talked to some quantum information guy in India. He was telling me because so in initial state, so before doing any measurement, so this part and the rest of the chain was entered, and it was one south. And it was one thousand times low. And then you do this Perupian measurement. Then this guy is now entangled with this guy. But this new entanglement must be upper bounded by original entanglement between this guy and the result chain because it was a source of entanglement. So, but an interesting point is that in the beginning, I In the beginning I uh introduced the original setting of uh uh entanglement swapping for four qubits setup. In that case you had the perfect entanglement, perfectly entangled pairs, then you do the measurement, then two remaining qubits were now uh perfectly entangled. So log two. Um but in this case this uh part was entangled with uh basically Entangled with base of the chain with one third times row. But after the measurement, this guy is now entangled with these guys with one sixth times row. So the entanglement is reduced, which can happen, I think. But I think you cannot possibly have a larger entanglement compared with the initial one. But in this case, one third times rho is reduced to one sixth times rho, which is About six types of which is, I think, yeah, yeah. Isn't this just from the gluing? So by measuring the developed pairs on the left, you glue them at one boundary. They just share one boundary. So that should be half of the original one, because originally you had periodic boundary conditions. I think one sixth is natural. Yeah. I don't understand what you think. Apart from COVID three or four COVID three because I'm not sure. Oh, well, but I mean, from the viewpoint of these guys, this was entangled with rest of China with one side. Of course, in some sense, total entanglement or whatever is reduced, maybe total. One more question, Andrea. Just out of curiosity. So, the protocol you use to make media. You use to make measurements is you make measurements on the same height on the chain, right? Have you tried to see what happens if you measure like two qubits which are not on the same chain? Yeah, that's an interesting question, but right now I don't know any answer. Maybe maybe interesting. Yeah, so yeah, actually some contact information guide told me that Guy told me that if your goal is to, if I understand correctly, if your goal is to maximize the entanglement between this guy and this guy after the measurement, maybe this bear pair measurement is not optimal. So there may be more optimal way of doing measurement between these guys. So maybe including the introducing some long range attack. Long range or something like that. So I don't know any answer, but that's maybe two situations. So uh is there some formula at some point like the ratio to point out? To point out which other data. But um, that's just what we did and I couldn't do it. You actually need to have your skills. So it's kind of it's kind of like
