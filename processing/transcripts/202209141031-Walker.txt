It erases almost everything except the standing rotation. But what I'm going to do is recapitulate the main theorem that I stated last time from the point of view of exterior algebra. So the main theorem was about DG modules over symmetric algebra, and as I mentioned last time, by DGG, that's the same. A DG module versus SN is the same as a DG module EN over symmetric equivalence. So the theorem obviously has to have an analog for. Has to have an analog for modules over the exterior module. And here's what it says. So it's really just a restatement of the theorem. In particular, the characteristic still can't be two. Now, P is a perfect EGE sub-N module. That's all I have to assume. No, it's cleaner, the length of the fear out of this. It's cleaner, like this. Then, remember, H of P is my idiosyncratic notation for just the sum of the dimensions of the homology of a thing, of anything, a complex or a space. So these two to the end, which would be great. I stopped right there, and that would be the DGE module version of the generalized Torrel rank conjecture. But unfortunately, there's another term. It's chi. Another term, and it's chi of p bar now over h of p bar. I'll throw in absolute values, where p bar is just p tensored into a resident field. So to make this really concrete, it's just p modulo, the submodule generated by algorithms. And as Shree was saying just after the first talk during the break. After the first talk during the break. Maybe I should have done this sooner before getting into the topological interpretation. Because the connection between this purely algebraic theorem and topology is somehow really clear. Space X with the torus action determines such a P by taking its singular chain complex. And P bar corresponds to the chain complex attached to orbit space. So just, if you just, in your mind's eye, replace P by X and P bar by X. Replace p by x and p bar by x of t, that's exactly the couple. Much easier to see. Okay, let's prove it. Proof is shockingly easy. So the central idea is just to approximate the total homology, so H themes, of the following contents. Just tensor P with itself. Answer P was itself over E. And I'll just make an observation here. This is the same thing as P tensored over K with itself barred. Remember, barred means if you have an E module, you modify the action of variables. And how does, so I need an E module here. How does E act on the tensor product of two copies of P over the ground? Product of two copies of P over the ground field, and it acts diagonally using the fact that E is a Huff. So, built into this sort of secretly is the fact that E is not just an algebra, but it has a co-multiplication. Okay, so we're going to approximate this in two ways. Way one, which is the easy way. Wait, Mark, can you just say that again? Sure. The top one, I'm just, they're both e-module. They're both E module. They're both intensive. E is not commutative ranked in the ordinary sense. So I haven't been careful about whether my module is a left module or right modules. It makes sense of this notation. You have to interpret it as both. Which is okay because he is gradient Q. So don't ask me to get the science straight. But what I'm saying is, equivalently, you could first take the tensor product over K, and that would be a priori over an exterior algebra in twice as many variables. That's right. It'd be a mod over E. That's right, it'd be a module over E tensor E over K. But there's a co-multiplication that goes from E, and that multiplication is an algebra now. So by restriction of scalars, I can think of this as an E module. And now tensor down to K. Trust me, it's the same thing as tensor as doing this modulo, getting the sign straight. Okay. So the easy way to approximate this number, which I will not present as proof, I'll leave it as an exercise. It's honestly not that hard. It's honestly not ever. It's at most the homology of P itself times the homology of P. Okay, so I won't tell you how to prove that. It's not hard to see how it has been. You could use a spectral sequence argument, pretty simple. Maybe that's not easy. There's also easier proofs that just use subduction rank or something like that. So the sneaky way to cross. The easy way to approximate it is to say like this: 2 to the n times the absolute value of chi p bar is a lower bound for computer tensor. And let me just observe that the theorem is an immediate consequence, right? Because if I just take If I just take, so this is at most at, which in turn is at most this. So by transitivity, this is at most that, and I just divide it through H of T bar. I can get this. Josh, what are you on true? I think it's really holding it because it's right outside the road. Oh, yeah, right, good point. Yeah, certainly. This poem doesn't need much fruit. This problem doesn't need non-trivial. It's just uninteresting untrivial case. Okay. All right. So I will prove the sneaky way. Oh, but first, let me try to warm up the topologist a bit. So in topology, what have I done? I'm going to approximate the tensor, not tensor product, the product of x with itself over the torus, which Over the torus, which you can take to mean by definition, take two copies of x and mod out by the torus using the diagonal action, just like I did in the exterior place. Then the two claims become that the homology of x over t with x is at most the homology of x times the homology of the orbit space of the orbit space. To the orbit space, and 2 to the n times the Euler characteristic of the orbit space at most H. Okay. All right, excuse me proof of two, which will be out. Which will be algebra, sorry to say. I can kind of give some insights of what's going on topologically, but I won't get you so far. So let C sub 2 be the cyclic group of order 2 generated by tau, say. And let's observe that it acts on this tensor product in kind of the obvious way, except you've got to get the signs straight. So you just interchange the two factors and pair a simple tensor. A simple tensor, but then you raise it to the negative 1 to the plot 1 degree. So the absolute value of an element in a gradient ring is the degree of the element, for sure. Just write that for short now. Okay. So this implies, since we're in characteristic other than two, that this tensor product decomposes into an even and odd eigenspace. An odd eigenspace. Eigen value 1 and eigenvalue negative 1. That's the one and only spot I use the characteristic is not equal to 2. And then just to avoid having to write this monstrosity, S has been taken, I realize, but I'm going to use it again. So it's going to be an S sub E. So this usually goes like the second symmetric power of an E. That's what. That's what the first symmetric power. That's what the first sum n is. And the second one is like the second exterior problem. All right, so these are just shorthand for those, even in odd items based some minutes. Okay, then we introduce this thing called the second atoms operation. So to denote psi 2 of an E module P. This is, by definition, This is by definition the second symmetric power, as I've just defined it, minus the second exterior power. Quotes around it, what does it mean to subtract a module from another module? Well, this is really taking place in the quote-unquote group of perfect DGE modules. Let's not get uptight about that, because the only thing I care about is the Euler characteristic of this formal expression, which is just the difference of the honest Euler characteristics. So the only thing I need to define So the only thing I need to define the root, so you could treat this as a primitive definition, which even if there's no notion of psi two, you could take this as a definition. It's the Euler characteristic of the second symmetric power minus the Euler characteristic of the second histogram. So one time in my life, I studied atoms operations extensively in the context of Extensively in the context of biological theory. So, this to me is a very natural thing, and so are the following very basic properties. So, three properties called A, B, and C, I guess. A is that the second atom's operation, and therefore the Euler characteristic of it, is atom on short exact sequences. Short exact sequences of perfect DGEN modules. So that just means if you give me a short exact sequence of perfect DGEN modules, this is just an integer, right? Let me check. Make that clear. You said a numerical invariant. Given a short exact sequence, the value of this numerical invariant on the middle one is the sum of its values on the outer two. That's all I mean by outer two, on short exact sequences. Sequences. I never know whether this is a consequence of one or not. I never remember. Oh, sorry, I wasn't going to use that intuition. If you suspend, so sigma p just makes, take p and shift its indexing by one, and you do something with a differential as well. If you suspend by one, then that flips the sign. It's denoted variant. B might be a consequence of A, I never quite remember. A consequence of today. I never bought it around there. But let's play it safe. And then finally, so far I just have this nice numerical invariant, and the third property is the only one that I'll prove, and it's the one that's going to pin it down for us. So far, it could be the zero invariant, right? Okay, but this rules that out. Guess what this is? So, what's the simplest perfect DGE module? ESL. Itself. Yes. To the end, very good. It's the only thing that I'm going to do. I'm going to the end. To the end has to arise somewhere. Can I ask a question? I guess I have two questions. So the first is, what is the definition of psi 2 of P me over here? And you have the complex minus the complex. Yeah, so this, I said this out loud because I didn't want to get bogged down. So thanks a lot. The first thing is, you don't need to understand that, because you just need to understand the oil or color. But technically, this is really the formal difference of two classes in the Groton-D. But you only treat pi psi 2 as the primitive notion there, if you like. That's fine for my purpose. And then the second question: is there an easy way, like is there a heuristic for remembering the properties of atoms, of these atoms operations? Like, is there a. The Grotoni group is the universal. The Grotonate group is the universal gadget that has these two properties. Okay. So this is really just saying that this invariant factors through the Grotonate group. That's how I. And now lots of invariants factor through the code movement, but this one, this is the special one for our purposes. By the way, there are higher atoms operations. There's a sign three, et cetera. And what changes is the base. So the two you see there goes with the two you see there. They get increasingly more complicated. They get increasingly more complicated as far as the formula. All right, let me indicate how to prove C. A and B are just, anyone who knows K-theory knows A and B are true. And this one's a little bit more complicated. C is a little more complicated, so I'll focus on names. So, okay. How is psi 2 of P defined? You take P tensor P over E and you break it up and it's even an odd eigenvalue component of eigen spaces with respect to this involution. Spaces with respect to this involution. So I need to start by computing E, the answer itself for E, which is quite obviously isomorphic to E, just by multiplication, for example. Ah, you might think tau x trivially, but you'd be wrong. So tau x here are interchanging the factors. How do you think tau x here? Like I think it's like a plan? Yeah, it's sort of like it flips the sign of alpha to the side. It flips the sign of alpha depending on whether or not alpha is in an even or odd position. A grading operator. So let's ponder that for a second. So with this action of tau, the even part, in other words, second symmetric, this looks wrong to me, but trust me, it's going. The second symmetric power of E as a module over itself. In other words, the stuff fixed by this operator. This operator on E is exactly the even part, and the second exterior power of E is exactly the odd part. I've just described the even in odd space in that condition explicitly. So chi of S2 is the sum of the even binomials, which is 2 to the n minus 1. Which is 2 to the n minus 1, chi of the second exterior power v, which is the sum. Well, okay, remember this is an alternate sum, don't forget. So this only has stuff in even degree, and I'm getting the sum of the even binomials. This only has stuff in odd degree, and I'm getting the, so the negative of the sum of the odd binomials. So I get negative of those even binomials. But now we're done, actually, because chi psi 2. Pi psi 2 of e is just the difference of these two numbers, so it's 2 to the n minus 1 minus 2 to the n minus 1. Okay. Still been this approving two and I've run out of word space. Okay, well I guess I'll bank on you remembering the theorem that's really bad at what work is. Something that's really bad at what work isn't. Maybe I'll summarize the statement. Yeah. Okay. Well, the next little punchline here is these three properties merely imply the key factor. What is the key fact? Key fact is, well, I mean, you can maybe, if you know what a perfect AGE module, I didn't define it super carefully. If you know what it is, you can almost guess. But roughly speaking, But roughly speaking, a DGE module is perfect if it can be built from E itself by suspending and forming mapping columns. So especially by suspending and taking extensions. So A and B say, together at least, tell you, you know exactly what happens when you either suspend or take a mapping income. And C says you know exactly what happens on the object that's building everything else. So these three properties determine what chi psi 2 node. Chi psi 2 nose for any perfect E module. And it's 2 of the n times chi there. I'll notice that I can now cheat a bit and modify my property C. I can think of this as 2 to the n times 1. I'll realize 1 as chi of E bar. What's E bar? So, what's e-bar is you might have intenser number k. So, e bar is just k. Sitting at debris zero. So, chi of e bar clip one. So, again, c says the key property holds for itself. A, b says everything built for me must also satisfy that property. Because, yeah, maybe one of the points you've made here is both sides enjoy property. So, the left side does, I'm asserting this. The right side of that equation also enjoys both these properties. So once you know this equation holds for the thing that builds all others, i.e. itself, and that's what part C says, you know it's true for, so I've already given proof of the key factor. Done. All right. Now we're almost done. Are you ready? Remember what I'm doing here? I'm proving the stinky fact. I developed a machine that's going to help me. So I'm trying to find a lower bound on P tensor with itself over P. So again, since this decomposes into even and odd eigenspaces, I can think of this as the total homology of that even part, just the second symmetric power of P, plus the total homology of the odd part, otherwise known as the second exterior power of P. The second exterior power of P. And then I'll observe something. So if I replace this by chi of it, all I'm doing is removing the odd terms and replacing them with their negatives. So I only make this smaller when I do that. And now I'm going to do the opposite thing here. I'm going to throw away the even terms. And when I do that, that's comparable to the negative relations. This one is obvious. This is a little more confusing, but if you think about it for 30 seconds, you'll agree. H of anything is at least the negative of a. is at least the negative of its Euler characteristics. Ah, but this difference is by definition chi study 2, which by the key fact is exactly 2pn times chi. Done with the proof of the sticky fact. Easy fact I didn't tell you, but trust me, it is easy. And combining that gives the theorem, which I don't like. Let me forget it's an absolute sound. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So, what do you do if chi is negative? The simplest thing is you replace p by its suspension, and you flip the sign of chi without changing the value of h. So, let me remind you what the conclusion of all this is right here. H of p times chi over r absolute value of h of r. So, this is just the justification, the case when chi is pi. The justification in the case when chi is positive, chi of p bar is positive for actually. But you can either just replace p by its suspension, do the other case, or you can run the same argument, just interchanging the roles of these two things. This is at least a negative designer characteristic. Okay. Alright. So, um, let me say a few words. That's the complete proof of the theorem. I fit it onto one board at the expense of racing this. On board at the expense of erasing the statement. Let me try to say something that might resonate more with the politics. So first of all, so long as n is at least 1, is the number of variables for the dimension of the torus. So the n equals 0 case is not very interesting. So, the n equals 0 case is not very interesting. But technically, what I'm going to say would be false if n equals 0. So, as long as n is equal to 1, what is true in fact is that, so looking back to the proof a second, I used this idea from k-theory involving the second atoms operation, which is the formal difference of the second symmetric power and the second exterior power. And the reason I did that is because I knew that psi2 is additive and behaves with respect to. And it behaves with respect to suspension. So it's a well-behaved invariant. It turns out that as long as n is at least one, the individual terms here, both sn and lambda n, are also well-behaved in that way. It's a little harder to see, but it's true. So, and then from that, you can deduce that chi of S2 of P itself is exactly 2 to the n minus 1 times whatever chi of p r is. Pi of P R is, and chi of lambda 2P is exactly a negative fact. And you can see that if I had proven these two facts first, then the thing that I call the key fact and the proof of the theorem would have been an immediate consequence. Because remember, chi of psi 2 is just the difference of these two things. K fact is actually a consequence of these more elements. Consequence of these more elementary facts. And again, if n was zero, this would make no sense. A fracture. And that would be at least one. Okay. So the reason I mention this is because I can interpret one of these facts and topology a bit. I can ask some questions about it. What's the analog of taking the second symmetric power of an exterior algebra over an exterior algebra of a D? Over an exterior algebra of a DGE module. Topology of the space of the torus action. And you take its second symmetric power, which in topology is sometimes written as sp of x. So by this I mean just literally take x cross x and mod out by the action of the involution. That's the second symmetric power of a topological space. Since x had a torus action, this inherits a torus action in an obvious way. And so you can then mod out by it, okay, comment out. mod out by it, okay, homotopy orders. So what's true is that this is the same thing as 2 to the n minus 1. So that's a topological analog of this topology. Okay, so I don't know how to interpret the second one. Maybe there's some way of thinking. One, maybe, maybe there's some way of thinking of the second one. I don't know how you take the space, across itself, you have an involution. How do you take the negative one eigenvalue? Maybe there's some way of making sense of that, but I don't know what it is. Okay. But at least half, if, and, you know, if you could, I could say this, if you can, if you knew this, this is actually a consequence together with the key label. So there's like three equations here, any two of them imply the option, by the way. So in some sense, this is maybe the key equation. Negative key. Could you suspend do an S and V? I don't know, maybe. You probably want to suspend. To get the lambda two analog, yeah. But let's not worry about it. Okay, so then there's the questions. So let's see, let me motivate this question by saying, so as I said, it'd be fantastic if this fraction didn't make sense, because then you'd be proving all of these conjectures. Like, for example, the Torrell-Brand conjecture. If only this fraction was If only this fraction was one. In other words, if somehow you didn't have to use chi here. So, questions I have for topologists, which may or may not have easy answers, and it may or may not be an easy question. I think it's a pair of questions. Does there exist X such that you take the homology of X cross T over X. T over X, and you get such a classical two here times the homology of X T for kind of a very related question involving symmetric power business, one for which the total homology of the second symmetric power of x divided out by its torus action is less than 2 to the mx times the homology of x t. times the homology of x t. So I've written h of xt both places here, not chi. That was on purpose. So the reason I'm asking this question, that's what I just want question, the reason I'm asking this question is if I'll say that this, any conceivable counterexample to the Torrel ring conjecture would So, the Torre-Rank conjecture would have to violate the top inequality. I think maybe it would have to violate both inequalities. Because if these inequalities would flip, then the proof would work just fine, and you wouldn't need chi-e-da. You could just use the true. So any conceivable counterexample would have to satisfy these strict inequalities. Now, it's not if and only if. So just if you hand me a space that satisfies this strict inequality, then my proof does not apply to it, so to speak. My proof does not apply to it, so to speak. I can't deduce the total rate conjecture using this argument. But it doesn't mean it is in contradiction to the total rank conjecture. It's not reversible. So again, it's spaces which have these properties would be candidates for counterexamples of the troll architecture. Okay. Questions? Okay, so you're saying can we find a space that satisfies either of these inequalities immediately apply anything that they could be candidates for passing? That's right. If you're looking for, I don't know why, I'm not trying to focus on the negative here, but if you're hunting for a count example, you should look for spaces that satisfy these problems. I don't know these results. Yeah, the argument doesn't work. All right. Okay, so new phase of the talk, counterexamples. Speaking of counter, counter, counter, counter examiners. And if I just for fear I forget to mention his name, as I appropriately should, I'll just say if I forgot the digital, this is all joined with three comments. In fact, I'll just give you a theorem due to us. Well, I'll end our first. And it's so the generalized total rank conjecture is false if characteristic of k is not equal to 2 and n is at least 8. So almost every time I mention the main theorem I have and the main counterexample I have, everyone assumes I made a typo and I met characteristic equals two, right? Because the theorem says, at least in some cases, the conjecture is valid so long as the characteristic is not two, so you think the counterexample characteristic is two, right? Not the case at all. The counterexample is also a characteristic not two, and n especially large. And let me just give the construction. And let me just give the construction, because it's amazingly straightforward. So, proof. Well, I'm actually, remember, the generalized total rank conjecture is equivalent to this perfect DGE module version of it. So, all I have to do is to find DGE module, eight module, say. I'll just focus on the kids n equals eight for simplicity. In the case n equals 8 for simplicity. EG8E8 module P, that is perfect and such that its total homology is strictly less than 58, which is 256. Okay, and what I'll do is I'll start with this magical element. With this magical element. So the generators of my exterior algebra E8 are E1 through E8. So I take this quadratic element, I'll call it omega. And really, the generic quadratic would work. But we can get away with this one. Break up the variables into pairs, multiply them together to add all these ones. Remember, I'm indexing things a little weirdly, so this is e negative 2. If the subscript here is the number of variables, the superscript is an indexing. It's negatively indexed. Okay, so then I take P to be just the mapping column of the map from E. Quite carefully about the sign. Again, the suspension is just the appropriate shift of index. But basically, you take the mapping cum of multiplication by omega, right? By omega, right? What do you do? In other words, just stare at it, think of it. Technically, this is a DGE module and not a complex of graded E modules, but it looks like a complex of graded B modules. Take the associated DGE modules. If you want to think of just a complex, that's like, if you want to erase the word column, you can add it in and say. Okay, so then the important fact about this is that this Of this mouth is either one-to-one or onto in each degree. So these are graded things, and this is a degree zero map that shifted the grading. So this induces a bunch of maps of k vector spaces in each degree. Each every time it's either one-to-one or not. Each every time it's either one-to-one or onto it. Ponder that for a second, minimizes the value of the homology. So, in fact, what you get, and I screwed this up in a notes going back, so what you get is that H of P is 1 plus 8 plus 8 choose 2 minus 1 plus 8 choose 3 minus 8, because 8 choose 1, and then Get one and then keep going, but eventually we'll get zero. Wait, what comes next? Eight, choose four minus, okay. Let's just do the whole thing. Someone tell me when I get zero. Next one's zero, right? Yeah. Okay, so that one can leave off. And the next to the next, so these are, this is, this is image takeaway kernel, image takeaway kernel, but this is where all the max are ejective. In the middle is actually a bijector. In the middle, it's actually a bijective, but we got turned off. And then where it's surjective, it's source minus, yeah. The things get flipped. So it's a, so there is no three five, but I don't actually hear my notes. Trying to figure it out before you compare my notes. Okay, this is what comes next, trust me. A five. There were multiple mistakes in the PDF notes here, by the way. Just completely ignore. Here, probably. Just completely ignored this. H use 8 is 1. And then another 8, number 1. This correctly? I don't believe this. I think it's correct. This is 8 choose 7 minus 8 choose negative 1. This is 8 choose 8 minus 8 choose negative 2. Alright? Okay. Someone tell me what that adds up to? Who's really good at that? By the way, a lot of the terms cancel, so you couldn't write it much more simply, but I'm not going to. So I couldn't write it much more simply, but I'm not going to bother. Exactly 252, which we'll notice is less than 256, which is 58. So that violates the perfect EN module version of the generalized follow-up conjecture. It's equivalent to the one called the generalized follow-up conjecture. So and then And then, so the history here is: we realize this was the simplest. Well, I mean, I wasn't trying to disprove it, I was trying to prove it. And I asked Sri, how can you prove this conjecture for this example? It doesn't seem like my proof doesn't apply, this example. So let's find a way to prove it. And I said, well, let's check to make sure it's really true. It always was, because we could probably calculate this, right? All right. So, what do you think about smaller ends? Smaller X? Yeah, I don't know. We don't have a camera sample less than 8, that's for sure. Oh, by the way, someone might have, here's a question you should have asked. Where did I assume the characteristic is not 2? Yeah, from this fact. So since characteristic k is not 2, this map is either 1, 1, or 1. That's not that easy to prove. In fact, I guess, though, I should have. In fact, I guess, oh, I should have remembered a citation. This is probably a well-known fact. We learned this in a paper by Konka and others. I forget, sorry. We got this from a paper that Tree knew. And in general, you can play the same game for any even, instead of eight, we play with any even number, the same quadratic form. And there's, so long as the prime is big relative to n, this fact will remain true. When n is h is true already when big. When n is 8, it is true already when p is at least 3. But it's worth pointing out, the fact definitely fails when the characteristic is 2. Does anyone see why? It's a very nice thing that happens, or that happens. About omega? Something about omega squared? Zero. That's what's special about an exterior algebra and character. That's what's special about an exterior algebra and characteristic too, is that the square of everything is zero, not just the square of the generators. So, by the freshman stream, right? So if you ponder that for a second, it's clear this fact cannot hold. And indeed, whenever omega squared is zero, if you replaced omega by any element that had the property that squared was any odd element, any characteristic, say, if the square is ever zero, Any characteristic say. If it squares every zero, you won't be getting a category scuffle. Definitely. In fact, it satisfies the, for a linear thing, it satisfies the bound on the nodes. Why when you get it, it's just the rank computation images contain the kernel, and that's probably you'll see. So maybe this is probably something that you're seeing. But if I did this cone construction just with a smaller E, which part of this doesn't work? Doesn't it work? Like I did the cone construction, but I had the exterior algebra on six things. Oh, yeah, so again, it's fact, or is it you need the character? Yeah, I forget, I forget the exact theorem, but a map no one. But it's the fact, it's fact that fails up there. No, the fact is always true in characteristic zero, no matter what n is. It just doesn't quite make a thing smaller than 28. So basically, there's, yeah, in characteristic zero, you can take any value of n you like, and the same construction kind of applies, but it's not going to be. Kind of applies, but it's not quite a counterexample until you hit eight, then it is, then it gets like a more and more impressive counterexample, then it gets to be a less and less impressive counterexample, but it's always a counterexample. Somehow it maxes out when n is about 12, I believe. It violates the bound to the most, the greatest distance by some metric when n is around 12, is that it called. No way of understanding why that's meaningful. Combinatorics of the catalog numbers that come up here. I think three confidence, yes, I guess. Are you sure it's true? Are we just making that up? No, I just said it's some combinatorics of the Katara numbers that come up here. Yeah, I know. I thought you were true. Middle binomial coefficient or something. I thought you were true. And characteristic 0 theta is already left shit, maybe earlier. Yeah, that's true. So characteristic 0. Yeah, that's true. So in characteristic zero, here's how you can see that you know algebraic geometry. There's the cohomology of a product of elliptic curves is an example of an exterior algebra. And so by the Leschet's theorem, there has to be some degree of L2 element that has this property about being injective and surjective. Okay. So, important note to make. Okay. So the DGS, let me say H module associated to the P in our theorem. Theorem. Module of name. I'll ask. It's semi-free. I'm satisfied it's the following. It's degree zero part is isomorphic to the field. It's degree three part cohomology in degree three is also a field and it's zero in all of the degrees. It helps enough. So if you ponder that for a bit, If you ponder that for a bit, you'll realize there's no way. So F is definitely not a DGS8 algebra, even uphomotopy. And there's multiple ways of seeing this, but the most elementary is if it was a replace by optahomotopy, I just mean there's no chain complex with these properties. Chain complex with these properties that has an algebra structure. Here's how you can see that. If there was such a thing, you'd get a map from S8 to F. Remember, the generators of S8 are all in degree 2. Those generators would be landing at H2 of F, which is zero. So roughly speaking, that says that the action is essentially trivial up to homotopy. But if the action were trivial up to homotopy, then it's easy to see that the Then it's easy to see that the bound predicted by the total rank conjecture would apply. So the fact that it doesn't apply says there's no way it has an alpha structure. So, in particular, this does not give, I don't certainly give a counterexample original toral conjecture. Original total rank conjecture. Generalized total rank conjecture implies this. This is a counterexample for the generalized total rank conjecture, but it does not provide a counterexample to the total rank conjecture. By the way, if it were. Do you mind just repeating the last bit? I couldn't hear it when you ordered that. Sure. What did you say was the example can't be an algebra basically because h2 is zero. Roughly speaking. Therefore, since it's not an algebra, well, okay, if it could be an algebra, but only in a trivial way, I guess, if I choose. If it were an algebra, the variables would act homotopically like zero. And if that were the case, then it wouldn't be a counterexample to the total rank conjecture. I'm sorry, it wouldn't be a counterexample to the total rank conjecture. But since this is a counterexample to the total rank conjecture, it must not have an algebra structure. Hence, it doesn't come from a topological space. It doesn't come from a topological space. That's the password. An example of a DGS module that's not realizable as a topological space. Those are not rare, by the way, but this is definitely such an example. Okay, so in the remaining 15 minutes, I want to say a little bit about the p-tournations. Just to kind of complete the thread here. Bunch of what I said, unless it's more, so we're moving away from. Unless there's more so we're moving away from Tori and moving into all the tribal AP groups, which is quite a change of topics, perhaps. So maybe I should pause for just a second. Any other questions? All right. So other speakers have used V for the elementary P group, rank N, and X will be a compact. X will be a compact V CW complex now. So for the first time, I should arrange what's over here, I suppose. For the first time, X has changed meaning. So every X with an action of the N torus gives an example of such an X. Well, you have to worry about the CW complex, but a torus action induces an action with an elementary P and P torus. That's why they call this P tori, I think. Okay, just the elements of order P and the torus. The elements of order P of the torus give those weak models. And I'll remind you what I believe is known as Carlson's conjectures. This Carlson has two S's. So if V acts freely, then total homology of X with Fp coefficients. So I'll just leave this to your imagination. This is the cohomology of space with Fp coefficients. Middle H means add up. P coefficients, middle h means add up. Oh, I'll just add up. So it's the dimension is an F p vector space of all the homology of x with f p coefficients. So this invariant is predicted to be at least 2 to the n, where n is the rank of the elementary of the only people that's doing the reactive. Okay, and then there's an algebraic analog. I think a lot of what I'm saying right now is positive. A lot of what I'm saying right now, in this five or ten minutes, has been mentioned at least once or twice before. So who's this conjecture due to? So I believe it's accurate to say that Carlson predicted this when P is 2, and Adeb and Browder ask the same question or make the same prediction or something. I want to say it when P is arbitrary. And the statement. Yeah. The state A is F is a finite free complex of modules of the group ring with Fp coefficients. Oh, sorry, there's a finite free complex word modules is missing. There we go. So by finite free, I just mean it has a finite number of terms, and each term has free free free free free free Of terms, and each term is free of finite. So it's finite two-ways, really. Then the total homology, so again, I'll just write this down to this. The total dimension as an FD vector space of all the homology of F should again be at least two. So really I should call V V sub N or V sub N P, which depends on two criteria. So once again, it's an oh yeah, sorry. The algebraic analog is a strict generalization of Carlson's original conjecture. Because if you start with a space upon which V is acting freely, then you could take Freely, then you could take F to be the chain complex with Fp coefficients associated with that space, and that would satisfy these hypotheses. So again, it's a stronger conjecture because not every F comes, every X determines an F, but not every F comes from X. So this conjecture implies that one, but it's not reversible. Okay, so the last theorem I'll talk about, at least of one. So it's again just to be clear. Just to clear this joint. Same paper. Really, it's the same proof. The algebraic analog of Carlson's conjecture. It's false. Again, if n is at least a and the p is All right, and I've got this will be even more expensive and proof. The only reason I'm bothering to write it down is to indicate that it's actually the same example as in the previous counterexample. At least more of it. So just to avoid writing f sub p over and over again, let's call that ring R. A standard little trick when you take the group ring of an elementary of Billian P group and characteristic P is you can apply the freshman stream. Apply the freshman's dream and realize this is at least being up to isomorphism, the same thing as FP adjoined p variables or n variables, is ep module of the pth power of those variables. More directly, it's it joins in variables and thought out by the pth power minus one. But thanks to freshman string, we'll pull the p out and do a linear change of variables and get it out. I'm not sure I'm actually going to need those details. Okay, so the only fact I'm going to use in the rest of the argument is that R is a very nice ring from the point of view of computer algebra. It's a complete intersection. These elements form a regular sequence. Oh, and again, I'm going to take NDK for simplicity. Okay, then I take K. Okay, then I take K to be the Kazoo complex, so Irena talked about this a little bit in her talk, over R on the variables themselves. So for a more general complete intersection, by the way, you take a minimal list of generators at the maximal ideal. So in this case, the Y is the minimal list of the maximal ideal. Okay, and then, so what's true about Okay, so we understand its homology very well. So, first of all, this is a Kazole complex on any list of elements, any array is a differential-grated algebra. And we exploit that structure. So, the homology of K, since K is a DGA, this is an algebra. And in fact, it's just an exterior algebra over FP on generators E1 through E8. Remember, I take that in E8 now. That's not hard to see. But EIs are now of homological degree plus one, which is the same thing as homologically negative, but just homological. So I pick Z in K2. That's just the degree two part of the Gazul complex. I want to pick a cycle that represents the degree two part of the homology. The degree two part of the homology is the second great piece of the exterior power. Greater piece of the exterior colour. So the class in homology represented by this cycle, what it's supposed to do is give me omega, which is E1, E2. It's an all-friend omega. It's the sum of spots of carriers of vectors. And then finally, I do it, I said it's almost the same. And finally, I do it, I said it's almost the same proof in a way. I take p to be the mapping cone of, because it's not quite the same, but I lift this element z to k. So z is no longer literally omega, it's just an element in k2 that represents the homology class omega. But the point is, remember I said k is a DGA as an algebra structure, so it makes sense to multiply k by any element, and I'll get a chain map, so we get a chain map. So the chain cone of it, that's by P. So, or if you like, maybe cone is too complex. You can literally take that complex. Bunk at the exact same. Each K is a complex. So let's say map between complexes. Take its mapping. Or take the totalization of the complex, terminological. That's P. Then essentially the exact same argument that I ran through before gives us H of P is 242, which is less than 28. One more quick comment. So Irina mentioned the Betty degree conjecture in its original form, not the modified one that she and Eisenberg have all agreed on, but the original Betty-Degree formula, the Roman offices. We also disproved that. It's almost exactly the same argument. It uses the same idea. Everything, it's universal account. Everything, it's universal counterinsupple. And then finally, I want to mention this theorem that Mark Steffon mentioned yesterday, but I thought I'd just further highlight it today. It's a very important point. So the example, I'll just say this somewhat loosely, does not come from the space. So it's not a counterexample to Carlson's original conjecture. And in fact, they prove it quite a bit more. They show that if you tried to play the same game and replace omega by any element that has degree at least two, then the results cannot come from space. From a space. And if you, I kind of alluded to this earlier, if you use something of degree one, you won't get a counter example. I think, did you prove it does come from a space? It does come from a space. If you replace omega by degree one element, it does come from the space, but it's also not a counterexample. Okay. I'll close with just a question that maybe at least Mark will find interesting. You might be able to tell me immediately, but this is useless, but a recent PhD student. A recent PhD student of mine, Alexandra Seshiana. Okay, that's her name. Alexandra Seseshriyana. Is that right? I never really heard her talk before last moment. She might be on Zoom, so I feel bad. Yeah, I know what's on Zoom. Okay. I just call her Alexander. Never know it. So, anyways, this is not what I'm talking about here. This is Erica Hopkins, who was a joint advisee of mine, Alexander. She showed that. She showed that if you take the totalization, I confess I didn't check the details super carefully, but I might be lying slightly here, but I think this is correct. Basically, what is this here? Basically, what is this here? Instead of taking a single quadratic element, take a pair of them, chosen generically. They will automatically commute, because this is a graded commutative thing. So I can form their gazool complex. Falling omega 1 and omega 2. The analog of taking the mapping cone, I guess I should be calling these Z1 and Z2, but okay, I think I'm a lot of things here. It really lifts two k of elements, z1 and z2, in the experience. Take the gazool complex, and then at least for n sufficiently large, it has to be quite big. This is also a counterexample to the algebraic analog conjecture. So that seems incredibly implausible to me, but maybe by some miracle this comes from a space. Yeah. What's the size? It's a less impressive counterexample than the one we already knew about, unfortunately. But you mean how big should N be, or how bad is the counterexample? No, no, yeah. What's this? Length or the length of the margin. I don't remember. It's complicated. But it's not okay. It's not a... I think it's... It's possible it's like a tiny bit better than any of the ones we found. I forgot, to be honest. It wasn't rapped, I think, unfortunately. The question is: did we have to revise a 1.96 or not? 1.96 or not. Yeah, I mean, it's possible it was slightly better to the point, but the rounding we did, it's still correct. That's how close it was. All right, that's all I had to tell you. So thank you very much. Online to the audience. No. My favourite was that you said that. Is that you said that choosing an odd element for the map wouldn't have worked because of, but like if you chosen just to be a generic degree four elements. Yeah, you still get a countering sample. They're worse, and n has to get bigger and bigger. So if n equals eight, I think it would not be. But if you allow me to take an arbitrary quadratic element for n at least 50 or something, okay, that's the calculus. But it's a less impressive. And again, they ruled out the possibility. And again, they ruled out the possibility of those could be spaces. Or odd even. I think, I don't know if degree three is necessarily a kind of. No, it doesn't come from a space. And I think it's probably not a counterexample also. Yeah, it squares to zero. It's the same argument. Anything about degree squares to zero, so you can figure it out won't be a counterexample. So even if I think it's interesting, but even, yeah, but none of them comes as bases unless she's linear. That's what's the way it is. That's what's doing it. Any other questions? Is there, I mean, like, you had this restriction that P is not 2. I mean, there's some idea what, like, what you could care to think about what P is 2? Yeah, that's the obvious open question. I have no idea what to do. I mean, the positive theorem doesn't apply, the counterexamples don't apply. The counterexamples don't apply. Reason the theorem about the first rate of E for the core. Oh, that's that. Okay, that's good. Sorry. Sorry. I'll finish that thought, then I'll say it. Pre-confidence getting in. So the theorem I stated does not apply when p equals 2. The counterexamples don't apply. And the reasons they don't apply when characters 2 are just totally different. So it's hard to know what's happening with characters to 2. But I think the result is probably still true because at least the total rank could be. At least the total round conjecture, not this fudge factor. That's probably still true because I can prove a slightly worse lower bound. And instead of 2 to the n, it's, I believe, I think it's square root of 3. 3 times 2 to the n minus 1. Square root of 3 times 2 to the n minus 1. Or something like that. It's a different, the base is a little bit less than, it's a little bit less than 2 to the n, but still very much exponential. Very much exponential. And the idea behind that is we just use the third atoms operation instead of the second atoms operation, which is better behavior characteristic to the third atoms operation. But it leads to slightly worse results. Since in general, as we use higher atoms operators, it gets worse and worse. I had this vision once and could use them all to prove the BEH conjecture or something. It's not true. So, do you have any intuition or anything to say about still possible lower bounds that are not due to the like in the generalized Cochrane conjecture case? I mean, it looks like something should hold, right? Yeah, well, yeah, yeah. So, um actually Daniel Erman and I were just talking about this. So, we think that the conjecture one of the actors that Irina was talking about with the Irina was talking about with the Bookfeits, Braille-Schreier conjecture. We think that if, Daniel thinks, if that conjecture is true, then the generalized total rank conjecture does hold with the following slightly weaker lower bound. It's the square root of 2 to the n. Did I get that right? I think that's right. So replace 2 by the square root of 2. That's predicted by this other conjecture. So maybe that should be the real conjecture. I don't know. Maybe that should be the real conjecture. I don't know. What is the number of the two? Square root of two. Is it two to the end? It's square root of two to the end. Or two to the end over two, I realize. Yeah. Okay, so there are no more questions. I guess this is quite a day for today. There's going to be an open mic session tomorrow at 10.30, and the idea is that we all come up with questions and problems. Chat about it. Chat about it. There's nobody wants to prepare questions beforehand and wants to use the projector, you should let people tell their earlier method, Mark. Okay, thanks again, Mark. Okay, actually, can people think Okay, actually, can people stick around for about three minutes? Because it's it's a some people don't know where to go hike. This includes me to the meeting ourselves to the the home people probably know where we're gonna go hike. Yes. So it's just that, you know, some people might know what they're doing, but it might be nice if we set a time to meet for some group to go hike, right? And that people don't I don't know.
