So, I hope this won't be a problem, but if it is, that's what it is. So, what I'm going to be talking about here is the results of a paper written with Simon Lentner and Thomas Kurtzer. The title is the same as the title of the talk. And in the last talk, Simon gave some kind of very broad overview. And give some kind of very broad overview of the things that go into the things that we consider. And so what we're really looking at here is deriving techniques which are useful for proving conjectures appearing in the logarithmic Kazdan-Mushdo correspondence. So the logarithmic Kazdan-Mushdo correspondence, of course, starts with the work of Kazdan. With the work of Kazdan and Lushtig, and they proved a braided equivalence between certain representation categories of affine Lie algebras at generic level and some corresponding Holme groups. And these categories for affine Lie algebras were later realized as categories for associated affine vertex operator algebras. And so these sort of equivalences between VOAs and quantum groups are kind of broadly referred to as the Kasdan-Lushti correspondence. And when the VOAs in question are logarithmic, we say the logarithmic Kazdan-Lushti correspondence. And so this was first investigated for the triplet by Fagin, Ganutinov, Sony Katov, and Tipunin. Gunen. And in their work, they conjectured a rooten equivalence between module categories for the triplet VOA and the small quantum group at 2pth root of unity. And so what I'll be doing at the end is I'll be kind of stating some categorical and quasi-Hop algebraic results, and then we'll be applying these results to These results to address this conjecture in the smallest case of Q of a fourth root of unity. I'll also mention here that there are some higher rank analogs of the triplet. So these were defined and studied by Shading Tipunin and Adamovich-Milis. And I'll kind of come back and mention these at the very end. So, I'll briefly talk about kind of what's appearing here in this conjecture. So, the small quantum group, or sometimes referred to as the restricted quantum group, at root of unity Q, it's just the C algebra with generators E, F, K, and K inverse with these relations. You've seen this many times now through this colourful. Through this conference. And this quantum group admits a structure of a Hopf algebra given here. And this is kind of the standard choice of coproduct, co-unit, and antiproduct. Okay. And what you should think about here is when we're looking at the representation theory, the abelian structure is being kind of determined by the algebra structure and the Structure and the you know monoidal structure rigidity is being determined by the hop structure. Is there a power of k that is equal to one? No, we don't put this restriction here because we don't want integer weights. So the category of modules for For the small quantum group. Yes, sorry, we should have a power of k equal to one. Sorry, you're right. So later I'll talk about the unold quantum group, and with the unold quantum group, we don't take this. But here we should have a power of k equal to one. Which power would it be? P of p to 2p. Yeah, 2p. Okay, so the module category here, it has 2p simple objects and it emits a family of extensions. And of course, in this family, we have vermomodules induced from the borel parts. And the projective covers, they have Lewis diagrams. Louis diagrams just kind of given with this diamond structure. On the VOA side, we have an inclusion of vertex algebras where the triplet is contained in this lattice VOA. And so this gives us the following categorical data. So for the lattice VOA, we have a semi-simple modular tensor category. And this also has two-piece simple objects. 2p simple objects, and its structure is coming from some choice of quadratic form. And for the triplet, we have a non-semi-simple modular tensor category. So the triplet was shown to be CG co-finite by Adamovich and Millis, and then it follows from the work of Puang Lapowski and Zhang that this category is finite and braided. Category is finite and braided, and suchia and wood that this is rigid. And so we had this conjecture that these categories are ribbon equivalent. Well, an abelian equivalence was proven by Nagatomo and Tsuchia in 2009. However, it was later shown that this category does not admit of breeding. Does not admit of braiding. So, this conjectural ribbon equivalence with the standard Pop algebra structure on the small quantum group can't be true. But this raises a very natural question of can we put a different structure of a Haf algebra or quasi-Hoph algebra on the small quantum group, which does have graded representation theory and. Representation theory and does realize this equivalence. So, some work towards this was done in 2017 by Kreitzig, Gynutinov, and Rukel, where they proved that there does in fact exist a quasi-Hop algebra, a factorizable quasi-Hopf algebra, whose algebra structure coincides with that of the small point group. And they conjectured that this quasi-Hopf algebra Quasi-Hoff algebra does realize this equivalence with the triplet. And so, the way that they constructed this, we have a different conjecture between the singlet, VOA, and the unrolled quantum group of SL2. And so viewing the triplet as a module of the singlet, you can identify some commutative algebra object in the category of weight modules for the unheld quantum group of SL2, then its category of Then its category of local modules should be equivalent to the category of modules for the triplet. And what they did is they constructed a quasi-Hof algebra whose representation category is equivalent to this category of local margins. So we also have braided opaque tensor functors from the lattice V away to the triple. The lattice VOA to the triplet. And so these are defined by VOA restriction with respect to the free field realizations of the triplet. You can also just take the usual free field realization of the triplet, and then that will be one of your restriction functors. And then the other is given by twisting the resulting module by some automorphism of the checklist. And we also have. Triplet. And we also have a quasi-tensor functor from the triplet to the Lattice Field. And so what we ask in our paper is, how does this information characterize the modular tensor category of the triplet? So this quasi-Hopf algebra, which has representation theory. Has a representation theory equivalent to the triplet. Can we use this information to somehow classify its structure? So we know by, sorry, I got the order backwards. So we know by reconstruction along this quasi-tensor functor that the category of modules for the triplet can be realized by some quasi-Hoff algebra. By some quasi-half algebra, and that its algebra structure is isomorphic to the small quantum group. Okay, and so we want to know if we can classify, use this information of these functors to classify the kind of quasi-hop structures which would realize this equivalence. So, on the quantum group side, we have some. We have some functors which correspond to these restriction functors on the VOX side. And when I say they correspond, I mean some die, they make some diagram commute. And I'll bring up this diagram near the end. And so these functors on the VOI side are defined by sending some irreducible module over C to the corresponding Vermont and dual Vermont modules of the same weight. And so, to classify structures, what we want to do is we want to study the image of the regular representation of C under these functors. And there's a small problem with this. So, a quasi-Half algebra doesn't admit a co-algebra structure on its regular representation, viewed as a, say, left module. But we can easily get around this by instead. We can easily get around this by instead viewing it as a bimodule, and then as a bimodule, it does admit a co-algebra structure. Okay, and so what we want to do is then classify the co-products on the images of the regular representation under these. Under these functors. And so one problem we have here is that we don't know what the co-associator on U is. And so we want to be able to fix a choice. And so we developed this theorem. And what this theorem, it's kind of a loaded statement, but it solves this problem. So if C and D are finite tensor categories, Finite tensor categories such that there exists a quasi-fiber functor on D and a essentially a surjective quasi-tensor functor from C to D. And if A and B are the associated ends, then there exist oblax monoidal functors from rep B to rep A, such that their tensor product is a projective. Is a projective generator of REPA. By this, I mean it's projective and generates REPA with respect to tensor products, direct sums, and quotients. And the induced coproduct on the images of these regular representation sends a generator to some biomodule generator. Okay? And if these conditions hold, then B is. Hold, then B is a sub-quasialgebra of some twist of A. Okay, and so we show that these conditions hold in our example. And what this buys us is that we can take C to be a sub-quasi so yeah, sub-quasi bi algebra. And so this fixes a choice of associated. So we can Of associator. So we can take the associator on u to be the associator on c, which we know. And so this now allows us to classify co-algebra structures on the images of these regular representations. So we can, in this way, begin pinning down quasi-hof algebra structures, begin classifying structures. Begin classifying structures on the small quantum group. So this should be the small quantum group, not U. And so, as I said, we start by classifying all of the co-products on these bimodule co-algebras. And from this, we can classify the co-products on E and F of the small quantum group. And what we find is that the small quantum group emits up to equivalent. Quantum group admits up to equivalents, so up to twist equivalents, four one-parameter families of structures of a quasi-biology with one associated to each choice of beta here. But we don't want to, we're not satisfied with quasi-bioalgebra structures, we want to find a grade structure on the representation category. Representation category. So we already know that we have abelian equivalences between C in the lattice VOA and the small quantum root and the triplet. So for C in the lattice VOA, this is actually a ribbon equivalence. And these functors I mentioned before, which send simple modules over C to the corresponding Verma and dual Verma modules, well, they make this diagram here commute. This is what I mean by this. Commute. This is what I mean by the correspond to the restriction functors on the VRA side. Well, this top equivalence here is ribbon. We know that the restriction functors are braided. So if we can extend this abelian equivalence between the small quantum group and the triplet to a braided equivalence, then these functors need to be braided. So we don't want to just classify. So, we don't want to just classify the braided structures on the small porn group. We want to classify those structures which make these functors braided. Okay. And so this is what we do. We classify the R matrices on the small carnal group, which make these functors braided. And what you find is that up to twist equivalence, there is a unique structure of a quasi-triangular. Of a quasi-triangular quasi-Huff algebra such that these functions are branded. And you can show that this resulting quasi-Huff algebra is in fact twist equivalent to this modified, this quasi-Huff algebra that was conjectured by Kreutzig, Gaynutinov and Luka. And remember, this was constructed by assuming. By assuming that there's an equivalence with the unrolled quantum group and the singlet. So, this kind of provides some tacit evidence for that conjecture as well. So, as a corollary, we get that there exists a braided equivalence between the small quantum group and the triplet. So, this should be that there exists, sorry, this quasi-half modification. This quasi-huff modification of Quetzegani to Navy Local and the triple. In fact, it was shown by Gannon and Negrin that there exists a ribbon equivalence for arbitrary P. And so they use techniques very different from ours that are, I think, they use some universal properties of the temporary leave algebra. And so And so, what we would like to do is, we would like to develop some stronger techniques which would be sufficient for proving this conjecture for arbitrary P, but what we're more interested in now would be something like the singlet VOA. So, proving that, say, the unrolled quantum group has representation theory equivalent to the singlet. So, um So, what I'd like to talk about now is some kind of ideas about what to do moving forward. So, I'll stress that the lemmas I write here should not be taken as fact. You should interpret this as these are statements which should be true up to some maybe rephrasing of a statement. So, if u is factorizable and a are cumulative. Factorizable and A, a cumulative algebra object, such that the category of local modules has a trivial mega center, then we should be able to realize U as this relative center. And so what you should think about here is if U is, say, the category of modules over the triplet, then we would take A to be the last VOA viewed as a module over the triplet. And so what this is saying is that. And so, what this is saying is that if you understand well enough the twisted modules of the lattice VOA, then you should be able to reconstruct the modules of the tripler. Because REPE here is twisted modules. So, we also like to be able to understand this category, REPE. So, if you use a quasi-Huff algebra with sub-algebras. With subalgebras B and B plus, and Cartan subalgebra C. Then, if we let A star be this module that you get by inducing up from the trivial module over B to U, well, this is the image of the unit object under a complex tensor functor. So this has the structure of a co-algebra, and it's dual, A, it has a structure. And it's dual, A, it has a structure of an algebra. And so this now would be the algebra we're interested in. And so we would guess that this category should be equivalent to the category of modules to some sub-algebra B plus of U. And so what you should think here is that B is going to be something like the Borel sub-algebra of U. Borel sub-algebra of U and V plus the associated nichols algebra. And we also expect that some suitable VOA settings have a tensor functor from REPA for a choice of algebra object to the category of local modules. So this is just a kind of necessary condition for talking about the relative center. Okay. Okay. So we'd like to prove results along these lines and then maybe apply them to something like the singret, maybe something like affine GL11. And if we're really brave, maybe something like affine SL3 at level negative 3 over 2. So proving an equivalence like this for affine SL3 is probably very, very difficult, but we can maybe construct. We can maybe construct a category which we expect to be to realize this equivalence and compare some data. So, FISL3 at level negative 3 over 2, this appears as a simple current extension of here, this is the SL3 singlet at p equals 2 and h the Heisenberg gear. And so we can construct a corresponding calculator. Corresponding category by exploiting this conjectural equivalence between the singlet and the unmolded quantum groups. And so this is ongoing work I have with Thomas and David Renault. And so to construct this category, obviously we need to understand very well the category of weight modules over this unrolled corner group of SL3 at fourth root of unit. A vessel three at fourth root of unit. And so we do this, we determine the irreducible modules, we determine the structure of verma modules, we determine all irreducible, all tensor products of irreducible modules, and we determine the Lewis diagrams of projective modules. So these are kind of nice. So I'd like to end just by kind of commenting on this. So the irreducible modules. So the irreducible modules for this unrolled quantum group, they're indexed by some highest weight, and k here is going to denote the dimension of the module. And they fall into four families. And each family consists of irreducible modules of a certain dimension. And so these dimensions are one, three, four, and eight. And the irreducible modules of dimension eight are projective, so they have trivial Louvre diagrams. Louvie diagrams. But for irreducible modules of projective four, their projective covers take this form. So they consist of, here you have two vermal modules appearing in the standard filtration of this projective cover and four irreducible factors, all with dimension four. And so this isn't so interesting, but you'll see that as the dimension gets smaller, As the dimension gets smaller, the projective covers get more and more sophisticated. So, when we're looking at irreducible modules of dimension three, the projective covers now take this form, where we have three Vermal modules appearing in the standard filtration and 12 irreducible factors. And for the dimension one irreducibles, so Irreducibles, so this includes, say, the projective cover of the unit. Then you have 24 irreducible factors and six of our modules appearing in the standard filtration. And so in this picture here, you should think that the red arrows are coming from the structure of the verma modules, and the blue arrows are coming from the structure of dual vermin. From the structure of dual vermal modules. So these projected modules have filtrations in terms of vermal modules and dual modules. And then these green arrows, you have to check extension groups to fill them out. So we would expect, for example, the projective covers associated to the singlet of SO3 at p equals 2 to take this sort of form as well. Okay, so I'll end there. So I'll end there. Let's all thank Matt. Thank you, Matt, for your nice talk. Yeah, now you could please ask questions and you can also ask questions to both talks since they are connected. Zima should be here as well. I have a question. Yeah, Azad, please go ahead. Med, could you repeat this classification? This classification of quasi-bioalgebra structures on UI. So, yeah, there are four of them. There's four one-parameter families. Four one-parameter families. Up to twist. So each of these quasi-biologists you can twist. So the continuous family? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, parametrized by complex numbers. Complex members. Interesting. Yeah. So, Asad, the four families, of course, come from the four different ways you can endow the semi-simple part with the modular tensor. But then the parameters come in because you can somehow put something more general on the EF relation. And there's only one choice that makes this braided that comes from a Drundfeldt center. And the other stuff is up to twist equivalents or up to twist there's a more. Twist equivalence or up to twist isomorphism? What are different things? I mean, there are equivalents up to twist, right? But there is more general relations, twist isomorphism. Then you have defined what you mean by that. I don't know it, but I'm happy to know. So let's say it this way: I think two quasi-Hof algebras have equivalent tensor categories if and only if they are twist isomorphic. So it's algebra ISO to twisted. I see. You allow algebra ISOs and I'm not completely sure about the four families, right? Because I think if you have this automorphism on. because I think if you have this automorphism on Z4, then I think you'd switch two of the cases in the Carton part. But apart from that, they are not isomorphic, no. So it's somehow very funny that sort of you can you can make the algebras isomorphic, but then the co-algebras are not isomorphic. Or you can make the co-algebras isomorphic, but the algebras are not. So these families somehow come from the fact that these two things are slightly off. So you can force the algebra structure to be the same as you would. The algebra structure to be the same as you would think, or you can force the co-algebra structure, but you have some factor which does not allow to make both at the same time by twisting. And those just are not braided. So I think they're just. Just to be sure, you don't claim that there are four parameters, okay, four one parameter families of inequivalent tensor categories. I would think that two of them are the same if you take the automorphism on Z4, something like that. Okay, are you saying that a continuous remaining? Okay, are you saying there are continuously many non-equivalent tender categories? I would think so. I would doubt it, okay. But yes, let's talk about this. Talking about twist equivalence, right? To be sure. Yeah. But it doesn't guarantee you that. So the two objects might be not twist equivalents, but they still have equivalent tensor categories. I mean, if you have two quasi-files. I mean, if you have two quasi-cuff algebra, which are not twist-equivalent, it doesn't mean that they have non-equivalent tensor categories. Yeah, so they can be some more categories. If they are not twist isomorphic, then. Right. I don't know, but you're right. The fact that I can put everything on the co-algebra structure, so I can have isomorphic algebras, just different co-algebras, actually. Just different co-algebras actually supports what you're saying. So, so they are not very different, they are just the. I mean, I can choose generators so that they are isomorphic as algebras. So, that somehow supports what you are saying, but I'm not sure. That's a good question. But you described them explicitly, right? Or there's just a factor in the EF relation. It's not, I mean, you just can't get rid of the factor in the EF relation sort of as you wish. F-relation, sort of as you wish, just much of it, but not all of it. And somehow you get stuck with a little factor that says how much you're off. Okay, well, take a look. Thank you. Good point. So I would have some answer to Nathan and Tomoyuki, if I may. If I may, you were asking whether those are isomorphic, and I thought about this in the last couple of minutes. And I'm very sure that they are not isomorphic for the following stupid reason. When you look at the quantum cerelation or higher, then you have always braided commutators. So you have the braided commutator of E and E1 and E2, maybe. And that, of course, is the braiding, right? The factor that you put is the braiding. But now, if you go one further and you have the relation between E1 and E1, Between E1 and E12. You take the commutator between E1 and E12. Then the factor you put is the braiding between 1 and 1, 2. But this is not the same because of the quasi-structure. This is not the same as the commutator between, so not as the factor between 1 and 1 and 1 and 2, because the braiding is not multiplicative anymore. So I would very much think that at least these factors are slightly off. So this is a very minor difference, of course. Difference, of course, but if you put the braided commutators for the definition of this quantum group, then you have to put the right Q's and the Q's will be different. And this is, of course, something, again, we know from twist equivalent hop algebra. So again, they look very much the same and PBW basis is the same and so on. But I think you have to put different Q's in the commutators if you go beyond just E1 and E2. So I think this is a more. So, I think this is more like an accident in rank one that there is sort of no interesting commutators that do that. Do we have any further questions? Okay, then let's. Okay, then let's thank both Matt and Simon again for their nice talks. We will resume at 11 with Anton's talk, so we can have a long break. See you in 40 minutes.
