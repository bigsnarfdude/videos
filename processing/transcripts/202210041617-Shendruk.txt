For being here and for the organizers for inviting me. So, as in order to, well, I've decided to do something very stupid. Given the short length of the time I've decided I'd like to talk a little bit about everything rather than talk about anything coherently. So I've justified this to myself by saying that there seem to be, I've been told there's three themes to the workshop: experimental, theoretical, and numerical. So I'll do a mini talk on each. However, in addition to being silly, However, in addition to being silly to try to force this all into one talk, my experimental stuff will be mostly simulations and not spectral ordered. My theoretical stuff will be numerically solved. And my numerical stuff will not even be spectic at all. So what I'll do is I'll pause at the end of each mini talk. And if we want, we can just dive into that instead, and I'll pull the plug on the talk and it's important. Pull the plug on the top and the importance of test people. And because of that, I'll do my acknowledgements now. I sketch make this smaller. I'll do my acknowledgements now. So this is my group. Much of the work, the theoretical work on bacteria and on smectics is done by Jack Paget with some work with undergraduates and master's students helping him along. Some of the final stuff on active flows that I hope to get to and singularities in those are done by Louis Head and I and Keogh, who are the. So first mini talk, searching for smectic order in bacteria colonies. So I'm interested in the structure within bacteria colonies, and in particular, I'm interested in polymicrobial communities. So this is a polymicrobial community, a very simple polymicrobial community. It's two separate species that start. Separate species that start out in different microcolonies and begin to mix. And why do they begin to mix? Well, because this one here is staph, as in a staph infection. These are spherical, non-motile cells. They form dense colonies. If you squint and use your imagination, you might be able to convince yourself that there's a bit of hexatic order internally in these because they're packed spheres in a layer. The other The other organism is Pseudomonas. Pseudomonas is rod-like and it's very motile. It has many different motility strategies here. It's on a substrate, so it's reaching out with a P-Li and pulling itself along. And it has two different phases of motility that it's using, even on the surface. And it's clear that the bodies of these bacilliforms, the rod-like bodies, are oriented together, aligned in some way within this column of the space. In some way within this column. And you can see that here on the right are the experiments from Nikki Lomoli's group of staph in green and Pseudomonas in orange and our simulations where in green we see regions of hexatic order in the staph colony and in blue we see less order so we see a patchy, not a total order of the staph bacteria. And below we see the pseudomonas and bright yellow are regions of pneumatic Bright, yellow are regions of pneumatic alignment with pneumatic ordering, and then red less orders. No. So the question is: well, okay, so then there was a bit of work on E. coli, so this is E. coli now a different bacteria, that said, look, we can see that these things are aligned, and therefore, let's treat them as a pneumatic. And people were able to identify pneumatic dislocations in these cell, in these colonies. And what I would. And what I would, I looked at figures like this quite a bit, and maybe being too imaginative, I thought I could see smectic ordering, a layering of these bacteria quite often, and then still convinced that there is some. So we started to work towards measuring the degree of smectic ordering. So on the left are experiments of E. coli that we're working with, on the right are simulations of ages. On the right are simulations of agent-based bacteria. And despite saying that this is the experimental talk, I'm going to focus on the simulations. And the reason I'm going to do that are because the stats are better because there's just so many more of them. And so that's why my experimental part is numerical too. So what we do to measure the degree of smectic ordering is for every single bacteria, we identify that bacteria, we identify the orientation of it, and we draw a Orientation of it, and we draw a rectangular box around it, oriented in the direction of the bacteria. And then we calculate the structure factor. We calculate the structure factor of all of the bacteria that are in that rectangular box. So we get something that looks like this. Here's the bacteria itself. Here are the nearest neighbors in the layers. And here are the two different layers. And so knowing that, So, knowing that, we would often have the layer direction that we're interested in is this closer set of peaks. We would zoom in on that. Here's the experimental, numerical data, and here's our fit to it. And by doing a fit to these two peaks, two peaks because this peak and this peak are the same peak, we were able to measure the degree of spectral ordering locally and the layer normal direction, even if that's. Layer normal direction, even if that's a different direction than the orientation of the body, and get an estimate of the phase, how compressed or dilated the layers are, assuming we know the average length of bacteria. And so then we could make movies where the degree of smectic ordering is colored in dark blue, so the more blue it is, the more lamellar ordered it is. And so we get this sort of patchy regions of layered order that certainly aren't the whole colony, at least. That certainly aren't the whole colony, at least in these simulations. It seems like there's more spectraling at later times and towards the center. And that's because as the colony is growing out and there's more bacteria to push outward, there's more pressure in the core of the colony, causing them to have more order in inside of here. But this is not smectic ordered enough that we're doing things like watching the dynamics of dislocations or anything like that. However, it is something that we're set up to do now. Something that we're set up to do now. So, if you say have colloidal data and you're interested in measuring local degrees of spectral and infolloidal data, it's something that we can do sort of standard nowadays. Can I ask a small question? Yeah. With this simulation, I guess that you can simulate how it varies when you vary, for example, the size of your bacteria. And do you enhance this bacterialism for example? We haven't played with that parameter yet. Played with that parameter yet. It's a good idea, but I don't know the answer. Yeah, you would think that. Well, wait, I was going to say. I think the shorter they are, the more. Yeah, the broader the smectic phase is for 2D systems. So that's Lisa's prediction. I don't know for the problem. Yeah. Yeah, but I think we could look up, like, maybe some. I think we could look up maybe Simona Ducey's PhD thesis. He was Mariela and Dyke's student, and I think he did the phase diagram for different aspect ratios for tuning in T. Oh, sorry. Go ahead then. The shape of your particles, are they a bunch of discs glued together? No, the sh the yeah, it looks like it in this movie, doesn't it? That's only so that um they look more blothy when that we zoom out. What what they are is they're cylindric uh they're sphero cylindricals. Cylindrical, they're sphero-cylindricals. So they're a long line with spherical caps. That's right. You mentioned the increasing pressure inside the air, which I guess is also increasing density. Is there a way to confine them completely so that they can only increase in density and maybe they will get more significant water? Only increase in density, but not in pressure. I guess so th th th that was pressure I suppose, but the kind of a um in a boundary. So they cannot grow past that as I want. In a different simulation, you certainly could. In the way that we do these simulations, the only dynamics that happen here are the growth of the bacterial bodies. There is no noise at all in these other than the growth rate. The growth rate, and there is no forces other than the contact forces between bacteria. So, for these particular simulations, we couldn't do that very well. But certainly, one could build a simulation for what would do that that way. All right, good. Second mini talk. So, the second mini talk, I'd like to talk about a complex tensor model for simple smectics. And my motivation for this was because of my interest in bacteriocolity. So I specifically was interested in building some way of modeling smectics where I could deal with messy internal structure. That was my motivation. And so I wanted something that could deal with a lot of defects and a lot of dislocations. That had sort of been my worry originally. And so I thought we needed a new model for Lomellar materials. And so there's two. So there's two things that I do that are sort of my limitations on this model. The first thing is it's really the simplest imaginable spectic. It's not a smectic at all. It's not a spectic A or a smectic C. It's just a set of letters. And then the other thing is I want a macroscopic description by which I don't want in any way, shape, or form to model the layers themselves. Rather, as density waves or as density variations, Waves or as density variations or anything like that. I want to do this on a continuum or a hydrodynamic number, on a scale that is bigger, that treats the layer size as a microscopic length scale. So what do I mean by simple smectic? I think I've sort of said this. Fundamentally, I want layers without strong nematicity. So you can think of some examples, and whether you agree fully with these examples or not, that's fine. We can talk about that. So short-range attraction, long-range. That so, short-range attraction, long-range repulsion, colloids will sort themselves into layers without having pneumatic orientation. I like to think that dilacopolymers don't have a lot of pneumaticity or living bilayers. Ionic liquid crystals, I've been told, don't have a strong pneumaticity even when they go into the spectral phase. I don't know if people would agree or disagree with that. And sort of these things like Lasarian phases. So non-aspectic C, non-aspectic A. So, not aspectic C, not aspectic A, not any spectac at all, just a lamell persist. And so, yes, and so I've sort of said this, but the traditional theory which Jonathan Selvinger introduced so well yesterday is to take a density, expand it as a bunch of terms, and then say that you're just going to keep the lowest order term. And what I want to be very careful about here to you all is to say that what I'm going to do is I'm really going to take this ideal wave part and separate it out on its own. And separate it out on its own, and only keep the complex order parameter bit as the macroscopic variable as something that is slowly varying in space and time. That's sort of an assumption. And then Jonathan explained very well why this sort of model fails in the vicinity of defects. And you don't have this problem in pneumatics, or you don't have an analysis problem in pneumatics when you use the Q-tensor theory. Part of the reason for that is because it's even an N. Of the reason for that is because it's even an end, and part of the reason for that is because it regularizes singularities around the defect. So, we came up with this description for this complex tensor order parameter for Lamellar systems. So, this bit is meant to be describing the extent of layering. This bit here is meant to be describing sort of where the layers are, the phase, and derivatives of it will be depression and perfurbations. And then, capital. And then capital N is the layer normal direction of these layers. Oh, and this is an important thing. So although I write it like this, psi, phi, and n aren't explicitly simulated, E is simulated, and these things are found after the fact from decomposition held E. So we never actually simulate any of these objects whatsoever, or layers, despite the movies that I'm going to show you that have layers. Movies that I'm going to show you that have layers, those are just sort of my superposition of layers on top of the solution to try to visualize them for us. All right, so given that complex tensor order parameter, we need to build a Lambda-free energy to go along with this. So the first thing is we need a bulb-free energy. A bulb-free energy needs to be a real thing, and it also needs to be a scalar thing. So I need to combine E, contract E with itself fully in order to get a scalar, and I need to do it not with. Scalar, and I need to do it not with itself, but rather with its complex code, you get so you get something like this for the bulk for your energy. Additionally, you might have compression or dilation of the layer normal direction it might change, and so you should have first-order contractions of first-order derivatives of E, so gradients of E sort of squared should be in here. And then you should have curvature effects of the layers, and so that suggests. Of the layers. And so that suggests that you need second-order derivatives of E. So in the simplest way of writing a Laplacian of E squared. All right. So then in summary, what's our model? Our model is this complex tensor that looks a lot like Q. It's got three energies that have a bulk term, that's got even terms, a gradience of E and its complex conjugate, and then And this, in a lot of, we can make this much more complicated by having different derivatives in different directions, and you can ask me about that afterwards. But this is sort of the simplest set that I could write down. And so, comparing against the simplest thing for pneumatics, we have a similar tensorial order parameter. We have sort of a similar number of terms in the free energy. Our bulk has similar terms except for we don't have a cubic term. Don't have a cubic term, and the pneumatic only has radian terms of the cubes. They don't have the further terms. And again, we can make that more complicated too if we want. All right, so let me show you a few results from this. So if we just allow, we started out disorderly and we allow the layers to form, we see that we can make a visualization of the layers. We can see that the layer normal direction. See that the layer normal direction is ordering in time, and the degree of layering is going up in time. And we can see that any differences in phase are vanishing in time as these layers sort themselves out, and the free energy goes monotonically down. We can do things, again, remember we only simulate E, but we can do things where we vary one aspect of E at a time. So we can have like a temperature gradient going across, and if we have a temperature gradient going across, If we have a temperature gradient going across, then we can vary mod psi without varying phi or n. So that's nice. Or we can have a channel with boundary conditions that force phi to change on the walls, and then we can get a dilation of the layers locally without varying, without melting the liquid crystal or varying the direction that the layers are ordered in. Or we can put them in a circular confinement and then mod psi and phi don't change anywhere, that the layer mobile direction changes in different. The layer normal direction changes in every direction. So we can come up with geometries where we vary one aspect of our interpretation of V or not, or we can do situations that are probably more interesting, like topological defects. So here's our plus one-half disclination type defect and minus one-half disclination type defect. So again, we've drawn the layers on top of this ourselves. The degree of ordering of the layers melts at the defect core, but the phase. But the phase doesn't change around these two types of defects. On the other hand, if we look at a dislocation-type defect, it also does melt at the defect core, but the phase. And the free energy distort, the variation in free energy is localized in the defect core. Jonathan showed as one of his examples, his clear examples of why the previous theories didn't work, where you get. The previous theories didn't work, where you get a line tension between defects. So we took a couple of defects and put them in here, and we find no discontinuities in the fields across n. We don't really see a free energy distortion across connecting point tension of some kind. Additionally, we can do things like try to force a plus one defect at the center of this, and so we can do that if we have the elasticity of the gradient turns turned on. Of the gradient turn is turned on, then the defense will sort of push away, but they won't repel each other to infinity. They'll sort of be locked by the layers crossing together, connected together close to the core or the center. Challenged by one of our referees, we can do things like make pseudo-onion phases. So, onion phases happen when you shear these things. And we don't have any flows, but yet referees like to see what referees like to see. So, we built this in by So we built this in by hand by having an intrinsic curvature, which we put on the second-order derivatives of it. And then that intrinsic curvature to sort of choose a length scale over which you have curvature and sort of get sort of these stable onion phases, although, like I say, they're not real onion phases like we would have in shared smack mix. Do I want to talk about this? I guess I just want to say we can put I guess I just want to say we can put colloids and things in here and have different types of defects. We can see the splitting of disclination type defects into domain walls and quarter charge ends, which I think, Rene, you're going to talk about a lot in the next talk, so I won't talk about that. So this is Rene's work. And then if we start the simulation from isotropically disordered but wanting to be in the ordered state, it'll quench. Let's try to order. Let's try to order the defects. Well, some of them will be able to annihilate, but not all of them. It'll get into a kinetically arrested state where not all of the defects can have pathology free energy mindscape to an island. Good. So that's the end of my mini talk. Two. This is just a recap of it. So I'll pause for questions because I suspect this might be the space where people have the most criticisms. Criticisms, or how you put in the waves, the density variation, if you factored out Q, didn't you have to change the direction of Q? Or you got the direction of Q from N. Sorry, can you use this Q? Which Q? You had EDIQ0.r. Yeah, but in fact, Q0 knows about N. That's right. So when I draw these layers in here, you know which way to analyze it. Yeah, that's right. Know which way I am. Yeah, that's right. And I choose a value of Q, which isn't in this model whatsoever, other than when I draw these pictures. Which might point to limitations. Like, so if I put these materials between two plates and I vary the separation of the plates by a little bit, am I going to get an undulation? No, probably not, because I don't have uh a wavelength and smectic layers. So that might be a major shortcoming of something like this. Major shortcoming of something like this. Yeah. And concerning the core, i i is it uh a calculated core? Yes. So so this is what is the result and what do you obtain that the all the parameter values and so on? Yeah, we just anchor the layer normal direction on the on the not this circle but a circle a little bit further out. Bit further out. And that's all we do kind of ends up these form. So if we make a circle too big, we'll get defects that sort of are kinetically arrested instead of just the one nice one. That's all. And is it nematic for you in the middle of the core? Is it which? Nematic? Well, it melts. Yeah, and at the defect core, the degree of glaring order melts. Order maps. Okay. If you want to say, order. It becomes disorder. It's not pneumatic, but the orientation becomes ill-defined, but that's okay because it's regularized by the fact that the magnitude goes to zero. So whether it's ill-defined or not, we don't care numerically. Okay. You turn a little bit more to the microphone. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're physicists who have better things to do. So we do. So we do that terrible, terrible final difference and these things. That's right. What we're hoping to, like, if I'm interested in the kinetics of this, currently all the kinetics that I showed you are just overdamped dynamics. What we really want is some sort of smecular hydrodynamic models. So we really want these things. We don't really want to be spending our computational effort on minimizing these things. Good. How am I going to get your time? Reasonable. Oh, that's, yeah, it's kind of reasonable. All right. I'm going to dive in here and I'll let the plug people on me any time. So I'd like to talk about something we've been doing very recently. This is very rough, and I'm very happy for you to say, for people to shake their heads. For you to say, for people to shake their heads in horror. But we've been interested in singularities in three-dimensional active flows. So we haven't talked about active flows yet in this workshop because it's a conference on symectics. But let me just mention what an active material is. An active material is some material that has inside of itself its own fuel source and also the machinery to convert that fuel into motion at a microscopic level, which means that you can get fluxes. Which means that you can get fluxes that will result in coherent large-scale motion. So, for instance, this is one, this is extract from a cytoplasm that is spontaneously flowing because there's ATP in there and motor proteins that can convert that ATP into mechanical work at a microscopic scale, which results in this flow. Now, this is messy. Don't ask me what these are, what bits of cell this is. So, what people do is they pure. People do is they purify it and they just take the important things. So they take microtubules, which are the cytoskeleton material, and they have motor proteins that like to walk up and down these microtubules, but they're attached to two of them simultaneously. So as they walk, they push and pull simultaneously, pushing them out, making a force dipole everywhere in space. And that causes flows where if you take this material and just confine it between two layers, an oil layer, It between two layers, an oil layer and a water layer, so that you just get a two-dimensional film, you get beautiful spontaneous flows like this. And it's obvious to liquid crystal people that there are defects in here, and these defects play an extremely important role in the dynamics of these active flows. So I think the clearest way to see how the defects and the flows are connected are by considering our simulations of defining an act. Of finane an active pneumatic between two plates. And if you do that and the plates are very far apart, then you'll get that active turbulence that we just saw. If the plates are very close together, then no slight drag on the walls is going to sort of overcome any spontaneous flow. And that's what we see. We see sort of active turbulence and nothing at all, except there's a sweet spot in between where everything's just right, and you get a vortex lattice. And so it's sort of one way. And so, sort of, one way of understanding this vortex lattice is to draw the defects over top. And what you see are that there's minus one-half topological disclination defects at the walls and plus one-half defects spontaneously moving through the field, generating this forticity. Because if you integrate the stresses around the defects in active materials, you get plus one-half defects spontaneously moving, but also generating vorticity on their weights. Vorticity on their wings. So this vorticity superimposes and they move and they generate this vortex as in 2D. In 3D, things are a mess. So I tried studying 3D once a long time ago, and it was instead of getting these nice clean point defects, you get these disclination lines, and everything is changing because they're spontaneously moving, and rings are appearing, loops are appearing, and annihilating. And I couldn't do anything sensible. And I couldn't do anything sensible about it. People in the audience have done much better work on it. And what they were able to do, in particular, was look at the structure of the disclination lines. And I was very jealous about that and really struggled to try to reproduce the types of structural analysis of the disclination lines that they did in this paper. So we did simpler things. So instead of looking at bulk active turbulence, we again put it in a channel. We again put it in a channel, now a square duct. And we could get the vortex lattice again in 3D. That was beautiful. We could also get funny things like a double helix of flow, where you have one stream going one way and one stream going the other way. And then things like this, which we call a grinder train, where you have a drift of the fluid in one direction, but also a bit of a traveling vortex one way, and then the opposite way, the one way, the opposite vortex. One way of opposite way. And these were much simpler states, but still I struggled to understand the disclination lines until there was this nice paper that came out this year where they defined a tensor that looks like this, taking derivatives of Q, and then interpreted this tensor as a scalar object that they could take the contours of, and an outer product between the tangent direction of. The tangent direction of the disclination and the layer normal direction or the surface normal direction of the plane in which the director lay. And then from that, you could get whether or not the disclination was wedge-like locally or twist-like locally. And this was much simpler for us. So starting in 2D, if we did a 2D active turbulent flow, we could track the defect location. Could track the defect locations using this in 2D. So, okay, it's a bit of an overkill because we're using some weird tensor in order to track defect singularities in 2D5, whatever. But in 3D, we could also look at the dance of the defects, the disclination lines in the vortex lattice, and we could quantify how they were plus one-half charge-like in the center along the disclination line, minus one-half charge-like. Minus one-half charge-like at the walls, and then sort of more twist-like closer to the walls for the plus one-half defects of disclination-wise that are moving through the system. We could do it for the other two, and we found that there were no defects. Disclination wise in those, all right, fine. And we could do it for turbulence, and now we could sort of make the same pretty pictures that Dan made with much more effort than we did. Now, what interests me in the last second that I have is the fact that defects in two Is the fact that defects in 2D produce vortices. And the vorticity of active turbulence is super important in characterizing it as different than inertial turbulence. And somehow there's an intimate connection between the vorticity and the topological defects in 2D. So I wanted to ask: do the disclination lines in 3D have vortex tubes associated with them? But vortex tubes, it turns out, But vortex tubes, it turns out, are a mess. How you define a vortex tube is a matter of opinion, which I was surprised about because they seem like a very obvious thing. But you can do these as regions of large vorticity, complex value, regions of complex eigenvalues of the velocity, gradient of the gradient and the velocity, or you can use things like the Q criterion, which is just differences in made between vorticity and strain rate. We did something different. We very naively We very naively just made the velocity field a unit vector, and then we applied the disclination d tensor that we used on pneumatics to the velocity field. And we looked for local regions of topological discontinuity in the flow field. And this thing will not be conserved. It won't necessarily be loops, and it won't necessarily span the whole. Loops, and it won't necessarily span the whole system, but it will tell us regions where we have a singularity in the flow field and the direction in which we have that flow singularity. And we'll know whether it's like a pure vortex in some direction or a pure strain rate in some direction, or we'll know if it's twist-like, if the velocity field is escaping out of that plane. And so, when we did that, we could get the We could get the centers of the vortices in the flow field. So here's the displanations we were looking at in 2D again, and here's the vortices now, the centers of the vortices. In 3D, here's the displanations that we were looking at for the vortex lattice, and here's the center of the vortices. What we were surprised to find is that in addition to the center of the vortices, centered right near the minus one-half disclination type defects that ran along. Disclination type defects that ran along the wall, there were these regions of pure strain rate. So, where the flow is pure strain, there is high strain in these regions. And these are vortex tubes that span the whole system. Now, when we went to the grinder train that, remember, didn't have any topological disclination lines in it, we found that there was a twist-like loop along each of these regions. Each of these regions, and that that would generate a twisting flow along these tubes. When we looked at the double helix, we found point singularities sort of speckled along the wall. It's hard to see here, but these yellow ones are pure vortex rotation points, and these blue ones or purple ones are pure strain rate type ones. And so here's just a Once and so here's just a different direction to sort of show that these are falling on sort of a helix along the wall, and these singularities in some sense are driving the double helix at flow rates. All right. Oh, and the turbulence, though, is still a mess. So what I'm hoping is that we can then correlate regions of wedge-like plus one-half type disclination regions with vortex tubes. But we haven't gotten ahead of it. You'll see a spaghetti mess in. Because I still see a spaghetti mess in both of them, but we're trying to slowly obtain. Any mess interload, or right? I can't even tell you yet. I think that's exactly the right question to ask. And I don't know the answer to that. It doesn't seem like to my eye. It doesn't seem like to my mind. And that's the end. So I've blown through three mini talks: one on bacteria in microcolonies. One on bacteria in microcolonies and how they're not really smectic ordered, but have a little bit of smectic order. This complex tensor approach to simple smectics, and these flow singularities and active turbulence that I thought maybe people would have slotted out to just tell me what they think. Thank you very much. We have a few minutes if there's any more questions. Yeah. For the second part. But if I understand correctly, this may also correspond to the structure of a semantic phase without pneumatic phase. So for example, a 12 CB or 10 CB which have no pneumatic phase. So and my qua, so already this is interesting, and my question is very complicated to compare. Compare, my opinion would be very interesting to compare the structure of the defect in this case with respect to the one where you have a nematic phase. But is it possible for you to put a little bit of nematic, but I guess a little bit of pneumatic, yeah. So, a little bit of pneumatic is sort of my thought on this is that what we need to do in What we need to do in order to do real pneumatics, as pardon me, in order to do real smectics, is to do both, is to have a free energy that does the full Q tensor style pneumatic free energy, plus the smectic that we've been looking at, plus coupling. So I think that's the way for us to do it. And what would that coupling look like? Well, the simplest things that I could think of for the coupling is we should have some contraction of E's and Q's that. Some contraction of E's and Q's that basically say for normal smectic, say A's, that you should favor getting to the smectic only after you've gone through them, once you have pneumatic ordering. So I guess this term would be small for 10 CB and 12 CB based on what you're saying. And then you should also have things, an alignment term where you want these two directions to co-align to sort of favor a smectic A. And then if you want something to be a smectic C, And then if you want something to be aspectic C, you want something to drive to project the gradients of the media onto Q so that you have sort of a color to Q between this term. And I think that'll go from aspectic A to aspectic C. But I haven't actually implemented it yet, so that's hearsay. Yeah. A question and a comment, but first the question. The different active The different uh active states you got in this channel, was that just from changing aspect ratios? No. That was changing a lot of different things. Um which I'm okay, so the the we're here somewhere so this state, so these are the three states, this state tends to This state tends to be everything at a reasonable moderation. So it's really the confinement that does it, and then you do some sensible anchoring that isn't too strong. If you do really strong anchoring such that the anchoring, the length scale associated with the anchoring, spans the whole system, then it doesn't want those defects that form at the walls. And so it does this state where it can still have the characteristic light state. Have the characteristic length scale of the flows emerging as this vortex size, but it can turn them out of plane and it can have the same sort of flow scales without having pneumatic distortions near the walls, which are so expensive because of the anchoring conditions. And then this state is a bit funny. This state occurs if we run the simulation below the thermodynamic isotropic pneumatic phase transition and only allow it to go into the nematic. and only allow it to go into the pneumatic phase due to the uh due to the uh the flows. So the flows will cause an alignment of the director with the flows and that's what generates this with weak anchor models. But that's that's a reasonable description of attribute. It is. Yeah. And another comment is: so the assuming Vignal D tensor, if you If you need omega itself, the end result is absolute brilliance. If you just want to know what color to make the disclination line, I think the eigenvalue you get out of that is the opposite of the saddle split, which there's a paper that Lisa's first author on that I had a very minor role in, where we realize that the opposite of the saddle split tells you whether you have a plus, a minus, or its disclination. So it all So it all amounts to the same thing. Okay, that's really good to know. That is good to know. We also find that our disclination lines are smoother. And I don't understand why, because we're taking derivatives of Q to solve this. Well, our contour surfaces are nicer, prettier. I don't know why. Um, I don't know why, but I also know people used the 2D version of this before the tensor was uh done in the bacteria, in these very noisy systems. So something about, I guess, taking the derivatives around the thing is smoothing things out. So there's also a smoothing side benefit. But yeah, maybe I'll get you to talk me through the saddle screen. That's once in the moment. I just want to make a comment. Carl Motes, you know, he recently developed an algorithm to measure the mutual entanglement of two. Oh, interesting. So you might ping him and see if he can help you. So then you can, then, at least with the turbulence data, you can. The turbulence data, you can at least answer the question. That's awesome. And it also gives me an excuse to message correct. Good. Reconnections, right? Well, that's right. Yeah, so like, yeah, the network's going to be continually Any other questions?
