This is a project that's that some of it is out there on preprints already, some of it is like still work in progress. I want to talk about part one, which is already at the part out there. This was joint work with a few wonderful women. It was a part of like a women in topology project. And the people involved were Rene Hexeva, Mona Merling, Laura Moray, myself, and Julia Smithina. And then, well, you know, like we got excited about it and then continue, don't worry. Excited about it and then continued on working on different ideas. So, part two is going to be given by Julia, and that's the ongoing work with Mona and George Naptis. Okay, so before I even start on the more technical part, like talking about manifolds, I want to start just by a warm-up of the notion of cation-based on polygons. Now, it has importance because. It is important because the notion of cutting and pasting, of course, it came later in manifolds, but originally the very original idea, even going back to the Greeks, was work on polygons. So here we have a cut and face operation. What is it? So you start with some polygon, then you decide on cutting it into little pieces, some polygons, and then what you do up here at the end is you move your pieces around and you Move your pieces around and you glue them back like this. Now, what you see here is like there are some rules on how you're going to be doing the gluing. You're not going to be putting, for example, that square on top of another piece. They're all glued along their common boundaries. So that's how you do the gluing. Now, a little bit more formally, when you have yesterday definition of what would be the notion of cutting and pasting of polygons, so you're going to have like two polygons, P and Q, and those are going to be subdivided. And those are going to be subdivided into pieces. They're going to be considered as the union of like little pieces P1 and Q1. And you say that there's a cis-as congruence if all of those sub-pieces coincide. If you look at the picture here, well, you know, you decided to cut this up into pieces, and now those pieces kind of like match your other polygon P. So that's how you go from P to Q. Now, of course, one interesting question that one can ask here is: what are One can ask here is what are invariants. In this particular case, two-dimensional situation, polygons, the only invariant is the area. And what does that tell you? Well, that tells you that if you have two polygons of the same area, you know of the same area, you know that there's going to be some way of cutting up that polygon into little pieces, rearranging, and getting the other polygon. Those are going to have the same area. Now, moving a little forward in history, this In history, this problem gets a little bit more complicated as you go higher up in dimensions. And we're still in the world of polygons and polyhedra. Hilbert's third problem asks the same thing we've seen in the first slide. He asks about what would happen if you think about that question in three dimensions. Is now volume the only gut and based invariant? So suppose that you have two polyhedra of the same volume, are they gutted-based equivalent? And the answer is Are they data-based equivalent? And the answer is no. So that was actually Dan's problem, thesis problem. And within a year or so, Dan managed to prove that the outside snow, for example, you would have like Denmy variant zero and other polyhedrons don't maybe don't have, like, for example, that tetrahedron there has then invariant one. So it means that, no, that you cannot class, even if that cube and that tetrahedron have. Even if that cube and that tetrahedron have the same volume, you would not be able to cut them into little pieces and rearrange one into the other. Okay, so that was the beginning of the 20th century. Moving even forward in history, with the cycler, the word of Seila, so the volume and dead invariant determining cisas congruence. So volume. You know, volume and that invariant that Denny managed to prove that those are actually the only CSAS congruence in, it's the only thing you need to know in order to prove C-SARS congruence in three dimensions. Going up in dimension and going forward in history, four-dimensional volume and then invariant are also like generalized portions of those are only invariants in four dimension. But if you're going higher in dimension, like dimensional five, Higher end dimension, like dimension five, then there's like open problems there, and it gets like really complicated. And that really complicated thing, well, then maybe you want to have machinery to work on these problems. So we talk about machinery a little later. Now, since we're going to be talking on manifolds, I want to introduce for you what is the classical notion of CISA's congruence or cutting and pasting on manifolds. And already that picture that you have there on the right-hand side, Picture that you have there on the right-hand side already says it all, but let me tell you to do it. So you're going to start with a closed n-dimensional manifold. And the first thing you need to find is a kerodimensional one manifold that's a small sub-manifold and that has trivial normal bundle. So why would you want that there? So if you have like, you know, here that's like very shady, very faintly, we already see the current one manifold. And we really want to have like this. Manifold, and we really want to have like this trivial normal bundle there. Why is that? Well, because when you do the cutting, you want your boundaries here to have these little colors as they should. You know, we are all working in the world of smooth manifolds. We want them later to be able to paste smoothly, and you're going to need the information from the colors to do that. Okay, so we've done the cutting, we've done the cutting, and now we're going to do the pasting. We're going to use some We have introduced some orientation preserving diffeomorphism of the boundaries to do that. And once you do the gluing, of course, if you glue the identity, maybe you go what you started with, but you could use any dithomorphism of those boundaries and you would get a new manifold. So what do you have? You have the thing you started with, manifold M, and the new resulting manifold, which is constructed from those pieces. Which is constructed from those pieces and the gluing, is those two things are cut and paste equivalents. They're not the same method, they're cut and paste equivalent. So, you know, like formalizing this idea, this old work of like Karas, Craig, Naiman and Ossa, they defined what's called the SK groups. SK is like when you talk about CISAS congruence, you're talking about the same thing. SK just really stuck because SK just really stuck because these authors did a lot of work in formalizing this notion. It's just like Schneider and Und Kleben, so it's literally just like the same as Cisnos Congress, cutting and paste groups. Right, so let's define that group. What do we start with? So we're going to start with the monoid of bifeomorphism classes of small, close, oriented manifolds and with the operational disjoint union. And now the group itself, you're going to And now, the group itself, you're going to take the grotto group of that monoid, and you're going to quotient by a relation. Your relation in this case, the relation you're quotiented by, is the cut and paste relation. Notice here, what are we seeing here? So we're seeing two manifolds which are made out of the same pieces, M1 and M2. The little part is orientation because we're talking about oriented manifolds. And the gluing is a different map here. So somehow, well, you know, like when you're Well, you know, like when you're doing cutting and pasting, essentially, you could use any different morphism you want to do the gluing, you're between the same pieces, that's okay because they were to fall in the same class in your cut and paste group. Right, so, all right, and again, like the V and the Psi that I have here, those are orientation preserving maps obviously of the boundaries and of the of the whole boundary, so those two glue along the whole boundary so that you get a close final in the end. You get a close particle in the end. So, this is the classical Gutenberg notion of Gutenberg's group. Now, before we jump into more things, let me show you an example. So, here we have just an ordinary tutorial and we're going to do a cut and paste operation on it. So, we start by cutting, so suppose I cut it into like four little pieces, and just like I did with the polygon before, I can rearrange my pieces and then take. Into my pieces and then paste them back. So, what's the result here? The result here is that the torus that I started with is in the same cut and paste class as these two copies of the same thing, two copies of the torus. So, one torous, same class as two toros. Well, okay, the only thing something can be equal to twice itself is if it's zero. So, it adds that um a two toros is actually zero in the two dimensional Catan based group. Two-dimensional catalyst group. And there's nothing special about two-dimensions here. In general, you can think of like a mapping torus. Mapping Taurus, the class of a mapping torus is actually a mapping torso for like say any dimension you want is going to be zero in whatever dimension that is. And why is that? Well, you could actually reinterpret this picture. You could actually reinterpret this picture a little bit. Suppose that, for example, one of these, like the what you know, like a maping torus, what is again a map inros? So, amazing doorus, you're going to start with some manifold called F, F, and you're going to do like that manifold cross an interval. So, this thing now is F cross I. And then in order to so this is another copy of F. And in order to create your map in Taurus, you're going to have like a glowing map right here, call it, say, H. Here, call it say H. Well, okay, so that's essentially like that's what a mapping torus is. Now, how do we see that that fits into the same example here? Well, remember that if we are talking about cut and paste, I could have exchanged that age over there by the identity, for example. And then I could exactly play the same game I played here. Now, all of these little white thingies would be F, and you get. Would be F, and you can get from your Mapping Doros to two copies of your Mapping Dora. So that's a very important feature of cut and paste: is that those mapping torrent actually zero in the cut and paste group. And that is very important because that actually differentiates in a very dramatic way cat and paste in groups and coordin groups. Covalism groups, you know, there's so many examples of mapping tori that represents non-trivial classes into co-ordination. Represents non-trivial classes into coordinism, whereas in SK, the Pindora are going to be zero. You care about the orientation, it all works. I mean, maybe I'm not being super, super careful right here in this picture right now, but it all works out. Yes, that will be yeah, yes. Uh yes. I will be just not just uh okay, so again, like uh remember that when we were talking about the polygon quality of case, the interesting the understanding the invariants was very important. The catalyst group, there are two essential invariants, the Euler characteristic and the signature. And you know, already in early work, this was shown that these are the two, for this specific cat and base group, these are the early invariants. These are the EU invariants or linear combinations of those. The Euler characteristic is essentially like a direct topology exercise, and the signature is not because of additivity, is what tells you that you do have like, you know, it doesn't matter how you're gluing here, you're just going to have the signatures of the pieces. Right, so now again, as I said, the problem becomes more complicated in thinking about especially like Just thinking about especially like algebraic varieties or polytopes. And Sakarevich and also Jonas and Canto did a lot of work trying to get a better grasp of good machinery that could handle these very complicated problems. So they had a notion of cesars congruence for polytopes as K-theory spectrum. And well, in our first project, in our first approach to this problem, it was like, well, you know, does this machine? Problem was like, well, you know, does this machinery that they have for polytopes also work for the notion of cutting and pasting of manifolds? And well, you know, even if you just initially look at it, you already see like just right from the start that there are some differences that make that machine learning a little difficult to apply. To start with, if you're going to try to create a category where, for example, the objects would be like polytopes, well, now you Well, now you cut your cutter polytope, you see that the pieces are stink polytopes. So the nature of objects after cutting is the same as the nature of the thing you started with. Now one problem, one important difference with manifolds, is if you start with, if you say you have a closed manifold and you cut it, now the pieces that you have are no longer closed manifolds. They are manifolds with boundaries. Manifolds. There are manifolds with boundary. And of course, there is a very essential difference between one problem for polytopes and the problem for manifolds. So we were trying to create some notion of K-theory spectrum for cutting and pasting for manifolds. And already from the start, we saw that we were going to have to deal with manifolds with boundary in order to deal with this issue of. With this issue of, you know, you get your pieces with manifolds with boundaries. So, our first variation of the classical theory comes on this slide. We redefine the cat and base group to be SK with boundary. And this slide would look suspiciously similar. The only difference is like, you know, your monoid now is like the few of these classes of things that boundary. And now you're taking the group to the group of that. Now, the relation, how about the relation? Now you're going to have boundary. Now you're going to have boundaries here that are going to be the gluing boundaries and they're going to have boundaries that you're not going to touch. What is the key idea here? So the key idea is that we start cutting a manifold with boundary and the existing boundaries you just do not touch those. You do all the cutting process and all the gluing process inside of the manifold. You do not touch the boundaries. So you see like the original boundaries here. Original boundaries here, this boundary, this boundary, and this boundary, those just like stay the same in the result. And well with this, now you could ask yourself how does the classical group relate to the new group of manifolds in boundary? It fits into a short exact sequence. Here you just have an inclusion, and over here, you have a growth and degroup of a monoid of manifolds that bound because from That's bound because from here you're going to have classes of manifolds with boundary. And what this map does is kind of like you're only looking at the boundary. So that fits into a short exec sequence. Right, so now continuing on, now we get into the machinery to construct our K-theory spectrum of misotheque boundary. And this machinery here, well, categories with squares. This was something that at the time we were working, Campbell and Sekarevich had already thought about this, and they were very generous to share it with us. So this is like really very good categorical machinery to deal with the problem. And just a couple of weeks ago, the paper finally appeared with collaborators involved with Mona and some other collaborators. So that's very exciting it's out there. It's out there. So let me talk you through the work that I did on those categories, and then I'll also show you how we use this machinery to understand the problem for manifolds. Sorry, another question. Yes. Do the manifolds have to be connected? Not necessarily, no. So, but when you do this operation, cut and paste, do you always have to cut and paste? Or can you just cut? Okay, so now you're supposed to cut and paste. Okay, so now you're supposed to cut and paste. So, yeah, yeah. So, I mean, if you just cut, let's see. Yeah, this wouldn't make sense because if you just cut, so one of the, remember that one of the rules, one of the rules we established here is like, you know, your boundaries are going to be the same boundaries. If you just cut, then I'm just kind of kind of again breaking that rule. So you really need to like, you know, cut and paste operation is a whole package. You do the cutting and then you do the pasting. I don't think of the fixed. But if there's a pair of patches for that, ESPK will be able to suggest such an option. Right. And in case of polyturpes, do they also have to paste everything together or I'm not sure if they use this machinery already for polyturpes? Maybe it's even not true that it has two half-degree components, but it is equivalent. Two connected components but it is equivalent to the sum of two polytopes. You're talking about polytopes? No, manifolds. Manifolds, okay. Manifolds which you just component. Yes. So is it? I'm not sure it is equivalent to the sum of two. It's operation of sum. Yeah, but it's addition. Okay, so you include this additional equivalent. Right, okay, so let's let's go like and like step back for a bit and let's understand this. Step back for a bit and let's understand this categorical machinery that Jonathan and Ina. So, what is a category with squares? So, a category with squares, well, it has a base point, you're going to have two types of morphisms, the cofibrations and the cofibrant maps. And very, very important feature of the category is that you have something called distinguished squares. Now, this is part of the data of the category and kind of like you get to decide what is going to be a distinguished square in your category. Square in your category. So that's important because it gives you a lot of control on what the distinguished squares are. Now, what are the conditions here? So a bunch. Your categories have co-products and distinguished squares are closed and co-products. You can also stack them. So you can compose squares horizontally, compose them vertically. Both the curve vibrations and the curl fiber maps include all of the isomorphisms in the category and In the category, and if you have, say, one vertical arrow, then you are able to create a distinguished square by saying, like, extending the identity. Or if you have a horizontal arrow, you have the option of creating a distinguished square by extending the identity vertically. So those are properties of categories with squares. Very interestingly, these categories with squares have a connection to Waldhausen categories. If you have a Waldhausen category, you would be Have a Valhausen category, you would be able to create a category with squares by saying that the horizontal maps are going to be the curve vibrations in the Belhassen category. Now, in your category with squares, the vertical maps are going to be all maps, not just the curve fibre maps. And the these weaker squares actually have the property that well if you look at the at the push out here, what's the relationship between the push out and the D, you have a weak equivalence. You have a weak equivalence. Now, so now you also have this squares k-theory. You can look at your squares category and you can look at this inclusion space. You can take the geometric realization, take base loops, and that's how you define your and you define an infinite loop space, which is this squareski theory over the category of squares. Over the category of squares. Now, that infinite loop space one can show that it's actually a spectrum, and furthermore, you can show that there is an equivalence of k-theory spectra from your Balhausen K-theory, which is being a Balhausen category, to your squares K-theory, which is being your squares category. And this is a very interesting construction, it's not direct, it's actually like a sig sac of equivalences which we actually spread out given in the paper. Spread out gift name the paper. Yeah, so in this case, this is more like Thomason's version. Exactly, so the sex is exactly right. Like Thomason is like in the middle, and there's an equivalence over there, and there's an equivalence over there. Right, so now what about taking pi naught of this spectrum? So what do you get? So pi naught of that spectrum is k0 of the squares category, and the way to define that is you would have like a free group on your objects of the category. Free group on your objects of the category, quotiented by a relation, your breakthrough is going to be zero, and then the relation like the slide has a little bit like short exact sequences, you know, you have some relation there, but here we have like a relation for the squares. So A plus C, okay, that's what A plus C is equal to B plus C. So you have this relation there. So that's what you get for your So that's what you get for your game is. And now that was, as I said, machinery that Ina and Jonathan had worked out even before we even started thinking about this. And now they shared this with us, and it was very, very useful because the situation with manifolds really adapts very well to that machinery. So now here I'm going to show you a squares, K theorea squares. Squares gave the squares how does, you know, manifold with boundary squares category. What is that? So we're going to have a category where the objects are going to be smooth, n-dimensional manifolds. Morphisms, well morphisms is important to very delicate how the morphisms are. So we're going to have this K-dimension zero embeddings, n and m here at the same dimension. And the rule for that is that in order to In order to something that works, you're going to have like your manifold N is going to have some boundaries, and the boundaries are going to go to either existing boundaries on N or to the interiors. If you see here, these two legs of the pens go to those boundaries and this goes to the interior. So you either go to all two existing boundaries or you go to the interior of the magnet. And with that type of embedding, now all of our arrows in our Our arrows in our squares are going to be embeddings like this. Here is a square, this is an example of how it would work. Embedding, embedding, embedding. And what you get out of that is a push-out, and this is a manifold number. So that's the definition of the category with squares for manifolds. Alright, so now just to give you a little bit of like a flavor of what such a k-naught would be. Such a K-naught would be. It's actually isomorphic to the catal-based group of manifolds with boundary that I introduced before. Now, the whole proof is a little longer than just this slide, but this will give you an idea of morally why it should work. So here we have two diagrams. They are both squares, you know, distinguished squares in our category of manifolds. And we could do this as a game of spot the difference because they don't look really, really simple. The difference because they don't like really, really similar. So, what do we see? So, we see so we do see A is the same as A on the other side, B is the same as B on the other side, C is the same as C on the other side, but the D's are different. So, what changed? So, the only thing that changed when you give this up. The only thing that changed is that you see here the blue and the yellow go to blue and yellow, and over here this are different maps actually swapping. is a different map actually swapping the two colours of this. Let's say that this is pi and it's a side. So now once you do the pushout, you have the colours that are telling you the information of how you're gluing. You do this pushout here, now you get this new manifold, this is D. And if you're using a different gluing information via this swapping map, now you're getting a D prime. But of course this But of course, we had our definition of k0, and we had this definition that a plus d is equal to c plus b. So a plus d equal to b plus c, that means that t is b plus c minus a. And on the other side, well, now a plus d prime is b plus c, so d prime is going to be the same thing. So this means that d and d prime are in the same class in this group. And we can also In this group. And we can also see that clearly see that D and D prime cut and paste equivalent manifolds. So, as I said, it's not a full proof, but it gives you more of the idea of why those two things should be isomorphic. And just to finish this off, one thing that we also looked at is that there actually exists a map of K-theory spectra from this interesting squares, K-theory of manifolds. Theory of manifolds to KC. And very interestingly, if you look at a damp map of spectra on pi naught, like phi naught on this, then what you're getting here, we saw just on the previous slide, that this is the SK group of manifolds with boundary, and then on the other side you have a copy of just integers, and this class here. And this part here is the Euler characteristic. So, you know, that map on spectra, if you look at it on pi north, that actually agrees with the Euler characteristic of this small compact kind of fills with boundary. Now, that's kind of like the end of what I went to say, but from that point, we've been working on different ideas. You could also ask, well, there was another invariant, there was the signature. This is work that. Signature. This is work that Julia and Ruben Huxuma and myself are trying to do. But today we're going to hear more from Julia and the project with Mona and George Captain. So I'm going to let Julia take the place.
