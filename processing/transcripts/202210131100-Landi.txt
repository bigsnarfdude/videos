Thank you. And thank you for the invitation, of course. Well, I just want to say that this work is based on the seminar is based on a joint work with Domenico Firenza. And it's a really neat idea, in my opinion. The basic fact that I want to recall is that we know that Is that we know that by definition, the first homotopic groups of the string group for large enough k are trivial. So Pn of string is trivial for n less than or equal to six. And it is pretty easy to see that this implies that for n less than or equal to six, then the n nth Bordism string group and the n and the n frame Border group are isomorphic. Bordism group are isomorphic. Now we know that we have Pointry Agen's isomorphism, and so this means that the frame borders is isomorphic to the stable homotopic groups of sphere. And composing this, we get that the third string border group is isomorphic to Z Ma 24. Now, a thing that would be nice to obtain, but is clearly impossible. That is clearly impossible is to obtain this isomorphism φ from the third border group, which I will just say board string 3 from now on to 024 as some characteristic number. So to have a way of obtaining some canonical differential three-form on a string three manifold such that the image of this isomorphism was the integral of this form. And as I was saying, this is impossible because. And as I was saying, this is impossible because, well, we do not have an injective morphism from ZMO24 to R. So, that was a typo. Takes values in ZMO24. There is a slash to it to me. But we could try to fix this by considering a string per manifold M and giving this manifold some additional structure, which we can't call U, such that for any. Such that for any manifold, we have at least one example of such a structure, and such that we could associate to this pair mu, a three form, such that the integral is an integer number, and such that if we have a different structure, which we can call u prime, then the difference of the two integrals is a multiple of 24. So, this means that given any such structure, well, the integral would be well. Well, the integral would be well-defined, mod 24, and so we would get something really, really close to what we would like to get. Now, this isn't really what happens, but we are pretty close. The correct version of this was found by Redden and by Bunke and Naumann. And their data mu is a triple eta, w, and nabla, where eta is a geometric string structure of the A geometric string structure of the manifold M, and we will see what this means in the sense of Waldo, but that's the only definition I think that there is of geometric string structure. W is a spin-four manifold whose boundary is the manifold M and this will always exist because the manifold M is string, and being string means it is also spin. And the third spin Bordism group is trivial. So any three. So, any three-spin manifold is a boundary of a four-spin manifold. So, and then we want NABLA to be a spin connection on the bigger manifold W such that when we restrict this connection to the manifold M, we obtain the spin connection datum of the geometric string structure. And when I say that this is close to what we want, it's just because we have some additional. We have some additional datum of another manifold, but we are really close because out of this data here, they compute this function psi of m, eta, w, and nabla, which is this integral difference here of, well, one over two of the integral of the Chernweil four-form representative, well, for the first Pentrigan class, which one can evaluate on the connection. Which one can evaluate on the connection minus the integral of some canonical form that we can associate on the geometric string structure. And the first integral is evaluated on the manifold W and the second one on the manifold M now if you fix M and the geometric string structure eta and you consider two different manifolds, the spin manifold, the spin four manifolds, W0, nabla zero, and W1. W0, nabla 0, and w1, nabla 1, then you get that the difference of psi of the first data and psi of the second data is exactly half of the integral of the first pontryagin class of the manifold w, which you can obtain by gluing the two w1 and w0 with the opposite orientation along m. Now it is known that for a spin, a closed spin for a manifold, the integral of the first For manifold, the integral of the first Pontryagin class is a multiple of 48, and this means that the integral of half that is a multiple of 24. So, well, psi of m eta is well defined, module 24. Then one can show that this function psi does not depend on the geometric string structure and it only depends on the string cobordism class of m. Then, of course, additivity. Then, of course, additivity is manifest from the definition, and one can just do a direct computation on S3, which is the canonical generator of border string 3, to get that you have this isomorphism that we want. And so we obtain, or well, not we, Bunke, Naumann, and Redden obtain this isomorphism here. What we wanted to do is to show how this integral formula. Show how this integral formula for ψ and its main properties can be seen in the context of TFTs with values in some symmetric monoidal categories, which are associated with morphisms of abelian groups. So to start, let's just recall some definitions that we've seen quite a lot of times. Well, by the symbol board xi g d minus 1x, I will denote the symbol. I will denote the symmetric monoidal category of dd minus one Bordism with this tangential structure x and background fields sorry tangential structure xi and background spie x so this means that the objects are d minus one dimensional closed manifolds with the appropriate tangential structure x i sorry again and endowed with a map to this space of background This space of background fields, or in general, we will not work with spaces but with smooth stacks. And it's really just a borderism category with a map to something. And of course, the morphisms are D-dimensional manifolds with the same tangential structure with a map to the stock or to the space X, such that everything on the boundary. Such that everything on the boundary works in the appropriate way. Now, a very simple example, but which is kind of important, is if we take X to be the smooth stack of closed D minus one forms, then an object in the category of oriented D D minus one borders with this stack of background fields is given by. Of background fields is given by a d minus one oriented manifold equipped with a map to that stack, but a map to the stack of closed G minus one forms is exactly a G minus one form. So this is a manifold with a closed G minus one form omega, G minus one M and given a morphism W from M0 to M1, so abortism. M0 to M1, so abortism in this category. Well, it's just the datum of an oriented D manifold with a closed D minus one form on it. And of course, everything should work when we restrict the big manifold, the cobordism to the manifolds M1 and M0. Now, well, No, well, a very simple definition is that if we have C, which is a symmetric monoidal category, then TQFT with tangential structure Xi and background fields X is just some monoidal functor Z from the Bordism category, which we just talked about, to the category C. And the typical choice is the category of vector spaces or of super vector spaces or that kind of. That kind of stuff over some field, usually C or R, but we will consider a different family of categories, which I'm going to define. So if we have a morphism psi, sorry, phi of A, which is just a morphism of abelian groups from an abelian group, which I will call A more to an abelian group, which I will call A ob for reasons that I think should already be obvious. I think it should already be obvious. We define this category ψ A tensor, which is a category whose objects are the elements of AOB. And amorphism between two objects, A and B, is an element X in A more such that A plus phi A of X equals B, where of course plus, where plus is the operation. The operation, the abelian group operation in AO. Now, here, composition of morphism is given by the sum in a more tensor product of objects and of morphisms is given by, well, the group operation in AOP in a more. The unit object is the zero in a yog, and that is pretty clear. And associators, uniters, ratings, all that stuff that we want to have when we consider. Have when we consider symmetric monodal categories are all trivials and they are given by the zero in AMORE. Just a bit of notation that will come useful later. If the map from AMOR to AOB is the initial map from the zero object to A, then the category will just be denoted by A tensor. So, well, we have a bit less data. Let's simplify the names. Now, here we have the first non-trivial example of this kind of TQFTs. If we take as our stack of background fields, the stack of D minus one forms, which we are not asking to be closed now. And we consider as a target the category identity of our tensor, so the category with object. The category with objects, real numbers, and a morphism from A to B given just by B minus A. Then we can define this nice TQFT from the Bordism category over D minus one differential forms to our category over the identity of R. And it will send an object. An object, so a manifold with d minus one form to the integral of that d minus one form over the manifold, and a morphism, so a d-dimensional manifold with a d minus one form to the integral over the manifold of the differential of the d minus one form. Now, this functor is a TQFT, and monoidality is just given by additivity of the integral over these joint unions. Over these joint unions. And here it's pretty neat that the functor reality of this map here is given by the Stokes' theorem. And a less trivial example that we can define using this framework, we can obtain for D equals 2 by taking the set of background fields to be this B U1 noblock. Is B U1 Nobla, which is the stack representing U1 principal bundles with connection. And as target, we will take the category associated to the exponential map from R to U1. Now, we can obtain TQFT from this data by sending a manifold, so an object, which is just a disjoint union of circles with a U1 principle bundle with connection to the whole. One principal bundle with connection to the holonomy of the connection, and by sending the abortism between two manifolds to one over two pi i times the integral of the curvature of the connection. And again, monodality is given by additivity of the integral and factoriality is given by the fundamental identity relating. Identity relating holonomy and curvature, which is here. And we can generalize this definition to not just U1 principal bundles with connections, but U1 principal N bundles with connection by considering the same formula. So we send a manifold N as a manifold MN, so an n-dimensional manifold with U1N principal bundle with connection to Principal bundle with connection to its awanomy, and we send a cobordism to well one over two pi i times the integral of the curvature of the connection. And here we have to give a definition of bn u1 nobla. And well one can define it in a couple different ways which are all equivalent, but the definition that I will use is Will use is as this homotopy pullback of smooth stacks where well the bottom map from B n plus 1 Z to B n plus 1 R is just the n plus 1 the looping in the category of smooth stacks of well the inclusion of Z into R and the right vertical map is just the map that from from From the RAM co-homology. So, the one that takes a closed form and associates to it its representative in the RAM co-homology. And by taking this pullback, we can define this nice stack of U1 and principal bundles with connection. And we also have for free this map 1 over 2πif, which is the curvature of the connection. And well, notice that our stack. Our stack also has a map from differential n forms, and composing this map with the curvature map is just the differential from n forms to n plus one closed forms. And these two will turn up later. Now, Brelinski and McLaughlin have shown that one can take the Take the map of classifying space from the classifying space of spin principle bundles to B3U1 or to the well B4 of Z or to the fourth Heilenberg-McLean space of Z, however you prefer to think about that. This map here, which is the first fractional Pontryagin class, and you can refine it to a morphism of smooth stacks. And you can also And you can also again refine it to amorphism of between the smooth stacks of thin principal bundles with connection and U1 principal three bundles with connections. And we have this commutative diagram here. So we just can define this map, the first fractional Pontryagin class at the level of smooth stacks with a connection. With a connection. Now, if we compose this diagram here with the curvature morphism from B3, U1, nabla to four closed forms, we obtain this nice cumulative diagram. And well, we have this map P1 over 2, P1, CW, which is the representative, the turn bias representative of the first. Violence representative of the first fractional contriigan class. And using this, we obtain from the example above, we obtain four three-dimensional TQFT with background fields given by this pinobla and target again given by the category associated to the exponential map. And this TQFT here, which This TQFT here, which we call the spin. Well, it takes an object, it takes a three-manifold with a spin principal bundle with connection, and it sends it to the holonomy of, well, of the associated U13 principal bundle with connection. And it takes four manifolds, so bordism in the category, and it sends it to. In the category, and it sends it to the integral of this turn value representative. It's just taking the TQFT that we've seen earlier and composing it with this map one half P one hat. Nothing terribly weird, but it will be useful. And now we can take a moment to talk about geometric string structures. And of course, we know that the Of course, we know that the homotopy fiber of the first fractional quantry eigen class is the classifying space of string principle bundles. So, well, we have this almost copy pullback here, and we can pass to smooth stacks, so to stacks representing smooth principal bundles, but nothing particularly exotic, and we can refine this diagram to a diagram where we have nabla. We have Nabla everywhere. And we can define the stack of well string bundles with connections. Now, this is not what we want to consider. We will actually consider a slightly different stack, which is, well, the stack of geometric string structures. And it can be defined with this pullback diagram here. The bottom up is again this. Again, this first fractional quantry class here between B Spin NABLA and B3U1 NABLA. And the vertical map is, well, the map from omega n to Bn U1 NABLA that I talked about earlier. By defining it this way, we have this nice homotopy pullback, and we have that whatever a geometric string structure is on a manifold M, it will have a geometric. It will have a geometric spin connection associated to it and three forms associated to it. And of course, you have some conditions that this diagram is a pullback diagram. Now, we can take this diagram here and compose it with the map from the stack of U1, three principal bundles with connection to To four loss forms. And we have seen that the composition of the vertical map with this curvature is just a differential. I'm not sure if you can see my cursor, actually, but I hope you can. Yes, we can see it. We can see it. Great. And this map here, the bottom map, is exactly the composition that we've seen earlier. And so this shows that. And so this shows that the form omega 3 is exactly the canonical three form on a smooth manifold. And it has, well, if I have this three form associated to a manifold with a geometric string structure and a manifold with a geometric string structure, since we are talking of smooth stocks, is just a map from M to B string geom to this object. String geom to this object. So it comes equipped with a spin connection with tree form omega 3, and we have this identity relating them. So the differential of this tree form is exactly one half of P1CW of normal. Now we are working with geometric string structures instead of string. Instead of string connections, for the following reason. If you have a smooth manifold M and you have a smooth spin bundle over M, well, then this bundle can be given a geometric string structure. So the map can be lifted to be string geom if and only if the first fractional point-triaging class of the spin bundle is trivial. And this is actually the topological, right? Actually, the topological fraction of Pontryagin class. And of course, this is equivalent to saying that if I have a string bundle, so exactly the same data mark, a spin bundle with trivial first fractional Pontryagin class. And of course, I have to choose a leaf, but let's not worry about that. Then every string bundle will admit a geometric string structure. And this is And this is always true for when we consider leak groups. So, if I have a league group G and I have a principal G bundle, I can always give this principal G bundle a connection. This is not true, or at least it is not so easy to say for Li two groups like the string group or Li n groups in general. Or the end groups in general. But what we can say is that, well, we can lift it to this, we can lift a string bundle to a string bundle with a geometric string structure, which is good enough for what we care about at this moment. Now, it is a good idea to go back a moment to more physics of abelian group. Of abelian groups and to those categories that we have seen earlier to notice that not only we can associate to a morphism of abelian groups as move symmetric, not as move, sorry, what am I saying? Asymmetric monadal category, but that this contraction is functorial. So if we have two morphisms, this phi h from h more to h ob. From H more to Hob and Phi G from GMO to Gob. Then, of course, amorphism in the category of maps of abelian groups is just a commutative square where we, well, we can say that the left map is F more and the right map is F up. Now, this commutative square will define asymmetric monoidal functor from the category phi H tensor to the category phi G tensor. Category of 5 G tensor. So this construction is functorial or pseudo functorial. Now, an important notion that we will need is the notion of homotopy fiber or essential fiber if we are talking of categories, but it's basically the same thing of a functor. So we have a functor P from a category D to a category C. To a category C, and we can consider a category which we will call ho fib of p, where the objects are pairs x, b, where x is an object in the source category. And b is a morphism in the target category from the unit element of the tensor product to well to the image of x along p, and this morphism has to be an isomorphism. this morphism has to be an isomorphism. Then of course morphisms between two pairs xb and x prime b prime are given by morphisms in D such that this diagram commutes. And this is the notion of homotopy fiber. We can relax it to a notion of lax homotopy fiber where we only ask the morphism B to be any morphism. It doesn't have to be an isomorphism now. Isomorphism now. Notice that if the category C is a groupoid, then of course every morphism is an isomorphism, and so the two notions coincide. And of course, notice that our categories constructed from morphisms of abelian groups are groupoids. Now we can give this nice description of the homo. Nice description of the homotopy fiber of the functor f from the category phi h tensor to the category phi g tensor. And well, we have this lemma that if we have this community diagram of abelian groups and we have the associated functor, then the objects of the homotopy fiber are just given by the fiber product of GMOR and HOB over GOB, the only fiber product. G-OB, the only fiber product that one can consider. And the morphisms are given. So a morphism from a pair GH to a pair G prime H prime is an object X in, sorry, morphism at X, so an element in H more such that, well, sending X to G more along F more will give more will give us the difference between G prime and G, and sending it to H ob will give us the difference between H prime and H. And we have this nice lemma where if to this diagram we add this map here, lambda, and of course if this diagram commutes, then we also get asymmetric monoidal functor from the category. I'll give Given by the homotopy fiber of F to the category curve φG tensor, which I recall is a category where given by the initial map. So the objects of this category are the elements of the kernel of 5G. The tensor product is given by the group operation, and we only have trivial morphisms. And this And this symmetric monoidal functor ψ simply takes a pair and sends it to g minus lambda h. Notice that if phi h here is an isomorphism, then our functions will be an equivalence. And this is quite a strong result. Now we can finally construct Finally, construct this Bunke-Nauman red and morphism in the following way. We know that the stack of geometric string structures has a map to three forms. So even a geometric string structure, we get a three-fourth. And if we see it functorially, well, then to the Bordism category with background fields, the SACAP geometric string structure, we can associate. We can associate well, we have a functor from there to the Bordism category with background fields, the three forms. Now we can compose this with the TQFT that we've seen, with the first TQFT that we've seen, the one with values on the category given by the identity of R. And this will give us. And this will give us this TQFT that we call the string from our category to the category or the identity. Now, this simply takes a closed oriented three-manifold M with a geometric string structure eta to the integral of the three form and well the three form the canonical three form and it takes an oriented four manifolds of a Bordism to the integral To the integral of the differential of that form, which is the definition, but we know that the differential of that form is exactly half the integral of the term while representative of the first fractional Puntreagin class evaluated on the connection. And notice that we also have another map of stacks from B string GM to B spinabla, which is just the, well, Just the well, forgetting math. And this too induces a monodal functor from this Bordism category to this other Bordism category over spin bundles with connections. And we have, well, we can construct this diagram of abelian groups. It's really. It's really well here the horizontal map above is the identity of R. The bottom map is the exponential map. And of course, the vertical maps are exactly the same maps. But we can think of them as this is H more, this is H ob, this is G more, and this is G ob. And of course, this will give. And of course, this will give us the top map will give us when we consider our functor giving us a category, a symmetric monodic category. This top map will give us the identity, the category constructed over the identity and the bottom map, the one constructed over the exponential map. So we can put everything together to obtain this diagram of symmetric model. This diagram of symmetric monoidal functors, where this vertical map here on the left is just the map that we've just seen. The right map is this other map that we've just seen. And well, they are this map here, the first one, and the last map of the slide. And the horizontal map are the string and z spin that we have seen earlier. And this diagram is commutative, it has identity two cells. Community, it has identity to cell, and so everything is really nice. And well, we have that the homotopy fiber construction is, of course, itself functorial. And so we can obtain a symmetric monodal functor from the lux homotopy fiber of this vertical map here to the lux homotopy fiber of this vertical map on the right. Right. And notice that the laxomotopy fiber of the second vertical map is the actual homotopy fiber because the bottom category is a glupoid. Now, recall that there is a message in the chat. Oh, no, it was not for me. Notice that the commutative diagram defining our morphism of our function. Morphism of our functor of categories can be completed with this diagonal identity here. And notice also that the top map is, of course, an isomorphism. And so this says that the homotopy fiber of, well, of the category, of the functor that takes the category constructed over the identity and sends it to the category constructed over the exponential map is. map is equivalent to the category Z tensor. So the category with well Z tensor because it is the kernel of this bottom map and it is the category with objects, integer numbers and tensor product given by sum in R and non-morphism, non-non-trivial morphisms. Now we can put everything together to obtain this symmetric polynodal functor that we call this spin string. That we call this spin string that is the functor from the lax homotopy fiber of this map to the lax homotopy fiber of this map. So it is exactly this map, which we can compose with the well, with the equivalence psi to z tensor. And well, the theorem is that this functor is exactly the Bunken-Nauman Radenma psi. And I will not give a proof here, but I just want to notice that the source of this map, this pin string, so the homotopy fiber, the lux homotopy fiber of this functor here, an object here, we have said, is an element, an object in the source category. So it is a three-manifold with a geometric string structure endowed with With amorphism from, well, from its image, but that is just considering that manifold as a manifold with a spin connection. And that, as I was saying, with amorphism from the unit of the tensor product, so the empty manifold to itself. And so this means that an object here is exactly a string, three manifold, three manifold with a geometric string structure. With a geometric string structure with a spin4 manifold with connection with M3 as a boundary. And of course, everything, the fact that everything coincides when we pass from one notion to the other is exactly that. The fact that we are considering that spin, that homotopy fiber. And this is just saying that the objects, The objects in the source of our functor are exactly the data of Bunke and Auman and Redden map. Now, of course, we can compute this functor Z-spin string and see where the quadruple goes. And of course, we can split it as the pair M3 eta and the morphism W4 NABLA. And we obtain that this. And we obtain that this object here, which is the image of our functor, when we consider it as where we consider the target of our functor, the homotopy fiber of that functor there. Well, using the equivalence psi, it will be sent to the difference of this and lambda of this, but lambda was just the identity. And so by composing everything, we get exactly the Bunkel. The Bunke, Nauman, and Redenma. Now, this was all work concerning the first fractional Pontryagin class, but it's not necessary to do that with the first fractional Pontryagin class. So, for instance, one can replace it in everything that we did with the first shurn class. And now, everything, the object. And now everything, the objects that participate in this work change. And well, the homotopy fiber of the map that we considered, so the homotopy fiber of the first class is now the classifying space of special unitary bundles. And so this means that now instead of considering spin and string, we are considering U and S U. U and SU. Then, if we repeat everything, we realize the isomorphism between the first Bordism group with tangential structure given by the special unitary group with Z mod 2. Notice that here the things that we are using are the fact that the Bordesian group of the bottom group. So, spin. Bottom group. So spin in our first case, and u here is trivial. And that we have some kind of relevant index theorem. The first one was, well, the actual index theorem, the fact that the integral of the first Pontryagin class was a multiple of 48. And here is the Gaussmann theorem, the fact that the integral over an oriented to manifold of the first joint class is even. And this is an This is an example that actually works. To conclude, I was a bit early, but to conclude, we could give another example by going higher along the whited tower of the orthogonal group. So instead of considering the spin and string, we could actually try to consider string and fibra. So the So the group obtained by killing another homotopy group from the bottom. And notice that the classifying space of fibraine is the homotopy fiber of now the second fraction of the three eigen class, which is one over six of p2. And we also have that condition that we like, the fact that the appropriate Bordism group, so the seventh Bordism group, Borders and group, a string border group is trivial. So by doing everything, we would get that we can obtain an integral formula by taking a five-brain seven manifold by obtaining an eight manifold, an eight manifold of dimension eight with a string structure with boundary, the five-brain manifold. The five-brain manifold, and by constructing all our connections and all our well, repeating all of our construction to get our integral formula. And here we have the problem that I was talking about earlier, which is that we can always give a spin connection to a spin principle bundle. And so, well, everything works in this case. Well, everything works in this case, but we are not so sure that any principal string bundle will admit an actual string connection. So a condition which is stronger than a geometric string structure. But if that was the case, and there isn't really any specific reason why that should not be the case, but we do not have a proof, well, then we would have this nice. We would have this nice theorem, even for five brain, and it should actually work by going up the white tower wherever you want. So that is all I wanted to talk about. If you have any questions, I'm welcome to hear. Okay, thank you very much. Okay, since I'm not in the room, are there any questions in the room? I can't see the room, so let me see if I can. If there are, I'll take the microphone. Yeah, yeah, please. Yeah. Yeah. Any questions? I guess I do have one question about this last bit. Is is there sort of does do you get sort of a nice statement that accounts for not knowing whether these uh fibers are actually non-empty? Like if you take the the sub is there, sorry, what am I trying to say? Something like, is there a statement where you don't need to know whether you always have these structures and you sort of just have the sub-object where they Then you sort of just have the sub-object where they do exist. And maybe the square is not a pullback square there, but. That is an interesting question. I don't know if there is such a statement. That might be possible, but it's not something that we. It certainly wouldn't be as nice as these, but. Yes, the interesting fact here is that you actually recover pieces of the, well, of the stable homotopy groups. Stable homotopy groups of spheres. So that is, yes, but we know we didn't really think about what happens by just considering what works. So we were kind of all or nothing. Yeah. Okay. Are there any questions by Zoom from Zoom participants? I guess I can ask a question about so if there's kind of a complex version of the string story. So in the Ando Hopkins, I forget if it's RESC or Strickland construction of TMF orientations, they actually write it out for BSU6 instead of B08, or instead of B string. So the connective cover of BSU where you kill C2. So, I suspect that there's, and it might actually be already included in what you're doing just by forgetting the complex structure. It seems like you could probably get a description of Pi3 stable in terms of SU6 boardism. I'm just wondering, I mean, and I suspect that actually just by forgetting the complex structure should basically amount to what you've already worked out. But there, it might be slightly easier to go one step up from BSU6 to BSU8. You know, from BSU6 to BSU8, where you're not going quite as far up as with fibrains. I'm not showing that it's actually any easier, but it's just sort of a parallel story. That's really interesting. Yes, thank you. I didn't think about that, but. But I think if you think, I mean, what you explained about how to detect ADA in Pi 1 in this stable one stem in terms of the BSU boardism, I think that you can also. BSU boardism. I think that you can also detect the Zimo24 by looking at BSU6, at SU6 boardism. Yeah, that's right. And who knows this? Yes. Okay, are there any other questions or comments? No? Okay, well. No? Okay, well let's thank the speaker once again.
