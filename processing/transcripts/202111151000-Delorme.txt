Okay, I start now. So G is a split reductive group of R. P is a borel subgroup. So the notation is not so standard, but I was hoping to treat the non-split groups. So I keep P like a ball subgroup. X is a real spherical. X is a real spherical G-variety. This means that P has an open orbit in X with invariant measure. I assume that there is an invariant measure. To simplify the exposition, I assume that P has a unique open orbit, P X0 in X. And if, of course, if H is a side valuer of X0, X. zero x identified to g model age what is the abstractial formula the abstract pointial formula is a disintegration of in multiple of irreducible representations so h pi mu is a boreal measure on the unitary dual and p h p is a continuous unitary irreducible representation Unitary irreducible representation of G and Mπ is a finite dimensional space endowed with a scatter product. So this is abstract decomposition and what I want to do is something less abstract than this. Okay, LMPI even is more specific. So this is due to Bernstein. This m pi is a space of distribution vectors which are h-fixed and tempered in a suitable sense. So this is the work of Bernstein I mentioned before that was told to me by Castleman, by Will. Okay, so try to remember this notation of H-fix distribution and tempered vectors. The goal is to explicit this formula up to the twisted discrete spectrum of the boundary degeneration of X. So this is for James, this is like after the work of Joseph, I was able, using also the work of Lapil, to give a proof of the spectral decomposition of long lens up to the discrete spectrum, okay, without the Okay, without the knowledge of the discrete spectrum. So I will come back to the boundary degeneration of X much later. The strategy is due to Saccharidis and Vancate in the PD case. In the PD case, the assumption of Saccharidis and Vancate were that the group also is split, and they were making a further assumption. Making a further assumption that the spherical varieties of waveform time. We are not, I am not, I do not need this hypothesis of waveform time in my work. So the strategy is to introduce Bernstein maps. So in the real case, this Bernstein maps, I will talk to of them later. Of them later were introduced by me, Knapp, Kross, and Schishkrul of our. And then there is a big issue in all of this work. This is some conjecture on the discrete series conjecture. And then introduce scattering operators, groups, they're unitary. Operators have proved their unitarity. So with X and P comes a non-unique maximal stitorus A in P and what I'll call AMT, the coefficient of A by A intersection S, H. And there is a set the finite set of simple spherical rules. So I don't want to explain what they are. To explain what they are, but they are, this is a finite set of rational characters of A and T. Okay, and so you have the set of for I included in S, there is a boundary degeneration Xi. So Hi is some subgroup of G. I will come back to this. I will come back to this later. For the group case, the HR are almost parabolic subgroups. Okay. So I introduce the neutral components of the Holy Group AI, the intersection of the kernel of the alpha. And this And this neutral component acts on exile. So you see, there is a difference in this treatment that for the treatment of Arizona of the Planchet formula for G, Aries General was looking to as an intermediate step to the levy. The levy to levy. But here we are not looking to levy, we are looking to actual things on which G is acting. So Z is the center of the complex algebra of the enveloping algebra of G. And we have the theory of the constant term. So this is quite. So, this is quite general fact in harmonic analysis, which is needed. So, what is a it is a map here between z of g finite tempered function on x to z of g finite tempered function on xi. So, it's not like for automorphic forms, it's not defined for any set of G-finite functions. Function. In the work of Val's Pierget on the Planchet formula for paired groups, this is named the weak constant term. So it could be called the weak constant term also here. So by duality, we define a map from H. map from H fixed distribution vectors to HI distribution vectors. So these maps are very, very important. You see the coefficient of the distribution vectors are Z of G tempered maps and they are mapped like this. So you have a map G star P. So there is a So there is an adjoint here because it was introduced like this by Serkeridis van Kertesch. Note that I0 act on the second space. And what has the Planchrel formula for Xi from the one from X from the one for X. So L2 of Xi is the one. Is an Hilbert integral of representation with the same Borel measure, with the same spectral measure than for X, but with modified finite dimensional MIP. So MIP is almost the image of M phi by G sar i pi. I pi. It is the AE0 span of G star M i pi. So you have a description of the space and the scalar product also on M i pi is obtained by some process of limit from M pi. So the Planchrel formula for X gives the Planchrel formula for Xi. So, an important ingredient of the harmonic analysis in our genre is the mass-Helbert relation. So, you have the space MI pi on which AE0 is acting, then the Then the Maus-Helbert relation says that the restriction of Mi pi of the adjoint of Gi pi is isometric. So this is very technical. You can almost forget it in the So now you have AI, the Lie algebra of AI, and you look, I want to describe the relative spectrum, the relative discrete spectrum. From the relative discrete series. So I induced from Hi II0 trivial on HI and with differential on I0 is lambda. And what is in this space there is a discrete spectrum of a is a discrete spectrum. The discrete spectrum. So the twisted discrete series are the irreducible representation of L2 of xi lambda. Okay, this is the definition of the discrete spectrum. And one can define the discrete series. And I define a space which is an Hilbert integral of this relative discrete. Integral of this relative discrete series. Of course, if you think to this, you may ask why this Albert and Degral exists, because there is a maturity issue, and I will solve this maturity issue in a few minutes. So now I come to the analogue of the discrete cell. Come to the analogue of the discrete series conjecture of Seth Albis and Venkatel. The first thing is that from Kroots, Quit, Erlochdam, and Schischruel, the real part of the variation parameters of infinitesimal characters of twisted discrete series are contained in a lattice. So, this is a restriction on the real part of the infidel character. And physicial character of 2C discrete series. The conjecture, which is the analog of the discrete conjecture of secular divergent attach, is on the imaginary part of the discrete spectrum. So this is for I included in S and almost all lambda and all twisted discrete series in L2 of X lambda. Essentially, Essentially, the imaginary part of the infinite character is lambda up to the action of the valve. Okay, so this is the analog of the conjecture is true in many cases for I GLS given by the real analog of cases given by Secretis Venkatesh in the PIT case. Case using the unfolding. Now I come to the invariant differential operators. So let D of X, the algebra of G, invariant differator on X. So we have the Aries Chandra homomorphism of Knop. This is an isomorphism between Isomorphism between this algebra of differential operators and the algebra of W X invariant of S of Avid. So I recall that S is a subset of Evid etoel, and there is a group generated by the reflection around these elements. So, I thank very much Raphael Boz-Arplessy, which has related his homomorphism to one defined few years ago when we were dealing with constant term theory, which is given in terms of a subquotient of the algebra of V P. Thus, this is much closer to the definition of the Arichon Ra homomorphic. Of the Arichendra homomorphism for the center of the enveloping algebra. It is quite close to this definition. It is different from the definition, quite different from the definition of Knobs, so this requires some work. Similarly, D of Xi is isomorphic to Si. is isomorphic to Si Wi where Wi is generated by the efficient to the elements of I. The auto-adjoint part of T of X I acts by essentially self-adjoint operators on L2 of XC with common core the space of C infinity vectors of this representation. This representation. So, this is this requires some analytics. I followed essentially things from Rossmann and van den Baan for this. And why it is important because this allows joint spectral decomposition for these operators. You need to have a common core to manage. Common core to make joint spectral decomposition. Together with the conjecture and the description of the xi above, this allows to show that L2, the discrete part of L2 of Xi, is the image of a spectral protection you have. Protection. You have an algebra with a spectrum and with a spectral decomposition to attach to each part of the spectrum. You have a spectral projection. Okay. For this, we use a property of spectral projection of type 1 groups, whose proof was given to me by Alan Cohen. It says that under some hypothesis. It says that under some hypothesis, the spectral projection of an Hilbert integral of representation is the Hilbert integral of the spectral projection. So this seems completely trivial, but actually it requires some abstract nonsense statement, requires some work. And this part ensures the measurability of the field L2 of it. Of the field L2 of X lambda T d. Now we come to the Bernstein morphism. The Bernstein morphism are morphism going up from L2 of Xc to L2 of X. So you have the spectral decomposition of L2 of Xc, which is given by an Ilbert integral with a field. integral with a field with a measure mu and you have a same similar field for l2 of x and uh so what so you have this two field of integrals and i the bernstein map is an ibert integral of Integral of some local maps defined for each pi. So G pi is a map from mi pi to m pi. The Bernstein morphist asks abstract version of wave facets of Eisenstein integrals of Arish Genre. So Eisenstein integrals of Aishenre complete. You take Wave packets coming from the levy and you go to the big group. Why is it an abstract version? Because these maps, the GIP maps are unknown. These maps are not explicit. Okay. Now there is a lot of information about L2 of X. You take the L2 of X is a discrete spectrum of each boundary degeneration. You take the Bernstein maps, you take the sum, and you get L2 of X. So So, this is not the composition of L2OFX, this is an expression of L-tuopics that has to be refined to make it more clear. So you have IG included in S. Define IETD is a restriction of The restriction of AI to L2 the L to the of X C T D so this is a part of the Vernstein map using spectral projection for Z of G and decomposition of L two of X C T D in in in eigen space for the differential operators. Differential operators and using also the property of the infinitesimal character of discrete series one as the G equivalent map. So you take a Bernstein map, take the adjoint, and this is zero unless E and G are conjugated. E and G are conjugated by the bi group. Again, using spectral projection, but for I0 and Ig0, it is relatively easy to see that if E is approximated, is conjugate to G, there exist scattering operators from L2 to XC. From L two d of x c t d to l two d of x g and w is a set of elements of w x which conjugate a to a g such that so this decomposition so this is a sum of scattering operators and I will say something about scattering operators And I will say something about scattering operators. The scattering operators have some properties that they so you have to understand that the SW are in some sense integrals, invert integrals of intertwining operations, intertwining integrals. Intertwining integrals. So you have this property of conjugacy. So R is the right action of IE0 and Ig0. And so it goes from things which behave by IE to IE double. And the main term. And the main theorem in the main difficulty is the proof of the main result is the scattering operators S of W are unitary. So this was the main difficulty essentially in the work of Secretis and Venter Tesch. Okay. And so the main theorem is the following. Theorem is the following. So there is a property, first property of Bernstein maps. The scattering of paraters behave well with respect to the product of element of the value group. So I repeat the result at the adjoint. That the adjoint are like this. And that's what is the main Planchet formula essentially. It says, so I denote E some constants and the map from L two of X in L two of X C T D the sum of L two of X C T D. Of L2 of XCTD is an isometric isomorphism onto the subspace of Fi in this direct sum, which are invariant by conjugation by the scattering of parameters. So this means that This means that if you know the discrete spectrum of each boundary degeneration, you know a nice description of L2 of X. So this is the main result. And I will try to give I will not possible to Will it's not possible to give a proof of the scattering, the unitality of the scattering of a parator, but I want to discuss some difference with the work of Sakhalis and Venetésch. Sakhalis and Venkate were looking to restriction of function on X to neighborhoods of infinity in a spoof compactification of X. Pactification of X. These neighborhoods were obtained by doing open cells given by the Local structure theorem of this compactification. The Local structure theorem describes neighborhoods in this compactification. Neighborhoods have infinity of this comp compactification. But the gluing process doesn't work in the real case. Doesn't work in the real case. Instead, we will use covering of X by open set built also from the local structure theorem and introduce approximate partition by a surgery on this covering. So this is not gluing, but there is some surgery to To have partition. So the idea: you have a compactification and you trim the bits in a smooth compactification given by open set, given by the local structure theorem, starting with a closed one. For simplicity, when I assume that X has Assume that X has a wonderful J-equivariant compactification. Then, in this compactification, the orbit are given in B-jection with I included in S. And I denote this orbit in the G orbit in the compactification by Egypt I. Then here is a definition of the boundary. Definition of the boundary generation. You have an orbit in the orbit in the compactification. You look to the normal bundle of this orbit, and inside this orbit you have an open G orbit. And this is the compact, the boundary. The boundary degeneration. One ends up with a covering of X by a finite family of open sides. So index part by three things. You have I, you trim an orbit, you trim an orbit like I, so you have I. You have a finite set of orbits because you want to trim by small. You want to trim by small sets. And epsilon i measures the proximity of the boundary to the boundary orbit. You have an open set near the boundary and you can make it close to the boundary. Okay, this is a question. Okay, the CC submissions. So U is a subset of a translate of the open orbit in X, which is densified with the same translate of the open orbit in each boundary generation. So you have an open, the open orbits. The open orbits in the boundary degeneration are in bijection. And in particular, the constant term of a function on UI might be viewed as a function on the same space. Okay. You can see UI in various point generations. So there is something I think it is used also in the theory of automorphic forms. The constant term might be viewed, the function fi might be viewed. The function fi might be used as a sum of alternate sums of constant term. And there is an inequality that we call main inequality for this alternate sum. Then elementary analysis is used as a Planchrel formula for RR, and at the end, it is necessary to entropy. Necessary to introduce approximate partitions. So for each P in N, I introduce U UIP. So the UIP has not to be too large. They have to cover the union of the UI. And when P tends to infinity, the UI. P tends to infinity, the UIP becomes approximately this joint. So with all these arguments modified to the work of Secretary Van Gatelsch and also using the theory of the constant term for the real spherical varieties, I was able to prove the To prove the main theorem, which is essentially this. Okay, thank you.
