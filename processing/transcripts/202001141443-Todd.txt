So I'm going to talk start by talking a bit about why calving is hard to do. Normally I start by talking about why it's important, but I don't think given the audience that that's particularly necessary. I'm going to talk a little bit about a very small subsection of the work that's been done on calving recently, and then I'm going to talk shamelessly about my own work for a little while, but then I have some provocative questions at the end in order to generate a bit of discussion. In order to generate a bit of discussion. So, why is calving hard to model? Well, many reasons. It happens quickly and it happens slowly. You'll notice in this picture there actually isn't any calving, and this is because this is the closest I got to getting a picture of a calving event myself. You can see some of the spray after the event happened. It's very difficult to sit there and take pictures all day. And this is the Brunt ice shelf, which has been calving very, very slowly. A lot of these things. Very, very slowly. A lot of these things in Antarctica happen over decadal scales. So it's fast and it's slow, and it's big and it's small. It's a fracturing continuum, and it's poorly observed. Or at least, this is what we would say a few years ago when people said, why are we so bad at doing calving? We say, well, we don't have the observations, so get out in the field and get some. But actually, that's what's happened. And now I don't think there really is a justification for saying that we don't have the observations. That we don't have the observations that we need to understand calving. I think it really falls to the modellers now, unfortunately. And this is a pain as well because when you don't have any observations, then your model is always correct, right? Okay, yeah, so that's why it's difficult. A brief overview of some proposed calving laws. I'm just going to skip between these two slides for this. So here's a glacier flowing towards the sea, right? And so amongst the earlier. And uh so amongst the earliest calving laws were suggestion, for example, that the rate of calving is just linked through some empirical relation to the depth of water at the front here, right? And so the deeper the water that you're in, the faster you calve. And so that's quite a straightforward empirical model. But then building on that, instead thinking about the idea that glaciers have to maintain a certain proportion of thickness above buoyancy or else they cove, i.e. they ought to be grounded. Calve, i.e., they ought to be grounded. Obviously, that doesn't work so well for floating glaciers. In fact, it doesn't work at all for that. But that gets us somewhere. And then moving on, work published in 2008, specifically looking at ice shelves or ice shelf margins that are pretty close to steady state, and just suggesting that you can take the strain rate at the front there and then scale that up somehow to get a calving rate. And then work that Mathieu and Morgan. And then work that Mathieu Morlegaem has been doing recently instead suggests that what we should look at is the stress at this region at the front here, and then scale that by some threshold value and multiply that by the velocity, and then that gives us a nice, reasonably well-behaved Calving law that advances and retreats in response to changes in stress. And then what we've been working on recently, and I think what Faisa knitted. Recently, and I think what Faiz and Nip was working with previously is a crevasse depth carving law. This doesn't look anything like how it was originally proposed, but this is how I implement it in 3D Elmer models. And this says basically that wherever you have some positive stress, and including the effects of water pressure underneath, not watering crevasses, then you will get crevassing. So this is like even simpler than linear elastic fracture mechanics. So this is sort of the limit of. So, this is sort of the limit of linear elastic fracture mechanics if you have very, very closely spaced crevasses. So, that's what I've been working on recently, working with recently, but sort of aim to go a little bit further than that today. Okay, and so just briefly to say as well that we can sort of divide these into different types of calving law, right? We have laws which attempt to define a rate of calving, and then we have laws that attempt to define where calving occurs. So, this is Define where calming occurs. So, this is sort of linked back to what Jeremy was saying about quasi-continuousness or event-scale calming. So, yeah, there's a whole range of different approaches that have been taken, but they mostly fall into those two categories, I think. So, yeah, just to say where we are at the moment in terms of the IPCC, right, so what policymakers have at the moment is basically Fiza Nick's work from 2013 using a one-dimensional full-line model. One-dimensional full-line model on four glaciers, and then that was upscaled based on some assumptions about different regions of the ice sheet in Greenland. And this is basically what the estimate for Greenland is at the moment. And I think we need to do better than this, and fortunately, I think we are starting to do so. So, yeah, like I said, there's been a lot of work on this recently, but I just want to focus on this example. So, this is Mathieu's recent work simulating an entire sector of. Simulating an entire sector of northwest Greenland here with this von Mises rate law. And actually, some really encouraging results. Particularly, so what we're looking at here for each of these four glaciers is the reality, the observed time respositions through time, and then the modelled ones, right? And so here we have a hindcasting, and then we have a forecasting as well, right? And what you see actually is that there's a really good match for a lot of these glaciers, right? So this is quite encouraging. The only kind The only caveat with that, I guess, is that for each of these different glacier sectors, we need to set a separate value for this threshold stress. And so there's a question about what does that change in threshold stress represent? Is it missing environmental forcing? Is it something to do with errors in the data? One possibility is that this threshold might represent something about the geometry of the glacier at the time, which might suggest that. Which might suggest that as we move away from these initial positions, that might become less valid. But yeah, so this is really state-of-the-art in terms of making big-scale predictions of calving glaciers at the moment. Yeah, so per sector tuning, does this represent environmental processes or local topography? So, this is a project I've been working on for three years now with Doug Ben. And what we're basically doing is trying to combine And what we're basically doing is trying to combine particle models with continuum models to try and learn something about the nature of Calving laws, which ones work, how can we improve them. So, High Dem, let me just briefly talk about this first. So, this is the glacier, and this is stored glacier in West Greenland, right? And it's a fast-flowing but very stable glacier, so it has a strong seasonal cycle in its terminus position. So, it's obviously got some environments. Determines position, so it's obviously got some environmental sensitivity in terms of calving, but it's been very stable at this location for over 60 years at this point, I think. What we found is that there should be a picture here, here we go. These red lines here represent observations and the green lines represent the model, right? And in this main figure here, we've got the seasonal minimum, maximum, and mean, right? And equivalent in green is the And the equivalent in green is the crevasse-depth Calvin law in Elmer. And then what we have here is the seasonal signal. And so we're doing a pretty decent job with the seasonal signal, right? And maybe in the minimum and the mean position, we're doing alright. But we get really quite significant discrepancies in terms of the behavior of this glacier at its maximum extent. So it does a decent job. The crevash depth law in Elmer Ice does a decent job. In Elmer Ice does a decent job, but there's plenty of room for improvement. So, yeah, this is why we decided to use Hayden, which is a particle model. So, discrete element model. Because it's a discrete element model, it can represent fracture processes directly rather than through parameterization. And what that means is that we can use these simulations, if we have confidence in them, to try and investigate the system in more detail and try and think about how we could parameterize. And try and think about how we could parameterize these effects for continuum models. Hide end is pretty simple. All it has is a series of particles connected by bonds, and those bonds break either through tension or shear, and then on top of that, the particles can collide with each other. Obviously, in terms of Calvin, we're primarily interested in this. So, yeah, that's high-em discrete element model. What we did to begin with, we took We did to begin with, we took two geometries that are sort of n-members. We have a sort of winter geometry that seems to be stable when there's melange and unstable otherwise. And then we have a summer geometry which is further retreated and seems to be stable in the absence of any extreme environmental forcing. And we did a bunch of simulations on these, and as Jeremy hinted, that these are on the time scales of hundreds of seconds and very expensive to run. And we forced it with a bunch of environmental forces. And we forced it with a bunch of environmental forcings and just with Glacier Advanced. I'm not going to talk too much about this because I talked about this quite a bit at Frisk and I don't want to bore you. And what we did basically is we, when we do our advanced simulations, for example, we can start with this summer geometry, the red line there, and we can advance that forward through viscous behavior in Elmer, and then we can take snapshots out and run them in high dem and see what happens. Yep, so high Dem results. Here's our very first. High-dem results. Here's our very first high-dem simulation of Store Glacier. You ready? Alright, so here's the front, some calving happening already, you can see. Right, so there it goes, a bit of calving, a bit more calving, and then blam over. Sorry, Torque. So our first result is that the stability of high dam depends quite strongly on choosing the right. Oh, I can't give it a stop now. Eventually. Eventually, it'll look at this as well. So, stability depends on a short time step, right? So, this is why we can only run for hundreds of seconds, because we really need to be at the microsecond scale to get sensible results. Yeah, I think it's the really you need to be shorter time scale than the propagation of sound waves across the glacier, I think, is how Jan has explained it to me. Yeah, so so so we've done a bunch of these sort of similar numerical techniques, but the difference is that we actually resolve the fluid in between them. And I think it might be worth thinking a little bit about how this problem relates to how you model the interaction between the particles. Because of the classical DM idea of like I have these spheres that kind of partially overlap as to represent deformation and then rebound, that does go away when you have fluids. Right, okay, so you get more stable size. Right, okay, so you get more stable simulation. Yeah, you get much more stable stimulation, and also you get more pressure effect, right? So like going back to this idea that whether you're fluid in a fracture actually matters quite a bit of like whether you basically, like the fluid basically buffers some of the things, right? And so I think that might be worth having to chat about that later. It becomes particularly important if you're not looking at spheres anymore. Because that effect would be a lot more pronounced if you had something that was more rectangular. Great. Yeah, no, that'd be good to talk about. Great. Yeah, no, that'd be good to talk about. Okay, yeah, so first result: we need short time steps. Here is what we're looking at now. This is the winter geometry, right? So this is the most extended front position that we have. And what we find to our relief is that when we run that without any buttressing Melange, it just falls apart. And what's quite nice as well, I'm just going to show that again, it actually falls apart to basically the extent of the summer geometry. So this new calving front shape is pretty close. Front shape is pretty close to our summer geometry. So, this is quite a nice sort of validation of the model. And what I'm going to show you now looks like it's going to be a video, but it isn't because this is the summer geometry and it does nothing, so I didn't want to waste the bandwidth. But you can see here, this is the final geometry. There's a small fracture in here, right? And there's another fracture in here. This region, I'm going to talk about this a bit later, but there's a lot of interesting fracturing activity happening there. Activity happening there. So, yeah, so our first real science results is that we took the model. I haven't applied any site-specific tuning to this in terms of the model parameters. I basically got it from Jan and Rani. So, that's quite encouraging. We find that the winter geometry, which we expect to be unstable without any support, is indeed unstable. And the summer geometry, which we expect to be stable in the absence of undercutting, is indeed stable. Cutting is indeed stable. So that's quite nice. What we also find is that we can get diverse calving behaviour out of the model depending on the environmental forcing that we apply. So if you saw the start position there, I'm going to show it again. But at the start position here, you can see there's a bit of undercutting below the waterline. And we get these quite typical top first calving events, right? And so that's quite nice. But then if we take the same geometry. But then, if we take the same geometry and rather than undercutting it, we advance the glacier. So, you're going to get a similar calming event here. But then, watch the toe here goes first. And we see both of these kinds of events at Store Glacier. So, this is quite nice. And it's sort of intuitive. If you undercut a glacier, you're not going to get a toe-first calving event, right? The other thing you'll notice here is that the behaviour of the particles, once they've detached from the glacier and are bobbing around in the water. From the glacier and are bobbing around in the water is not very well implemented, right? So we're pretty confident in this part, but as soon as they like this, it's a bit dodgy, right? But we're pretty confident that the fracture itself is behaving. Your ocean isn't very viscous, I think. Yeah, I think that's the problem. Yeah, so it's sensitive to forcing. And I'm not going to show too many more results. If you were at Frisk, then you would have seen my results about that. The more we undercut, the more we. The more we undercut, the more we cull, and the more we advance, the more we cull, if that makes sense. Finally, this is just something that's been put together reasonably quickly. This is work done by my PhD supervisor, Paul Christofferson, and one of his students, Tom Chudley. And they flew a bunch of UAV flights over the glacier and produced these nice orthophotos. And this is the first pair of images that he sent me. And you can see this really nice region. This really nice region here disappears in the next image, right? So that whole region just falls off. And when we run the model with moderate undercutting, so about 60 meters, we get basically the same kind of calving event initiated in the same place. So that's pretty cool. We have some rather rough validation in terms of comparisons with observations and expected behaviour. And that's great, but this is not worth anything if we can. This is not worth anything if we can't extract some information about what caused this to happen, because we can't run this model for the whole ice sheet, particularly not for more than a few minutes. So, what I want to talk about now is a bit of a comparison between our Elmer results and the Hayden results. I just realized I'm grinding this chalk a little bit for me. Okay, so Hayden for Calvin laws. So, the next thing we did, we took our Elmer geometry. So, this is the, this is a plus. Is the planned view of Storr Glacier, ice flowing this direction? Here's the ocean, right? And what this is, the colour here is in Elmer, the predicted penetration of crevasses just based on that simple nigh crevass depth criterion. So red colours are where we expect complete penetration to the glacier, and moving along this colour scale, we get less and less crevasse penetration. And then on the And then I'm going to superimpose on top of that this yellow line is what the Elmer calving model predicts will fall off. And you'll notice this doesn't map exactly to that region because this region here, for example, we wouldn't really expect that to calve even if there was a fracture there, right? Because it can't clear the ice out of the way. And actually, the distinction between this and this was like the last five months of my PhD. This was a real pain. But so this is what Elmer says will happen, right? So we've got some limited calving events in the So, we've got some limited calming events in the north side, but then quite significant in the south, and this is because this region here is floating up to about this point. This feature here is basically the grounding line. But we run the same thing in Elmer, High Dem, and that gives us this final geometry, is this magenta line here, right? So we get no carving along here, and then over here we have a sort of, if you stood really far away, you might say that Elmer was doing a good job, right? But we can probably do better here, right? There's an obvious. Here, right? There's an obvious mismatch between this and this. But I want to show you as well that there's some interesting stress effects here that seem to be running along that line that High Dem predicts will come. So that's Elmer versus High Dem. And what this is, is all the bonds in the High Dem simulation that break, and they are coloured by their depth. Okay, so the red bonds are really close to the surface, and the blue bonds are at depth. And what we find is that you basically can find... Is that you basically confined this fracturing to this floating region in the south? And what we find as well is if I was to plot them through time, running out of battery, they all begin here and they propagate this way, and that's what eventually leads to the calling event. So, just I'm going to flick back between these, but as I said, we find in high den that we get crevasse initiation here and then lateral propagation. Here and then lateral propagation, which is something that we don't think about. We think about it a lot in terms of Antarctic glaciers that these things spend a long time propagating laterally, but in terms of Greenland glaciers, we tend to think that they form at the surface and move downwards, right? But what we find in High Dem is that we get initiation over here and then we progress this direction. And this is just the horizontal eigenstress values at the surface of the glacier. And I just want to point out this maximum here, right? So this is a shear margin. Here, right? So, this is a shear margin here, and I think we're getting some combination of frontal and shear effects that are giving us a local stress maximum here, which seems to be where those fractures initiate. So, now what I'm going to show you is a bit messy, right? These white lines, what I've done is I've taken my 3D Elmer output and I've seeded some stream tracers at that maximum, and then I've set them to follow the direction which is orthogonal to the maximum. Which is orthogonal to the maximum eigenstress. So, what I'm saying here is that at any point on this line, Elmer says the maximum extensional stress is in this direction, and this direction, and this direction. And what we see, particularly to begin with, in this region here, is that we have a pretty encouraging match between the direction that Hydem says that fracture will propagate and the direction that Elmer would predict that they would propagate if we were to implement this. Then, the issue we have is that as we Then the issue we have is that as we move over here, these start to diverge. And I think the reason for that is in high dim, or in reality, as you begin to fracture at that region here, then obviously that changes the stress field. And that's an effect that Elmer isn't able to handle. And that's something that we presumably need something like damage mechanics to get a handle on. But this is something that I'm quite excited about: the prospect of thinking about blue screen. Thinking about blue screens, calving as a combination of local maxima, which allow fractures to initiate, and then fractures following that eigenstress-defined direction to give us calving events. And so, I was wondering if there's any sort of support for this from other work. This is Brunt ISHOF. This is work done by Jan and Hilmar. And they basically showed that if you take the stress field, stress or strain. At the stress or strain field? Stress field. Then indeed, these fractures initiate at local stress maxima and then tend to propagate along that direction. So we've got a couple more pictures from that paper. So you can see again the maximum stress direction orthogonal to that fracture propagation, right? So that's quite nice. Um, some support from Antarctica as well for that. For that. Yeah, there's another one. So, our results suggest that at least for this particular glacier, and I'm very aware of the fact that I've now been working on the same glacier for like seven years, eventually I will move on. But at least for Stowe Glacier, the hygiene seems to do a really nice job out of the box of predicting reasonable calving behaviour. It seems we don't have any pre-existing fractures or damage in high dam, and yet. Fractures or damage in high dam, and yet we get the calm events that we expect. So, at least at this scale for these kinds of glaciers, we think that maybe it's that instantaneous stress that's quite important. Although, obviously, in a continuum model, we need some way of capturing the variation in stress that happens as fractures propagate. So, yeah, this eigenstress direction, well, maximum and direction is quite promising, I think. Quite promising, I think. But I really have no idea how you would turn this into a Calving law for higher-order models. I'm going to finish up because I feel a bit guilty about having spent so much time talking about my own work. I've got some questions that I'd hope would generate a discussion, but Cunningham's Law says the best way to get the right answer is not to ask the question, but to give the wrong answer. So, with that in mind, this carving a progressive damage process, no. Can we account for the effect of fracture on? Account for the effect of fracture on stress using damage? Impossible. Can we represent discrete calving via rate laws? Never. And do we need Stokes models? Definitely. This was one of the motherhind models, it's just general. So when you do this, do you know for sure that those are zero that you have to pay? Jan is very interested in trying to work out what the rheology of a discrete element model is, and I think it's not immediately obvious or even well defined. Because we sort of agree that the stoic patients are sort of sensitive patients are solved. So when the limit when your hardware is going to zero, it's usually not incorrect. Normalize in what I told you? Elastic behavior, yes. Just in terms of stress forms. Yes, so as one question to that and one answer to that question, there's actually been, I think, a lot of major progress on continuum models for dense granular flows. I presented some of that work at AGV in case someone some of you were there. But those actually do recover the original Stokes rheology. And the change, the sort of additional component they have is Additional component they have is they want a parameter that diverges at the transition. And they've been shown to be consistent with laboratory experience of dental granular flow. So like simpler than this, obviously, just spheres in a ratio. And they've also been shown to collapse to the original model. I would appreciate that answer, but my question is really just the specific model and the specific forces that they use. Yeah. Because depending on which forces I... I'm not an expert in this, but I'd rather talk a little bit. Depending on what forces you use. Bit depending on what forces you ashrim, you feel what part of the house is done, you may not always achieve the same limit. So, in this particular case, in particular model, the particular setup you have, if you were to have this partnership called zero, you had good resources to test it, would you actually get an agreement between LMIs and your partner model solving some fairly simple problems? Yeah, so th th this is a purely elastic money. Well okay, sorry elac in the elastic case, right? In my case you have to deal with anything. So let's say it's elastic then, but in that particular case you get it's solving the same equations. I don't think this question makes a lot of sense at all. But we are solving stokes with the reality that uh sheer thing is and this is a purely elastic question. Yeah yeah how how how could it be the same? So the eigenstress plus direction, would that give you, do you think that would give you the same answer as von Mesis plus level set? Because the level set with Because the level set with the monmesis criterion will essentially ensure that your the level set of your terminus is always at whatever the stress criterion is that you've chosen. Yeah, I suspect that they would give you different results because I think they're quite different approaches in terms of, I guess, if von Mises with a level set is more of a rate law or trying to treat the process as continuous. Would you agree with that, Von Chief? Yeah, that's right, but. Yeah, that's right, but the retreat will stop whenever the stress is too small. So ideally, I would say that, yeah, they would match. I don't see why not. They sound like, I mean, they sound like after the capping was finished, you would have the same criteria that were met at the terminus. I guess the level set approach goes from the terminus directly. Approach goes from the terminus directly backwards upstream. Whereas, what I'm talking about here is: could, for example, if you had a region with low stress, very near the front, with a region of higher stress behind it, you could get round behind that. Whereas I don't know if that would be the... No, no, no, no, no, no, it wouldn't happen. Yeah. Okay, one last question. That sounds true, but somebody else asks. One last question. I was just thinking about your question saying that, well, how can I integrate this? Say that, well, how to maybe integrate this and more continuum models, or can we just use those models? And I don't know to which level you're familiar with, maybe the engineering community and maybe more solid mechanics and meaningful stuff where if you use a continuum model, you will always have some kind of virtual details by representing these kind of structures. But there are more there are models that are like basically you can use instead of using a nonlinear creology, you can use a squelastic plastic creology. I mean there it should somehow consistently derive that should carry out the slave restaurant into account with raised the proper place and then I mean extend it to maybe have flow deal fractured and things I suspect there is maybe some I mean in part of the community some work done that could be inspiring and yeah I think there's there's a obviously a lot of better work going on in other communities in glaciology. I think we've got a lot to learn. Last thought before
