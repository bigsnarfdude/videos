Work going on and to really meet many people whose papers I've read for some time now. So I'm at the University of Washington, and my lab studies the molecular circuits that control cell fate decision making in immune cells. So as you know, the immune system has this remarkable ability to protect the body against a wide variety of challenges, ranging from viruses to parasites to cancer. And a big reason why is because it can maintain a large collection of specialized cell types. Large collection of specialized cell types with different effective functions that can, in turn, adopt these specialized states during the course of an immune response. And so we want to understand how the immune cells make these decisions to ultimately uphold robust immune responses and ultimately learn principles that can help us engineer these cells for therapies. And so cells make decisions by responding to signals and turning on these networks. Signals and turning on these networks of lineage-specifying genes. Our approach to understanding how these signaling and gene regulatory networks work is conceptually quite simple. We want to measure the dynamics of these circuits in single cells, and we want to be able to controlling manipulate the activities also at the single cell level. And these types of quantitative single-cell measurements then provide us with a basis for quantitative descriptions of these immune circuits that we formalize using mathematical models. We formalize using mathematical models. In work that I started as a postdoc with Ellen Rothenberg and have continued for the last few years in my own lab, we discovered that the decision, okay, the decision for a multipotent progenitor to become a T cell, this T cell lineage commitment decision that occurs in the thymus is regulated by a stochastic epigenetic switch that acts on the locus of a key transcription factor, BCL11B. BC11B. Okay, so this is BC11B that's shown here, and its activation basically seals the cell's fate to become a T cell and nothing else. And what we found remarkably was that this switch, it requires inputs from upstream signals and transcription factors, right? You don't activate it if you don't have them. But even if you have them present, this switch flips with an inherently low probability. It has a very low probability of activation. That's mediated through a rate-limiting chromatin opening step. Okay. And what's remarkable about this stochastic step is that its time constant spans multiple days in cell generations. It can exceed the length scale of a cell division and has a time constant of multiple days. Now, I won't go into this work any further, but this work made us fascinated in the implications of these long time scale, inherently probabilistic regulations. Inherently probabilistic regulation for the functioning of the immune system. If this type of stochastic regulation was more prevalent, if this was a major mode through which immune cells made fate decisions, what would this mean for how the immune system responds and is constructed? And so, and for today, I'm going to tell you about work where we've been investigating these issues in the context of CD8 effector and memory differentiation. So, as you know, during the course of an acute infection, Of an acute infection, naive cells that haven't seen antigen before can differentiate into, can proliferate explosively, right? They can expand by about almost up to 10,000 fold to a peak of its response to give rise to either short-lived cells with potent effector memory capabilities, but these are the cells that work to clear the infection. But once the virus is cleared or when the threat is removed, these Removed, these cells decay in number to give rise to a population of long-lived memory cells, right, right here, that are increased in number and can persist in the body for long times, decades in humans to really confer protection against secondary challenge. And of course, this is the reason why we have protective immunity against a whole race, a whole range of diseases as a result of vaccination. As a result of vaccination or prior infection. Now, I want to just really highlight the robustness and the quantitative nature of the memory response. So, across many different individuals, pathogens, different contexts, the amount of memory that's formed, the number of memory cells that form is always about 5 to 10% of the total number of cells that are present during the acute phase of the response. Okay, so there's a very robust number of cells. There's a very robust number of cells that are ultimately formed in response to acute infection. But there's also a defined composition of this memory pool where there are different types of memory cells that are formed in different proportions that differ in their functional capabilities. For instance, you have central memory cells that can circulate and live for a very long time, can self-renew for a long time. They provide central surveillance. On the other end of the spectrum, you have things like resident memory cells that can. Like resident memory cells that can hang out in tissues and really kind of serve to raise the alarm when you have like infections that present in the periphery. And so we'd like to understand the quantitative basis of how memory is controlled, how the amount, the quality and quantity of memory is controlled. But in order to get at these questions, we really need to kind of get a strong handle on really, you know, the On really, you know, the pathways through which memories generate. We want to understand on a fundamental level first how and when memory cells form. And this has been a subject of like intense debate in the field for quite some time now. And even there's even though there's been a lot of work, it's still been unresolved as to how and exactly where memory cells form. So there's convincing evidence for one set of models where memory cells or memory precursors are said to form. Precursors are said to form early during the course of T-cell activation, maybe as early as the first cell division or the first few cell divisions, and that they're memory cells that are set aside, cells that are set aside to become memory cells that undergo little or no effective differentiation. Now, on the other end of the spectrum, there are models that argue that all cells enter an effective phase upon activation, but upon pathogen clearance, some of these effector cells have the ability to Have the ability to form memory and de-differentiate to form memory cells. And so these are two mutually or thought to be mutually exclusive or opposed models for memory cell formation. One of the reasons why it's been so hard to really elucidate what pathways are active is because most of the work to look at T cell memory has been done using these classical in vivo infection models, which really only Infection models, which really only allow us to measure the dynamics of these decisions in snapshot populations, right? So, for instance, you could take populations of cells in vivo at different time points in a mouse. You could see that there's prior to infection, there's a single naive cell. During the peak phase, there looks like a heterogeneous population and which resolves to some population that's enriched. It doesn't really tell us which pathways are active. And so, in order to really Active. And so, in order to really track these decisions at the single cell level and really elucidate which pathways are active, we developed a minimal system to mimic the conditions of an acute infection in a dish, where we take single naive cells, we incubate them in stimulatory conditions that mimic what's present during an acute infection. This includes strong stimulation of the TCR through antibodies, as well as the anti-CHITA As well as IL-2 and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12, as well as homeostatic cytokines such as IL-7 and IL-15 that are important for maintaining the memory pool after the clearance of an infection. And with this imaging, with this ex vivo system, we're now able, using imaging, to follow a single naive cell. So this is a single naive cell here over the course of many cell divisions in days as it proliferates. Days as it proliferates and differentiates. So you can see that all of these cells right here are stimulated on the plate and derived from the single naive cell. So we can follow cells over time, but do these cells actually differentiate into effective memory cells under these conditions? So we first addressed this question by performing single-cell transcriptomics on these cells that are cultured in vivo. So this is a collaboration that we are So this is a collaboration that we have with Jun Chao and Jaishen Duri, where we used a technique that involves metabolic labeling of RNA transcripts to basically distinguish between old and new transcripts using single cell RNA-seq. So we can do this analysis where we generate gene expression profiles for many single cells. We collapse them into a low-dimensional space using this UMAP plot here. And so this is a And so, this is data from cells that are collected day one, day two, and day four after activation. And what you see here is that even in this minimal system, right, with just cytokines and uniform stimulation, you already see this diversification of cells into effector and memory precursor fates. Okay, so you can see here there's an early cluster, and there's also two effector clusters that are high in the expression for effective genes. For effective genes such as Granzyme interfering gamma, as well as effective controlling transcription factors like TBX21. On the other hand, there's this additional branch here that has lower expression of these affected genes, but has higher expression of these genes associated with memory formation and self-renewal. And so this would include TCF7, the transcription factor that's important for a gene including. For a gene encoding and transcription factor, important for memory cell differentiation, as well as other memory regulators such as LEF1 and a cell which encodes for CD62L, a lymph node homing molecule. Now, if you just look at the structure of this plot here, it looks like you have cells that start early that then diverge into these effective memory states, relatively early in their trajectory, such that there's kind of like a trifurcation here into effective memory cells early. Into effective memory cells early. And so, because we have metabolically labeled these, we can use the differences between new and old transcripts to not only get at the states of the cells, but the trajectories of the cells along this space. And so using this analysis, we can then generate these vector field lines to tell us where these cells are going in this space, which suggests that these cells diverge from this early state and indeed, like, you know, and And bifurcate or trifurcate into effectual memory fates. And so this is suggestive of some kind of early diversification of this effectiveness memory lineage decision consistent with one class of these models. Of course, now this is static, even though this is time results using metabolic labeling of transcripts. And we ultimately want to understand the timing and the dynamics of these decisions. The timing and the dynamics of these decisions by following single cells because this type of measurements destroy the cell and cannot get at things like when these things happen, how these things happen at a clonal level, and ultimately don't allow us to just infer as much about mechanism. And so in order to get more insights into the dynamics of this divergence, we used quantitative lifestyle imaging to track effective memory differentiation dynamics at the single cell level. At the single cell level. And so we followed the transcription factor that I told you about, TCF1, that's important for memory formation. It's expressed in naive cells and continues to be expressed in memory cells, but is down-regulated during affected differentiation. And so this down-regulation event is really this pivotal moment where the cells move towards the affected lineages, turn on affected genes, and shut off their self-renewal potential. Potential. So we used a TCF7 YFP reporter mouse generated by Abhinash Mandulla that's non-perturbing. It consists of the YFP fluorescent protein that's inserted into the 3' and translated region of the gene. And if you just take a single naive, if you take single naive cells and you track YFP levels in single clones over time, this is what you get. So this is a single naive cell that's been activated on the plane. Single naive cell that's been activated on the plate with CD3 and CD20 antibodies. You see that the cells grow, they divide, and they'll divide multiple times to generate lots of offspring. And just from looking at this alone, you already notice that within this single clone, the regulation of TCF7 is heterogeneous, right? You see that this sub- This subclone has higher levels of YFP expression, whereas this subclone has lower levels of expression, which is suggesting that this decision to bifurcate into effective memory cells is occurring at an interclonal level, right? Within single clones, there's this decision that's heterogeneous. Now, we've done quantitative image analysis and movie analysis to really pinpoint when these decisions are happening. When these decisions are happening at the clonal lineage level. So, this is quite a lot of work, which I'm going to just like quickly describe. But we've used machine learning to identify where the cells are, track them over time, construct these lineage trees, as well as these activity plots showing YFP levels as a function of time. So, the key here is that by identifying changes in activity levels and the rates of synthesis of YFP, you can identify exactly when activation and silence. Exactly when activation and silencing happens. So, we did this by coupling these measurements to a hidden Markov model to really pinpoint exactly when these transitions to a low synthesis, low activity state is. And so if you do this, and you do this for individual clones, you get these plots where you see that cells, well, they grow, where they divide, and they initially upregulate TCF1 synthesis. Synthesis, but after TCF7 synthesis, but over time you could see that there's silencing of the TCF gene. So these are the effector decision points. But you also see that this silencing is heterogeneous within the clone. For instance, these two granddaughters, both, but not these two granddaughters, silence TCF1. Actually, this subclone, these like the fourth generation cells later also silence TCF1. Also, silence TCF1 is highly heterogeneous. Okay, so that's good. But now we wanted to know a little bit more about the mechanism that underlies TCF1 silencing and effective differentiation. Like what's underlying the decision? Now, there's been two models that have been proposed in the literature. One involves this idea that cells asymmetrically partition these cell fate determinants into one sister cell as opposed to the other. Onto one sister cell as opposed to the other. And this would cause kind of heterogeneous differentiation within a lineage. Now, another model that's also something that we've been thinking about through our earlier work with T cell development is a stochastic model where the cells, the two daughter cells make independent decisions, okay, whether or not to silence TCF7 and become effective cells. But because by Cells. But because by chance this could occur independently in two daughter cells, you would have a fraction of cells that are a fraction of daughter cells that are different in their ultimate fates. Okay. So in order to distinguish between these two hypotheses, we looked at the fraction, we computed for each pair of daughters, the fraction of cells that either turn off TCF1 concordantly, both turn off. Concordantly, both turning it off, or turning it on discordantly, with one on and one off. Okay. And then if you just calculate the probabilities of this happening by chance on this two-dimensional plot here, you can get this line here, which the data would fall on if stochastic silencing were taking place, right? If one daughter's decision to silence TCF-7 had no bearing on what the other daughter did, these are really independent decisions. And if you plot this. Decisions. And if you plot this data from hundreds of lineage trees that we've generated across different signaling conditions, you notice that all of this data really fall on this independent line, okay? With different probabilities, nonetheless, but still falling on this line, indicating that the decision to silence TCF1 occurs independently between sister cells, which is consistent with a stochastic mechanism. Now, you could ask, where is this stochasticity? Where is this stochasticity manifesting? Where is it? Now, one idea here is that this stochastic event could be something that's occurring in cis on the gene locus itself, as we had seen for our earlier studies with PCL11B and T cells, as opposed to one mechanism that could be occurring in trans, right, where both copies are silencing TCF1 at exactly the same time. Now, in order to distinguish between these two models, we took cells We took cells, we would predict, right, if cells have two copies of the reporter, okay, they would take longer to silence or to enter a TCF1 silent state as opposed to cells having just one copy of the reporter. And it's simply because it just takes longer for two events to happen if they occur stochastically. Now, that's indeed what we saw, right? So if you look at the fraction of cells that have silenced TCF. Fraction of cells that have silenced TCF1, that fraction is lower in cells that have two copies of the reporter from homozygous mice, reporter mice, versus this situation where there's a higher fraction of cells that have silenced TCF7. And this is from cells with one copy of the fluorescent reporter. Okay, so I've told you about, I've told you evidence that there's a fate decision that's being made early, right? Decision that's being made early, right, whether to go into effector memory lineages under these initial stimulatory conditions. Now, once the cells become effective cells, once they silence TCF1, are they done, right? Are they committed to become short-lived and can they ever form memory again? Is there any evidence for the other pathway of de-differentiation that I told you about? Now, to answer this question, we sorted effective cells that are low for TCF-1 expression and TCF1 expression. And these are the cells that are sorted to be low. And we asked: do they have the ability to reactivate TCF1 and de-differentiate into a memory state? Now, the answer is dependent on context. If the cells are continuing to be stimulated, if they experience TCR signals, inflammatory signals, they never turn TCF1 back on. But on the other hand, if these signals are taken away, as is the case, As is the case during the course of an acute infection during the contraction phase when the virus is being cleared, what you get is robust reactivation of TCF7. Okay, so you could see that activation happens and it correlates with the expression of memory markers such as CD62L. If you look at a single cell level, okay, so these are imaging experiments from one single TCF1 low effective cell that's been sorted. One low effective cell that's been sorted. Here, the cells are moving crazily. The effector cells are very, very motile. And that's why we have to confine them using a micro well that you see here, this black boundary. But you can see the cells are initially off of TCF1 expression. But over time, after many cell divisions, you see something happen. You'll see the reactivation of TCF7 in a sub-clone of these cells. Of these cells, and so again, right, similar to silencing, there is reactivation that, and the reactivation occurs heterogeneously, even within a single cell clone, right? As you can see from this connotation right here, you can see that it's different within clones and also between clones, right? There's certain clones that don't seem to activate TCF7, where there's some clones. Seven, where there's some clones that activate it, and the clones seem to differ in the timing at which they activate. This is all consistent with maybe the activation process occurring through a stochastic mechanism similar to the one that I described for silencing. So to summarize all of this work put together, we've found that the decision to whether or not to differentiate into a vector cell or to maintain TCF1 expression and And maintain memory potential. This decision is made early. It can be made as early as the first or second cell division. It's made stochastically through an epigenetic switch that silences TCF1. And so this would be consistent with the first class of models that I told you about, that TCF, that the decision-making is made early. But on the other hand, when signals are withdrawn, these TCF1 effective cells, at least some of them, have the ability to stochastically reactivate TCF1 expression and form. One expression and form memory and form memory cells. Okay. And now these two findings put together then implicate signals, the duration and strength of signals in the choice of pathways that cells take to form memory. So short stimulatory durations would favor memory formation through this early divergence pathway. You stimulate, they proliferate, they keep TCF1 on and they just. They keep TCF1 on and they just keep it on for the, you know, for the rest of their life, right? Even after the infection is cleared. Longer durations, on the other hand, would then cause TCF1 to silence for cells to differentiate into affected cells. But upon withdrawal of signals, then these cells would then, at least some of them, would then reactivate. So longer signal stimulations would favor memory formation through de-differentiation. Okay, so. Okay, so both pathways, essentially, we find evidence that both pathways might be active during the course of a response. Now, one question you might have is: why is there this flexibility in the choice of pathway for memory cell differentiation? It can form through one pathway, the other pathway, and different developmental histories can give rise to essentially the same endpoint. Now, one possibility. Right. Now, one possibility, and this is something that we're testing right now, is that choice in pathways taken might allow for functional diversity in the memory cell compartment, right? As cells form memory through these different pathways, they experience different stimuli signals that would modify their cellular states in different ways. And so, one possibility here is that cells that, for instance, enter an effective space might be more primed for faster effective function or might be more. Faster effective function, or might be more prone to going into tissues, and as a result, generate these different types of memory cells compared to those that form through this kind of early divergence. Now, taking this back to this question of like why we have epigenetic control, I'm just going to just really highlight maybe epigenetic control is favorable in the immune system because immune cells don't have kind of positional information, much like cells do in the embryo. Much like cells do in the embryo, but yet still have to diversify in their fates. And this epigenetic, this stochastic mechanism for cell phate diversification may allow for functional specialization without the information of where they are in the tissue or in the organism. So let me just end there by saying that most of this work was done by Kathleen Abedee, a very talented graduate student, and we've been collaborating with Jun Chow, Jaishanderi, and Abhinash Bandullah on these studies. Thank you for your time. On these studies. Thank you for your time. Okay, so maybe let's start with Leila. We cannot hear you. It's good now. You can hear me? You can hear me? Yeah, yes. Great talk. Thanks. Very interesting data. I have two questions. One is a technical question. When we look at your movie with the YFP on the TC7 importer, it looks like it's dilute with the division too. So I was wondering if you checked that. And maybe if you model, you also take into account the half-life of the protein and the division timing. Yeah, that's a great question. The YFP report is stable. Great question. The YFP report is stable, and it only gets diluted when the cells divide. And for that reason, when we do our hidden Markov modeling, we don't take the levels to be commensurate with activity. We take the rate of change. So we measure the increase in the total levels, the derivative, the time derivative of YFP as a measure of promoter activity and to synthesis rates. You do have to define a threshold or not, because if you look at your fax profile, Because if you look at your fax profile, it's very continuous, right? The expression of the way you can. Yes, that's right. Yeah. Because they would be continuous because they have different numbers of cell divisions, something that we can't disentangle just by facts alone. Okay, good that you take that into account. My last question is more general, is more about. So now, as you said, like there is like early generation of memory or late and data or going in both direction, but it could be. But it could be, as you say, stochastic and it could occur also all along the division, right? And it could also change with a certain probability that maybe with some signal it's more probable at the beginning and with others later on. Did you test this type of models? You mean mathematical models? Yeah. Yeah, we're doing that right now. Yeah. And yeah, we're curious to know how the fractions of We're curious to know how the fractions of memory cells, what proportion of memory cells are formed through different pathways under different stimulatory influences, you know, under yeah, under different conditions. Thanks. Maybe Paul? Paul, Thomas? Sure. This was a great talk. I had a couple of questions. So if you want to come to us, yeah. So, one question. So, one question was: Do you know what the actual epigenetic switch is? Is it histone-mediated or is it DNA methylation? Because I've seen both proposed for TCF methylation. Yeah, we're getting into this. We don't, yeah, we're getting into this right now. We don't know yet. Yeah. And then the other question is, you know, there's on the in the T-cell world, there's a lot of focus on terminal differentiation and exhaustion. Differentiation and exhaustion, and the inability to turn TCF back on. And I was curious if you kept your cells under stimulating conditions for longer periods of time. Do you see a lower rate of reversion to the TCF positive state? Yeah, no, that's a great question. And we're doing this right now as well. We just, there's so many things that we need to do. But we do know that if we culture cells for a few days longer, they actually turn on additional sets of genes associated with exhaustion. So things could absolutely change. No, it's beautiful. Change. Yeah, it's a beautiful system. I liked it a lot. So maybe, Anita, now. Thanks. It was a great talk. Please excuse my ignorance. I'm really not familiar. But do you have defined proportions or does the system produce defined proportions between the memory and the effector cells? Yes, we are also doing. Yeah, we would also like to find out. Yeah, we would also like to find out. Yeah, I think the hypothesis maybe my thinking is completely wrong, but if it's defined proportions, then that would argue against the stochastic mechanism. And also, if you have similar proportions at the beginning, but also at the end when they de-differentiate, then that would argue more for a different type or maybe population-based mechanism if that is possible. Population-based mechanism, if that is possible in the system, I don't know. No, no, I think, well, actually, the stochastic mechanism isn't at odds with having, you know, control for one way or the other in terms of like generating defined proportions of cells, right? Because the idea here is that the stochastic mechanism, right, by generating heterogeneity over time scales spanning multiple cell divisions, right, could give rise to defined fractions of. find fractions of cells of different types. So I mean the probabilities have to be tuned. So the key that the probabilities have to be tuned and this is indeed what we see. The probabilities are tunable by TCR signaling. They're an analog function of like inflammatory cytokine levels. So to say it's stochastic doesn't mean it's not controllable. But one more question. So does the, for example, because you So does the, for example, because you showed with the single cell, it occurs after several cell divisions. And I mean, imagine you have many repetitions. So does it always occur at a specific size of the population, maybe when you see the initial differentiation events? It occurs after we see it distributed across the first four cell divisions. So if you just do like a look at the distribution of division times or division generations, they are, you have some that are. Generations, they are, you have some that silence, you know, first, second, third, fourth cell division. So it doesn't look like it's like a certain, and there's no like peak, right? So it's not as if like there's a, there's, there's a preponderance for a certain, we don't think there's a timer, right, at this point that says divide, you know, differentiate after three cell divisions, just because we see it so widely distributed. Okay, thanks. So maybe very quick question, Alexander, for one minute. Is it possible? Uh, I'm not sure my question is. I'm not sure my question is going to be very short because it's basically the similar to actually great talk, really wonderful. But it's similar to Aneta's concern about the stochastic nature of this decision, which is it's stochastic, but there is also clearly epigenetic stability, right? So, because once you've made a decision, it's inherited, absolutely, right? And so, that also means. Right, and so that also means that cells that haven't made the decision to turn on TCF, they are TCF negative, they also have to be stable at some point, right? So there's only a window in which there's stochasticity. And that, I think, might only then you can have to find proportions. Because otherwise, if this permissive, if this phase of being stochastic can last for the entire time, then you just will accumulate more. Entire time, then you just will accumulate more and more TCF positive cells. Yeah. So, so you're asking, um, like, how do you reconcile it being stochastic with it being heritable over cell division? Right. Is that the question? So, the way we're thinking about it is that we think that the chromatin is inherently in a stable state, right? It's held in a closed conformation from, this is kind of a cartoon to kind of describe our thinking, but it's held in a. To kind of describe our thinking, but it's held in a close confirmation that is heritable across cell division, right? You have these histone marks that are rewritten after cell division, after DNA replication. The locus closes back on itself. It has some stability, but what we're measuring here is a transition to an active state that is occurring with a very high activation energy barrier. So this is then, I mean, because it's an activation energy barrier, it's inherently a stochastic process. But even Process. But even cell division cannot like push the cells across the barrier, is the key, right? That, but transcription factors and signals can do that, but then the probability is so low that the time constants exceed that of cell division. So we think those two properties are not mutually exclusive. Right. It sounds like it would be a good topic maybe for tomorrow's discussion where we talk about signaling. So, and I suggest for the sake of time we should move on. And thank you a lot, Quay. Thank you a lot, Quay, and maybe Leila, it's your turn now.
