Make my Zoom window smaller. Okay, so I'm going to talk a little bit today about what I've been doing the past four years, and it's a compile of a lot of studies that ends in disease modeling completeness and other stories. So, I'm going to talk a little bit about network science, network medicine. Network science, network medicine, times of pandemics. How can non-coding RNAs improve what we know about network medicine and some conclusions and perspectives on the topic? So I don't have to discuss this a lot because a lot of people already know about network science, but I'm going to give a little basic so everybody's on the same ground. So we know that everybody's, everything is connected. So if we think about So, if we think about people in a party, people that are interacting with one another, they can be connected through some kind of interaction that we may say, can be sharing a drink, can be sharing a dance, can be sharing a conversation. We can also think about connection under social media. So, who is sharing someone else's content, who is following who, who is friends with someone else. But we can also leverage the same. Can also leverage the same idea to biology. So, in biology, most of the times we are interested in genes being connected with another. And this connection can be given through gene products such as proteins binding physically to another protein, or how one gene is regulating another one, how one gene is being co-expressed with another one. Expressed with another one. So that can have multiple ideas depending on what we are interested in. So in network medicine, we mostly want to understand how those interactions among those entities, they can be genes, they can be proteins, they can be non-coding RNAs, they can be any biological thing, can affect an outcome. And this outcome is often a disease or a phenotype of interest. So, how can So, how can genes that they are differentially co-expressed be affecting a phenotype? How proteins are affecting a particular phenotype? How drug targets can affect patients' response to certain medications? And we can also use network medicine to identify drugs as a potential treatment for emerging diseases, as we're going to see later on. So the first The first project that I want to show here is Network Medicine in Times of Pandemics, where we basically use network medicine to try to identify some drugs to treat COVID. But this goes a little bit further than just trying to identify drugs. We also try to identify diseases that they could be as similar as possible to COVID. So, when COVID hit in 2019, 2020, we wanted 2020, we wanted and we needed some rapid deployment of effective treatments or interventions so we could go out and have our lives back again. So the traditional approach where we have this iterative development of drugs, we have some experimental testing, clinical validation, approval of new drugs. We're not feasible, mainly because this whole development takes about 10 years. Takes about 10 years. So we could rely on drug repurposing to identify some approved drugs, so FDA-approved drugs, to treat COVID. So network medicine in the past has developed a series of computational tools that could allow us to identify those opportunities. And that's what we started doing. So we deployed those tools to identify potential treatment. To identify potential treatments for COVID. So, what drug repurposing actually means is that we are using an existing drug to treat another disease that's not what was meant to. So, one of the most known examples is sildenophil that was first approved to treat coronary artery disease, CAD, hypertension, gene pectoris. However, it had some It had some collateral effects, side effects, and was repurposed to other diseases, right? So, Sudenophil is Viagra. And in the clinical trials, they started having some, the males subjects, they started having an unexpected erection. And therefore, the drug was pre-purposed to be used for erectile dysfunction. Child dysfunction. And in the same idea, we can use many other drugs to treat other diseases that they actually are having a side effect. From the other perspective, we can also try to identify what other diseases we can have under the light of having a host pathogene interaction. So, what we have here is a small network where we have viral programs. Where we have viral proteins that they are in blue. And those proteins, they are targeting some host proteins that they are the viral targets in green. And from that, we can try to pinpoint which diseases can be existing under this host pathogen indirect. This host pathogene interactions. So, we have a case here in EBV where we had three proteins from EBV that they hijacked some of the human proteins. They are named here as viral targets. And those targets, they also going to interact with other human proteins. Those are named host proteins. But we also have to remember that are also increasing the chances of us having other diseases such as some of these parasinomas and we try to put the same idea of i think that my connection can you hear me it's okay again you It's okay again. Yeah, we lost you for only a few seconds. So I think we can still understand what's going on. Okay, sorry. So from then we can, we wanted to try to do the same thing with COVID. So the idea was we have the human interaction, which was a PPI based. We also had the source targets, and we had. Targets, and we had some drugs and their targets. We wanted first to identify some drug-repurposing predictions, and we also did some experimental screening and validation of those drugs. So the PPI that I haven't discussed much about is basically a map of protein. Project interactions. So, those interactions depend on the disease that you're studying, they depend on the tissue that you're studying, they depend on a lot of impulse that the cell is having at the moment. However, we can assume that the PPI is stable under a certain point, and that's what we use. And that's what we use. So it's based on physical interactions between those proteins that are binding into one another. And one thing that is interesting for us to think here is that proteins, they are going to be localized or they're going to bind to one another depending on the biological process that they have, right? So those proteins, they're going to bind to one another depending on what is Depending on what are their functions in the cell. And that leads us to what is known by disease modules. So a disease module basically is a series of proteins that they are co-localized in this network, and they are associated with a particular disease. So here we have proteins that they are associated with asthma, and we see Associated with asthma. And we see that when we dim the lights of the PPI, they are the pink dots, right? And they are clothings in the outer space. And I'm going to discuss more about this in the second part of the presentation. But up to now, we always thought that the reason why those Those dots, so those proteins, they were so far away was because the PPI was heavily incomplete. And we were always trying to find new interactions inside the PPI. Now we know that's not just that. We have other interactions that are not accounted here. So, as I mentioned, so we have disease modules that they are highly specific in the same network neighborhood. And when we look into the Look into the genes that they are associated with COVID, they are also in the same neighborhood. And we can also test if this module is just by chance, and we actually see that it's not. So the module is also statistically significant. And we can also see that this module is consistent across multiple tissues. So we looked first into the lungs to see whether. To see whether this disease module would remain in the lungs or was just a spurious correlation or something like this, and actually, we found that the disease module was much stronger in the lungs than in the overall PPI. So, we decided to look into the same result over other tissues. And what we found was that the brain and the lungs and many immune systems are not available. And many immune cells, they were heavily affected by COVID. And later on, we actually had the results from COVID, as we all know, those are parts of our body that are heavily affected by the disease. So I haven't mentioned priorly, but there is another method. So when we have disease modules, diseases are going to, so the proteins of a disease, they're going to be close by to each other. Close by to each other, and those are forming the disease modules. But we have diseases when they are very similar to one another, they are also going to be living in a very close neighborhood in the network. And that is a highly predictive of comorbidity. So we have autoimmune disease, they are all in the same neighborhood. We have brain disease, they are also in similar neighborhoods. So we also know that diseases that they are very similar to. That they are very similar to one another. They can be treated by similar drugs. And the first thing we wanted to say was: the COVID has any disease very close that we can basically just repurpose the drugs that are being used for that disease. And unfortunately, or fortunately, right, there are no other diseases that they were very close, but we found that That neurological diseases could potentially turn to be a comorbidity, similar to cancers and other immune system diseases. So that meant that we definitely needed to look into different drug repurposing methodologies. So what we did was trying three different methods that they are very well known in the network medicine community. network medicine community. One of them is proximity, the second one is diffusion, and the third one is prioritization, AI prioritization. I'm going to discuss a little bit each one of them. So proximity, what we want to see is what are the drugs, so the targets from a particular drug that are as close as possible to the targets of the disease. And we basically calculate the average shortest path between them. Between them. And that's what we use as the measure that is known as proximity. We had three different pipelines for this one: one that consider all targets, another one that consider only enzymes, and a third one that consider only genes that they were differentially expressed under the presence of the drug. In the network diffusion, what we have is a random walk where we start from the drug target and we walk towards. And we walk towards the disease module, and we calculate the probability of the drug treating that disease module. And for that, there are different distances that we can use. And that gave birth to five different pipelines that they are all based on those three distances. And later, we had the AI-based one where we have different layers of information. One is One is trucks, viral targets, and the human proteins. And one thing that I wanted to mention here is that all three pipelines that we are using here, they are using exactly the same data. So none of the methods that we are using are going to be using are having any kind of difference on the data. All of them are using exactly the same thing. So we can compare the method as. Compare the method as the method itself and not depending on any other data or any other circumstance that we have. So, what we see, so each one of those methodologies, they provide a ranked list of which are the drugs that would be the best. And we see that all the diffusion methods, they are going to cluster among themselves, the AI methods, the same thing, and the proximity base, the same thing. Based the same thing, apart from P3, that is based on differential expression instead of being only on drug target. And what we see is that those methods, they are providing us complementary information, right? So we decided to test whether any of those methods would be better than any other. And what we find is that AI is the best one. Is the best one. What we are using here as an outcome is drugs that they were being tested at the time by clinicians in the clinical trials. What we see here is that AI was doing the best from the three methodologies by itself with 87 in the accuracy. And then the next one was proximity. But when we combine all of them, we had a better accuracy than any of the methods by the Any of the methods by themselves, showing again that they were providing complementary information. So, what we did next was to experimentally validate 900 drugs. So, we plated human cells, we infected them with COVID, and then we gave each one of the wells a drug. And we did this for six or seven. Six or seven different doses. And we built a machine learning tool that would provide us different categories. So the drug could be a strong drug, a weak drug, a cytotoxic, or no effect. A strong drug basically kills the virus very fast. A weak drug requires less drug dose to kill the virus. Those to kill the virus. A cytotox is going to kill the cells and not the virus, and no effect, everybody leaves. And the results we had when we compared the accuracy here were very similar to the one I presented previously against Clinical. We decided to go one step further and test 6,000 drugs in vitro using the same protocol as I just presented. Presented. And from those results, we find that 172 drugs were strong and 217, they were weakly active. And we wanted to see whether there was some preferences from the targets. Were the targets the same or not? And we actually found when we look into the targets and the strength of the activity, we found two big modules. We found two big modules with 61 drugs and 120 targets, and the other one with 43 drugs and 66 targets. And we see that those targets, they are somehow similar to one another, like the structure of the proteins, they were similar. And we did a similar analysis using one drug target analysis using only the structures, and we found pairs of targets showing that there was some kind. Showing that there was some kind of similarity across the targets, but not the targets were not the same. They were just similar to one another. So we re-screened the top drugs that we found in other cell lines. And we found a couple of drugs that they were strong again in those different cell lines. And we re-screened that in human, sorry, in a mouse model. In a mouse model. And we found one drug that was much stronger than any other drug that we had. So I want to take some minutes for us to discuss how non-coding RNAs can improve network medicine. So, two years ago, we were working on a project that we wanted to understand what was the impact of the human genome project and what we know. Genome Project and what we know nowadays in genomics and genetics and everything in this universe. And one thing that was very interesting for us was we discovered a lot of protein-coding genes up to a certain until almost the end of the human genome project. And towards the end, we started discovering more and more non-coding RNAs. And there was like And there was like this major explosion of knowledge that we have now on non-coding RNAs, and we never included it in any of the network medicine projects. So we started by including non-coding RNA-mediated interactions as it was this PPI, because we don't have protein-protein interactions anymore. We have all kinds of interactions, not. And one thing that was very Not. And one thing that was very striking to us is that even though we have very few microRNAs, they are responsible for more interactions than protein-protein interactions by itself. And we also see many other interactions between long-known coding RNAs and transcription factors, as we expect, or microRNAs and pseudogenes, and so on and so forth. So we have like this big network. So, we have like this big network where we now tried mapping almost all interactions that are experimentally validated. And we have evidence for those real interactions, right? And they are not context-specific. So, what we had priorly only using the PPI was almost 94% of the protein coding genes, and we can see. And we can see that we still have more or less the same thing when we include the non-coding interactions. But we are able to include almost 90% of the microRNAs interaction, microRNAs that are known by their interactions. We still need to learn a lot from long-known coding RNAs, but that already That already brings them to the table that they were not included priorly. So, we also know that non-coding RNAs are highly associated with different diseases. And I have a couple of them here, it's not exhaustive list. What we see is that asthma, arthritis, lupus, those are diseases that they have plenty of microRNAs associated to them, and they were. And they were always neglected when we looked at those diseases under the network medicine, only looking into the PPI lens. And we also know that non-coding RNAs, they are highly associated with gene regulation. So that could also help us identify plenty of disease mechanisms that they are not well understood. So when we look first into the RA disease module, we can see here that a disease module already exists. Disease module already exists. So it's not highly connected, right? So we can see that the part that is connected is the one that I'm surrounding here, and we still have a lot of single tones here. When we start including the non-coding interactions, we can see that plenty of those genes, they start being put inside this network, meaning that now we have a much more complete network disease module. Disease module. However, when we look into preeclempsia, this result is much more stunning. So we have only three, like we cannot even call those components here. So three clusters of genes. When we include the non-coding interactions, we now have a disease module. We can see that those genes, they are connected. We can identify, we can study this disease now. Can study this disease now from the lens of network medicine? However, we also have a problem now, right? So the network increases in size. So the number of genes that we're going to have associated with a particular disease are also going to increase. The largest connected component, so the size of the disease module is also going to increase. But we see that the correlation between those numbers are now almost one. So we are. Now, almost one. So, we are being able to collect almost all the genes inside the LCC, which is a big progress in the area. However, we can also correct this measure using the relative LCC, which is basically the number of the LCC divided by the number of disease genes that you have in the network. So, that gave us the measure that is the completeness. Um, measure that is the completeness of this disease module. Um, so when we look into RA, that's the first one that I showed you guys. So we have an RLCC of 62%, and now we are able to have 88% of the genes inside this disease module. When we look into preeclempsia, that number was about 6%, and now it's 81. So now we can definitely study this disease under the lens of network medicine. Disease under the lens of network medicine. When we look into Crohn's disease, then we are in a gray area here because we have 45% of the disease module is defined and it's a significant disease module. But some people discuss that, like, if you don't have at least 50% of your disease module complete, you have a heavily incomplete disease module. And we can jump now to a 77%, which is a much Which is a much better disease model that you can study and understand much better of the disease mechanism. So, just to show that I was not cherry-picking and just selecting a couple of diseases, if we do this for about 800 diseases, we are now able to identify the majority of them for the PPI and the non-coding interaction, right? But the PPI, the PPI and NCI alone. Alone are able to identify 132 new disease modules that we could not identify previously. And we see that the increase of the disease module in size is pretty significant for most of the diseases. We also can study now the disease comorbidity that I showed previously in a much more More specifically. So, when we look into the PPI alone and we look into the diseases that they are comorbid with RAS or rheumatoid arthritis, we only find Crohn's disease. When we go to the PPI and non-coding universe, we are able to identify many more diseases, and most of them have been described in the literature. Been described in the literature. So we know that RA has plenty of autoimmune comorbidity diseases, such as UC, inflammatory bowel disease. It's also associated with plenty of inflammations, multiple sclerosis, and so on, as cancers. And we were able to identify this cancer module as well. Um, and we did this for many other diseases, and we actually see that the relative risk also increases. So, we have a correlation between the PPI and NCI and the correlation between the relative risk. And we are also able to identify much better and more structured disease clusters in the PPI and MCI using this disease-disease similarity. So, I want to conclude here talking that we know now that network medicine can enable the prioritization of drugs for treating also emerging diseases. The same pipeline can be used for neglected and tropical diseases. The pipeline obviously can be improved. We can include different kinds of omics. We can include novel data. We can also include other kinds of data. We can create different kinds of layers. We can create different kinds of layers. The experimental screening that we did also provided strong evidence towards the network medicine, the target identification, where targets are located. The target similarity also shows and suggests that we have active compounds that have preference for certain protein classes and protein domains. We, with the non-coding RNA, With the non-coding RNA project, we can also revolutionize network medicine and medicine as we know. Including non-coding RNA-mediated interactions, we were able to identify much better and more strong disease modules, disease mechanisms, and we are able to elucidate different kinds of disease progression that we are not able to do only using protein-protein interactions. And if we talk about the future, we know that microRNA. About the future, we know that microRNAs have been tested as drugs to treat many diseases with promising results. So, including them in the PPI can definitely lead to better treatments and better precision medicine. And I'd like to thank the COVID-19 team, and mainly my PI, Lazlo Barabashi, who has helped us and guided this beautiful project on COVID. And also, thank my And also, thank my collaborators. I'm open to questions and happy to discuss with you. Thank you so much. Thank you. That was a great talk. We had many comments here and previous talks dealing with completeness and incompleteness. So, this is a good closing also for us. Questions from the audience? I'm sure there will be questions. Okay, so Andrew McDonough here. Hi, thank you. I guess two questions. First, are you able to reveal what the compound was you carried forward to human testing or animal testing COVID? That was a Batoclaws. So I don't know. Yeah, I don't know much about the drug. Much about the drug. I know that worked really well. In the paper, we did a lot of study to identify the mechanism of the drug. And one thing that was very interesting is that we tested all the pathways that they were described the drug to work. None of the pathways that they described as how this drug works was the reason why the drug work to treat COVID. So they might have probably. So they might have probably there is other pathways involved that they are not well described. Second question was: I think I got a little bit lost about where some of the edges were coming from in the graphs. For instance, like you had the graph of different genes that were involved with RA. What determined if you were drawing an edge between an RA gene here or not? Okay, so they are interacting, so they have to. In they are interacting, so they have to have a physical interaction between the protein as translated. They've been described to have an interaction in a database. Which databases do you use to determine this? 21 databases that they provide experimental validation. I can share the paper and then I can share the name of the there are 21 databases. I see. In other cases, is this like the In other cases, is this like generally the if you have an edge between a vertex and one of these graphs, it's because the proteins were showed to interact in a database? Or are there other criteria that determine if you have an edge in some of the other graphs that you showed? All the protein are gene-related, whether there is experimental validation that there is a real interaction. Validation that there is a real interphysical binding between them and here, but in the literature, there are different kinds of edges that people use. So you can also use prediction between proteins. I particularly don't like using the predictions. I particularly like using the experimental validated interactions. So we don't include any kind of predictions here. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. I thank you. You're welcome. Other questions? Okay, I think we don't have. Let me just quickly check the audience in Zoom, but I think we are good. No, there are no questions in Zoom. So thank you very much again, and thanks for joining today's session. I know you were there all the time. Thank you. Thank you so much. We are going to have a coffee break here, so I'm sorry you cannot join.
