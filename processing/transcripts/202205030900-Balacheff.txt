Florent Balachov. The title is Santa Lou Point on the Holmes-Thompson boundary area and joint work with Gil Solanes. And I can't read this name. So please start. Okay, thank you very much for the presentation and to the organizer for the invitation. For the invitation. So, okay, I will start by explaining some remarkable connections that have been made recently between syntactic geometry, convex geometry, and electric geometry. So, I'm coming from geometric geometry side, and then I get interested in some active geometry and convex geometry. So, let me remind some track conjecture and convex geometry. Soundtrack conjecture and convey geometry, which is called the Malar conjecture. Okay, so you take a convex body K in Rn. So this is a convex body containing in its interior the origin. Okay, so containing So the conjecture is that the volume product. So you take the Ausdorff module of your convex body and then you multiply by You multiply by the Ausgraph measure of the polar body, which is defined okay. This is the parametrization of the hyperplanes which are outside your convex body using the scalar product. And then this bottom product is bigger than or equal to this constant, depending on the dimension. Okay, so you have equality in this. have equality in this uh so the volume product of the sample 'relize this bound and if k is further assumed to be symmetric then you can improve your bound your label web to that one One which is realized by the volume product of the aperture queue, for instance. So this is a very nice conjecture, I think, because intuitively this is easy to get a feeling of why this is true. If you have a convex body k then the hyperplanes which are not cutting your hyper Cutting your hyper your convex body are smaller when the convex body is bigger, and then when you measure them in this manner, then you can feel that the bigger is k, the lower is the polar body of k. So this conjecture was proved by Malor in dimension two. I guess this is in 39. And then there is this famous result by Bergamil Mann in 1987. And what they proved is that you almost have this band up to some constant depending. Depending in that way of the dimension, so you have this is bigger to Cm. Let's say for the symmetric case, for instance, for n to the n factorial. Okay, so this is C to the power n, where say is a universal constant, positive constant, times the volume product, let's say, of the. Say of the beta cube of dimension n. So I write this like this: the geo. Okay. And this is when k is symmetric. And they have also the same result for when k is not symmetric, but I write that way. Okay. Then in 2008, Kuperberg improved this theorem and he proved the following. He proved that the volume product is strictly bigger than p to the power n over factorial n. So you can see here is a pi, here is a 4. So this lower bounding. This lower bandage is really good, I think. Okay. And then the last thing I want to tell about this conjecture is that it was recently proved by Irier and Shibratar. So the paper was really recently published in dimension. In dimension tree in the signature case. Okay, so there is a nice connection of this result with symplectic geometry. So I will recall the result I have in my mind. I have in my mind. And the result is the following. So this is a result by Arstein, Avidan, Karacev, and Oskover. Which is also pretty recent. Okay, so they proved the following: they proved that the Vitabos conjectures, which I shall recall in a few seconds, for some capacities, which is the Hoffen Zender capacities, imply the symmetric manner conjecture. The symmetric Manner conjecture. So, this is not a relation which is easy at all. And so, the Wittabos conjecture is the following, is that if you take a convex body, which is symmetric, in the Euclidean, well, in the R2N, the vector space of dimension. Of dimension 2n underwed with the standard symplectic form to form. Then you have the volume divided by this capacity. So here the capacity of a convex body, there is various ways to define it, but this is, in my mind, the last action of a periodic orbit. Of a periodic orbit of the boundary underwed with the restriction of the standard one form, which is a contact form. Okay, so this is a contact term. You have a rib flow, and then you can look to reb orbits, and then you take a periodic orbit, and you can compute the action, and then you have the. Compute the action, and then you have this invariant. Okay, and then you have this inequality that the volume over this capacity to the power n for your convex body k is minimized by the ball. Okay, so at first sight, it doesn't look like a volume product, and then you have to work to prove that feedable conjecture. So, this conjecture implies symmetric matters conjecture. Maddox conjecture. Okay, I will not explain all it implies. It's just to explain some connection that there is between symplectic geometry and convex geometry. And then when you see this and you know some historic geometry, you can feel that this is like a historic type inequality. So let me explain another connection. Another connection you have between Manel's conjecture and metric geometry. So, for this, I will recall some basic facts about historic geometry. So, I take a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension M, which I call M, and I will. M and I will suppose that the fundamental group is not zero. Then you can define what is called the systole or the homotopical systole. So you take the infimum of the length of a closed curve which is not contractible. So you can easily prove that this infimum is indeed a minimum. This infimum is indeed a minimum and it is realized by a closed geodesic which is not contractible. So, in particular, this is bigger than those infimum of the lengths of curves which are closed geodesic. So, sometimes this is called this, this quantity is called the system, and this one is the homotopical system. And here you can see the parallel that there is with the last with the capacity of a Franzander, because you have the last action of a flow. And then here, of course, this is also the last, like the last action of the geodesic flow. Okay. So Grid theorem by Romov characterize the manifold for which you have an inequality between the volume and the system of a remaining manifold. So it goes like this: you have if m is essential, then the following ratio. So you take the And the following ratio, so you take the volume and divide by the system to the power n. So you can see here the relation between the rules, at least at some intuitive level, is bigger than or equal to some universal constant, only depending on the dimension. So it says that if the system is not, the system is where the manifold, the Riemannian manifold is the more. Manifold. The Riemannian manifold is more contracted. Okay, so if the length is not too small, then you can't shrink your manifold too much. And then the volume has to be at least something universal. So the condition to be essential, I will not explain what it is, but let me just explain that it includes, for example, the Projective Real Project. The projective real projective space of any dimension, the term of any dimension. And another example is the orientable surface of genus G, or not orientable in fact, and more generally, any closed hyperbolic manifold. Okay, so one time you have this theorem, you can ask, of course, the following question. Can ask, of course, the following question: Is what is the optimal constant? So, here you have some lower bound, but you will have what is the best Riemannian metric given a closed manifold. What is the optimal strength? And for the real projective spaces, we have a good candidate, which is a round metric. Is the round metric? So this is what we call Pooh's conjecture. So I don't think that Pooh actually formalized this conjecture, but it's like it appears naturally because he proved the following in dimension two. So for any Riemannian metric on RPN, then the volume. Then the volume over the systole to the power n is minimized for the lone metric. Okay. This conjecture is a conjecture to be also true when you replace the Riemannian metric G. The Riemannian metric G by Finsler metric, Finsler reversible metric. I'm conjectured to be true for Finclosible matrix. Okay, and it has been proved in dimension to By Fungpu himself for Riemannian metrics and by Ivanov for Fincia metrics. Okay. Okay, so together with Juan Carlos, Margaret Faiba, and Krum Sanev, we make the following connection between Manasko. Connection between Manor's conjecture and this conjecture, Pooh's conjecture in the Finsler case. So the Finslerian Pooh's conjecture implied the symmetric manner of conjecture. Okay, so it's like Okay, so it's like if you had the Malier's conjecture, and above you have in the symplectic geometry, the Vitables conjecture, and then in the metric geometry or systerer geometry, you have the pus conjecture. Okay, and here the proof is some kind of easy because you take your convex key, okay, which is assumed to be symmetric inherent. Inherent, and then you consider it as a closed ball or closed set, where at each point you have a Finzer metric which is given by the convex himself. I mean that the convex K is the unit ball in the tangent space in any point of K. And then you consider the action on the boundary. Corresponding to the antipodal application, and if you take the question by this action on the boundary, then you get a projective space with a Finsler metric. And it's not easy to see that the volume, the Arm-Thompson volume of this Finsler projective space is actually the volume product of K and that the system. Of k and that the system is equal to four. Okay, and so if you have the whose conjecture, then it will apply imply the correct lower bound conjecture in Males conjecture. Okay, so I get interested into this set of conjecture to this historic geometry. And if you look at If you look at what was studied, Urban Mara's conjecture, the following was studied by Santaro. Sorry. So actually, Santaro studied all varies the volume product of a convex scale. Of a convex scale when you move it under translation. Okay, so of course, because you have that the volume product of the translated convex satisfies this inequality. Satisfy this equality. What you should really study is this quantity. Okay, so here X is some point in the interior of your convex body, and then you translate it, and then you study how this volume behaves. So, Santa Ro in a very A very elegant paper proves that this function indeed is strictly convex and proper. And it implies that you have a unique point which actually minimize the volume of the dual of the translated body. The dual of the translated body. Okay, so we prove that this map is strictly strictly convex and proper. And it implies that there exists a unique point in the interior. So I shall denote S of Q. Shall denote is of key minimizing this functional. So this point is called the center point. And we have a nice characterization because in general this is difficult to find and to determine this point if I give you some convex body. Some convex body. We have no way to easily find this point. So, what prove Santaro is that you have the following formula, which corresponds to the first variation. And this is equal to n plus 1. And you take the scalar product of the centroid of the dual body. And here, V is. And here there is some vector in Rn, okay, where C of the dual of K is the centroid of the dual body. Okay, so this is nice because you can say that you have the following characterization: the central point is at the origin. Is at the origin if and only if the centroid of the dual body is at the origin. Okay. Okay, so there are some nice and they are not really difficult results to prove, but at the time it was a very nice result and the proof are elegant. Lastly, let me add that some That the map, the center map, let's say like this, is an affine invariant point, which basically says that if you move your convex smoothly or in a continuous way, then this point will also Then this point will also move continuously. And if you move it by an inverse or affin map, then the point will be moved by this map in the same way. Okay, so seeing this, you can say, okay, what I take as a volume was the odd of Was the Hozdoff measure of a realm with this Euclidean structure? And then it seems natural to study the following functional. So instead of studying the volume of the dual of the convex body. The convex body after translation will look at the Ausdoff measure of its boundary. So the functional is the following one. So the n minus one Ausdorff measure of the boundary of the dual of the translated body. Okay, so in fact, this was not done, so we did We did study this together with Jill Solanes and Komsanev. So before saying some results, I will put this question in a more general frame. Okay, so more generally, I will take a non-vector space. I shouldn't like this. Here B is a convex body, which will be the unit ball of my norm. And I shall not assume that this is symmetric. Here, B is possibly non-symmetric, asymmetric. And I will take a convex body K. So you can define the dual body, which corresponds to the set of linear functions which are equal to at most one. At most one inside your body, your convex body, so a set of dual functions such that you have this inequality for any x in k. And this convex, this dual body is living in the dual vector space, which inherits with this norm. Okay. And then actually, what happens is that. And then actually what happens is that if you take V is equal to Rn and B is the Euclidean unit ball. We can recruit this quantity as the following one. This is on Thompson and my name is Juan Wario. And minus one volume associated to this vector space to this norm of the boundary of the dual. Okay, so instead of studying this function, we have make the study for this function, which is more general. Okay. And here I take the Amtonson volume of dimension n minus one, which I call area. Area. Okay, so this is defined as if you consider this as a submanifold of this vector space, it inherits from the vector space a Finsler metric, and then you take the sample volume of the unit cotangent bundle of the Finsler manifold. Okay, anyway, I will write it what is the explicit expression of this area. Okay, so let me state the first theorem that we prove. I check the time, okay. So our first theorem is the following. So this is time by myself, Gilles, Solanes and Komsanev, which was published in 21. So you have two cases. If one, the boundary of The boundary of your bow B is C1 or two if K is equal to B, then the following functional, which takes some point in the interior of K and you can associate it on this area. Okay, this functional light. Okay, this functional, like in Santa Robert theorem, is strictly convex and proper. Okay, so in particular, there exists a unique minimizing point which we call the central point for the boundary area. So we denote it like this, and this point will be an affine invariant point. Okay, so let me emphasize that in general, if you don't have this condition, what will fail is that you have strict convexity, but you always have convexity. So in some sense, minimizing points always exist. So I will explain an example. I will explain an example after explaining why this is convex and proper. Okay, so to see why this is convex is not too hard. So first you write the following. So you have some duality formula which is due to Thompson himself, which themselves which say the following. Okay. So you can interact. So, you can interact B and K if you take the duals. Okay, and then this one you can write easily using the definition of Hom Tenson volume at the following integral. So, you take for any point on the boundary of B, you have the tangent space. Okay, and then you have Okay, and then you make the intersection with your convex body, so with the convex body k. So you have here, normally this is key, but here instead this is k minus x. And okay, k minus x is leaving something here. Okay, and you take the intersection with your tangent plane. So this is defined as the unit ball of. This defines the unit ball of your finslow metric, and then you take the dual and you take the measure. So, here I fix some identification of V with Rn, okay, and I take some accladion structure. It doesn't matter which one you take. So, you divide by some constant, which is actually the unit volume of the I minus one dimensional unit your Kilton bowl. Euclidean bow, and you integrate over the Euclidean structure you have taken. Okay, so when you have this formula, it's not too hard to see that the function is always convex. Okay, you just have to check it. But from this formula, we see easily that the function That the function is always convex because you are integrating functions which are convex, basically. Okay. And then to see why this function is proper. Excuse me. Yes. What do you write under the integral? Is it k minus x c? Yeah. Which is your. Which is your unit body is k minus x, and it does intersect the tension plane at y, yes, because x is inside k. Okay, I draw it here, but in fact, here this is the origin, you have some vector space with the tangent spans, and then you have the convex which is translated, but so it's okay. Okay. Okay. So next we check why the function is proper. So you have to first use the classical isoperiotic inequality, which write like this. So you have some universal constraint, and then you have to multiply by the Hom Thompson volume of your convex body B measured with. measured with this norm, okay, to the power n minus one. Okay, and then use you can use the following that actually the Omtonson product, sorry, the Omtanson volume of this is equal to this one. Okay, and then you use the zite. that this one goes to infinity when when x is going to sorry when x is going to the boundary of of v okay so you use the the santaro result that this function is proper okay like some tarot so of course if x is going to sorry the boundary of key so if x is going to the boundary of key this X is going to the boundary of k, this quantity also goes to infinity. Okay, so you have convexity, properness, so some tarot points always exist. Okay, but you can uh add that uh they are not unique. So, I give you an example of this. Maybe I give you directly my notes because drawing this is like, okay. So, what you take is the following. You have K, which will be this, the following. Will be this the following. Okay, so you have this rectangle. Let's say that here this is three on the apsis, here this is one. Okay, so this is key, and you'll be like this, like the L1 worm. Okay, so you have to integrate this functional, okay, over point on the boundary of B. Okay, so the tangent space which appear here are this one, this one, this one. This one, this one, this one, this one. So, in fact, this is this one or this one. Okay, so this is this one or this one. Okay, and then you have to integrate this quantity, but they are constant if you take the intersection of your K with B of with K with some transition along this point here. This is exactly the same. Okay, sorry. Is that you take you take this tangent space, for instance, which is here. And if instead of k you make some translation by some point which is living here, okay, it will not change this quantity. And either this one, of course, and either this one or this one. Okay, so you will move your parallel planes like this. Okay, so you see that the function is constant. You see that the function is constant here. Okay, and it's not too hard to see that this is actually the minimized. Okay. So here we have an example that shows that you have actually the possibility that not only one only point minimize this area, but several ones and infinite ones. But what you have to remark here is that in fact To remark here is that in fact you have like a cylindrical direction, and in fact, this is what makes the problem. Okay, so the problem here in that example is that let me write it like this, that there is some cylindrical direction. Cylindrical direction, cylindrical direction. Okay, so you have the convex K which locally look like this, like the boundary of C, of a convex C, which is living in some vector space H. Okay. And locally, your convex body is of the form boundary. Of the form boundary of, say, time some interval. Okay, so how do you manage to prove strict convexity when this is the case? So you just have to remark that if H is a hyperplane which contains Which contains a parallel line to x1 x2 to the segment x1 x2. So I'm saying that okay, you have here your cylindrical direction and then you take some hyperplane which is leaving. Sorry, this is bad. Just living like this. Okay. So the intersection will be something like this. Okay, so this H, which is contains a parallel line to X1, X2. Then by center row, we know that the following functional is strictly convex. So this is chi minus one is strictly convex so around x one x two okay so because you have strict convexity what will happen is that uh If the set of such planes at such that you have strict convexity is of positive measure, then you will have in your integral strict convexity. And this happens if, of course, B is C1 because you can tax H and like an open set around H. Like an open set around H, and you will be done, or also if you have B which is equal to C himself, then any points here living on the cylindrical part will have the same property, okay, because the tangent space will be of this nature, okay. So, this is how we prove that actually you have uniqueness in the case where the boundary of B is C1, and in the case. And in the case where k is equal to b. Okay, so next that you know that you have some some tallow points which is unique in this case, we would we were interested to to get a characterization like uh Santalo's characterization that uh the Santalo point is at the origin if and only if the centroid of the dual body is at the origin. Dual body is at the origin, and we get the following theorem. So I will write it in the case where a B is a Euclidean ball because it's easy to describe and short in time. Then you have the following. So the first The first variation of this functional, we calculated it and we proved the following formula. So there is some constant here and you have to multiply by the scatter product of some point, I will explain what this is, times the variation, the direction of the variation. So where this quantity, so this This quantity, so this is like a centroid. This is an average of centroid of projected bodies. So this is you make the integral over Sn minus one. So this is your complex body V. And then you make the integral over the projection. So you have some X fixed here. Then you make the projection of the dual body on the orthogonal. On the orthogonal plane, hyperplane to X, and you make the centroid of this one. Okay, here this is the Lebesgue measure and Camellical measure, respectively. Okay, so this formula is some kind of hard to prove and And more generally, we prove a general formula when the boundary of B is smooth with a positive curvature. Using, I will finish with this remark, using a Crofton type formula, which is due to Juan Carlos. So, the formula is the following: you take Your home Thompson area, and then you can describe it like this. So, you have again some constraint depending on the dimension, and you have so you integrate a volume form obtained from a symplectic two form on the space of oriented lines, and you integrate over all the oriented lines of your vector space, so I denoted like this, which intersect key. intersects key okay so this set is a set of oriented lines and uh in fact it's classical results that uh when you have a finsal manifold and the space of close of sorry of geodesic is the smooth manifold then you have some syntactic structure on it so okay i can describe this true form uh if you want but uh maybe i have Maybe I have two minutes so I can explain a little bit about these two forms where omega b is the following symplectic form defined by the following expression. So the pullback of these two from is equal to the pullback These two forms is equal to the pullback of the standard form where so p is a projection, it's following projection. So you parameterize the set of oriented lines by point of your vector space time elements of the boundary of your dual ball doing like this. Okay, you take X mass plus. mass plus your text the Legend transform of this form and you orientate in this direction. Okay, so this point is the only point of the boundary of B which realize P d is equal to one and I is the following map is the inclusion. Okay okay and in order to And in order to use this formula, in order to obtain this result, what we do is to parametrize the set of oriented lines as intersection of several hyperplanes. And these hyperplanes, in order to get a nice parametrization that is useful, we use the geometry of B. Okay, so that's all. Okay, so that's all. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you. Are there questions or comments? I have a question. What is the value conjecture for the surface area? So if you know there's a total point, okay, you can look at the conjecture that. uh the conjecture that uh the simplest minimizes this uh surface area is it's uh known in some dimension i'm not sure to have well sorry yeah you keep having this problem here uh so uh you uh what's the malar conjecture for surface area in the non-symmetric case is it uh simplex is it known in some dimension Okay, that was the last part of my talk. So I was a little short in time. So effectively you can ask a good question is to ask what is the optimal value of this function also. You take the area of B with respect to the boundary of B, okay? Because this is like volume product and you can ask for an upper bound and for a lower band. Burn and for lower band. So, in dimension two, this is known. This is already resulted by Gorab that in dimension two, you have the following. In arbitrary dimension, you have some upper band and some lower band, okay? But they are not that's symmetric, right? For non-symmetric, probably something with Glenbaum, I think. And bow my big column dimension, though. Okay, that's true. This is for B symmetric. And in symmetric case, okay, so no, it's open. Okay, it's open. So what you did is to make the translation which minimizes the Hamptonson boundary area. And then you try to get some, for instance, upper band, which will be the analog of Blashka. analog of uh blasches and inequality for instance this is not known if for instance uh the best upper band is is uh the wrong shape or what is the the best lower band on this quantity so far you're saying that already in which dimension is that now in dimension three and higher uh in the symmetric case you mean In the symmetric case, you mean, or in the non-symmetric case? Both are interesting. Is either of them known? Sorry, I didn't hear you very well. Is either of them is there a conjecture in either of them? I don't think so. I don't think so. If anyone knows about it, you can. Anyone knows about it, you can say, but I don't think that there is a special shape which is conjectured to be optimal. Yeah, well, in dimension three, the lower bound in the symmetric case, 36 over pi, and that was proved by myself and Thompson. Yeah, that's right. That's the one in dimension three. So that's we proved it, Thompson and I, and Thompson, he found a cubic dot. Thompson, he found the cubic dodecahedron, for example, has 36 over pi, but that's a symmetric case. For the non-symmetric case, the thing is that proof depends on Ivanov's poo-systolic inequality. But in the non-symmetric case, we don't have Ivanov's poo-systolic inequality. So that case is open in the two-dimensional case, even the two-dimensional case even the the non-symmetric case i think it's six to six as well but uh it's it's it's a bit different always in in the non-symmetric case but that's 36 over pi is the is the optimal uh because of of what uh what uh thompson and i did but the you don't do they have a unique minimizer in the cremator no there's no unique there there are lots there are lots of minimizers Lots, there are lots of minimizers. Are there any operations you can do with minimizers to get conjectured minimizers at higher dimensions? I don't know. I haven't looked at higher dimensions. I think we should move on to the next talk. Actually, we are five minutes over time.
