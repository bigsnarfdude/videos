There we go and now the live stream wirecast's reacting so I think wirecast is about to start and then refresh the live stream when you're able to log in in the workshops to record our own models recorded. Yep, the live stream looks good. I can see myself with a few seconds delay. Nice. So we have to send the So we have to assume the recordings working as well. That's it for this case, right? Is there anything else that would normally happen for the remote presentations? Like, do you want me to try guests sharing something? Sure. If they cannot hear us, can they hear us? Yeah, I think you can hear us. So this is how it would look for your So, this is how it would look for your local participants in Baltimore sharing a presentation. Yeah, looks great. Can you try a PowerPoint slider by chance? That's kind of. Yeah, I can try something. Let me see what I have. I don't know. They're not long. They're not locked at all. I'd like to try, try all the lever until something, you know. Boom. Oh, it's very small. Yeah, that's a close computer. Can you actually see from it? It definitely looks better on a computer. It's more, but it's not even like full screen. It might be something like these settings, but the projector screen view is pretty small. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's right. Full screen, no. Um, is there anyone else who could share? You could try to share. Yeah, on there, it looks okay. It's just here. On the live stream, it looks okay. On the live stream, the live stream, I have, I'm taking up the entire screen. I'm taking up the entire screen with my presentation. I just have two black bars down the side. Can you see the projector screen? Like if I show you from my computer? Yeah, that's not what I was seeing. Hang on. Maybe my laptop. Let me try disconnecting my other disconnect and changing the resolution. So now it's wider to present our comments. Maybe something on the Mac maybe like a few settings. Okay, on the Mac mini itself, you will also have the ability to resize the presentation and me. So just to look, I'm trying to make out on the pinned screen, but if you move the mouse cursor for the Mac mini to the area between the presentation and me, you should be able to make me smaller by finding that bar and dragging it to the right. Could you do that then? Because it's a separate document. Do you know? I mean, like on whoever has the mouse for the Mac menu, if you move the mouse cursor over the presentation, it should show you a bar dividing the presentation from the videos. And you can move that bar around. You can drag it, I think, to the right. You can click on it and drag it. You can only make it smaller and bigger. So, Carlos, you should be able to do the same thing on your laptop. You should be seeing a presentation with me to the right. You should be able to change the relative size of those two things. Is that working okay on your laptop? Yeah, yeah, you got the. I don't know how to, yeah, because you got the thing, right? You can do this. Linda's trying, I guess it's not working, or it's. What about the expand or shrink, scale it on and off? And when I click on that, it just shrinks it even smaller, doesn't even get larger. The chat keeps popping. Is it oh, you can unsee when I go here? Okay, so if you're on top, come on. Maybe it's in the view ratio. Does you see what the Because you see, with mine, I got the view ratio, right? Then you have to 50 window or what? I'll try to view option at the top there. You see? Yeah, that one. What does that say? 50 window? Go 150. Let's see what happened. Original. Oh, that's too much. Oops. Yeah, that's weird. It fits into the window, but. It fits into the window, but it's in the smallest possible wood. Actually, I'm going to stop my presentation. Carlos, do you want to share a window from your laptop? Why is the chat keeps on popping back up? I wouldn't be able to say at the moment. That was an issue as well before, remember. Someone would type something in the chat and would just pop up. Let's try if I share something if I can now speak. Share something on the speaker. I'm right on it. I'll share mine. Oh, wow, this is even smaller. Yes, the resolution, probably, of the projector is what I would guess. Because that's tiny. Unless... It looks fine enough. Yeah, it's filter the window too, right? Yeah, that's definitely slightly better. But it is weird. Is this you? Is this you? No, that's me. That's not ready to worry. Yeah, that's regular. How do I get full screen? Why do I still have Ian on the slide? Is it supposed to be like that? Steve, because he's spotlated me, he's the last person to talk. Yeah, that's where you are. View is a side-by-side standard. Yeah, so this is just. Yeah, so this is just. I'm going through the Zoom options on mine as well. This is just some setting on that Mac Mini for Zoom. You can do things like turn off the side by side, and then you end up with the video of the speakers floating around, and you can minimize that. That gives you a full screen for the presentation. Well, it's not even side-by-side mode. Yeah, yeah. It's on photo present there. Did we have that before? When they would screen share, would we see the rest of people in there? No, it just only want to see the presenter. How do you get rid of it? What did you do before? Nothing. I just moved. Maybe side by side. Side by side speaker. That's how I'm going to go. Speaker. That's how you can. But then you can. That's what shrinks the whole thing. Yeah. Try the next one. It's another option. Maybe it's on Jan because I haven't said anything and my mic is dead. So he's the last one that's in it. Right. I can turn my thing on just for a sec. It just matters that the picture is so big and that. And would it change? No, it doesn't change. Yeah, that's weird. It's probably pinning. It's probably pinning. Who do you want to see? If you right quick and try, can you try pinning an individual video on top of the presentation? I'll just spawn with Carlos and then there. That gets into the shape. I don't know what we're trying to. Like, I think our concern is that it's too. Our concern is that it's too small. People won't be able to see the presentation on the bridge while we're sitting in the room. This is how it was. I think there was maybe try the script that's like relaunch soon. Try that. Where does it send? It's on your, it's uh, you can go out of the screen share. It's on the regular laptop and download spot. You're on the mac menu. What is this? You're on the mac menu still. You can bring it out. Except it's screen share. Maybe press escape. Press escape. Yes, clearly, not the resolution of the projector because that's the right size in a way, right? It's clearly got to be the Zoom setting. Yeah, it has not yet no change. Poking around to see if I can do what you're trying to do on my laptop for current views. The options I have are standard side-by-side speaker, side-by-side gallery, swap video and shared screen or full screen. Have you tried through all of them on the projector to see what it looks like locally?  Like you can't be very far away in terms of resolution because the video for the speaker is going down to like, I don't know, a sixth of the screen width or something like that. The presentation must be the other five sixths. Is it definitely not usable from the back of the room? G, are you still on the call and moderating? Okay, if somebody's in as a Is in as a Zoom admin. The first meeting the room is shown as pinned, I think. Sorry, do you want me to something? Just check what the video, like, who's got what video pinned. So if you just hover over the video, like I'm just trying to see urgent meetings, actually, that much for Carlos's laptop. It's not the I can give you that whole. I can give you the host. Okay, so I gave you the host privilege, so you should be able to do a lot more. Cool. Do you want to record a video from the room? We only have cardboards and jacob slap talks.
