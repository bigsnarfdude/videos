Okay, thank you. So, in the last two talks, I explained the following. Let me just remind you, like the geometry of the circle, you let things run on the circle. So, this is related to Hosho. And eventually get algebra index. Index. Last time I explained that if you do chiral theory on the Taurus, and I mentioned that it's going to be intertwining this elliptic chiral chain complex. And there's a way to go from the curve to the torus by choosing this ace. By choosing these A cycles and to break modularity, and this process is like related to this how bar goes to infinity limit. And from here, you get index. Basically, you get these operators like A cycle integrals. You get this chiro index. That's a rough idea. Now, today I will explain. Today I will explain a non-trivial example of this one as an application. I will show you how to use this one to establish a quantum mirror theorem for this own HD curve, in particular this quantum beam model. This is a particularly interesting example. And this example is a quantum, not semi-simple example. Okay, so to explain this, let me just mention a few things before we start. And I guess most people know. And I guess most people know this story about this mirror symmetry between the compiler geometry and this complex geometry. And so we have been talking a lot about this Gromotian type theory. But on the B side, there's a strange field theory, which was proposed originally by Chessey Takori Oguriwafa. People now call this one B series theory. It's B model. Precise way of saying this is like a B model. Precise way of saying this is like a B model, which is called B model closed stream field theory. And originally, it's proposed on Colabia three folds. And somehow you can call this one Coda Spinfer theory. And the equation of motion describes And the equation of motion described in the theory is like the deformation of complex structures, which describe the solutions of Richard flat metric by the celebrated Calabi-Yau theorem. Now, and I will explain that today example actually is proposed by me and my collaborator, Castello. And we find a way to extend this big model close. This B model close string field, not only close stream, but let me say B model stream field on first, not only on collaborative freefold, but on any collaborative any dimension. And also for this open-closed green field theory. And this is related to this Koda-Spencer coupled with so-called holomorphic chain signals in the larger limit. And this particular gives a proposal for this twisted topological twisted gauge gravity. H gravity duality. So, this is a particular object. So, I will explain today as just an example. So, you see, like this is the simplest example of Colabio, it's like if the curve. So, I want to explain this explicit solution of this quantum beam model. On if the curves turns out to be an application of this chiro index theory, but it also leads to this quantum neural symmetry in this example. Actually, this solution exists not only for closed string but also for open string. But let me just explain. But let me, I will just explain this colostrum factor in this talk. So, let me explain the model and how this is connected to the example I explained yesterday. So, first, the data of this model on UFD curve, they're gonna work with the same UFD curve as yesterday. De Kirby as yesterday. It is the following. You cannot write this E is the double complex valued in two variables. And this situ variable is odd. There are two different ways of grading this. So I'm going to use a simpler way of doing this. It's like this degree. Of doing this is like this degree is minus one, it can be also plus one with a different gradient. Degree t is zero, this is bosonic, this is permanent, and theta square equals zero, and theta is related to the vector fields. So it's a geometry about this polyvector fields, vector fields on eptic curve. And t is related to gravitational descent. Gravitational descendant. And this is my field space. Now I'm going to define an action functional on the space. So let's consider the following. It's actually somehow like a point case in the chain level before we push to the homology. So basically, Push to the homology. So basically, what's happening is like, let's define this map, the correlation. Just as everybody knows, like a psi-class intersection on the model S2s. By suppose you have tensors of these objects like T to the K1, T to the Kn. By this correlation, I just mean computing this integral. And you have an explicit answer for this. It's like k minus 3 choose k1 up to kn. That's the combinorial formula. And you extend this one to the field space by, this is like a point version at the genus zero level. Version at the genus zero level and you extend it and with respect to this coefficient. So I get something, I call something for t, you just do this intersection, and then do linear extension along this coefficient linearly. You get this map. I still use the same notation. It's a map from symmetric tensors of this E goes to. Now you evaluate the descendants. You end up with something like differential forms, the book complex, and with the sitter. This is the linear coefficient. But that's how I define this map. Define this map. And this map allows us to define, which we call like the BCOV classical interaction by the following. Because if I extend it from BCUV interaction by let's say Let's say as an action functional is written as following: like you integrate on the curve and integrate oxeta and do this kind of evaluation. We can any phi lysine this E. So exponential here, you have to have to do power like Taylor series expansion and Expansion and use this formula to compute what that looks like. And the d theta is the Razina integral. The D theta is like it's odd variable. So it's like integrate O A theta job plus B. By definition, it's like A. It's a Brazilian integral. And the coefficient here is like Lysina De Bou complex. So you merge with additional dz to get a two form integrate. We get a two-form integrate. And that's the action function. And it can be viewed as actually a family of points and parametrized by this duple complex, this coefficient. And then we integrate the sum over the points. And so geometrically, from the strength theory point of view, it's trying to do something like that. And localize around every point and glue them. That's roughly speaking what's happening. Now, I will explain what is the data of this one telling us and how to quantize it, and how to use this detrace, it declire index to compute a partition function, and then how eventually you get this mirror gromuting invariant. Of the mirror, grow moving in mirror. Now, the first one is like, what is kind of what kind of property does the action function look like? It's very bizarre. It has infinitely many terms. It's starting from QB term. It's only from three. So you have QB term, fourth, fifth essential. You have infinitely many terms. We have infinitely many terms. And what that is why is telling now introduced, so let me try to impose some standard thing that you have seen in this classical integrable hierarchy. So let us write the following. Let us write my field. So you see like you have components in SETA and in this gravitational descendant. But let's write in the following term. So let's write in the following term: K, bigger or equal to zero and BK is a field. And then the first one has no theta. It's just a particular component of the descendant plus the second term. It's just a way to decompose in components. That's the way to write. And each term here lies in. Way to write. And each term here lies in the is a it's less in this space. So each little k is now in this double complex. Just a decomposition. Then you introduce a Poisson bracket. Introduce a actually the shifted Poisson bracket. By the following, like you define the bracket of these two. Let's pick up B0. So at two different points, you define the bracket of two fields by like in classical integral hierarchy, you find equations like derivative of the delta function. That's the standard Poisson bracket. Poisson bracket, but now you introduce a little bit more. You introduce a delta function in this zeta variable. Or precisely, this is a zeta variable shifted degree by one, basically. And then with this bracket, you can somehow obtain the induced bracket as usual you calculate in the future. As usual, you calculate in the field theory, like you calculate the bracket of two action functional. With my action functional there, this is now well defined. It's defined as a local functional. This is what's happening. So, without theta, that's the standard thing you see in this integral system. Like, you have the derivative of the delta function, and you compute the bracket. Delta function and you compute the bracket, you insert this delta function, and you evaluate this integral. And now you insert this theta just to incorporate this integration. And the shift degree by one. So far, yes, it is independent. Only this one is dynamical. All the other fields are background fields. Yeah, let me say two parts. It's probably CITA1. Two parts. It's probably theta one minus theta two is better. But I didn't write theta here. So suppose I suppose a theta variable here on the left hand side, on the right hand side, supposed to be a delta function here. So what this means is like if you insert this integration, you basically kill one of the DCT as well. You end up with the same expression. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So it just depends on the set. Let me just write it this way. This function is a function of Z and Seta, which doesn't depend on Seta. You are right. So I write Z here properly with the Theta 1 on the left hand side. So when you write, insert into this action functional. If there's a Seta1 here, let me say it this way. There's Theta 1 here, blah, blah, the two here, blah, blah, blah. And the DZ, DW. And we compute just a bracket. I define my, if you compute this bracket. Define my if you compute this bracket here, you have to insert a delta theta. So you be basically you q one of the d theta integral. You end up with this is what I mean. But just one way of saying this, but uh precisely, yeah, you're right. I don't write any explicit theta here, but there's a set of v and theta on the left hand side, and this z and theta on the right hand side. I mean, this whole combination is super wearable. This is like a probably this is more formal. Like a probably this is more formal. Basically, you can think about it like you don't look at this theta, then you're done. And actually, you can forget about theta to get only formally look at this integral here, and you will see this is actually related. But this model is precisely like that. And they can define a bracket. Now, what's really happening? What's really happening is the following. So I cannot keep this blackboard. What's really happening is that this action functional satisfying classical mass equation, so let Q to be a differential acting on here by the following, like Q equals d bar. equals d bar plus t delta. Yeah delta is like ddz ddz. So this is like a divergence operator. It computes the divergence of vector field if you think about it as well as like a vector field. And then it induce It induces a derivation where duality on any kind of functions on the field because it's like elements of the dual. So induce real duality as a derivation on function fields. It's just like a like derivation on the space on the space field induce a derivation on the function field. Induce a derivation on the function field. And then we can talk about QI0 is defined. So these two stuff are defined. And the key proposition you can check here, that's the whole point. One of the points for this construction is I naught satisfies. The classical master equation. This is not trivial, but you can just track it by hand. Classical master equation. This QI naught plus bracket. The bracket is the bracket I defined over there using the let me call this one bracket zero. zero so this bracket zero equals zero so this equation holds you can check it using this comatori formula explicitly and this looks like a more recordant equation more type more cardon type equation it's a classical mass equation encoding the classical intersection data on this modular space also this Space. Also, this actually has a more general version of any collabor, but just in this example, explicitly, it's given by this equation. Yeah, hopefully I got this point. This is the first thing I want to mention. And we know, like, once you got a classical mass equation, basically this described the classical gauge theory in the B-V formalism, one of the homological. the homological particular homological method that we employ in this uh in this uh quantum field theory now i want to explain how to quantize the important here is to how to quantize and once you quantize you'll get to this point this index now let me erase this part This part, you try to explain how to quantize. And this quantization actually is actually, we know like in quantum field theory, whenever we have some versions of classical mass equation, we can write down a quantization condition by writing down what it means by a quantum mass equation. And it is true here. It is true here. We can try to find correction terms, like starting from I naught, it's classic, they are improperly correct by something and by higher terms in H bar and the etc, satisfying a quantum mass equation. And the quantum mass equation looks like, like, for example, it's like a QI, people usually write it in such a way. And this B-W operator, and just this bracket equals zero. This is like what people usually write in this physics terminology. This quantum mass equation. And this is like a quantum BB operator. And the issue here is like, because we are working with like an infinite-dimensional example, this isn't ill-defined, like mathematically. You have to make sense of this equation. You have to implement the idea of renormalization and things like that. And in fact, this can be done. I won't explain the details, but let me just lay down. Details, but let me just lay down a few words which leads to the final solution. First, this is the EO defined. And to define such a thing, one way, I mean, there are different ways, but we can use, for example, Costello's homotopic renormalization technique. The normalization method makes sense of this equation. And it's a little bit like hard to explain at this moment precisely what this means, but the rough idea is that. Rough idea is that what's really happening is like this operator is ill-defined in the infinite dimensional case. Well, this is like a singular, it's like behaving like a, for example, like a grain functions with singularities. You have to pair distributions with distributions and things like that. And this is how, what is the appearance of the UV divergence. But the idea of this one is like you replace this BV operator by a regularized one. And remember how you recognize it. You've seen a trend homotopy. That's the idea of Castello. For us, in this example, we won't use such a complicated method. There turns out to be a way of Complicated method. There turns out to be a way out, very simple way. It turns out this theory is UA finite and can be recognized in a geometric way, as I explained yesterday. You see the work that I did with J.J.O. We call this recognized integral. Integral can be done geometrically. Geometric required as integral. This is the stuff I explained yesterday. It's a very simple procedure. You see, like we have this holes for these local correlations, and you want to integrate things on the surface. And then you can just decompose into this log and things like that and integrate. And you get a well-defined right-last integral. It turns out that this method is equivalent to this one in this example. And I just want to mention this higher dimensional version of this, like it's worked by Ming Hao, my former student. It shows, actually, it's a remarkable thing that she holds UV finite for any higher dimensional chiros holomorphic theory. Polymorphic theory. Polomorphic theory. So I explained the example of like complex one dimension, but it turns out this method works for higher dimensional as well. I had to like the method of Schwinger compactification that I mentioned yesterday. But anyway, we're just going to work on this example, one-dimensional example. Now, it turns out the fault, let me write down a Let me write down a theorem. It turns out that the way, if you do this regularization, this geometric regularization, this equation turns out to be a very simple algebraic equation that you need to solve. Let me just state in words. We can find in this paper the right glass Upon a mass equation, just a mathematical like expression realization of this equation on this equivalent to this equation on epicurve or like say only p-curve. It works more general, but let me just state for the curve. Is it equivalent to algebraic Mori-Kada equation on the mode Lie algebra of Of what is operator algebra. And the particular which vertex operator algebra depends on the model you are working with. I always explain this particular vertex operator algebra in our case for the BCV theory. But this is actually, this theorem works in general. Like, if you try to formulate such a thing, like on curve, it turns out that. It turns out that the complicated way of solving this renormalization and things like that is equivalent to solve an algebraic equation. Now, let me try to explain what is the corresponding algebraic equation. It turns out to be the following. Remember, my field is written in such a way in this particular example. So here is my field, BK and the eta k. And classically, I introduce a Poisson bracket for B0 and nothing else for other stuff. And then I can quantify the system by promoting this Poisson bracket to like an OPE, like a what is algebra. And this is also known in this. This is also known in this integrable hierarchy technique. So let me just write it down. So we're going to write this action functional that can solve this equation as an expression like this. So this my classical action involves complicated combinations of this B's and Of these b's and b's and etas. But let me write in general: if you quantize it, you want to write, you can write the quantized action in the following form by some some chirol Lagrangian. This is a complicated expression, but it turns out to be, depends on the following form. It's okay. So it's a, in general, when you quantize, you're going to write down some action functional, which depends on holomorphic derivatives of the fields. And the holomorphic derivatives combine in such a way that this dv h bar, I mean root of h bar, dbz. It turns out first, you can find yourself. First, you can find your solution by writing down some action functional of this type. Second, the way you solve this equation is by turning this expression into an algebraic expression by the following. Introduce the following. Introduce the following vertex operator algebra by the following. So this is a parallel to how you write down the Poisson bracket. This is like V is the tensor of Heisenberg or VOA. Let me just write it down. Heisenberg. Tensor with some kind of non-communicable view, eh? And more precisely, it's given by the following. It's given by, probably let me erase it part. It's given by again, generated by this field. You think about this one as like the generators of my what is the operator algebra, then you can get the following. So this Heisenberg is going to be generated by V0, V0. That's what this one is. All the other stuff be bigger than zero. Be bigger than zero and eta stuff generates this community for VOA and equivalently, explicitly. We're gonna write down the OPE. It's like the B0, BW, OPE. It's like a chiral bossum I wrote yesterday. It's like a H bar over Z minus W. Over Z minus W square. So this is like a Heisenberg what is the algebra. And to compare with yesterday, I write like a B0, Z, which is basically the derivative of the Kairobosl. That's the field in yesterday's notation, but today, let me just call this one P0. And then all the other OPEs, because it's a community. The other OP is because it's a commutative, all the other OP is zero. So, for example, you have like V0, like say, suppose anything, you have anything else. The singular term is zero, if this k plus m is bigger than zero. And this be whatever with eta whatever. With eta, whatever is zero, and eta eta is zero. So this expression quantized the Poisson bracket for the B field, and which is the Heisenberg-watt is the algebra. And all the other stuff are zero, it's commutative. At the classical level, we say there's no bracket for other fields, it's the background fields. So you can write down a vertical. So, you can write down a vertical operator algebra generated by this field. Then you can express such expression, you know, like the way you write down this algebra is by with its generators, by all the possible derivatives of this guy. So, you can view this L as an element of this particular what is the operator algebra. So, you can view such a So, you can view such a way. And then the claim is the following. It's the main theorem in this paper. The claim is the, let me just write it down. Theorem. By the way, whenever we have what is algebra, we can define a Lie algebra by writing down the modes. Lie algebra by writing down the modes. This modes Lie algebra. That's all collection of all the possible Fourier modes. So in particular, for this expression, I can write down something like that formally. And this can be viewed as a chiropractor vertical operator. And the theorem is the following. This complicated stuff. Just renormalized quantum mass equation for like this PCW theory is equivalent to solving an algebraic equation. Again, it can this. Again, this original differential induced differential on this vertex algebra easily. You can write down something like that. And basically, this is a Marikadon equation in this vertex operator algebra. H-bar. Probably there's a pi somewhere, but that's not important at this moment. So the way you solve this action functional is by treating this action functional functional functional functional Treating this action functional as an element of this vertex algebra and solve this Mauriciardon equation. It's pretty algebraic. So people usually write like, if this is like some kind of a vertex, you look at all the possible constructions and compute the residuals and so on. So this is how you compute complicator of this most Lie algebra. And now it becomes purely algebraic equation. So you don't need to study. So you don't need to study that complicated uh renormalization equation. Yeah, this is uh uh so you think about uh you think about things like that. I mean, this V as a vector space, it collects all the possible like uh expressions of the derivatives of the field. So it's basically. So it's basically a differential ring. Now, then you can formally write down like most, like you can write something like this definition can be viewed as like v mod out partial z something. Mod out total derivative. That's a formally write down. What do you mean by integral? That's another, this is an equivalent way of saying this. So algebraically, so if you study algebra, like people usually write in such a way, you model the total. Write in such a way. You mod out the total derivative. That's how defined is modes. And once you mod it out, like this becomes a Lie algebra. And geometrically, people will write something that integrations like integrals. And different ways of doing these integrations will become some kind of rest field calculation. So I can explain this more later. So this has an algebraic definition. Has an algebraic definition, you have this Bauter formula, and all geometric formulation by RASTU turns out to be the same. But I just want to mention, this is like just some expressions of this derivative terms. And so you can use this OPE to compute this relation. All this relation determines uniquely how to compute this bracket. How to compute this bracket. Then you can just play. And the theorem is that not only like this, and there's a canonical solution of this equation. And there exists a canonical solution. And by the way, for the computator, the classical way, if you people usually write classical way by connecting one propagator. Classical way by connecting one propagator is precisely the fact that if you compute ratio of this expression, it's the derivative. That's why the classical level, why you have the Poisson bracket of these two, is a derivative of the delta function. And then also there's a unique canonical solution of this equation. Satisfying a bunch of further properties Satisfying a bunch of further properties, satisfying what I call a pulch weight condition, and a version of a dilatant equation at the chain level. And the name of this equation is that it borrowed from German theories. If you look at you can't turn this one internet. You can turn this one into an algebraic equation, and you can analyze this equation in this vertical algebra, and you find a canonical solution, a unique one. And that's how you quantize the system. Now, let me just show you what this one looks like, because it looks complicated, abstract. And it turns out that the classical activity I gave you an expression for this classical action, and there's an expression. And there is an expression for the quantum action as well, explicitly. So, let me just probably just let me explain this. What it looks like. It turns out it's easier to state, compute it in the so-called stationary sector. Again, this is a name I borrowed from grommet theory. So, my fields. My fields. We have this decomposition and I consider the special locus. Of these fields by the following. You basically like make all of the higher B's zero and like freeze this field to be constant. So it's the following, like B something, like B1, B2 is such a all of the fields are zero and each are constant. So in physics, So, in physics, we say this is like a constant background field, and this is all of the stuff will be frozen. And you might wonder why you consider such a locus. It turns out that this locus is mirror to which is called stationary sector in the mirror-grommut theory. Moreover, this locus, the information on this locus, determines the partition function, the generating function for everything. And this is remarkable. Everything. This is a remarkable. It's called a station or local station factor. Then it turns out that this zip guy plus Virusoro determines everything for answer on the generating function. On the generating function. The proof of this one is the same thing as you prove the same result on the mirror it decurved in Gomuten theory. That's one thing you can do. But let me just show you how to write down this action functional in this stational spectrum. So this is the place where you observe. This is the place where you observe some quantum integrability. That's actually an explanation of this quantum mass equation. This quantum mass equation can be viewed as a version of quantum integrability. Let this I s to be my action, quantized action functional restricted to this stationary sector. My original field The original field depends on this complicated thing, and you also involve derivatives as it's like that. But when this particular element is a constant, the derivative just goes away. And it turns out the action functional is very simple. If you solve it like recursively, you find the following. So you only have B0 and ETAs. Now, ETAs a constant. It finds the following. Following. After you quantize, you find this is rational. Let me write it down. B V and eta K eta M W M plus two B naught M plus two where this W is the generator of this W one plus infinity. of this w1 plus infinity algebra so precisely given by when i write wm it's given by at the classic level it's given by like a b naught m power like remember like a b naught is the related to it relate relates to chiro bosom by the following some plus some higher correction terms and you can write down some formula like that is given by some that is given by some root of like partial z h bar plus b naught, this operator apply m times to one. You can write it down explicitly. You apply this operation m times and you write down the expression in b naught and integrate and that's that's the answer. And the quantum mass And the quantum mass equation is equivalent to say that this object as the element of the what is the algebra, if you compute the most, actually it generates infinitely many commuting quantum operators. That's the explicit solution that comes from this result. Once you have here, now you can implement this. You can implement this chiR index to compute the generating function. And here's the final answer. This is like, by the way, just let me mention, this is like generators. Yes. W1 plus infinity algebra. Yes. There's some reason why this kind of eat corner intercomability appears. I have some proposal in general, but I can explain later. But this is a, if you compute this one efficiently, that's what you find. Then you can compute the generating function. What is the quantum BCO theory on epic curve? And in the same way as I mentioned yesterday, so you compute basically the correlation function of this action functional, basically. And And you have to integrate on the Riemann surface on the curve. And then the way you do integration is to use the recognized integral. And it turns out I mentioned that the answer of this one is going to be combinations. It lies in the range generated by each star E4, E6. You can compute it. And I mentioned that you can compute the so-called Tau Bar goes to infinity limit, which where you get the quasi-modular form. This is what I called Kio index yesterday. This is what I called chiral index yesterday. And this is the same thing as computing. We reduce this one to a cycle integral. It turns out that this equals trace, a Q trace, up to the standard expression that it up to the standard expression that you see in in in this representation theory and just the same expression so now you compute the the coefficient some some this is the mirror coefficient to the um the committee invariance so this is let me write eta tiota So this is let me write it's a tilt and something like that. The modes of this generator of this w1 plus infinity algebra w k plus 2 or k plus 2. So you insert this operator here and compute a q trace and you get a get a function of this eta. This eta is a mirror to the case descendant of the volume form on the on the mirror EDV curve. And that's the B model calculation. But that's the B model calculation. B model result. It's by computing this generic function and taking this tau by infinity limit, and you get this Q trace. It turns out that this equal, this is equivalent to the B model, the A model calculation. This is like a stationary grommark within invariance. On the mirror, as computed by, I think the first calculation is by a digraph on one descendant, the general by Okenkoff-Padre Panda. And they calculate the same on this commuting invariance using. There's the commuting variance using a formatic vertex algebra and given by some trace. And the B model calculations given by like bosonic generator with Kyle Boson of this W1 plus infinity algebra. Turns out that they are equal by the famous Boson-Fermian correspondence. So, this means that if you calculate the chiro index of the BCU theory on the epic curve, the B model, on the B model, epic curve, is the same as the A model calculation, like computing commuting events and so on. To all genus, all the information. So, this example of like quantum neurosymmetry, and also I promised in the first stage that example of non-semi-simple example. Of non-semi-simple example. And so that's the thing I want to mention, the application of the method I mentioned. So I think probably I just stop here. Thank you.
