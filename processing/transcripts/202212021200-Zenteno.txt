who will be presenting about using Langland's program to solve certain cases of the inverse Gala problem. Okay, so thank you very much for the invitation. It's a great honor to be here and give the last talk of the workshop and of this year in CMO. So before to start, I would like to thank the organizers for this great workshop, Melci Bocu and Maui, muchas gracias Luis, muchas gracias otro Luis. And thank you very much, Manis. So please, let's thank the organizers. Okay, so now. Okay, so now let's start. Today I want to talk about some applications of the LangLands program, which is very natural but not trivial. So in order to do this, let me recall Lavelle Epoch when we were undergraduate students and we learned about Galois theory and in particular. And in particular, we learned that if we have a Galois extension, for example, a Galois extension of Q, finite Galois extension, we can associate a special group, which we call the Galois group of the extension. Then we learn too that by using this association, we can do a lot of interesting things. Can do a lot of interesting things about polynomials and about these extension fields. For example, we can characterize the polynomial equations which are solvable by radicals, for example. So after a look at a lot of interesting applications of this association, it's a natural question asks if Asks if the Galois groups are special groups or not. So, in this direction, the inverse Galois problem asks the following question. So, the inverse Galois problem asks if given a finite group G group G, the question is: if does there exist? If does there exist a Galois extension of Q Galo extension finite such that the Galva group of K over Q is isomorphic to the group G. Okay, so in this talk, I try to explain I tried to explain how by using the Langlands program, we can prove certain cases of the inverse Galva problem for a certain matrices group. Okay, so this is an open problem, obviously, but what we know about the solution of this problem. So let me recall some important results of Kilbert and Safarevich, etc. Of killbird and safarevich, etc., to put in context this idea. Okay, so first, the first result in this direction is due to Hilbert. Hilbert in 1892, he proved that the permutation groups AN and SN are And SN are Galba groups. Then Shafarevich proved in 1954 that if G is a solvable group, it is a Galva group. And finally, Matsat and Samson. Matsat and Thompson proved in the eighties that the simple if if G is a simple sporadic group except the Matthew twenty two twenty three sorry is 23 sorry is is is they are galva galva groups okay by using the the method of tonson and matzat we we can prove also that that certain groups of matrix are are galva groups for example you can can look at the the the book of untermali and matzat And you can find that if G is a matrix group with coefficients in a field with order L prime, then these kind of groups can be realized as Galois group 2. Okay? In fact, we can use this method to prove certain cases of the inverse Galois problem for matrix groups. problem for matrix groups with coefficients in a field F L S for a small power s. In fact, it can be proved that if L S is greater than the rank of the group, then we can realize this kind of groups has Galois groups. So, okay, but the problem is that But the problem is that if we have a big power here, it's very difficult to realize Calva groups by using, for example, the Mali and Matsat results. Okay? So let me explain how by using Galvar representations, we can eliminate the problem and the powers. So let me explain the strategy. It's very easy strategy. Is very easy strategy, but yes for this is for yeah, this is for Chevalier groups in fact in the In the Matsat and Mali book, you can find a lot of very nice examples about this. I think a complete list for the matrix groups by using the methods of Matsat and Thompson. So the idea of the strategy that The idea of the strategy that I want to talk about is to study the image of mod L Galo representation. It's a very natural strategy, if we think. So the idea of the strategy is to study Galois representations from the absolute Galva group of Q. I use the I use the same notation that Ramble and Sean in GLNFL bar, for example. Okay?  Thank you for watching. Couldn't hear you for about maybe a minute. Oh, we're working on this. Yeah, yeah. Now it's okay? Yes. Okay. So it's okay now. Okay. Okay. Okay. Sorry. I was explaining the strategy. So the strategy is to study Galva representations mod L and we will use the following observations. use the following observations. First, we use that the image of a compact is, in this case, is a finite group. And on the other hand, we have that the kernel of rho by continuity is an open normal subgroup of UQ. Then we have that there exists a finite extension of Q such that the kernel is isomorphic to the Galois group. Isomorphic to the Galois group of Q bar over K. And then by using group theory, by basic group theory, we have that the image of rho is isomorphic to GQ over the kernel, and this is isomorphic to the Galois group of a finite extension of Q. Then if we study the image. And if we study the image of the Galva representation and we can control the image of this representation, the groups that we can produce has the image of this representation are automatically Galva groups. So we need a source to produce Galva representations where we can control the image of these representations, right? So So, the first mathematician that worked with this strategy was Ken Rivet. And he studied the Galois representations associated to modular forms. And he proved the following theorem. Let me 75. He proved, for example, that there exists a modular form. A modular form of weight 24 and level 1, obviously normalized A Hen form without inner twist and with coefficient field equal. Feel equal to Q square root of 144,169, a big number. And he proved that for this Calvar representation, the image of the Calvar representation associated to this modular form. This modular form, okay. It's its projectivization, in fact, is equal to PSL to FL square if this number is not square modulo L and L and P is PG L to F L if this number is an square mod model. Okay. For L different from two, three, and forty-seven, in fact. Okay. So has a corollary of this of the result. Of the result, we have that we can realize the group PSL2FL squared for infinitely many primes. In fact, we can realize this group for infinitely many primes, but this group we can realize by using the Matzat and Thompson result. Okay, but if you look If you look at the result, there is a problem similar to the problem with the Matson and Thomson strategy, because this field depends on the coefficient field. So if we want to construct a big power here, we need to produce modular force. To produce modular forms with Fourier coefficients very complicated, very, very large. So if we can compute Fourier coefficients to produce bigger and bigger fields, we can realize this kind of groups as Kalber groups, but it's very complicated to calculate Fourier coefficients. Calculate Fourier coefficients. So the idea to solve this problem of the powers is to use the strategy provided by Carrie and Vinton Berger in his proof of search conjecture. So the idea is to use the cold dihedral Galois representation. Dihedral Galois representations to produce Galois representations with large images without to calculate Fourier coefficients. So let me introduce a slightly more general definition that the goodral representations, which we call maximally induced representations. Induced representations. Okay, so to define the maximal induced representations, I need some ingredients. First, we need integers greater than two. And for simplicity, I will assume that n is even. Moreover, I need a couple of primes, p and q, greater and than. And q greater and than n rhymes such that the order of u mod p is exactly the integer n. Okay, so I will need the following extension too. following extension too let me denote by q q n the the maximal no sorry sorry the unramified extension of q q of degree n and recall that the the multiplicative part of this of this field can be decomposed Can be decomposed as the uniformizer, the powers of the uniformizer, times the u n minus one roots of the unit times the u the one the one units. Okay, so by using this decomposition, we can construct a character for for all L different from P and Q, we can define the following paracter from the absolute Galois group of Q Qn. No. First, from the multiplicative part of Q QN to the multiplicative part of QL bar. Of QL bar, okay, with the following conditions, such that if we restrict this character to the one unit, we will assume that this character is trivial. If we restrict this character to the q n minus one roots of the unit, we will assume that this character this character as order p we can do this by the by the the chose of of these primes okay so finally we send the uniformizer to minus one or two one if we want to produce then orthogonal or simplective representation in fact let me In fact, let me say that chi will be called of S type if the image of the uniformizer is minus one, E and sorry, chi will be called of O type if they match. If the image of the uniformizer is equal to one. Okay? So this is a very easy and very no construction. Maybe Jeff knows very well this construction because he. Okay, so Have we seen in the course of Sean? If we have a character, we can associate a Galois character. So by local class field theory, we have a Galois character also denoted by chi from G Q U N to Q L bar. L bar, the multiplicative part. Then we can take the induced representation rho q, which we will define as the induced representation from GQQN to GQQ i. And this is a a a Galois representation from GQQ to GLNQL bar. Q L bar. Okay. In fact, if our character is of S type, we can factorize this representation by a symplectic group. And if the representation is of O type, we can factorize this representation by an orthogonal group. So, in fact, we have a symplectic or orthogonal language parameter. Okay. Okay, so let me say some things about this representation. First, okay, so let me repeat this idea because it's important. If chi is of style, then the image of row q. The image of raw Q is contained in SPN URL bar. And if chi is of O type, then the image of ROQ is contained in SONQL bar. Okay, moreover, by the assumption in this couple of primes, we can prove that. We can prove that this representation is irreducible because if we take the powers of this character, the character, then the character power q, power q squared, et cetera, et cetera, until q n minus one, all the characters are different, so the representation is irreducible. Rho Q and even row Q bar, the reduction mode L are irreducible, irreducible. And something that is very, very important is that the image of these color representations contains an element of order B. Of order B irreducible containing an element of order P. And why is important this element? This element is important because if we use the Dirichlet theorem for arithmetic progressions, we can choose can choose infinitely many couples p and q and then we can in particular we can choose primes as big as we want so we can produce local representations with image as large as as we want and we don't need to calculate fourier coefficients then we have to prove the existence of this kind of representation Existence of this kind of representations. But for the moment, these representations are very nice because we have an element of bigger order. So let me now we are ready to define what is a maximally induced representation. Because to solve the inverse Galois problem, we need global Galois representations. Global calibral representations, and these are local Gala representations. So let me define what is a maximally induced representation. So definition. A Galva representation row from EQ to GLNQL bar will be Will be a maximally induced representation at a prime Q of order P if the restriction of rho rho L to a decomposition group at Q is isomorphic to rho Q. Okay, so we have Okay, so we have two types of maximal induced representation of S-type and of O-type, according the construction that we use to obtain rho q. So by studying the image of this kind of representation with this particular local component. Particular local component, we can prove the following results. Sorry? Ah, here? Okay, here is the restriction of Roel to a decomposition group. Of rho l to a decomposition group at q is isomorphic to the to the local component rho q maybe up to a twist by a ramified character. So by using these these ideas, we can prove the following. If we fix a prime Prime let L a prime we can prove that if row from GQ to GL and QL bar is, for example, of S-type, then it can be proved of S-type Of S type obviously maximally induced of at sorry Q of order P obviously Q and P different from L then if we have these these conditions then we can we can prove that the image of the reduction mod L Reduction mod L. Sorry, the image of the projectivization of the reduction mod L of this representation is isomorphic to P G N F L S or P S P N F F L S for some for some power for some power s. And we can do bigger and bigger. And we can do bigger and bigger this power by taking a prime bigger and prime p bigger and bigger. So if we are in the in the O-type case, we have a similar result. This result is due to Carrie, Larsen, and Carrie, Larsen, and Sabin, and by using another method by Arias de Reyna, Diolife, Shin, and Gabor BC. And 2015. Okay, if we are in the O-type case or O-type, we can prove a similar result. Prove a similar result, but it's a little bit ugly because we have eight options and no two options. But Celery. So in the O-type case, we have that the image of robot approach is isomorphic to P G O plus minus and And F L S because we have to, we can not distinguish between the split and quasi-split in this case. So P O N F L S P S O N F L S plus minus plus minus and P omega n plus minus F L F. minus F L S because SO is not simple but it has a index to subgroup of contained here and omega is just that that group. Okay so okay and this this case is is a continuation of my PhD thesis with with Okay. So the idea of the proof is looking in the maximal properties of groups of the symplectic or orthogonal groups and prove that the image of these kind of representations can These kinds of representations cannot be contained in each case. For example, when we are in the dimension two, the proof is easy because we don't have a lot of maximal subgroups. So, for example, when n is equal to 2, the maximal subgroups of pg. Of PG L2FL S are upper triangular matrices, groups, dihedral groups, permutation groups like A4, A5, and S4, and PSL two FLM or M or PGL to FLM for some M dividing S. So to deal with this case, we just prove that if the image of the local representation drop Q is contained in this kind of groups, then the image is contained, in fact, in the Image is contained in fact in the diagonal, then has the image of this representation is non-Abelian group. We have a contradiction. To deal with these three cases, we just choose P greater than seven, for example, and we have an element of order greater than seven, and these groups don't have. Groups don't have an element of this kind. And if we are in the dihydral case, we used to prove that if the image of rho q rho bar is contained in the dihydral group, then it should be contained in In this cyclic group. So, like this is non-abelian, and if this is contained here, we have a contradiction too. So, the only options are these options. Okay. So, if we want to do the same for higher dimensions, we have to do the same by looking at all the maximal groups. It's a hard work, but it's possible. Okay, so we have seen that the maximal induced representations are very nice, but does there really exist or not? Because the maximum Because the maximally induced representation depends on the restriction to the composition group, and that these representations are isomorphic to some particular constructions. Okay, so the question is does maximally induced representations Really exists? So the answer is yes, and is thanks to some parts of the line lens program. Okay, so let me explain the idea of the proof of the existence of this kind of colour representations. Of colour representations. So let's let's assume, for example, that row. A row q is of S type. We can do the same for the O type. Let me explain the S type. Okay, if rho Q is of S type, we have a local irreducible representation, Galois representation from GQQ to S P N. And QL bar. Okay, then by using local angles correspondence, we can associate to this irreducible representation a supercuspital representation. Tau Q super cuspidal representation of SON plus one kidal. This is thanks to the work of Jan and Sutri for the local landlands correspondence in the generic case. Here we have to assume that this is generic. Okay, this is a result of 2004. Then, if we have a local supercuspidal representation, generic. Cuspidal representation, generic, we can globalize that representation by using a globalization results like the similar to the results of Harry's talk, for example. So we can associate by globalization in this case, thanks to the work of Carol Larsen and Sabin from two thousand From 2008, we can construct an automorphic representation, a global automorphic representation. Automorphic representation generic of SO and N plus one AQ. Okay, then we can use Langland's functoriality to construct an automorphic representation of GON. So here we can use Langlands functoriality, global Langlands functoriality. In this case, This language functorality in the generic case is thanks to the work of Cogdell, Gim, Piateski, Shapiro, and Shahidi from 2004. And we can construct an automorphic representation pi. Which is regular algebraic essentially self-actual cuspida of GLN AQ, which lifts the tau Q to PQ, lifting tau Q to pi, to pi Q. Okay, then for the regular algebraic essentially self. For the regular algebraic essentially self-galcus pedal automorphic representations, we can associate Galois representation, global Galois representations. Then, by using the work which comes from Clausel until Genevieve, Harris and Shin 2013. We can associate a Galva representation probably. bar representation property L from TQ to GLNQ L bar such that rho pi L restricted to a decomposition group at Q is just isomorphic to rho Q. So this Gala representation is a maximally induced representation. Maximally induced representation at the prime q of order p. So we have a method by using several parts of Langland's correspondence and Langlands functoriality to construct this kind of representations. Then, if we apply this method for infinitely many couples of prime, p and q, we can prove, we can realize infinite. we can realize infinitely many Galois Galois groups well infinitely many groups of matrices as Galois groups. So let me let me write the following corollary. So where are you? For each prime L we can prove that at least one of the following groups Groups in the S type the groups are PSPN FLS or PG SPN FLS at least one of these these two groups are Calva groups over Q Over q four infinitely infinitely many powers s okay. So we okay here is s and s okay. So we will lost the the control and the the powers a little bit, but we can realize matrix groups for Matrix groups for matrix with coefficients in big fields. And we can do the same for the O-type case for each prime L, at least one of the eight groups that I write before, P omega plus minus N F L S. S P S O N plus minus F L S P O N plus minus F L S or P G O plus minus N F L S. At least one of these eight groups can be realized as Kala groups. For infinitely many powers of s. Okay, so this is a very nice application of several parts of Langland's program to a classical problem. So the first part is also a result of Carriel, Arsene, and Savin. And this part is a result in a joint work with Luis Diolife. So finally, to have a complete list where we can realize Calva groups by using this method, let me talk about a little bit a result of A result of Carol Larsen and Sabin when n is odd, when the dimension is odd. When the dimension is odd, the construction, the automorphic construction is a little bit more complicated because we need a supercuspidal representation of depth one, nor depth zero, like these cases. Like, like these cases. But it's possible. And Carrie, Larsen, and Sabin in 2010 proved the same result by the following set of groups T omega N F L S FLS or BSO and FL F L S. Here we also have only two possibilities. In this case, we have a lot of possibilities because for groups of the type, we have split and quasi-split cases, and we have more different groups here. Okay, so by using the same Using the same technique, Carrier, Larson, and Sabin also prove that the exceptional group G2FLS can be realized as Galois group 2 for infinitely many powers of S. So I think that I stop here. Are there any questions? Zoom, are there any questions? Yes, thanks. Hello. I was curious uh if there were if it was possible to do something with something like G two, an exceptional group with the language correspondence and they The language correspondence and the inverse calor problem? The construction of Carrie-Larsen and Sabin is special for the particular choice of supercuspital representation. So we don't have the proof for all local languages. So yeah, so I guess I presented this correctly. So how does what is required? Because we have a local language and then there are some global results. And then there are some global results. Ah, okay, what's required? In this case, we need a land length parameter which corresponds to a supercuspidal representation of deep one. It's much more complicated. That is not an induced representation of a character, for example. And then the procedure is almost the same. procedure is is almost the same yeah in fact this this is a particular case with with a little bit more restriction than this case when n is equal to seven so he he proved the the result for for for the orthogonal groups and then when we are in the seven dimension he he applied a little bit more restriction little bit more restrictions to obtain to obtain G2. But this method works also for totally real fields, for example. And if you ask for unitary groups or TLN, for example, thanks to the work of Shulzi, we have now regular algebraic. have now regular algebraic ecusical representations without without this this condition but in the construction we have to do a base change and then when we arrive to the galo representation we have a galo representation of some extension of q no of q and we don't know how to descend to to q for example any other quick questions Questions Oh yeah, thank you for the very nice talk. I was wondering, is there any hope to get any control on what powers of S do appear? What powers of S? We can control a little bit if we choose carefully the prime p, but be but we don't know how to to avoid the big holes between some power and we don't know how to do that and and we don't expect anything about that because because the the the the the the election of of the prime p is by using density theorem so it could be very large after but Any more questions? Any questions on Zoom? All right, let's thank our speaker once again.
