Compatibility of the canonical LALEC local systems on exceptional shamoro prices. The work I'll talk about is joint with Christian Presbyter. It's still being finished, but hopefully it will be done soon. Let me begin. Let me begin with some broader context. There are a number of different contexts to try to put this question in, but this is how we came to it. So let me start in a much more general situation. So suppose X is a smooth, quasi-projective complex variety. And just to fix the ideas from now, I suppose we have a nice compactification of the sort that resolution of singularities provides, so that straight normal cross. So that strict normal crossing superiser complement at infinity. And let me just write gamma. And tell me if I'm not loud enough, if you're here or if you're not here, be the topological fundamental group of x, some base point, and consider a representation. Consider a representation fundamental group to say G of C or G a connected productive group. And so then, you know, natural question you might ask, interested in things like the Fontene-Maser conjecture, is, well, is there any condition you can put on this homomorphism that somehow guarantees that it comes from algebraic geometry, comes from cohomology of some family. So that's very speculative. That's a very speculative thing to think about, but here's a sort of specific context for a setting of this conference. Let me call this a function maser type conjecture. It's the following, so this would not be a contextual necessary. Conjectural necessary and sufficient condition, but necessary, sorry, a sufficient condition. It's a conjecture due to Carlos Simpson. So suppose, just for definiteness, that rho is irreducible, g irreducible in the sense of the last talk. And And satisfies some necessary conditions to come from geometry. One image in the abelianization of G is finite. So this gamma, this is like, this is discrete. Discrete. Right, so it's like a tool gamma Completion right. Yeah, starting with discrete C's here two 2 coming out of the local monodromy theorem along the boundary. So rho has quasi-unipotent local monodromies along the boundary along each boundary component. Boundary component. So there, I mean, the picture is just R2, you delete a point, you get a little loop. And similarly, an Rn, if you delete Rn minus 2. And maybe just for reference later, let's call gamma i generator. So these are necessary conditions, and then we can impose a much stronger condition that is certainly not necessary to come from geometry. Not necessary to come from geometry, so and the far from necessary condition 3, and this is really where Simpson's conjecture has its part. Rho is rigid in the sense that It is an isolated point of a pseudo-moduli space of G representations of gamma with, say, fixed abelianization and fixed isomorphism class of local monodromy. One of my space representations, maybe row prime with, I'll just write depth for this map, depth row prime, step row, and conjugate over model phase, row prime of gamma i, conjugate to row gamma i. Then rho is rho comes from hormonology. And you might mean different things by this, probably not so clear. Not so clear just what one should hope for, but at least one perhaps reasonable formulation that's not too fancy is I E for a faithful representation of G there exists. There exists a family over X, well, or maybe over some open in X family Y over some U open that X. We call this F such that rho occurs as a subquotient, or rho restricted to pi 1 u occurs. It occurs as a subquotient as gamma representation, or pi 1 of u representation of maybe some sum of piece. That's some sort of conjecture, which is a very hard problem. Solve. solved by making that's when g is gln and x is punctured p1 and that's really the principal known case of this theorem of this conjecture Okay. So this setting of row rigid contains the following setting of a somewhat more tractable setting. And this is in fact the domain of Katz's proof, although it turns out to be the same setting for IGLD, one setting. One setting, broke homologically rigid. Cohomologically rigid just means you replace this condition of being isolated in the moduli space with being a smooth isolated point of the moduli space. And that's easily formulated colonologically, a sort of condition that's probably familiar in a deformation theory conference. So the kernel of the, I'll write I'll just write this for the induced action of adjoint action of rho on the Lie algebra to the direct sum over these different boundary components. I haven't said how many of them there are. It's just some finite number of these local monodroming groups. This kernel zero. 0. That's the colonological rigidity condition. It's banishing the tangible space in this decorated moduli space, the representations. And this condition, of course, holds if this is already zero. So rho, I don't know what to call this, very, very homologically rigid. This group itself is always. So this group itself is already scaled. So in particular, if you have gammas with representations rho, where you have this property, might expect those representations of great geometry. And in the arithmetic setting, there's a very famous context for this vanishing hold. Vanishing holds. And that's going to be the context of this talk: somehow we came to the problem from the more general setting and by failing in the more general setting. But. Sorry, what was the index on the sorry? It's the boundary components. Yeah, so x bar minus x is some union of di. I go from 1 to n. I go from 1 to n, and goes from I go from 1 to n. So, yeah, it's just saying that the local deformation problem or the local amount, or local restrictions are entirely constrained. So example of this last condition, fundamental example of this last condition. Doing more cool list is let me for just to avoid extra bookkeeping simplicity now and forever. Um let me um assume that g is over Assume that g is over q and the adjoint group is q simple, just we don't have to worry about multiple components running around there. Gamma inside of this adjoint group be an arithmetic subgroup. So g q be an arithmetic subgroup. And then assume you're in the rigid regime, or the super-rigid regime from Marbulis' theorems, which is that the real rank of this adjoint group, dimension of the maximal split torus, is at least 2, then this condition always holds. So then in fact, H1. H1 gamma v equals zero for all rational representations G to G L V since it's extremely deep theorem of Markolis. And we're going to work in the overlap of these two settings where we Overlap of these two settings where we have this complex geometry and we have this very strong homological rigidity. But to kind of sum up the discussion, this tells us that, in sum, Simpson's conjecture in this setting is, I mean, Is, I mean, modulo, how precise a conjecture any of these things really is, is roughly equivalent to DeWean's dream from the canonical novels of Shimura varieties paper, that general Shimura varieties but of course the mainstream The main stream in the radio regime. So, not for the GL2 Shimoto Braid, but for these real ramps with these two ones. Oh, but I don't cooperate. But general Shimoto Braids are modular motors and general here means. And general here means up to some assumption like rationality of the weight homomorphism. So Shamur varieties are by definition moduli spaces of Hodge structures of a very particular kind. And the problem is asking that those Hodge structures really come from colonology varieties. And that's that sort of Simpson's conjecture is asking for this rigid local system as well. Okay. Okay, this problem is extremely hard. And if you go to, say, an exceptional Shimura variety, I think one where we have no idea how to do this, except in the land of really speculative guesses. But let me maybe just make concrete the relevant Shimura ID setting here. So the Shimura. So the Schmoor varieties where this parallel is relevant are they come in a few flavors. Type E6 Shimora varieties, type E7 Shimora varieties, mixed type D Mixed type D shorter varieties. Type D. So that is there are two kinds of real groups that can show up as the Archimedean components of the G in a type D shimor datum. And this is where your Q symbol has both of them. And then there are Are there more varieties where this parallel is relevant and where we don't already have a good understanding of these questions? That's what I mean to say. Don't already have a good understanding mixed ID and then simply connected type return the on its D so it's just some classification of non-abelian type simple Shimura data has been the links for Ballis. And sort of for all the other Shimura data, whether they're in this rigid regime or not, we have, because of the work of Shimura and Lean and maybe finally known, some sort of moduli interpretation in terms of appealing motives of its parameters. The rota since I'm not known for GGL DNA by cuts, so it seems to be much more spectral but ah, so yeah, so I was just mentioning this as a known case of Simpson's conjecture. This has nothing to do with the Shimura variety setting because the variety here is just this function p1. The funny state has a good understanding, so it doesn't mean that inside. So, does it mean that in some setting related to this variety? Yeah, where x is a schmoor variety. Yeah, where the x is a schmoor variety. And this conjecture holds well not maybe not exactly this conjecture, but some point-by-point interpretation of the complex points of the abelian-type Shimura variety. Abelian type Shimura varieties as coming from some abelian motives. Yeah. Yeah, sorry, this is just sort of introductory. I'm not going to say anything about this conjecture, but this is where the problem comes from. So all this is just to say, you know, we're number theorists, so we're interested in oral varieties, whether or not we're interested in rigid focal solutions. Interested in rigid local systems on arbitrary complex varieties. And when we're talking about rigid local systems in the Shimura variety setting and want to avoid settings where any of the theorems we might be able to prove have already been proven, these are the types that we're looking at. That's that's all I'm saying. Okay. That that's just to have something in mind. Just to have something in mind. Okay, so let me state. And here I'll say something more precisely. So this will be a kind of a weak form of the main theorem, but it will articulate a way in which, well, these Shimura varieties aren't moduli of motives. Aren't moduli of motives, but they at least their points, say over number fields, at least all give rise to compatible families of eladic representations. See the eladic realizations of the conjectured modics, and the point of the theorem is that these eladic realizations are former models. So let's just go. So let's let termout be more formal, let GX be a smuridatum. I'll make a technical assumption. Always fiddle with the center of a general Shimora variety if you want to get Gao representations. And let me just make some pretty innocuous assumption. Assumption of the center, two points of the center are discrete in the finite delta points of the center. And let k0 inside the adult points be a compact double subgroup. Now, I said now and forever, assume that G ad is cube simple. Of course, if g ad is a product of cube simple, things would be able to multiply this result together, continue with g add cube simple and this rigidity assumption that the round cube simple. Rank. Your rank is at least 2. Probably all the notation I need. No, it's not all the notation I need. But should K0 be the canonical model of the reflex field? E GX of the Schmohr variety. So the model of the complex Schmohr variety, which is this manifold complex manifold union of locally symmetric. Varieties. So this variety now over some number field. And now to each number field, I'm saying this first just to have a more concrete statement. We need to number field f and let's say x. And let's say x in the f points of this and these representations that I'm going to write down now, I'll define later. So maybe I'll just say there is a naturally associated representation. Representation, say rho XL from, well I'll write gamma F is write G gamma zone gamma F's group of F R over F to G Q L for all L. And then here's the theorem. And then here's the theorem. And let me put it here to state it. I just want to say these form a compatible system. We actually do not manage to prove that. We only prove it in the add-on group. The hadronic productions. Hydraulic productions row XL add just means project down the adjoint group form a compatible system. In the sense that there exists some n which will depend on this point x such that for all v places of f not above Well, N L or L prime rho X L add and rho X L prime add are unramified at V and the resulting controversy classes of the value of the value of Conjugacy classes of provenius, or rather the underlying semi-simple conjugacy classes, or let me say the image of this in well space of conjugacy classes lies in sorry. So that's for L prime. It's too rational. And uh and there we go or maybe yeah. Looks better, exciting. This doesn't mean that they're conjugate in like to g of q rels. But if you prefer, just take q bar inside qlbar, and that's the essence of compatibility. This is fine. So I'm going to sort of take these classes, which now have a meaning. There we go. So yeah, this rationality gives sense to comparing these and sense to comparing these. So if you're in familiar abelian type cases like the Ziegl varieties GSP, these representations are basically teeth multiples of abelian varieties. And so we know that they form compatible systems. But if you leave the world where you have any sort of motivic interpretation, Any sort of motivic interpretation, then have no initial handle on making the hotel on comparison. When did I start? You have about half an hour. All right. So that's this kind of crude form of the statement. The theorem is really Not about individual Gau representations, but this is maybe easier to latch onto. It's really a theorem about hell addict local systems on these components of And that's what I'll describe more precisely next. But maybe before I do, let me make the comment. This is quite vexing if you think about these non-abelian types where we don't have moduli interpretations. Okay, this is, you know, this gives you something nice. Type V6 gives you some new information there. Type V7, it gives you. Information there. Type E7, it gives you some new information there. Gives you some new information in the mixed type D. Doesn't give you new information in that last case of the simply connected type DH because we're only showing this compatibility down on the branch. And that's unfortunate, but it's just a limited method. Maybe maybe somebody has some simple idea of how to do it better. I don't know if I'm going to do that. Alright, so let me do the setup for this. So let's just fix a base point, maybe all the way up the tower. The tower limit over all subgroups, compact open subgroups of K of the corresponding level K varieties. And under our assumption of discreteness in the central hypothesis. This limit behaves rather cleanly. This means it's a center assumption. So it's just some point which we can think of as being represented by here or there. And so that yields a base point the S K zero. Nothing here. And then let me take the geometrically connected component of this not connected thing containing this base point and a name for that. So let S K0 be geometrically connected. It's geometrically connected over certain numbers to build component of this containing this base point. And it's defined over some version of some extension of the Weitz field defined over. Over some finite extension, which I'm going to call D K0S of the reflex field. So these connected Shimor varieties aren't all defined over the reflex field itself, but over some extensions. And then, so from again, from the Again, from the ZG hypothesis, you can check that this map is a, say for k normal in k0, this map is actually a Galois cover with group K0 mod K, Galois with group And essentially by base changing to here, pulling back to this component, and then taking the component of the resulting fiber product that is induced by not this, but the base point all the way up the tower, you can get a pointed Galois cover of this space with Galois group inside here. And we basically go back and use our chosen base point S, and you get a representation of the image inside here. And now this is the tall fundamental variable. I'll always write top if I mean topological fundamental group, and otherwise I'll mean tall fundamental group. Group and then take the limit over k, and you get these canonical rules, I suppose. Canonical and so these are not defined over this arithmetic base. And these then working, projecting L by L give the local systems that I really am going to think about here. And since I'll be focused on the adjoint ones, let me preserve the simplest notation for the adjoint ones. So write row L Um from I'll omit this point here for a composite, I guess I can just draw the picture. This projects to K0L, and then this projects. Projects into the atom group. So I prefer to understand compatibility properties of these local systems, but only succeed down here. Um okay. Okay. And so, so then to formulate a statement here, so these are over the base F, or not F, E, E, K, 0, S, and we need to spread them out in order to formulate a compatible systems property where you work at closed points. But maybe before I do that, let me. Do that, let me just say the two tools we have to work with for these local systems. So, what we have to work with that we have to work with is That we have to work with is the following two features of this situation. One, we know the restrictions of these representations to special points. So understand row L restricted to special points of the Schmoor variety. This just the Just the characterizing property of the canonical model tells you how Galois acts on special points, and that can be translated into a description of this representation. And then the other fact that we know is that after we pull back to the topological fundamental group here, so the restriction along So we have the topological fundamental group of base change to C mapping to geometric telefundamental group. Sorry, let me go that way. Geometric a telefundamental group. So these representations are of the sort that Markulis tells us something about. So if I call this topological fundamental group of our chosen connected Shimura variety gamma, this is this representation that's conjugated. This representation has come together to the inclusion of gamma in G average. And so we'll have a lot to exploit. Okay. So then I can state the actual theorem. And I'll explain how these two pieces of information get used. There's some integer n and an integral model which I want to have some kind of distinct aspect. Some kind of distinct S. So write a very script SK0S over such a field was EK0S, and then I'm going to ignore primes of n completely such that One row Larger theorem. Rho L extends to this arithmetic model. Well, I just well I've already inverted n, so I just will invert one more. Oh. One more time. Oh. And then, second, we get the And then second, we get the compatibility properties of 1 equal to 2 for all L L prime and all closed points of this integral model where we avoid fibers. Fibers um rho L of rho of X and rho L prime of rho of X are equal in the sense of the previous theorem. So our r equal equal in yeah so I I do think you've got this overview I haven't actually written it down part you are check it out all right and yeah so that's that's the that's the underlying theory That's the underlying theorem, and then the previous theorem is recovered by specializing rational points. Previous theorem recovered specialized integration. I'll say a bit about the strategy. So, how do we use these facts? Yeah, maybe I'll maybe I should call these things that I can label. I'll call this. Label. I'll call this CM and I'll call this super rigid. So I'm using super rigid initial. Margulis' super rigidity gives us the following statement. Let's take our downloads. Let's take our gallon. Let's take any outgrade. We close the fuel to zero. We'll take two homomorphisms from gamma to g dad. And we're really going to use this the adjunct group here poems with sort of skins image. Then they agree up to an automarkism of gene. There exists some tau automorphism of G n over this build omega such that L1 is of build two. And so we'll apply this in some setting and get this automorphism ta and we'll really Ta, and we'll really want to show that this in our setting is an inner automorphism. But you should think of this g ad as being some restriction of scalars from some, you know, potentially as big as you want, field extension to Q of some absolutely simple group over that field extension. And so this group here is just lots and lots and lots of copies of some simple group. And this automorphism group includes everything, all these permutations as well as symmetry. Mutations as well as symmetries that think in that. So, in cases of interest, there'll be a lot of outer automorphisms here. For gamma is still the fundamental theorem. Yeah, it's our fundamental theorem. Is it only for Schmurbari or for Schmidt? No, no, so this, I mean, yeah, this setting that we are concretely working in are these real rank degrees of two in this Schmurberi setting, but Marboulis' theorem would imply this. Imply this just in the real ranks to open on compact over our context. Okay, so um so let me uh just give a a s a s a sketch of the um so yeah, maybe so. So yeah, maybe so sort of uh getting the getting the arithmetic models, so I don't have much time, I'll sketch this. So one, a sort of general argument tells you that for all L there's some integer n. There's some integer n that depends on L such that rho L expects to this model where you throw away these primes. I have a paper in which I've seen such a result proven. No, not the Shimura write is just some abstract result. Just as some abstract result ramification theory is this paper of Alexander Petrov, where the kind of deeper part of the theorem is about geometrically irreducible local systems automatically being almost a ROM or something. Some argument along these lines later in the paper. And so then the question is really arranging that these n of l are all some common n times l. Times L absolutely one basically something like this and this is where we will use rigidity so suppose that sorry these these models do the problem yeah these models are um very very soft um I'll uh I'll uh yeah, that was so. You just take a good compactification, simple normal crossing divisor compactification, rational way and spread it out to a relative strict normal crossing divisor compactification. That's what we'll use as a model. So we forget finitely many fibers no matter what. Outcomes are a property of the models if I chance. But okay, so suppose for some rho L a place V is bad for rho L, so it divides N of L. I mean, really, this NFL should feel an ideal, not just an integer draw. But it's good for some other draw L. Then we'll show that it's good for L. So, how do you do this? You have the rho L prime, and it now makes sense to restrict it to the V fiber, because V is a definition of a quid prime for rho L prime. So, this makes sense. So, this is how the special fiber. And this representation is automatically tamely ramified, and this has to do with the fact that it extends across extends already. Now, if I hold on this strict normal group divisor and thinking. So these factors are containing a formal group. Regardless of whether it factors Regardless of whether it factors through the tame fundamental group, we can apply Trinfeld's proof of Lien's conjecture. So by Lien's conjecture, I amplified slightly over G, but this is all due to Trinzel, ultimately resting on the function field of Language correspondence. Correspondence. This row L prime along the B fiber has an L companion. Say row. I'll use this notation. So this was L prime, and I'll write L prime to L. So it's now L addic rather than ah, L primatic. And because this was tame, the companion is tame. This follows from work of From work of Eric and Schmidt, giving various characterizations of tameness, namely that it can be checked pulling back to curves, and from the curve case, which is in Antwerp paper, wean. Hence, when we restrict this to the geometric fundamental group, I'll rewrite B bar. I'll rewrite B bar. This is the geometric fiber. This is TAME. Factors like this, and so it can be pulled back along the TAME specialization map to a characteristic zero representation. Representation. And in this case, the characteristic zero thing is just our original connected Schmurr variety. It's a surjective tainted specialization of homomorphism and can therefore be further pulled back to our gamma. And so we get this kind of topological analog. And this is also Zariski dense image. Check this, but so hence it's tau of the kind of canonical representation. We get this only over Over closure for some automatic density? Yeah, so Zariski density, already at the level of the geometric fundamental group, these homomorphisms are Zariski dense, and that comes from knowing that they factor through the tame. specialization map for L prime because we know that here to start with the complex representations are Zariski dense. And then Drinfeld, it's easier in this setting because we're Zariski dense, but essentially Drinfeld would tell us that the companion then has Zariski-dense image, and then you just make a small argument to show that the To show that the geometric fundamental representation of the companions still says gas. Now I don't have much time, right? I think a couple minutes. A couple minutes. Okay. So, all right. But but I have this board. But this tells you two things. Maybe I don't emphasize. Maybe I don't emphasize any details here, but basically this implies rho L is good at V. Because you can relate what rho L was to just some conjugate of Y2 disc companion. And so you can deduce that rho L factors through this tame specialization homomorphism. And that's basically what it means to be good at the work through what the specialization map is. But it also implies more. Once you know that this is good at V, this tells us that the V restriction of rho L is really a companion. Is really a companion, I guess I can write it this way, is tau of the L addic companion of the V restriction of rho L prime. So that says that the L addic and L prime addic representations along the V fiber are companions up to this mystery automorphism, Ta. But the situation is kind of messy. messy because this ta, okay, this tau depends on v, depends on l, depends on l prime. If you imagine fixing l and l prime and running through different v's, you're getting different tows for every v. You're not really showing that these things are companions at this point, but this is a starting point. And then step two is show all these automorphisms, tau, are inner. Ta or inner. So Drinfeld, in his proof of the Wien's conjecture, proves a more general result, which is if you're working on a regular scheme of finite type over z, and you take, say, an el-vadic local system, some necessary conditions. If for every kind of arithmetic For every kind of arithmetic curve on this regular scheme, you can pull back your local system and put the resulting scale representation of either a curve over a finite field or of a number field into a compatible family, then you can actually put the whole fundamental group representation into a compatible system. So if you the theorem is done if you already, the second theorem is done. If you already, the second theorem is done if you already knew the first theorem, is what Drinfeld tells us. We don't already know the first theorem, but we know the first theorem for special points. And so here, the thing to do is judiciously choose special points where known compatibility along these horizontal fibers that are Horizontal fibers that are special points. Here's this field, here's this base, here's the Shmura variety, the arithmetic thing, here's our V we're interested in, there's that fiber, and now we want to choose some CM point horizontal section here where we can use its intersection with the V fiber to To and known compatibility along this section to show this toys inner. Show all V this toys inner. And I should stop. So maybe I will just mention what the key ingredients are. So the idea So the idea is find, I'm using CM and special interchangeably, find some CM point. This will be defined over some extension. And this will be enlarging what I previously had as n, but it's an enlargement that you'll make once in the wall. Um maybe I'll say edit twiddles. So find a CM point like this where it hits the V fiber there, the image of Frobenius here in the pulled back representation is sort of Pulled back representation is sort of very generic. So, where, yeah, we call this CMY, where row L pulled back to Y evaluated at rho W for some prime W above V is very general. And this being very general, This being very general, and knowing that L and L prime are compatible here, but at the same time, ta of this is equal to this will then force this ta to be inner because very general will precisely mean something like that. So I'm out of time, so I shouldn't get into this. So, I shouldn't get into this too much, but basically, we use result from this recent paper, a fairly recent paper, Kissen, Matsupera, and Shin that they call sort of quantitative theory for Schmuer varieties that allows us to build these special points. Special points in exactly the way we need in order to arrange this very general condition. A kind of key part of this genericity for us that's not part of something like this is we need to select the torus corresponding to this CM point to be a Q irreducible torus. And that way all we really need to do is arrange that this Robenius image. Is arranged that this Rubenius image has infinite order, and that will somehow mean that anything that fixes it has to fix this entire maximal torus, and that's what's going to eventually chill the outer morsel. So I'm over, so let me stop there. Are there any questions? But when we said it then, does it show that tau is the as being fixed forever? And then you're going to find this n twiddles first. So this, actually I should mention this. These kind of coarse or soft canonical models that I was mentioning with Florian. Models that I was mentioning with Florian are those used in the Pila-Schunker-Simmerman work on the Andre-Oort conjecture. And they show that these have the property that you can find n such that all special points are 1 over n integral. So we kind of, you know, we use that initially, and then we don't have to make further. Then we don't have to make further changes to this n, and we can, for every v, look for a CM point with this property here. Are there any other questions? Does your construction give that these things are also like the wrong recursive link for sufficiently large L? So that's already known that that's proven by Um and uh Feng Shou was on this paper. They prove that all the points of Shimura varieties get used wrong in Galer institutions. They use their they prove this Duram rigidity theorem, where if you say it's again, which will be Yes, sorry. Yes, sorry, thanks. This Duram rigidity theorem, where if you know that one point is Duram, then every point is Duram, and then it's clear that CMS did. So just to kind of memory check any understanding at all. So like if you go to some V six mode running, you can just kinda like take a point and get a compatible system. Yeah. That's gonna get a new construction compatible system. Structured stuff. Yeah, so there's one previous construction of compatible E6 DAW representations, but they're one that was a lot more. But yeah. And these are non-regular people, so they're in a different Any further questions? Not let's thank Stephanie. Say the flow of the chart wasn't clear. So it's a little bit more. So we said they'll use that. Yeah, but you when you when you then build it a bunch of
