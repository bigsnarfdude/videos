Thank you. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, so I would like to first thank the organizers for the very kind invitation. So I was planning to join this meeting in person, but due to various family reasons, couldn't do it. So unfortunately, I have to do this online. Unfortunately, I have to do this online. So, for today, I will report some preliminary results on the study of distributional solutions for the 3D novel stocks and MHD equations with my master student, Mark Pino. So, yeah, this is still research in progress. So, I changed the title a little bit because we got some new results in the Get some new results in the recent weeks. Okay. So I mean, here everyone's an expert on the mathematical fluid mechanics. So first we recall the 3D incompressible Nervous Docks equations. So I'll consider the Cauchy problem just for simplicity. Now, the main equation. The main equations models the conservation of momentum assuming incompressibility. And for this 3D Navy-Stokes equation Cauchy problem, everyone knows that we can prove short time existence, or in other words, local in-time existence for classical solutions. And for this short time period, the classical equation, the classical solutions are also unique. Oceans are also unique, but then there's very little can be said beyond this short time period. And so, since about one century ago, since LaRoy's groundbreaking work, so when we hope for a general theory, then we consider a possible detour, like a curved approach, right? So, to consider the weak solutions, which may not be classical, which means it may Classical, which means it may not allow us to directly take derivatives as required in the equations. And then we hope that the weak solutions can be upgraded into classical solutions. So if we consider the weak solutions, then the most naive one would be just to consider the distributional solution because we can thanks to Because we can, thanks to the incompressibility condition, we can put the nonlinear term inside a divergence, right? So that way, then we can treat this equation number two in the distributional sense. And this leads to the following definition of distributional solution. So we consider locally squared integrable velocity field u. This way, every term in equation two will be well defined. Then we assume that it's divergence-free, and then we consider test functions that's contact supported, which allows to be non-zero at time zero, but otherwise vanishes near the boundary. Then we consider such divergence-free test functions and write the equation into equation three. Write the equation into equation three, right? So that's the kind of the weakest formulation of weak solutions. But then, unfortunately, I think there's not much conclusion can be drawn for such a solution. So in Leroy's groundbreaking work, he actually considered another type of weak solution that enjoys more regularity. So nowadays, we call it Nowadays, we call it the LeRay-Hopf solutions. So, for LeRay-Hopp solutions, then we consider the velocity to be in this particular space, right? So it's L2 in space, then the L2 norm is uniformly bounded, right? So it's essentially bounded in time, and then the H1 norm of U in space will be L2 integrable in. Will be L2 integrable in time. And then we can write the weak formulation slightly differently into an equation. So the difference is that since we now have gradient u well defined, then we don't have to put all the derivative on the text functions anymore. So we can write it into equation four like this. So note that. So note that here the derivative is put on u, and also here the derivative is also put on u. So that is in like sharp contrast to the situation for distributional solutions. And for the rehop solutions, we also require it to satisfy the energy inequality. So that is a natural relation. Relation that everyone believes should be satisfied for solutions for the number stocks equations. And so, what LeRay showed in 1934 is that such a solution exists, but of course, it hadn't been like people hadn't been successful to show the uniqueness for such a solution yet. Nevertheless, Lore Hop solutions, they enjoyed some nice properties. They enjoyed some nice properties. In particular, we will have this continuity in L2 for the solution for continuity at the initial time. So this is actually a very nice property. For example, if we say the original convex integration technique as illustrated in Professor Farrell's Professor Farrello's lectures. So, if we just use that construction, then there will be a jump at the initial time. So the ut for t immediately greater than zero will have energy smaller than the energy of u zero. Okay, so one natural question that we can ask is the relation between different formulation formulations. Different formulation formulations of weak solutions. So recently there are some nice papers showing that distributional solutions are the rehop through some extra assumptions. So the point here is that these extra assumptions, they do not involve derivatives. So in particular, we have In particular, we have Gaudi's 2019 papers, so two papers. So, in one, he assumed U is in L4, L4, right? So, it's L4 in time, L4 in space. In another, he assumed U to belong to this so-called prodigy sharing class, right? So, if it's in LRLS, and so three over S plus two over R less than or equal to one. So, here we are considering a three-dimensional equation. A three-dimensional equation. So, if we consider, say, n-dimensional, then the three in this relation will be replaced by n. And then a more recent interesting paper by Barcelli and Cheda Radi, so they showed that the distributional solutions are the way hop if we further assume that U is in LRLS when 12RR plus 12RS. Then 12 over R plus 12 S is less than or equal to 1. So with the extra condition that S is greater or equal to 4. So this condition 5, if we consider the red hop solutions, then it is a weaker assumption than the product sharing conditions. But I think if we just assume distributional solutions, then they are kind of independent. So the proof is based on So, the proof is based on a nice duality argument. So, we just have a very like wishful thinking basic idea for this duality argument. So, the problem with distributional solutions is that it does not have any regularity, right? So, the solution is only in L2 locally in space-time. So, the big idea. So, the big idea of Gaudi here is that how about we just create another function that enjoys such regularity, right? So, this other function, then it's naturally the solution to this linearized equation, right? So, we still use this distributional solution u, so as the velocity field here, but then we solve this linear equation. And by a standard method, you can show. Standard method, you can show that this linear equation has a solution that's in this standard space. So it's L2 in space with a uniformly bounded L2 norm, and then it's also L2H1. Now, of course, this equation we know is very similar to the original equation, right? So the hope is to show that V just equals U. And then we And then we automatically have U belongs to this same regularity space. And then we basically can just apply all those Larry Hopf technique now. Okay, so if we write down the equation satisfied by the difference, then we have equation seven. And for equation seven, we can see immediately that if Immediately, that if it is possible to find a phi, a test function phi, such that what's in here is so what's in here can equal to any test function, then we are done, right? So all we need to do is to be able to solve this equation, the phi equation, right, equals f. If f can be an arbitrary If f can be an arbitrary function, then we will have u minus v dot f integrate is always zero, then u of course must equal to v. Then the problem, of course, is that, for example, if we try to solve this phi equation directly, then phi, there's no chance phi will be smooth. So we cannot really use it in this as a test function. test function and also there are other issues in from six to seven okay so we have to we will have to do some regularization and then after we do this regularization or we take a limit there seems to be some delicate balances of indices that's necessary so making it kind of not not as Not as powerful as one wish. Okay, so we have one result for Narva stocks. So this result can be compared to some energy conservation conditions in the Prasadi Chedoradi paper. So our LRS LS space here is so it's a stronger requirement. So, it's a stronger requirement than those assumptions in that paper. But we notice that in that paper, the result is about energy conservation of Larry-Hopf solutions. So he's assuming it's Larry-Hopf. And in the proof, the fact that you have uniformly bounded L2 norm and also L2H1, so both are crucial in the proofs. Crucial in the proofs. So these bounds are not available if we are dealing with a distribution of solutions. So, on the other hand, if we look at these indices and if we just naively do the sublife bedding, then we see it's scale from a scaling point of view equivalent to U in LRLS prime, where S prime is given by that. And then we can see that. Then we can see that if we consider R over 2 plus 3 over S prime, then so we see that it's a weaker assumption than the product serving class. And also, if we consider this requirement that R over 2 plus, sorry, 2 over R plus 2 over S prime, then we can see that for. Prime, then we can see that for our range of parameter, so it's greater, so it's also a weaker assumption than the main result here for Basali Cheddar Valley. But of course, there is really nothing very miraculous here because I mean, we know that when you try to And we know that when you try to use this kind of solvent type estimate, then if we put assumptions on the gradient, then usually you can get better results from a scaling point of view because sometimes you don't need to do some integration by parts anymore. Okay, now so we sketch the proof. So first, from Gaudi's result, we know that our candidate We know that our candidate, like our auxiliary solution, the existence is guaranteed. So all we need is locally in L2. And for the proof, it's basically a gallery method. So from this proof, all we can conclude is L2 based bounds. So we have this V in weakly continuous L2. weekly continuous L2 and then L2H1. Now, what we have to do is we have to like we cannot really directly use this V. So what we do is we consider the equation 8, but with a velocity field, a smoother version. So we replace U by its basetime modification, and we solve this equation. We get V. And we solve this equation, we get v epsilon. So, of course, v epsilon is now a smooth function satisfying this energy type inequality. And then what we do is we try to let phi, the test function, so we will let it solve basically the same equation, but backward, because what we want is we want the test function to be possibly non-zero at time t equals zero, but it has to be equal to the term. t equals zero, but it has to vanish near time t. So we solve it backwards, starting from time t. Okay. And then once we do that, just some simple manipulation, we see that at the end of the day, what we want to show is that the right-hand side of this equation ni will go to zero as epsilon goes to zero. So now u minus u sub epsilon, so that part. sub epsilon so that part is relatively easy right so because okay so so so that will go to zero in our assumed space right so LRLS because u epsilon is just a modified version of u and on the other furthermore like this this u here it also satisfy the same it Same, it's in the same space. So, finally, all we need to do is just to use some Hoder's inequality and sub-leaf embedding. And when we do that, we will see that the conditions on everything are like this. And if we unravel every such algebraic relations, then we will see that r equals 8s over 9s minus 12. S minus 12. So I feel that there's a really much more should be able, like we should be able to do like following this line of thought, but so we are still working on it. Then we also tried to apply the same method to the 3D MHD equation. So everyone here is also very familiar with the 3D MHD equation. The situation for classical The situation for classical solution is similar to that of narvis dogs, and we can also similarly define the distributional and the so-called like LeRay-Hopf. So we just call it LeRay-Hop solutions. So they are all very similar. And then people have applied this duality result to. Oh, sorry. So this second one is not like young anymore. So people also applied this duality result to the MHD, and they recovered basically Gaudi's result. So the natural question is like if we apply the same result in Bersait's paper, can we obtain the same thing? So the answer turns out to be yes. And there's really not too much difficulty in there. So I'll just explain the Explain the main ideas of perside chat already, so which is a very clever idea. So, now if we return to novel stocks and recall that the key issue is to show that this integral go to zero. So, if we look at this, then we will see why L4L4 is special. It's because, so u minus u epsilon, right? So, that goes to zero. So that goes to zero in this, like our space of our assumption. So we assume u to be in certain Boschner space, then of course u minus u epsilon will go to zero in that space. So now the point is phi epsilon solves this backward equation. So the natural bound for phi epsilon is the energy bound. So Energy bound. So in the natural bond, the gradient of epsilon is has a form bound L2L2. And on the other hand, U minus U epsilon and U, they are in the same space. So that means that space has to be L4L4. So that's why the L4L4 situation is the situation that's most easily proved. Now, if we want to If we want to improve it to some LRLS, then what do we need? Then what we need is we need gradient phi epsilon to be uniformly bounded in a different Boschner space, right? So which space? If we look at the situation, we see if U is in LRLS, then of course the gradient Fibson has to be in this L alpha L beta where alpha is. Where alpha is s over 2, beta is r over 2. So now s is greater than or equal to 4, so basically s greater than r. And furthermore, we observe that 1 over alpha, 1 over alpha plus 1 over beta actually equals 1 over 2 plus 1 over 2. So what is 1 over 2 plus 1 over 2? What is one over two plus one over two? So it comes from here. So that tells us what we need to do is we need to kind of do some iteration to start from gradient phi epsilon in L2, L2 and increase the integrability in time and decrease the integrability in space to arrive at this L alpha L beta. L alpha L beta. And this is achieved in Bersetti Cheddar Radi by the following result. So if we start from L alpha L beta for gradient phi epsilon, then we can see that with the assumption on u epsilon, then we can obtain this guy, right? So this is in some L alpha prime, L beta one, then alpha prime and beta one are given by those relations. So why do we do that? So, why do we do that? We do that because what we can do is we can move this term to the right-hand side, put it together with forcing, right? And then we will have a stocks system. So, for stock system, we have nice regularity results. So, the one that used by Bercelli is they show that if like if we have this as the four thing on the right-hand side, then we will have. Side, then we will have a bound for these guys. So now, once we have bound for these guys, then we basically are in a situation of a sublife embedding for Boschina space, right? So we have this one time integral in this space, and then we have this space that does not have time integral, but we have stronger spatial differences. Differentiability, right? So we can actually take two spatial derivatives. And in their lemma, it shows that when you do that, so I think this is actually a gradient phi. So when you do that, you can keep the spatial regularity, but improve the time integrability. So that means we can make this gradient phi epsilon into L alpha 1. phi epsilon into l alpha one l beta one alpha one is given by this coming from here right then the beauty of the whole thing is that if we have 12 over r plus 2 over s equal 1 then alpha 1 1 over alpha 1 plus 1 over beta 1 equals 1 over alpha plus 1 over beta so with the yeah so with beta 1 gets smaller alpha 1 gets bigger so if we start from alpha beta equals two and two alpha beta equals two and two then we will have the spatial integrability going down and the time integrity going up which is exactly what we need here so alpha greater than beta okay so now if we apply this um uh this framework to mhd then we can prove uh the mhd uh so upgrade the distribution solution uh to the red hop solution um with uh With the same condition as in the narrow stocks, basically. So we got different conditions on UMB, but that seems to be very difficult because of this whole framework for MHD. What you have, you will have U here, then B, then you have, so U, U, U, B, B, U, B, B. So basically, So basically, since the in the middle, gradient Phi epsilon is basically the same regularity. So that will force U and B to have integrity. Yeah, so I guess that's all I want to say. Thank you very much for the attention.
