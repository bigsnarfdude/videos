For inviting me here. I enjoyed it so much so far. And today I will talk about some older topic gene set tests and some new topics about cell cell communication in single cell RSC data. And I know I'm ambitious to try to squeeze two topics together, but I don't try my best. Again, GSI testing has been there for more than 10 years. I started doing it like maybe five years ago when I was a PhD. But as discussion earlier, this has been widely used in the past for biocurrency, and recently, even in single-cell RNA data, people still use it a lot. But there are definitely new features we need to pay attention. We all know single-cell RNA data has a lot of zeros, whether it's zero information or not, we have the debate. But generally speaking, also a lot of cells, and from what I understand, there are two types of correlations. One can be from the One can be from the different cells from the same sample or same donor. The other layer information are the gene gene correlation. Generally, the gene gene correlation in single-cell RNC data may not be equal to the gene gene correlation in Valkyrie-C data. So that's something we want to pay attention also in gene-centered testing. There are many kinds of gene-side testing methods. I think earlier we talked about there are different kinds of differential Different kinds of differential stories, you know, differential expression, differential variability, differential correlation. The most popular gene set testing are still based on the differential expression analysis, and that's what I will focus today. Typically, by definition, geneset test, the genes by size define the priority, and the size can be from pathways, it can be a pathway, gene oncology pathway, and it can also be from other people's experiments. Be from other people's experiment. When you use existing defined pathway for GSIs, that's really to ask whether this pathway is more important considering the sample comparison, say disease or non-disease, versus the other pathways. On the other hand, sometimes if you use other people, like generated so-called GSIs, your underlying story might be to look at the similarity. Be to look at the similarity between your comparison with other people's comparison. So that's two kind of hypotheses behind the gene set tests. Although the first type is more popular, generally speaking, gene set has still higher power, better interpretation, and still three typical steps, even for such a long time. Firstly, we want to do some say differential expression analysis at the individual GN level, then do a summary statistic using Then do a summary statistic using some reasonable way, and in the end, they want to do the statistical inference for PO animals. From again, my understanding in the past 10 years, they always give you at least there are two type of non-hypothesis there, either based on permuting of genes or permuting the samples. Permuting gene means it's kind of, I showed the sort of the figure here. Permuting genes, we even call it For mutant genes, we are going to call it competitive gene cyber testing because it really asks whether the sets of genes in your pathway again are more significantly associated with the sample loop than the other, like the random selected gene sites. However, a promoter of say sample labeling or cell labeling in single-cell case is really to ask, you know, for the set of G you are interested in, are they significantly associated? Are they significantly associated, say, with cluster or with samples, but without consideration of the other gene's? So that's to, I think, you know, when we talk about gene-set testing or data analysis, it's always important to know exactly what's the non-hypothesis behind it. Yeah, there are existing gene-set testing methods. I think something has to be hidden in the lower of the screen. From what I know, at least, there is a gene set testing module in MAST and CR. In masked, and Sean developed the idea methods. So there are others, but those are sort of the popular ones. Again, it's from the old story that we learned. The correlation between genes can make some difference during the test. Basically, the variance of the neurang, because sort of the neurank test is one of the copulary to do gene-side testing, the variance of neurang can be affected by averagely positively current. Averagely, positively correlated GA within the gene set. Based on empirical data, we mostly observe averagely positive correlation in a gene set. Because if you have many genes in a gene set, the urgency wouldn't be strongly negative coloring. So and here we basically show only the average correlation within the disease center. So to make the inflation of the virus. And to consider the average correlation. To consider the average correlation in the gene set, you have adjusted the variance estimation to sort of better control the type of error in that way. We learned that about 10 years ago, you know, in barcode and CP data. Then for the new single-cell RCP data, we sort of wanted to develop something from there. So, here our framework is to consider multiple samples in multiple sample groups. Groups that sort of we face nowadays, not just for biosample, and particularly by interested gene sets associated, like at the differential expression level associated with the sample groups, for example, disease or non-disease. This is a flowchart for the methods. Yeah, so they have cell types, genes, and different sample groups with biological replicates. They previously developed something called 2-sigma. Something called the two sigma, is a two-component zero-infinity and negative binomial distribution. We sort of consider of the so-called subject effect or donor effect in the random effect model. And then later we extend that at the GSF level. So we use 2 sigma to sort of do the differential expression analysis for the single cell data. We have the rank of the Z scar, and then we sort of use the residual space from 2 sigma to measure the integing. To measure the intergene correlation and use that to adjust the rank level variance for the just state, we are considering some rank tests and then sort of present some visualization. Yeah, there are details, but I miss details. Something I want to mention, we don't have zero inflation component there, but it's very flexible. You don't have to have it if you don't need it. So, and in practice, I will scale some. So, and in practice I also just use the natural binomial part. But the random effect due to subject or donor still play an important role here. This is basically how we estimate the intergene correlation at the residual level because the correlation needs to be considered when it's conditional on the other covariance you are not interested in. So, our methods Uh so our methods uh basically hold typewrite error and has put the power on the uh left you mostly see type of error and uh here is negative power. Uh I it's probably harder to see the detail. We compare them with the several existing meters. I didn't hold the camera arrow by out, but I think we have better power in terms of using the full data instead of the meta status test status cheek. So and yeah, maybe here okay. So, and yeah, maybe here I consider different scenarios. For example, you know, because it's a competitive test, so your background genes can be differentially expressed, but may not so differentially express as the gene in your cell. So, that's the simulation here. You know, the results, it's basically arranging cell tests, you'll first get a G, you know, some D analysis test results, number of genes, significant gene level, and the significant gene Gene level and the significant gene size level. Here, it's like even use FDR adjusted p-value 0.2, which is kind of detail, right? It's not very conservative. We didn't use FDR 0.05. We have around 50 gene sites there. It's not very large. I think if we use FDR 0.05, it will be more conservative. Generally speaking, competitive gene site tends to be more conservative. And then in the end, we take the top. And then in the end, we take the top most significant gene sets across all the sort of clusters using this example data, but comparing HIV versus small samples in the humanized mass spleen. We found a lot of interferometer-related pathways, and people believe interferometry is about the treatment for HIV infection. So that kind of connected the story, but again, we have other. Story, but again, we have other examples in the paper. So I switched the gear to the next topic. My student Ari community leaded the work, and Ho-Yang and Shu Men work on another single-cell related topic for vivariat zero-equality negative non-mediation for the co-expression in single-cell RNC data. And then great area, single-cell level, cell-cell communication. The whole assumption of The whole assumption of what we believe is that cell-semotion communication is sort of mediated by the intracellular ligand receptor interaction. There are databases mostly for immune cells to show what are the ligand and the receptor should be a pair to bond together in humans. So that's good. We have some prior knowledge and I think in the field there are different data sets to show how they bond and that's still of the question how we consider different reference. Consider the different reference database for like a receptor bumping, we use about them. And in the early stage, I think people first only consider the strengths of cell-cell communication, maybe even between different sample groups, but didn't pay much attention to what are exactly the megan receptor make the difference. And then later, like the recent review paper also compared several methods conceptually. Methods conceptually, however, all the methods, I think there are probably 10 methods there for single, sorry, it's a type of single-cell RNA data, but they are all basically to identify the cell cell communication associated with cell clusters, not sort of between different sample groups or with multiple samples. That's why we sort of work on something new. Again, this is a review paper, so it's very small, but based on this, Small, but based on this review table, there is only one sort of targeted comparison between different samples, and yeah, so that's the motivation. Again, that's the real data. We focus on PDC and ILC baseline collaborator suggestion. We propose the so-called VCCC vimation data because it's still sort of wrap-up. We particularly look at each time a pair of magnetic receptors to see whether. Of megan receptor to see whether the connection score between this pair is significantly associated with the sample groups, for example, you know, associated HLA infection, and particularly for a pair of cell types. So each time when we talk about cell cell communication, it's always a pair of genes, negative receptor, and a pair of cell types. The two cell the two pair of cell the pair of cell types can be the same because uh cells can talk to their own. Talk to their own webpad. We use two component models to handle its many zeros. And we also particularly consider random effector model to allow correlation among genes from the sample. And then our method allow for comparison between two and more sample groups. That's the flowchart. So basically, we start with the same, we start with legendary. Same, we start with ligand receptor pair, you know, cluster, but you know, compared to that review paper, we also have the bedymetrics because we have multiple samples there. And then from there, we thought we use the two-component model to consider, you know, on one side, a logistical regression for zero, not zero, and then for sort of continuous variable that is not zero. So that's basically the model, but I wouldn't go into detail. We just fit a Detail, we just feed sort of the data into the four components and independently. And then we have the coefficient beta here. We sort of assemble that as the product of the coefficient to represent the connection score for the four of them, and then do the test. I will skip this show. We are also thinking about Google. Type and error is well controlled. So we use real data for cell computation. And therefore, if you scenario of the simulation, the real data also confirmed there is no strong correlation between the p-values in the continuous component and the discrete component. That's good because we don't want to concrete with each other. And then there are different filter procedures. Again, the method is invariant. And the method is invariant to the different filter procedures. This is a way to show the eigen receptor direction, it's not easy, but generally speaking, they have the sensitivity to detect something previously like a cell phone DB can't identify. The future is in spatial transferism. So that's helping. Thank you. And because you guys check that, it's time for a couple of questions. Race through that. There's time for a couple of questions while our next meeting comes down to get set up. So, questions? Do you have a favorite? You picked the gene sets. Can you just tell us a little bit about what your current favorite is?
