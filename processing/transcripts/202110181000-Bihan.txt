Give the more or less the same talk in Brown Schweig in July, so there is some differences, but not so much. So sorry for those who were already in my talk in July. Okay. So hopefully it is a beginner. Everybody can read. Yeah. So So the first part is really the same part, the same as my talk in July. The aim of the talk is to give a panoramic talk, Peter, but this time about the counting part of the workshop. So not about stable polynomials, but counting things about real polynomials. And in fact, we want to count real solutions of polynomial systems. Sorry, Frederic, maybe you can hide the right part, the right panel, so the slides are wider. Like this, it's okay. No, no, if you touch this small triangle, will hide the right panel, the right menu, and then. Ah, you mean this one? You go down, and there is a small triangle that will hide that. Okay, okay, so it's been yours. Well, it doesn't matter. Please go on. Okay, no, what doesn't matter? Please go on. No, no, no. Let me let me see. If you go down, you there is a small triangle that allows you to hide this part. What doesn't matter? Okay, sorry. I don't see why we're trying to. That's okay. Sorry. Let me just know it's okay. Okay, let's go like this. So my slides are a bit dancer, so don't A bit dance, huh? So, don't worry, I don't want to say every word in each slide. So, the aim also is to give you at the end you have some complete slides and you can understand easily after the talk and when reading the slides. So, I recall briefly the classical descarto of science, which is about the number of positive roots of rare Roots of rare polynomial in one variable. And this is a very old result. And so you write your polynomial in one variable in the standard way. So this starting from the constant coefficient and finishing with the term of giving you the degree of the polynomial. And so you write the coefficient in the you number the coefficient according to the number the coefficient according to the degree of the monomulants to the increasing degree of the monomulants okay and uh so if air is a degree you know uh we everybody everybody knows here that the polynomial has at most a degree of polynomial complex roots and what we want to to know is the number of positive or where roots and And the Descartes raw signs tell you that, in fact, you can just count the sign of the coefficient. So I made some sentence here explaining that in the real world, you have some natural ordering. So this is like a philosophical idea. In the real world, you have some natural ordering, creating ordering, which gives you a sign for a real number. You just compare it. A real number, we just compare it to zero to zero. So, this word, the natural ordering signs, are very important in real algebraic geometry, as you will see later. In particular, descarto signs use look at the sign of the coefficients and look at the sequence of the coefficients numbered according to the increasing degree of the corresponding moments. So, you have science and ordering in the Science and othering is a discountable science. Okay, so let me just have made a small example. So if you look at the polynomial, which is minus one plus three, the square of x plus eight, this x to the to three, and so on. You look at the at the coefficient and uh don't forget to to uh forget about the zero coefficient, just look at the coefficient you see really. Look at the coefficients you see, really, so which are not zero. You look at consecutive coefficients and you compare the signs, lines, and you compute the number of sign chains in your sequence. So, in my example, the sign variation is free. So, my polynomial F in my example has at most three positive waveholds according to discard rules. And moreover, the scattered rules. And moreover, desktop sign gives you that the difference between the number of positive error roots that I count with multiple CT and the sine variation is always an even integer number. So, and there is also one very important property of the scatter option, obviously, the scatter of sign is a property that it is sharp. I mean, I mean, I can, if I take, I fix monomulas and I fix a sine variation corresponding to this monomula, I can find coefficients which satisfy this sine variation and such that the corresponding polynomial exactly the sine variation positive overall. So this is really sharp. Okay. Okay. So an easy consequence of descartov sign is that you just forget about the sign of the coefficient, just look at the number of non-zero coefficients. It gives you the length, if you forget about the coefficients, the length of the seconds of non-zero coefficients. And obviously, the sign variation is not more than the length. Not more than the length minus one. So you get what we call now a phenomenal bound, which is which is that the number of positive rare roots is not more than the number of non-zero coefficients in US one. So the number of monomials which really appear in your polynomial in US1. And using that, you easily obtain the same for the number of negative roots, and then you get. Number of negative roots, and then you get another polynomial bonds for the number of rare roots of your polynomial, which is two times the number of monomials minus one. So, and the name phenomenal bond comes from the key observation that these bonds that I just described might be way smaller than the degree of the polynomial. Of the polynomial. So, in particular, it means that many complex roots cannot be real or positive. And this is really smaller than the degree when many coefficients of the polynomial. In other words, where the polynomial has few monomials. So, this is the reason for the name phenomenal born. So, morally, you have few monomials, you have few real roots, but the You have few real roots, but the number of complex routes is always the same. This is a degree if you count with multiplicity. Okay? Okay. So I already made this resume here. And so you have the degree, the number of complex rules, and you have some function which is parallel. Function which is bound on the total number of monomers, which gives you a bound for the number of real roots, and also another function of the same type, which gives you a bound for the number of positive real roots. And you also have the Descartes Row assignment, which is more finer, it gives you a bound for the number of positive rehords looking at the sign of the non-zero coefficients. So one goal, at least my goal and the goal of my several people here, is to get the generalization of this descriptual of science and also of the phenomenal bones in the multivariate case. And since we want to count something, it is natural to want to count the number of real solutions of polynomial systems, but we will see later. Systems, but we will see later, and you will see a talk this week that we can also try to count the number of connected components of algebraic IP surface, for instance. But in this talk, I will concentrate on the case of polynomial systems. So, I am looking at polynomial system and polynomials equation and variables. And I want to get generalization of this previous result. It's a quite useful. So for the number of complex solutions, everyone, the naturalization of the degree bond is a Besou bond, which is just a product of the degrees of the equation. But you also have another bond which we don't see in the new. We don't see here in the new Nival case because this is coincident more or less with the Turbibond. This is a Bernstein-Cochnierian compound. And this to explain this bound, we need to do some notations. So now I write a polynomial in L variable in the form which is written here. So I write my monomial in L variable x1 xn using the standard. using the standard notation multivariate notation and uh i have a and now i have a set uh a set a finite set in uh in z to the n and uh z to the n because i i want to look at the solution with no zero coordinates so i can do that and this is a finite set because i want a polynomial and the coefficients are depend on each on the element of this set and are real numbers And are real numbers because I want to consider real systems. And in fact, I want to, what is important is to consider the monomials which appear with another non-zero coefficient. And I call the set of monomials or the set of vectors in z to the n with this property the support of the polynomial as in the tool by Peter just before. So this one I have one polynomial When I have one polynomial, I look at the support of this polynomial. This is a set of more or less a set of monomials appearing with zero coefficients. And when I have a system, polynomial system, so I have n equation, n variables, I can have less equation if you want. The support of the system is just the union of the individual supports. Sorry for my cat. Okay, so this is a standard things. And if you look at the born for about the number of complex solutions, solutions is a complex stories. You have, as most of you know, the Bernstein and Baby Careborn. So you have two versions. Either you bound the number of solutions in the complex stories by the volume, interior volume of the total support, or you can be better. Be better and do better and use the integer mixed volume of the individual support, which is less than the volume of the total support. So, already in the complex part, we have non-trivial hyperbond for the number of complex solutions. And this, more easily, these bonds take into account about the convex pool of the support. The convex the convex pool of the support and they look at they use the volume different kinds of volume of the convex pool of the support but they don't take into account of the really of the monomials which occur i mean they only count the the take into account of the vertices of the of the supports which means uh they they completely uh forget about the monomers which are inside which can have zero or not or non-zero coefficient okay Know the woke coefficient, okay. Frederic, there's a quick question. Uh, so what is the notation of BBK versus BKK in terms of yeah, yeah, yeah, perhaps I'm wrong here. I was a bit confused just now. Okay, forget about this. This is a bone. I have given the name BK, but it's not okay. Okay, this is the bone. Okay, classical bone. Okay, classical bond. So, for those who are not familiar with this bound, you just the interior volume is just the Ecliption one that you multiply by n factorials in order to have that the sample X, which is generated by, say, the standard basis in N, have an integer volume one. And using that, it is obvious to see that the integer. you it is obvious to see that the integer volume of a polytope with uh vertices in uh in the lid z to the n is always an integer so it makes sense to uh so you your bond is just an integer okay no question okay i can pursue yeah go go ahead yeah yeah sure i just made some uh some uh make some some some stop some pose uh so now okay now we go into the into the art of the talk we are want to look at the number of positive solutions so a positive solution of a volume system positive solution for me just a point with positive coordinates so all coordinates are strictly are positive positive numbers and um and we we consider again a Polymer system with a coefficient system with a coefficient and then uh and then we uh i recall here uh famous uh coins key bonds uh which have been improved uh more recently by by me and frank sottil and the statement is that the number of positive solutions of our polynomial system are in fact this is the number of non-degenerate positive solutions so non-degener means that we have at each solution you have the Jacobian is uh as full rank Jacobian is as full rank and so the transversal intersection of the hyper surfaces. So the number of positive solutions of the system is bound in from above by some explicit function that I don't want to write down here. This is a function which depends on the n, the number of variables, and on the s, which is the total number of monomials occurring in your system. So in other words, the number So, in other words, the number of elements is the support for the system. You have some explicit function which is dependent only on these two quantities parameters, n and s. So, remember that in the univariate case, we have already a bone of this kind, which is just s minus one. And in the univariate case, the bone is sharp. And it is sharp, in fact, for any. And it is sharp, in fact, for any given support in Z of Kern ETS, obviously. And the problem, okay, so this is a very, very, very nice result. And for instance, this tells you that again, when you have a poly substance, polym system, n-variable n equation which has few monomials, and you can say precisely what it means, what it means, few monomials, then it will have. Then it will have among all its complex solutions, there will be a few positive solutions. But the problem is that the bonds already, the bond by Kovansky, and in fact, also the bond obtained by me and Francotil, are in general not sharp. And there are very, very few cases where we know a sharp repair bonds. So this is the aim of the tool is to. the aim of the tool is to to give you a vision of what is known what sharp bounds are are known okay which sharp bounds are not so so there is a one remark we can you can skip this remark if you want but there is a an easy very easy bound that we can get for the number of positive situations which is not i mean a easy bond which is not a bound I mean is a bond which is not a bone for the number of complex solutions and the bone is a is a volume of the of the support which is normalized with respect to not the not the lattice z to the n but the lattice finally generated by the support so and normalize means that if you look consider a basis of this sub lattice and you look at n samplex so you assume that first of all that this subsamplex sub lattice has Sub-subplex sub-lattice has full rank n, otherwise, there's nothing to say. And then you can look at the basis of this sub-subgroup, sub-lattice. So, and you look at some n-samplex generated by this basis, and you look at the determinant, the volume of this n-samplex, and you just have to divide by the Euclidean volume by Divide the integral volume by the volume of this sample X. So in general, this new volume is less than the Z volume. It's not bigger than the Z volume. Okay, so this is just a remark. So this is just your remark. Already it is not difficult to get that. Okay. Now I want to give a bunch of sharp known bones. So perhaps the first, except the new case, the first sharp bone that I know at least was obtained by Lee, Rogers and Wong in 2003. And it was about very specific. Was about very specific systems, but in fact, we will see that we know something about only very specific systems. So they were looking at systems of this kind, also looking at other systems, but okay. So very simple system, if you look at a system of two equations in two variables, so you have so x here is a is a couple of variables, and each equation has exactly three monomers, and in fact And in fact, you can choose the monomials and divide by this monomial without changing the number positive solution. So if you want, you can assume that in each equation there is a constant term because you just can divide by any monomials. So we have two equations, three monomials in each equation, and they prove that the number of positive solutions of such a system is at most five. And what is more in And what is more impressive for me is that they also prove that this bond is optimal, which is not really, really, not easy to prove. So in this story, as usual, in such story, there are two parts. You have to find upper bound. And on the other hand, you want to show that your upper bound are good. And to show that your upper bonds are good, you want to construct a system which To construct systems which approach your imperbs, and this is very, very difficult in general. Okay, this is one example where we know the sharp bound. Another example, which is very similar to this one, which is more recent, was obtained by my PhD student, Gulos Alinani, and me. And now we look at system. Now we look at system still with two equations, two variables, but system the first equation is just a line. You look at the line and the semicolon. So Frederick there is a quite detailed question by Munir in the chat. So he says that a natural generalization of discarded rule of science is to count the number of connected components of the real part of a hypersoff. Real part of a hypersurface in the positive quadrant, so where all coordinates have positive sign, and then counting the number of connected components can be done via VROS patchworking and whether this is true or not, essentially, or whether there's something missing. What is the question? Okay. Okay. So, count the number of connected components by a VOS patchwork. Okay, so we can discuss about what is the natural generation, but as I mentioned, there is at least for me one naturalization, which is to look at polymer systems. And as I also mentioned, you can also look at counting the number of connecting components, but of appear surfaces, but But this is not, in that case, it is not sufficient to look only at hyper surfaces which are constructed by communal patroling. We know that there exists hyper surfaces which cannot be constructed by a communal patrol. And as Maurice told you in the chat, I'm not sure I will explain, but I I don't I'm not sure I will explain but uh I know that this is not sufficient to consider only a commercial partial key. I can tell you a bit later the only case when we can do that, the circuit case. Okay, there is only one case when you can when about the problem of counting the number of cognitive components in the per surface case, community networking give you the maximum number. This is a separate case. But I agree, and there is, I mean, there are other directions to generate the data scattered roles, and as I said, for me, the polymer systems are unnaturally generizing. There are other. Is it okay? Okay, so okay, Maurice, to give you a give you an example. Gave you an example of chat. So, cometal patchworking is a powerful tool for constructing an object relative with a rich topology, but we know that it is not the miraculous tool. Okay, so another type of system. So, I look at the system which corresponds to taking by taking. To taking an intersection of a line with a trinomial curve. And then now I look at the number of real solutions and with eventually zero coordinates. And with Woulos Alieni, we'll prove that the maximal number of solutions of such a system is 11. So this is really, for me, it is a very nice result. So something that you can explain in Explain to school students. So you look at a line, to take a line, take a curve defined by three with three monomulas. You can give us an example of a conics. So obviously you get at most two in that case. But you can imagine that you can construct a priori curve, three markers which are very oscillating like this. that uh and in fact this result shows you that you can not have too much oscillation say and in fact you have uh and you can uh and you know in fact the the charm in that case this is eleven okay okay what is the example is it difficult to explain yeah yeah and i mean you can look at uh i can show you the paper you can find the I can show you the paper. You can find the paper in my web page, and you have an explicit example with the explicit coefficients. But this is a, I like this, it's kind of this is like a miraculous example. But okay, now now let me give some definition. What is the dimension of the s of a system? Polymer system is just the number of variables or the number of coefficients. Variables or the number of coefficients of the number of equations, sorry. And the codimension is just the number of total number of monomers minus n plus one. These are standard definitions. And so now I come back to the general thing. So I just want to So I just want to have one of the which depend only on the number of variables, so the dimension, and the number of monomials. So more or less, this is also you can say that there are bounds which depend only on the dimension and the co-dimension. And I don't want to specify what happens on each equation. And in that case, there is, in fact, if I forget about the univariate case, which If I forget about the univariate case, which is the case of dimension one and any co-dimension for which we know the Timal bond, there is in fact only one other case where we know the optimal bond. This is a case of co-dimension one and any dimension. So this is like a symmetric case. So what does it mean co-dimension one on any dimension? It means that you are considering a system of n equation, n variables, and a total number of n plus two monomers. Number of n plus 2 monomers, and n can be any integer. And in that case, the sharp bound, the optimal bound is n plus 1. Okay, so this is the other example where really we know the optimal model. So, for instance, consider the example which is a The example which is below, I have to be okay. So which is below, you look at the system here below. I consider a system, okay, as I said. So I take the dimension is two, so you have two equations, two variables. And if I count the number of monomials, I have four monomials, which is exactly n plus two when n equal to two. And then I claim that this system has at most three positive. most free positive solutions, which is n plus one, when n is equal to two. And I'm a bit cheating when I say that this is optimal here in my statement because it depends on what you fix. And it is optimal in the sense that for any n, we can find a support with n n plus two element and Element and a system which has this set as a support and which has n plus one positive solutions. Okay. Okay, so now I come back, I come to the other problem. We want to generalize the description of science. And the goal is to The goal is to bound the number of positive solutions by some sign variation, which obviously should come from the polar system. Frederick, there was a question again in the chat. So could you repeat what optimal means with respect to the bound you just showed? Before, okay, me. Okay, I'll come back. So optimal means, sorry, that you are for any n, for any integer n, I can find a set. A set of n plus two monomials or say element vectors in z to the n and a polynomial system supporting on this set which has n plus one exactly n plus one positive solutions so for any n I can find a system of this kind which has exactly n plus one positive solutions. Which has exactly n plus one positive solution for any n. So I don't fix the support, which is a set of monomers. I just fix the dimension and the codimension. Okay? I will give you some examples after, if you want. Is it clear? Okay. So, generalization of the scattered world science. So, I'm going to encode the polymer system as we do in a university for a linear system. Linear system, you write it often in a matricial form using two matrix A times X equal to B. times x equals b, which is a polymer system. So you use your writing in matricial form, you can write this, do the same thing for polynomial system, of course. And so now I consider the monomials which appear in my system with no zero coefficient. I index these monomials, or I mean the exponent vectors by from zero to capital N here. I just switch a bit my notation. And so I can write my So, I can write my Polyspan as it is written here. Each equation I write CIG for the coefficient in front of the minimal x to the Ag in my equation number I. And then this way I get a coefficient matrix C, which the size is just, the number of rows is the number of equations. And the number of columns is just, this is a mistake here, the number of columns is any. Mistake here: the number of columns is n capital N plus one. Sorry, the mistake, and there are two mistakes because you also have another matrix. In fact, you have two look at the matrix which is very which is below. I have another matrix that I construct as follows. I just first put in columns the exponent vectors and then I add a And then I add a row of ones as the first row. And then I get so the matrix has n plus row, small n plus one row, sorry, and capital N plus one columns. Okay. So these are the coefficient matrix and the exponent matrix of the system. Standard, this is the standard. And why we consider these matrices and And why we consider these matrices? Okay, because they uncode the system. But the more important is that we observe something which is interesting. Is that more or if you multiply on the left either C or capital A, one of the two malfruitces, what you get on the left by an invertible matrix, sorry, what you get is that another polymer system which has Which has, in fact, the same number of positive solutions. So, the statement about the coefficient matrix is obvious because multiplayer on the left by the invertible matrices, the matrix is just doing linear combination of the equations and invertible linear combination. So, in fact, you get an equivalent system. And the statement above the exponent matrix, so multiplying on the left by an invertible matrix, in fact, the amounts In fact, the amount is the same as multiplying each equation by some monomulates and then doing a monomial exchange of coordinates, which preserves the number of positive rules. Okay, so this is a bit fast, but just so this is true. And there is also another action which is very important for Tulk, is that you can just You can just permute two columns of the matrix capital A and do the same for the matrix C, give you, in fact, the same system. And this is important because when you permute columns of capital A just correspond to just another numbering or ordering of the support of the system. And as you know, ordering of the support is very important if you want to generalize the scatterbox sense. The scatter of sense. Okay, so this is a trivial action. And what is more important is that the first action tells you that, in fact, you can also encode your Ponya system by the vector of maximal minors of the Cauchy matrix and the vector of maximal minors of the expanded matrix. The number of solutions depends only on that. Depends only on that. In the number of positive solutions, it depends only on that. Okay? Okay, let me give you a first very simple example. Perhaps I can skip that, but I can, in fact, be very fast. In the simplex case, so assume that your support. So assume that your support is just a set of you have in fact n plus one monomials, n variables. And you assume that your support is not contained in some hyperplane, so that your exponent vectors are just the vertices of an n-dimensional sumplex. And if you want doing a monomial change of coordinates, you can, in fact, what you are looking at is as you are looking at linear polymers, linear systems. This isn't the same. And concerning linear systems, And concerning linear systems, we know everything. We know that there is at most one real solution, and we know and so there is at most one positive solution. And in fact, we know using Cramer's rules that exactly when we have one positive solution or not. And this is the lemma which is written here. And in fact, if you think a bit about Cramer's rule, you see that the galatization is the one which is written here. One which is written here. And the recognition is that all maximum minus of the coefficient matrix, so you just have your coefficient matrix, which has n rows on n plus one columns. So a maximum minus is just obtained by removing one colon. And you look at the maximum and minus, and you multiply each maximine minor by the sign of the corresponding colon. And you want that all these things are. Want that all these things are non-zero and have the same sign. So they are either all positive or all negative. So you see here the appearance of the maximal minor of the minors of the Cauchy matrix. In fact, you don't see maximal minors of the exponent matrix because there is only one in that case. Because in that case, the matrix capital E has exactly The matrix capital E has exactly is a square matrix, so there is only one max minus minor. Okay. Okay. Okay, I don't need to say too much things as usual, but okay. Now the first non-trivial generalization of the scatter of science, to my opinion, was a uh to my uh to my opinion was obtained in uh by uh several uh coachers Muller, Feyu, Regensburger, Conradi, Hsu and Alec Alice Elikenstein who is here and other people are there too and it works in any dimension and any co-dimension but but it gives you something like there is at most one positive solution and uh and what and already we saw we see here the appearance of the We see here the appearance of the maximal minus of the coefficient matrix on the exponent matrix. So you look at a maximal minor of C, which corresponds to some subset G, capital G. And then you have to be a bit careful here because G is not so I index the columns from zero to capital G So I index the columns from 0 to capital N and G the subset of the set starting from 1. And this is you have to be careful. We have to be careful here. But the set one is like this. You take a shoot G like this, and it gives you a maximal minor of C and the corresponding maximal minor of capital A just obtained by adding the zeros, column number zero to this. Recall that capital A has a A has one row more than than C. And the statement obtained by these occurs can be reflashed as follows. You look at the vectors given by the product of the corresponding maximum minors, and you assume that this vector is non-zero vector, that is at least one non-zero coordinate, and all coordinates are either all negative or non-positive. Negative or non-positive. And then the system has at most one positive solution. Okay. So this is a statement. And you can ask me why you see that as a discard rule of science. Because, as I have written just below the statement, because you can see that. Because you can see that this bone has one plus the sine variation of this of the coefficient of these vectors. And obviously, because under the hypothesis of the theorem, the sine variation is zero. And what is interesting when the sine variation is zero is that you don't have to get an ordering. You don't have to take care of an ordering. So in this statement, there is no ordering. So, this in this state point, there is no ordering, and in fact, we don't need that because the separation is zero. But the bond, at least to my opinion, should be written this way. Okay. Those slides will be on the website soon, so you can ask questions as you want during the week. No problem. During the week, no problem, no problem. Okay, so now I have to uh so the next generalization uh works for any dimension, but only in codimension one. So this is exactly the case where we know a sharp phenomenal bound, the C-shaped case. And let me uh be a bit fast now. Be a bit fast now. So, in that case, the support consists of n plus two points in L to the N, you have n plus two monomulas. And so, you have only up to scalar multiplication one final relations. And the sine variation we will consider will be the sine variation of this, of the coefficient of this finer relation. So, the support of the exponent vector are exactly n plus 1 plus 1. n plus one plus one point so you have only one affine relation and we will consider the sign variation of the the coefficient in these affine relations but we have to order them and in order to order them these coefficients in fact we will use the coefficient matrix of the polynomial systems and how do we do that uh so a bit fast here i'll skip a bit Skip a bit. What we do? We consider a Gal dual matrix D of C. So this is a matrix whose columns give you a basis of the kernel of the Cauchy matrix. So assuming that C has full rank N, this kernel has dimension 2, and so your matrix D is just a matrix with N plus 2 rows and two columns. Okay, so I use this. So, I use this matrix D. I have some properties of this matrix D. In particular, I can look at the maximum minus of this matrix D, and I see that if the matrix C at the beginning is uniform, meaning that all maximum minus are non-zero, the same is true for D. Okay, this is one thing which is important for us now. But now, what I do? I look at the row vectors of D. Look at the row vectors of G. So you get n plus two points in R2, n plus two vectors in R2. I consider these two vectors, these n plus two vectors in R2. And one very useful and critical property, Lema, say, is that if my system If my system has at least one positive solution, then all these vectors, these n plus two vectors, lie in some open half plane passing through the origin, like in my picture. And the key point with this property is that then you can order your vector according to the clockwise order or the counterclockwise order. Okay, starting from the line passing through the region, which gives you the boundary of the Half plane, as in my picture. So you remember the PI's, so P0, P1, P2, etc., etc., according to the clockwise under. Under and it gives you, in fact, a way to so you now you reorder using this ordering. This ordering gives you an ordering of your support. Okay, so now I have ordered the points, and now it gives you an ordering of your support. And if you want a numbering, and if you fix. And if you fix this ordering, so we get the following result. So we consider this ordering, and then the number of positions is bounded, as I claimed before, by the sine variation of the coefficient of the affine relation between these exponent vectors. Okay. So So so this is a and uh moreover the difference is always an even antigen normal. So you have so morally to resume the Coefficient matrix give you a way to order the element of your uh of your monomials or if you if you want to use the exponent vectors of your of your monomials and then you look at the unique up to a f n uh Unique up to affin multiplication by scalar affin relation between your exponent vectors. You look and you look at the coefficient ordered with respect to the ordering of the exponent vectors. You look at the sine variation of this sequence and I give you a bound for the number of positive solutions for your Promium systems. And there is a there is a interesting remark is that Interesting remark is that, in fact, first we recover the bound n plus one because you have to see that the sine variation is the sine variation between n plus two real numbers. So it can be at most n plus one and n plus one was the sharp bone I explained before. So it means that if you want, so you recover the bone n plus one and you also see that if you want to get to have the See that if you want to get to have the bound n plus one, the sine variation should be maximal. It means that two consecutive coefficients should have opposite signs. And in fact, it means that your capital matrix, your exponent matrix, capital A should have this very nice property that all its maximum and minus have the same signs, either all positive or all negative. Okay. Okay, so this is something which is very nice. And already, there are some obvious consequences of this theorem. And the one is, for instance, if your exponent vectors are not inconvective. Vectors are not in convex position, which means that you have n the convex pool has not n plus two vertices, but say n plus one, it should have at least n plus one if you if you want to that they are not contained in some hyper plane. Then you get at most two positive solutions. This is very and it works in any dimension because in your aff affine relation, one coefficient is positive and all others are negative. And all others are negative. And so the sign variation could be at most two. Okay. So I have not much time, so I skip all this, and I just now want to stay the refinement of this theorem, which is even more recent. Another refinement is the following. So I need to introduce all the So, I need to introduce other numbers. So, I start from the coefficient of the affin relation. I keep the ordering given by the matrix C, and now I look at the partial sums of the coefficient of the affin relation, which is defined by the mu and this L. So, mu 0 is lambda 0, mu 1 is lambda 0 plus lambda 1, mu 2 is lambda 0 plus lambda 1 plus lambda 2, and so on. And the last one is mu and this index n plus 1, which should be 0, because this is the sum of the. Which should be zero because this is the sum of the coefficient of the fun relation. Okay, and it turns out that we have another upper bonus in the condiment one case, which is given by the sign variation, which is given by one plus the sign variation of this sequence, mu0, mu1, etc., until mu and this one, n plus one. And in fact, And in fact, this bond is better than the previous bond. And the important property of this bond is that in that case, it is sharp for any given support A of n plus 2 exponent vectors in a n, which was not the case for the previous hyperman. So I'm sorry, I was a bit fast, surely, but sorry. Okay, so Okay, so I already talked too much. Okay, perhaps I can stop now. I have all I have, so perhaps just let me mention another direction, as you said. So there will be a talk on Thursday about partial generalization of the scatter signs for counting the number of conductive components of the complement of some. Of the complement of some hyper surface. And in fact, there are also another person generalization, but which are not published now that I obtained a few years ago. And this is still work in progress because I want to improve them. And the bone I have are like a hybrid between a phenomenon and this. Between a funomial and descart allocine bonds. In fact, the one are some of sine variation on a phenomenal band. And I still want to improve that. So, but there are some generalization of some discardable signs working for polymer systems. And we have two open questions. And the first one is related to what I explained about just before. Explained about just before. Is it true that the property that the exponent matrix has all its max minus of the same sign? A necessary condition to rage the sharp funeral bond, even if this bond is not known in general. Because this is true in the univariate case, in fact, for dimension one, this is easy, this is trivial. Is easy, this is trivial, and this is also true in the codimension one case. So, the case I just mentioned. And there is another open question, but I'll let you read this question by yourself, perhaps. Thank you very much, Sorie, for the. Okay. Yeah, thanks a lot, Frederic, for the talk. Yeah, I mean, of course, if there are a few questions in between, then that's completely fine if we go a little bit over time. But maybe there are more questions for Frederique. More questions for Frederic from the audience? Yeah. Yeah. It's not a question, but a remark, or maybe a challenge to people doing Descartes' rule of science. I have two stupid questions about one dimensional case, which are open. They are so irritating that you cannot imagine. Cannot imagine. So the first one is assume that for simplicity, we're only looking at real polynomials with all non-vanishing coefficients. Yeah, yeah. So if you have all non-vanishing coefficients, then the cartridge of signs you can use for both positive roots and negative roots. Yeah, I know you what was now the question is if you fix the signs You fix the signs, how many positive and negative roots could be there? This is all, yeah, I know, I know. I read your papers about that. And the second one is in similar spirit, but also say if we fix the number of real roots and the signs, what's the topology of the set? Topology of the set of real roots? Yeah, so I mean, so what is the root? Yeah, so I mean so what is trivial if you look at real polynomials with k real simple roots and the rest being complex, k is fixed. Now this set is contractible for obvious reasons because you can contract all your roots and then complex conjugate are also contractible. But now what happens if you fix the signs of the coefficients? And the topology begins And the topology becomes completely unclear. Okay. And this has quite an applied flavor there because people doing applications need to know certain things. Okay. Sorry. Okay. So do you have a, I mean, this is a I mean, perhaps there is a paper describing this in more details or? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I I I can maybe send it to you or to organize it. Send it to you or to organize. Okay, send it to me or to everyone, it doesn't matter. Okay, thank you for the question. I have no idea, of course. But this is okay. You're interesting. Okay, there is another question in the chat. Let me just read it out. So, it seems like the conditions and settings you use on the matrix coming from the linear system can be converted to Matroid language and maybe more proper. Language and maybe more properties can be obtained by using some concepts from matrix language. Are there some works in that direction? I mean, yeah, yeah, sure. But yeah, you're right, but we still don't know exactly. I mean, there should be some works, but okay, no result from the moment now. I completely agree. I completely agree. So, but for the moment, I don't know any kind of result using about the number of positive solutions of coincidence which use really matrix theory. This is not an answer to the question, but we have another paper where we just try to find conditions to. Tried to find conditions to ensure at least one positive route. So he mentioned that the first result here, using my paper with many co-authors, gave a solution in terms of the minors to bound at most one positive root. But if you want to bound at least one positive root, it seems that this not only depends on the minus, not only depends on the matrix. It's more complicated than that. I don't expect that the general solution will. Don't expect that the general solution will just depend on the matrix. You need things that depend on the sign of the minors, but I expect other functions to be involved, not just the size of the minors themselves. Okay. Further questions for Frederick? One more question. Maybe I'm a little bit Maybe I'm a little bit tangled. So, sorry for a stupid question. Can we somehow classify all collections of support sets such that almost all systems of equations supported at these sets have at most one real root. Okay, so. Okay, so so I yes, so I guess you have in January the result telling you that you have classification of polytop for which you mean volume is one? So yes, my question is actually is it the same answer or do we have some something less trivial? I have not the result in mind, but this is a good question. For okay, in fact, yeah, I am not the answer, but uh, this is a good question. I already uh think about this a bit a long time ago, not so long, maybe. Maybe not even the complete answer, but just do we have some examples of such systems of equations that are not essentially linear, but that have at most one real root? At most one, at most two, this is easy because I gave you an example in this case. Yeah, but at most one, no, I don't know for the moment right now, I don't know. Okay, other, yes, Monier so Monier. So Monius says in the last part of the... As Maurice told you, this is an easy answer. If the support is a samplex, there is at most one body solution. Because the samplex case is a linear case, in fact. Yes, yes. So this is actually the same as mixed volume one, essentially. And do we have something more exotic in I don't know, no. No. But this is a, yeah, this is a, yeah. This is related to my second open questions. Perhaps you can read it. This is something that I ask in some paper. I have classified in all paper all super all circuits, so n plus two points in R, for which. In her end, for which there exists what I call a maximally positive system, which is a system whose all complex solutions are, in fact, positive solutions. So this is like positively hyperbolic systems. So all this is system for which, okay, all the complex solutions are in fact positive solutions. There is no imaginary solution. And in fact, in fact, And in fact, this circuit have the property that you can find a basis of affine relations, or if you want, you can find a Gale matrix B for the matrix exponential matrix capital A whose coefficients are smaller, are not bigger than two in absolute value. So they're very small. And more or less it means that the that the the the support is uh is very close to the i mean there is no missing point no missing monomials i mean uh it looks like the like like a germ system or something like this as in the previous tools i mean if you want to have many uh as many posi solutions as complex solution you need every integer points in your or in in your uh in your uh the convex hole of your The convex scroll of your support. So, here I am imposing that the support is an integral exponent vector, of course, because I'm speaking about complex solution. So, you have a support, which is a set of points in Z to the N. You look at the convex pool, and we want that every point of Z to the N, which belongs to this polytope, is in a support. Something like this. This is not exactly the same because all not exactly the same because uh already in the this is for in the univariate case case this is this is a this is a this is true a polynomial in one variable has all has degree b a degree positive roots if only if i mean in implies that all the monomers are in the support and in the in a dimension in the circuit case it is not exactly the same but this is a more Actually, the same, but this is more or less the same. The support should be close to the set of integer points intersected with the convex huge of the support, more or less. So, this is a, I like this kind of question, and then if I see it is closely related to the subject of the workshop, because you have hyperbolic on one side, phenomenal things on other side. So, perhaps it's interesting. Yeah, so. Yeah, so then since we have five minutes until the next talk would start, I would suggest that maybe we use this to have a short break before we have the final talk of today. But first of all, let's thank Frederic again for this very nice talk and the discussion. And of course, if you have further questions, you can just ask them at the end of the day, always in the open discussion ground, or maybe you can meet on Gather Town. And let me also use the opportunity to say again. And let me also use the opportunity to say again that if you have any questions during the talk, you're welcome to put them in the chat and I will try to read them out. But for now, let's use five minutes of break before we meet again for Trosen's talk. Thank you.
