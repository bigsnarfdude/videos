So we can study a binary system of two compact objects, which can be neutron stars or black holes. And using scattering amplitudes, we can approach the in-spiral phase, where the objects are orbiting around each other and the separation is still large. What both applications, collider and gravitational waves, have in common is that when we get this scattering amplitude, it evaluates. This scattering amplitude evaluates to some functions, some new transcendental functions, some numbers. So, what we will do in this talk is focus on the functions that will appear and the geometries behind them, as we will see. So, first, I will review, just to set the stage, how we can have geometries in Feynman integrals. Then, I will comment on a couple of tools to be able to detect these geometries. And then we will put everything together. And then we will put everything together and study the functions and geometries that appear in the post-Minkowski expansion. So imagine that we are at one loop. We have this bubble, which in two dimensions evaluates to a logarithm that depends on the kinematics. Similarly, in four dimensions, we have this box, which evaluates to a dialogue plus some logarithms. What we find is that the space of functions to which these two integrals To which these two integrals evaluate to are just classical polylogs, which are iterated integrals over the Riemann sphere. But if we pick another arbitrary one-loop Feynman integral, we see that they are not enough. We have to expand these space of functions to something called multiple polylogs or concur of polylogs, which are very similar iterated integrals, but now we allow these poles to be shifted by some amount. But of course, But of course, the same happens again when we go into higher loops, especially when we have very high particle multiplicity and many scales. We find that they are richer than multiple polylogs and we have integrals beyond that. So let me review how can integrals beyond multiple polylogs occur. So for that, we will focus on a very simple example where we have a Feynman integral with two Feynman parameters, x1 and x2. With two Heyman parameters, x1 and x2. And for the simplicity of the talk, let's take a very simple denominator, which is x1 squared minus a polynomial in x2. If we integrate over x1, we get this integral with a logarithm of 1 minus 1 over the square root of p divided by 2 times the square root of p, where here we get the same, but with a plus. And one natural question is, what does this integral evaluate to? What do we get as functions on the right-hand side? As functions on the right-hand side. Well, it turns out that we just have to look at this equation: y squared equals to the polynomial. Since the polynomial depends on one variable, this defines an algebraic curve. And then depending on the degree of this curve, we get different functions and geometries. So if the degree is less or equal than two, then we can always find a change of variables such that we can rationalize this polynomial, we get a perfect square. We get a perfect square. And so, as Oliver was doing this morning, by partial fraction, we can reduce everything to iterated integrals over the Riemann sphere. So the result here on the right-hand side is just multiple polylogs. But of course, if the degree is higher or equal than 3, then in general, it cannot be rationalized, and we will get a non-trivial geometry. The simplest case is when we have degree 3 or 4, we get Degree three or four, we get an elliptic curve, and so this means that the result of this integral will be an elliptic integral, or if you want, elliptic multiple polylog. This can also be seen as iterated integrals over the torus. And of course, we are already familiar with this because we have examples such as the sunrise in two dimensions, the elliptic double box, which we like a lot at the Nisborne Institute, which all evaluate to elliptic intervals. All evaluate to elliptic integral. But of course, this is just the first step in a power of more and more complicated geometries. If the degree is five or six, we get the hyper-elliptic curve. The geometry becomes a two-torus. And for example, this happens in this non-planar double box diagram. But of course, this was for this very simplified example in which we have two Feynman parameters. So let's see what happens. So let's see what happens when we have n of them. So let's take an n-fold integral with the same denominator as before, but now we allow the polynomial to depend on n minus one variables. Then when we integrate over x1, we get the same result, but importantly, now instead of an algebraic curve, we get an n minus one-dimensional manifold. And it is such that if the degree If the degree of the polynomial is equal to 2n, this corresponds in general to a Calabia n minus one fold. And well, even though this seems like a very abstract geometry, there are also plenty of examples of diagrams that depend on Calabia manifolds. So we can, for example, generalize the sunrise to this banana family. We can equally generalize the double box to these train tracks, which both families at L loops depend. Both families at L loops depend on integrals over Calabial L minus one poles. But thanks to some of the authors here present, we have more complicated cases such as this cardigrade family, which said L loops depends on a Calabia 2L minus 2 pole. The thing is that all of these examples are mainly relevant for particle physics, in some cases n equals 4. So our question was, are there also Was are there also non-trivial geometries for gravitational waves, and in particular in the Posmi-Koskin expansion? And as we found last Christmas, the answer turns out to be yes. So the setup that we are going to study is this binary system of two compact objects, neutron stars or black holes. In order to describe this system with quantum field theory, we will use the Postminkoskin expansion. Use the Posmi-Koskin expansion, and the first step is to take the point-particle limit, in which the size of the objects is much smaller than the distance, in this case given by the impact parameter. So, this gives a hierarchy of scales that allows us to define an effective field theory, and then we can use perturbative Feynman diagrams to calculate the potential in this system by calculating instead diagrams. Creating instead diagrams like this one, where we have the two-to-two scattering of two massive scalars, which model the black holes. And if we want to take into account the effects of spin or tidal deformations, we can just add them as operators in our effective field theory. The thing is that since we are using quantum field theory techniques, we will get quantum results for a diagram. A diagram, well, for a setup that is very classical. So we need to take the classical limit, which corresponds to the angular momentum being large, which translates to the fact that the kinematic invariance I think is the next one. Yeah, sorry. Which translates to the kinematic invariance as. The kinematic invariance, S, U, and the masses being much bigger than Q squared, which means that the traditional H-bar scaling associated to classical physics is replaced by a soft Q expansion, such that the classical piece is the dominant one, and then we will get quantum corrections, which come with powers of Q, which is small, and so we will drop them in the classical limit. And one important aspect. And one important aspect which will be relevant towards the end is that the Posminkovsky problem for a two-body binary system only depends on one variable. We call this variable y. It's equal to p1.p2 divided by the masses. And in the results, we normally get a square root of y squared minus 1. And to rationalize it, we introduce this variable x as given here. Now, if anyone is interested in the Poslin-Causkin expansion, I can Interested in the Posmin-Coskin expansion, I can provide more details at the end, but I figured that for the interest of this talk, maybe it's better to focus on the geometries that appear. So now we need tools to be able to detect if we have non-trivial geometries in our integrals. One such tool is to use differential equations. So the first step is to solve an integration by part identities to get a vector. Entities to get a vector of master integrals. Then we can take a derivative with respect to one of the kinematic parameters, and we get a system of first-order coupled differential equations, like this one, where A is a matrix. And by taking further derivatives, we can translate this system to a higher-order differential equation for one of the master integrals of interest. So here we can apply this operator L, which is Apply this operator L, which is known as the Picard books, onto the master integral and we get an inhomogeneity. This inhomogeneity is just a linear combination of master integrals of sub-sectors, which means that at the maximal cut, all of them will be zero on the right-hand side. Now, why is this important? It's because the Picard books is a smoking gun for detecting geometries, because in general, it factorizes. If in the factorization we only have L1s, so operators of order one, then the integral is polylogarithmic as long as the sub-sectors are also polylogarithmic. So if we are at the maximal cat, then here on the right-hand side, we have zero, which means that if we only have L1s, the solution to the homogeneous differential equation will be polylogs, but then the solution to the full differential equation Solution to the full differential equation also takes into account the subsectors. So the integral is polylog if the subsectors are also polylog. Otherwise, we can also have a factorization where we have an operator of order r greater than one, which implies that we are beyond polylogs. And normally it corresponds to a Calabia R minus one. But there is one big elephant in the room. One big elephant in the room, which is that the first step is that we need to solve integration bipartisan entities. And as probably everyone is aware of, this is the biggest bottleneck in all calculations. So what we will do instead is to use an alternative method for all the integrals and then use differential equation as a cross-check. So this method is based on the leading singularity. Now the leading singularity can be Now, the leading singularity can be related to the maximal iterated discontinuity. For instance, in our previous example with the logarithm, when we take the leading singularity, we are basically taking the discontinuity across the branch cut, which means that at the end we get this very simple integral, which captures precisely the denominator that was giving us the geometry. In practice, we will take the link. In practice, we will take the linear singularity by replacing propagators by on-shell delta functions. So we take the maximum cut. And again, it can also be used to detect geometry. So if the lean singularity of an integral and the subsectors is algebraic, then the integral is polylogarithmic. So let me go over that. So in our previous example, which is very simple, we have this very clean denominator, but in other cases, Denominator, but in other cases, we could have simple poles, so we can take further residues. We start localizing many of these integrals, and then in many cases, at the end, we just have a number, no integrals left, which means that the result is algebraic. Otherwise, we have this y, which can be an elliptic curve in the denominator, which means that is an indication that we are an integral b. That we are an integral beyond polylogs. And the advantage of this approach is that since we are at the maximal cut, we will localize many of these integrals. So for a given master integral, it will be very easy to calculate compared to IBP identities and differential equations and so on. And then we can use this, for example, to bring the differential equation to epsilon factorized form. And in practice, we will use the by... And in practice, we will use the Bykov representation. So, if anyone is interested, I can also give more details at the end. So, now we just have to apply everything into the POSMI-COSKEN expansion. But before that, is there any question? So, then this is what we did. So, we started looking at the diagrams: one loop, two loops. Diagrams, one loop, two loop, three loop, which is the state of the art. And we got that almost everything is polylogarithmic, as expected from the explicit calculations at three loops. But what we did not anticipate is that we would be able to relate geometries across different sectors and across different loop orders. So for example, we found the following. So if you are computing the leading singularity of a post-Minkowski diagram, Of a post-Minkowski diagram. And it's non-planar, like this one, where we have the non-planarity due to a crossing in the black hole matter line. You can just unravel them and compute instead the linear singularity of a planar diagram. So that means that the geometries in these two diagrams will be the same and also the functions. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Yes. So due to the classical limit, you have these linearized propagators, and then you can also view it as a partial fraction if you want. But then when you take the linear singularity, you can quite literally find that the linear singularity of all the terms in the partial fraction are proportional. Um, not that I am aware of. You also need to, if you want to be super careful with the i epsilons, you need to conjugate them. So maybe it exchanges retarded and advanced. Yeah. Then we have another relation, which is that we can reduce certain superclassical diagrams where we have an isolated graviton propagator to be the leading singularity of a lower loop. The leading singularity of a lower loop. And finally, we also have the following, which are two very visual rules to identify diagrams that have zero master integrals. So this means that they can be written entirely in terms of sub-sectors. This happens when we have such an object inside a drawing, which is a bubble where at least one of the vertices is cubic. Similarly, it also happens when we have a triangle. Similarly, it also happens when we have a triangle where two of the vertices are cubic, one of them being the graviton-shelf interaction. Now, why is this useful? Well, maybe the best way is to play a little game with you, which is imagine that we are at two loops. These are all the diagrams that you can get. There are 23. Now, the question is: which of them can give rise to non-trivial geometries and functions? Well, we can. Well, we can eliminate that one because this is a vertex, so this just factorizes into two triangles, so there's nothing new. Then we can remove these four. Do you remember we can just exchange the vertices? So the linear singularity of this one will be the same as that one. So we might as well just look at the geometry of the one above. So let's remove them. So let's remove them. We now have 19, but then we can apply the other rules. For example, we can just see that these four diagrams will have zero master integrals because of this rule with the bubbles. Then we can exploit this crossing by also saying that all of these diagrams will have zero master integrals, and the one that survives is this one because. Is this one because the bubble doesn't have a cubic vertex, so we can also remove them. Then we can do the same for the triangles, so we can also get rid of them. And then we can reduce these superclassical diagrams. For example, this one will be x divided by x squared minus one times the lean singularity of the one loop triangle. So without doing any calculation, Without doing any calculation, we can find that if there are non-trivial geometries, we can just look at these four diagrams. And in fact, we did that, but it also works at three loops. So we have initially of the order of 500 diagrams, and then applying these very simple four rules, we find that there are only 15 of them. So this allows to do a full classification and just To do a full classification and just look at the geometries that appear in these 15 diagrams. So that's what we did. We looked at this one diagram at one loop, the four diagrams at two loops, and the 15 at three loops. We found that all of them are polylogarithmic, except for one. So in these two very nice papers, these two groups found that the post-mean-Cosken expansion of Philoops contains this diagram. Contains this diagram, which evaluates the products of elliptic integral. So, the first challenge for us was to see if we can reproduce this result. If we do loop-by-loop-bykov and compute the linear singularity, we have a two-fold integral over the square root of a degree six polynomial, which satisfies the previous Calabiao condition and defines a K3 surface, which is a Calabiao football. Which is a Calabia twofold. The problem is that this would indicate that the result is an integral over a Calabio twofold period, which from explicit calculations is not the case. But here comes this crucial ingredient, which is that the Posmin-Koskin expansion only depends on one parameter. And that's because if we look at the PCR Fuchs of this diagram, it is of order three, it's very simple. Order three, it's very simple. Up to this point, this is also consistent with a Calabiao twofold. But since it's one scale, there are theorems in mathematics that say that it actually becomes the symmetric square of an operator of order two. So that means that the solutions of this operator are not generic, but are products of the solutions of this L two. So that's why we have products of elliptic integrals in the result. Of elliptic integrals in the result. So it was very nice to be able to reproduce this from our analysis. And with this, we concluded everything up to the state of the art. And then we started looking at for loops and beyond. There is a check that you can do. There is a relation between the coefficients. It's a very simple equation that you can. It's a pretty simple equation that you can just check. If it's satisfied, then it's a symmetric square. But there is a theorem that says that all the Picard books of order three, which are single scale, have to be symmetric square. Yeah, so let me come back to that point in the next two slides. So then we started looking at for loops. And what we found was that there are only certain diagrams and subsectors which can give rise to new geometries. These are diagrams that pertain to this family, which we call the Mondrian family, since it resembles these paintings by Piet Mondrian. And at four. And at for loops, we also found using our selection rules that there are of the order of 100 diagrams. If you look at the top topology, you would expect two to the 13 diagrams. So the simplification is very nice. And then we just look through them. And in particular, we found the following. So the lean singularity of this very simple-looking diagram is a three-fold integral over the square root of a degree eight. Over the square root of a degree eight polynomial, which now defines a Calabial threefold. So, this was the first time that such a geometry appears in the Posmin-Coskin expansion. To verify that this is the case, yes? Yes. It it's a sub-sector, so So this family, for example, at for loops, you can have this one. Now our statement is that diagrams that do not pertain to this family or that are not sub-sectors will have trivial leading similarities. And in that case, it's just inching this. So, yeah, as I was saying, we can just cross-check with the Picard Fox. It's of order four, so it's compatible with a Calabial threefold. It also doesn't factor. And then we checked the properties of this piggyfux to see that it is truly a Calabial operator. That means that it's essentially self-adjoint, that x equals zero is a man point with integer solution and many more. Command point with integer solution and many more. And within one of these properties, there is one where you have to compute. Now I don't remember if it's the instanton numbers or the Yukawa couplings. One of them, if it's a symmetric square, all the numbers have to be one. In our case, they are not one, which means that we truly have new transcendental functions. So it's not that we will have. So it's not that we will have products of elliptic integrals, but we will have an integral over a Calabi-Africa. But how do we do that? Well, we are very lucky, again, because our problem is single-scale. So we can borrow tools, for example, from this paper where they computed the equal mass banana at all loops, also depends on one scale. So what we are doing at the moment is precisely that. Is precisely that. So, getting the differential equation, the epsilon factorized form, and then to get the solution in terms of a series expansion. So, this brings me to the conclusions. We have seen that non-trivial geometries appear both in particle physics as well as the Posmink-Cozin expansion for gravitational waves. For that, we have used Lubbay Lubaikov and differential equations, which turn out to be very powerful tools also to Be very powerful tools also to classify the geometries in the expansion. And in particular, we have identified this novel Calabiao threefold that appears at Orloops. As future work, of course, we have to calculate this Calabiao integral to get the 5pm results. Then one question that we have in mind is, okay, we have seen, for example, this banana or train tracks family. Can we also identify such a family at Higher Loop? We don't know. Such a family at higher plug? We don't know yet. And so far, we have looked at the two-to-two scattering, but it would also be very interesting to look at the waveform where we also have one graviton that is emitted. Thank you. Yes. So, two comments on that. First of all, we are lucky because in the classical limit, your usual quadratic propagators, which would be, I don't know, P plus L squared minus the mass squared, they become something like this. They become something like this. So the mass dependence totally factors out. So that's already two parameters less that we have in the problem. So that's why for a two to two scattering, we only have one parameter. So in this five point, I believe you only have three. Ah, you have five. Ah, you have five. Ah, okay, okay. Then, um, okay. I mean, you're probably asking in the sense that Maple, the factorization of the Picard books, is not the best thing with. Okay, okay. Okay, so I mean, what we do is check with Maple, there is this command, DE factor. DE factor. For single scale, it works very well. For multiple scales, not so much. So if you want, in that sense, also the analysis with the loop by Lubykov can be a way to circumvent this problem. I mean, also one thing that I didn't mention is that with loop by Lubykov, you have non-trivial changes of variables to find residues if there are any. If you have more scales, If you have more scales, it could be more non-trivial. Formally, I think it's the relativistic Lorentz factor of particle one in the rest frame of particle two, something like this. It's p1 dot p2 divided by m. It's P1.P2 divided by M. Yes. Terribly bad. So for loops. The group by Jan computed this diagram and also. They computed this diagram and all the sub-sectors and a couple of things more, and it took them 300,000 cluster hours. So it's very bad, yes. And on top of this, we also have a non-planar top sector, which is truly non-planar. You can see that if you start swapping the vertices as we did, you cannot turn this one into planar. So it will be much worse. Much worse, but yeah. Yep. Yeah, so one thing is if you are calculating the lean singularity, then it helps you to get a good basis. So to bring everything into canonical form, you can just divide by the lean singularity. Just divide by the lean singularity. And then another thing is, for example, I remember Zv at amplitudes, what was it, one, two years ago, saying that, okay, yeah, very nice, but then at the end they just shift-enter it on Mathematica. But if you have a Calabiado, it will never finish. And so it's also a way to get an understanding of the tools that you will need to use. Because if in advance you know that this diagram is a calabia, then Is a Calabiano, then you do not approach it in the same way. We are currently working on getting the solution, yeah. Okay. Yep. Yes, you also have, for example, intersection theory to give you the coefficients of the IBPs. The thing is, at for loops, which is what we are looking at the moment, I don't think they are right. I don't think they are ready to compete with IVTs yet. It would be fantastic if someone has an implementation and it just goes to yeah. The other one is that, I mean, the answer, I would say that it's not that we don't know that there are two. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your question because I have a backup slide on that. So, yeah, yeah. So it's the part below. So the thing is that our analysis is just for individual Feynman diagram, of course. Yes. Now the thing is, in n equals 4, for example, you have supersymmetry, which means that there will be cancellations. And in that theory, it happens that It happens that geometries and functions cancel. Now, in the post-Minkowski expansion of gravity, we do not expect these things to happen. So, what we do is look at individual diagrams as an indicative of what will appear in the final amplitude. This is an assumption, of course. This is supported by reloops, where they had this one non-trivial product of elliptic curves that also appear in the final result. Now, maybe you are asking because of Now, maybe you are asking because of this result. So, at for loops in this diagram that I drew there, there are sub-topologies that contain elliptic integrals that do not show up in the result, but that's because they do appear, but with a pre-factor that is proportional to epsilon. My fourth theory maximum over the period. I mean, it's not, there isn't a there's a very specific direct way of answering the question. So even even taking into account Even taking into account cancellation of diagrams. No, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean, for example, if even if, I don't know, saying something like this diagram and the mirror, they will conspire to cancel? I mean, I guess it's possible. No, because from our analysis, we know of a list of diagrams that We know of a list of diagrams that all contain exactly the same geometry. So, for example, this is independently always organized your life. There's an element of homology specifically. And if the amplitude is non-zero there, there's a basis element in your COVID model. Port there, and it will go. Now, there could be, you know, another, this happened in polywalk with a very conjugated conjugated difficult and the Feyman contour you know averages out but But I don't know. I think that's also a testable find that's accurate. You go to maximum time. That's the sum overall possible. Okay. Thank you. Oh, the background.
