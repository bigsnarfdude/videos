Of friends and colleagues here who are participating. And I also see that there are a number of folks from sort of the more extended multi-taper family whose work I've read for years now, but never met in person. So it's great to be with you here today virtually. And I'm going to talk about really an application of multi-taper spectral analysis that is based on work that I did with my good friend and colleague. With my good friend and colleague and committee member of mine at Yale, Jeffrey Park, some years ago back in the mid-1990s, early to mid-1990s. And what it is, is a tool called MTM-SVD Multi-Taper Method Singular Value Decomposition that seeks to identify signals that are narrow band in the frequency domain, but with amplitude and phase modulation or potential amplitude. Phase modulation or potential amplitude and phase modulation that are spatially correlated in space over large regions. So it's a way to detect spatio-temporal oscillatory signals in the climate system, making use of the multi-taper spectral analysis and Sleppian tapers. And the way it works is, as we know, if you have a time Uh, if you have a time frequency bandwidth of say uh two, there are three tapers that are uh resistant to spectral leakage. So by simply cutting your frequency resolution in half, you're able to gain two more degrees of freedom. You've got three degrees of freedom, and that turns out to be an excellent trade-off in this method. Where what we're doing, we're seeking to see if in Seeking to see if in a particular frequency band, there is some modulation of that central carrier frequency that explains a large fraction of the data variance. And it ends up yielding a spectrum, what we call a fractional variance spectrum. How much variance does the first mode in that singular value decomposition explain out of the three total degrees of freedom? Total degrees of freedom. And that particular metric, that sort of spectral domain diagnostic, has a flat spectrum even for a colored noise process, because as we know, the only assumption here is that the behavior of the spectra or the null behavior of the data are that they are locally white, that is to say, approximately white over. Say approximately white over the bandwidth of the spectral analysis. And so, more generally, that allows for a colored noise process, a red noise process, for example, which is very common in climate data. And so this is a synthetic example where we've got three signals. On the left, we see the time domain signal, and on the right, we see the spatial domain signal. That's the spatial. Spatial domain signal: that's the spatial pattern in both amplitude and phase of the signal that we see on the left. And so, we've got this sort of secular mode. If we had 100 years of data, this would be an overall warming trend with the pattern shown here on the right. This second signal is an interdecadal oscillation. You can see that there's amplitude and phase modulation, and it has this spatial pattern, which in fact averages to Which in fact averages to zero if you average over the entire domain because you've got out-of-phase behavior, you've got phase variation in the spatial pattern. So it's an important example to demonstrate that a signal that might not be detectable, say in the global average temperature, can potentially be detectable if you make use of the full spatial information. And given the fact that many of the signals we're interested in have a weak projection onto global Have a weak projection onto global average temperature, but change regional temperatures quite a bit. This is a very powerful feature of this particular approach to signal detection. Finally, that third mode sort of is our model for a frequency modulated El Ni単o signal with an inter-annual time scale and this pattern that sort of shows phase propagation. So, what we're going to do now is we're going to take these synthetic signals, we're going to Synthetic signals. We're going to embed them in red noise that has the approximate sort of amplitude and redness of actual climate data and see how the method, the MTM-SVD method performs. And here now you can see the actual signals and the reconstruction of those signals from the MTM-SVD method. You can see that there is some. Some, you know, obviously there are errors, small errors in phase and amplitude, but the overall characteristics of the signal are captured quite well, and in fact, in many respects, more effectively than in other competing methods of climate signal detection. So, back in the mid-1990s, early to mid-1990s, Jeff Park and I applied this method. Jeff Park and I applied this method that we had developed, which obviously makes use of David's work. It's an outgrowth of the work that David Thompson and others have done over the years applying MTM to various types of geophysical data sets. Jeff in particular had applied these sorts of methods to seismological data. But here was an effort now to apply these sorts of methods, this MTM-SVD method, to climatological data. Method to climatological data to see if, for example, there is evidence of oscillatory signals in the climate record. And that's important from a climate change standpoint, because if some of the long-term trends in the climate system happen to be part of some oscillation, that has implications in our attribution, in our ability to say that this particular phenomenon may be associated with climate change or might instead be associated with natural variability. Variability. And this is the spectrum that we get from applying the method to 100 years of surface temperature data around the world with the median 90, 95, and 99% significant levels relative, again, to that local white noise hypothesis. And unsurprisingly, we see highly significant spectral peaks in the interannual range associated with El Ni単o, and we can look at the spatial pattern. El Ni単o, and we can look at the spatial patterns of those signals and recognize that they look like what we expect El Ni単o to look like. But there was also evidence in particular for sort of an interdecadal oscillation, a 16 to 18 year oscillation in the climate system that other researches at the time had argued for as well, using different data, different methods. And so the MTM SVD application to this data set really did suggest that there might be this sort of interdecadal. That there might be this sort of interdecadal oscillation in the climate system. And then there is what we call the secular band. With 100 years of data and time frequency bandwidth of 2n, we can only identify signals on, you know, with periods shorter than 50 years in a 100-year data set. We can only separate signals of 50 years or shorter periods from some sort of Periods from some sort of secular variation in the data. So, what we see is there is statistically significant variance in that secular band, but we can't say whether or not it's part of an oscillation because it occurs on too long a time scale in this data set. Well, here's that interdecadal signal, and there is some independent evidence that there is a signal of this sort in the climate record, although an analysis. Sort in the climate record, although an analysis of more recent data, the extended surface temperature data, suggests that that signal may be less significant than we once thought. But of particular interest was this question of whether there might be some very low frequency oscillation in the climate system that is too low in frequency, too long in period to detect in 100 years of data, but perhaps might be detectable if Might be detectable if we had longer data sets. It's actually that challenge that led us, Jeff and me, and our collaborator, Ray Bradley, back in the mid-1990s to turn to paleoclimate proxy records like tree rings and corals and ice cores that go back hundreds of years to see if we could identify low frequency oscillatory signals in that record. And we published our findings in the journal Nature back. Findings in the journal Nature back in late 1995, arguing that we could, in fact, see evidence for these sorts of oscillations. I would note that it was this foray into paleoclimate data that ultimately led to the later publication of the so-called hockey stick graph that some of you may be familiar with. So, in a sense, it was our early interest, Jeff and my interest, spurred in substantial part by David Thompson's forays. David Thompson's forays data that led us to analyze these long-term proxy records that ultimately led to the hockey stick graph. So you could say that David and Jeff are both, in a sense, had some role in the science that ultimately led to that. But at the time being, we weren't interested in climate change or reconstructing global temperatures from proxy data. We were simply interested in whether we could detect. Simply interested in whether we could detect oscillatory behavior in those data. And indeed, we argued that you could see multi-decadal spectral peaks that were significant over using different data sets with different temporal resolutions that span different time intervals. There seemed to be consistent evidence for something like a multi-decadal oscillation. I'll just skip past that. In 2000, In 2000, I published an article with Tom Delworth of the Princeton Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, where we analyzed a 1400-year simulation of a controlled coupled ocean atmosphere model. At the time, this was a very rare entity, a very long extended integration of a coupled ocean atmosphere model, a general circulation model that had a dynamical ocean that was sort of innovative at that time. Sort of innovative at that time. And Tom Delworth and his colleagues had analyzed these simulations before and argued that there did seem to be something like a so-called Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation in the data. And you can see here on the left that there is this very sharp spectral peak at about 60 years, centered at about 60-year period, that is, in fact, highly statistically significant, well beyond the 99% significant level. Significant level. You can see it in the data. When a signal is that clear in the frequency domain, you can, of course, see it readily in the data. And this is the spatial pattern of that signal. Without going through the details, if you analyze the relationship between surface temperature and sea level pressure, both of which are analyzed here, you can see this sort of evolution that suggests a role for the over. That suggests a role for the overturning circulation of the so-called ocean conveyor belt. And the phase of that overturning circulation is actually indicated by the arrow. So you can see as the circulation, the ocean circulation, the conveyor belt circulation is changing over the course of half a cycle as reconstructed here. You're seeing changes in the heat transported into the North Atlantic, in sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic, and you're seeing variations in atmospheric. You're seeing variations in atmospheric circulation that go with that. There's an internally consistent signal that actually makes physical sense here. And this led to the notion of an Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation. And since then, it's been blamed on just about everything at one point or another. In particular, in the hurricane community, there are still researchers who argue that the increase in Atlantic hurricane activity is part of the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation. The data doesn't actually support that. It actually suggests that that increase that we've seen really can only be explained by the increase in surface temperatures resulting from human-caused warming of the planet. But we continue to see the claims that these sorts of things can be explained by the AMO. I've sometimes said that I feel like we sort of created a monster here because this concept that we had described and published. We had described and published on has really been taken out of context. And this is an article I published with Carrie Emmanuel back in 2005, an expert at MIT on hurricanes and tropical meteorology. And what we showed was that statistically, you could in fact show that the warming is not associated with an oscillation in the system. It's associated with greenhouse warming and the irregular nature of greenhouse warming, because Greenhouse warming because you have a ramp up in warming over the last century. But then in the 1950s through the 1970s, you have a substantial increase in what are known as sulfate aerosols from coal burning and other activities that actually have this offsetting cooling effect. So you warm early in the century, temperatures flatten out for a few decades in global average temperature, but especially in Atlantic temperatures where that aerosol. Temperatures where that aerosol forcing signal is quite large in the summer. They flatten out. Eventually, we pass the Clean Air Acts in the 1970s. We take away the masking effect of those aerosols and the warming accelerates. Now, if you do something very naive and rather foolish, to be honest, of just taking the long-term time series, subtracting off a linear trend, using the model of a linear trend for the net effect. Trend for the net effect of human activity on climate, and you analyze the residual, you're going to see something that looks like an oscillation. But that's a product of the fact that the human-caused warming trend is not a linear trend over time. It's this irregular trend that reflects the competition between greenhouse warming early, ramping up of aerosol cooling in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and then again, the unmasking and the dominance of greenhouse warming late in the century. And Carrie and I showed that. More recently, I showed that. More recently, we've published work where we've analyzed the state-of-the-art climate model simulations used today by the IPCC, the so-called CMIP coupled model inter-comparison simulations, where dozens and dozens of climate modeling groups around the world do the same experiments. And so there are control simulations where they just run the climate model without changing greenhouse gases or any of the natural factors like solar. Of the natural factors like solar output or volcanic eruptions, and just let the model vary on its own due to internal variability, chaotic variability in the system. And so we analyzed all of the simulations in the latest archives of the IPCC SIP CMIP5 simulations, more than 50 models in this case. And what we showed here, the gray, we'll zoom in on the low frequency part of this spectrum. This is a low. Of this spectrum, this is a local fractional variance spectrum with a dashed curve here: median 90, 95, 99 percent significance. The blue is the extended surface temperature record that goes from 1850 now because they've been sort of extended back in time using more and more data that have been obtained in recent decades. And they come up to the present. So we've got now 118, 15. 1850, 170 years of data. And that actually allows us to now isolate from the secular band of variation a spectral peak that might be associated with a multi-decadal oscillation. In the instrumental records, the actual historical records, that's the thick blue, you see a peak centered around 40 to 50 year time scale that appears highly significant. We'll get back to that. In the control simulation, Get back to that. In the control simulations, you don't see anything like that. The dark gray are two-thirds, the LFE spectra for two-thirds of the simulations. The light gray are 95% of the simulations, the confidence region for 95% of the spectra from the different simulations. And essentially, what you see, the thick black curve, by the way, is the average over all of the models, over all the realizations. And it's about as close to flat as you could. And it's about as close to flat as you could hope for. There really is no evidence for structure in these control simulations on multi-decadal time scales that is distinct from low frequency colored noise of the climate system. A clear contrast with the instrumental record that seems to show a pretty significant peak on that time scale. So we were curious about that. We then went ahead and did the same sort of analysis, but using the control. But using the control, the historical simulations. These are now simulations over the historical period of 1850 to present, where the climate models are now driven with those human factors of increasing greenhouse gases, sulfate aerosols, as well as natural factors like solar fluctuations and volcanic eruptions. And without going through all the detail, now all of a sudden in the models, you see that pretty significant, highly significant apparent. Highly significant apparent spectral peak with a time scale of 40 to 50 to 60 years that can be isolated from the secular band. And in fact, you know, more than two-thirds of the models actually show that. More than 95% of the models actually show it. So it's present in every single model simulation. What's going on here? Without going through all the details, you can see these are different climate model simulations. Climate model simulations, and this is the multi-decadal signal isolated by MTM SBD in each of these control simulations. And the peaks and troughs are in the same place. They shouldn't be. If this is an internal oscillation, its phase should be random. Its phase should be different in every single control simulation that's done, but it isn't. The peaks and troughs are in the same place. And that's because, as we show here, it's an artifact of the competition between greenhouse warming. Competition between greenhouse warming and sulfate aerosol cooling, which ramps up again in the 50s, the 70s, then disappears thereafter. That's what's producing what looks like an oscillation. Now, at this point, and I don't think I have a whole lot of time left, you might say, okay, that may all be true, but how is it then that back in the early 1990s, you and Jeff Park and Ray Bradley showed that there was this evidence of a multi-decadal. This is the evidence of a multi-decadal oscillation in these paleoclimate proxy data that precede the anthropogenic interval, that precede the historical era where we were forcing the climate with greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols. Where does it come from if it is an internal oscillation? Well, that's the latest phase of this research. And we published this a year ago in Science. And what we showed, this is now taking the last millennium simulations. So now this is again the CM. So now, this is again the CMIP models. Lots of groups around the world doing the same experiment, but the experiment they're doing here is driving the climate models with estimated volcanic and solar radiative forcing during the pre-anthrogenic period over the past thousand years prior to industrialization. And this is just showing the average temperature, global average temperature analyzed, averaged over all of those model simulations. And what you can see, the yellow is just highlighting the low frequency. Just highlighting the low frequency, 40 year or 50 year or longer time scale variations. There's a lot of multi-decadal variability, but where's it coming from? It's coming from these big volcanic eruptions. Bang, bang, bang, bang. That's what's generating most of the multi-decadal variants in simply the global average temperature series, averaged over all the model simulations. And because we've averaged over all these different simulations, there's essentially no internal variables. There's essentially no internal variability left. That is a random phase. If you average over lots of realizations, it approaches zero in amplitude, and all that's left is the forced signal that's common to all those simulations. That's what we're seeing here. And so the MTM-SVD method now detects a very significant multi-decadal peak. But you've already basically been told what's going on here. In fact, if you simply do the MTM power spectra of the global average temperature series that I showed you. Global average temperature series that I showed before. It's got this sharp multi-decadal peak. In fact, you can take a simple energy balance model, which has no climate dynamics, no thermohaline circulation, no conveyor belt. It just models the average temperature of the planet. And you can drive that energy balance model with the volcanic and solar forcings that are used in these experiments. And what you get is a multi-decadal spectral peak from the forcing, and it's coming from the From the forcing, and it's coming from the volcanic forcing. It's coming from the sort of time scale of recovery from these large volcanic eruptions and the coincidental spacing of those eruptions that happens in a somewhat coincidental manner to project onto this multi-decadal time scale. That's where it's coming from. And here you can see you reconstruct the signal. The spatial pattern, first of all, looks like what we expect the spatial pattern to look like for a response to volcanic. Like for a response to volcanic forcing, where there's a large tropical response because the radiative forcing is greatest there. And I could go through some of the other details. This looks like volcanic forcing if you look at the spatial pattern. And here is the reconstructed multi-decadal oscillation. Those troughs are lining up with those big volcanic eruptions. That's what's generating it. And so, in conclusion, there is no compelling evidence for internal oscillatory modes of climate variability on internal. Modes of climate variability on internal and multi-decadal time scales in current state-of-the-art multi-model ensemble simulations. In other words, this signal that Jeff and I and then Tom Delworth and I and others argued for in the climate record, the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation, it doesn't appear to exist. It appears to be an artifact of the fact that one or two early simulations did produce an internal oscillation with this time scale. Internal oscillation with this time scale. And analyses of climate data that don't take into account the role of forcing seem to give rise to a multi-decadal spectral peak. But it's coming from the forcing. It's not coming from internal variability. It's coming from the competition between greenhouse gases and aerosols in the modern era and this sort of coincidental pacing of the large volcanic forcing episodes in past centuries. I will leave it there. I hope we have a little. It there. I hope we have a little bit of time for questions.
