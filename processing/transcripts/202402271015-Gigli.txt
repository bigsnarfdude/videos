So, first of all, this talk is a bit about global orange geometry, on which I'm no expert, okay? And I won't pretend I am. I'm just learning something which I want to share with you. And one other thing I want to say is that, yes, I could speak about a novel approach to global reset geometry, but novel by no means means better. Novel, just novel. Okay, it's a new perspective that. It's a new perspective that can give some further insight about our understanding of the region. And most of what I'm going to say is coming from a joint collaboration with a number of people. This is by far the biggest project in terms of number of people involved I've ever been been involved in. These persons are John Pierce Bern, Matthias Brown, Master Vallista, Robert McCann, Argamona Jam Fredrik Strott and Clement Simon. I'm Frederick Strotten and Clement Simon. And the reason why there are so many of us is because in the fall of 2022, there has been a thematic semester on not geometry in Florida. And it was a very, very nice atmosphere and friendly behavior by basically all the participants. And we started some conversation around non-motor fluorescent geometry and what I'm going to tell today mostly comes out of this conversation. So let me start with the, I think, a statement we can all agree with: namely, when we do analysis or geometric analysis, either on RD or on Riemann manifolds, well, we tend to use quite often things like sobre functions, elliptic operator, and banana spaces. I'm not saying that these are necessary tools, nor that they are sufficient. I'm just saying that we frequently have to deal with these. And the next observation, and the starting point of this talk, is that when we are not on Rd, not on the space, but rather in the Minkausian setting, or not on a Riemannian manifold, but rather in a Lorentzian manifold, none of these three guys have a clear analog. And because of the different signature of the metric transfer, right? If you have the same Kostian scalar product, which places the Euphelian scalar product, then Product, then basically the data version, which is a hyperbolic, of course, takes place, takes the place of the Laplacian. It is not clear what is a sobbed function. And it is not clear, say, what is a Banach space in the sense that the space of, say, L P vector fields on R Deform evidently a Banach space. But in this signature, I mean, even the I mean, even the norm can be negative. The squared norm can be negative, it's all sense. So, and you don't have a triangle inequality, so things are clear. And then one can say, okay, who cares? Lorentz geometry has been flourished for one set at least without the need of these books. So, why should we care? Of course, it's very possible that a set of books works in a certain setting, then you change the setting, and you're putting the boots, but nothing more. To get the other between the groups, massive monetary. But there is at least one reason why we might ponder this question, and the reason has to do with a non-smooth geometry. Now, in this talk, I mean, all of the talk will be about the smooth category, but as a motivation, and in fact, the idea to say that most of what we're going to say is perhaps relevant even in the flat Minkowski setting, okay? But as a motivation as to why we should go in in in certain directions really comes from no smooth geometry. Really comes from no smooth geometry. And here is the point. So, I guess we all know that, you know, one of the many things that Romo proposed was that, you know, in order to study how many folks can degenerate once we fix a certain bound of curvature or dimension of other geometrically relevant quantities, is to basically think many fold as metric spaces and met the category. You know, a meticate of manifolds into this not category of metric geometry. And I mean, the program, I won't make any attempt of mentioning results of this program, but the program has been a success. This idea worked. Now, more recently, a similar program has been started for Lorenzo and drugs. I won't say too much, but let me just say that despite the Despite the things being so recent, there are already clear signs that there is some interesting geometry going on, even in this nose-mood-Lorenzian setting. Let me just mention two of the most important results that came out of this Lorentzian nosemool program so far. So, one is a nosemooth version of the Oaking singularity theorem that has been stated and proved by. Stated and proved by Cavalier Mondino. So basically, you have a way to define what it is a metric Lorentzian manifold, the metric analog of a Lorentzian manifold. Let me say, and you have a way to say, one of the things that Cavalier and Mondino did, you have a way to say that this space has, say, no negative rich in time-like directions. And in this setting, they can state and prove an open sign. Setting they can state and prove an open sequence in it. So, this is a sense a comparison result if you're wanting it related to lower each bound, highly non-trivial. And there is another highly non-trivial comparison result, this time related to sectional Fucosh-Rober bound, namely the splitting theorem as an analogy Lorentz setting, both under assumptions of non-negative sectional Fucos and other assumptions. Negative sectional progression and other assumptions of negative reaching progression. In such as the easier case, that means the splitting under sectional corrosion over bound has been generalized in the Lorentzian Lorentzian set by Verano and Ayam raw 36. Now, what has all of this has to do with the elliptic operators of all functions and Paranc spaces? The previous slide. Well, things are very much related to lower each bounds because, in the elliptic, in the classical, in such sense, metric setting, lower rich conversion bounds in the non-loose setting are encoded through basically a couple of notions. So, the first notion is what is called the curvature dimensional condition that has to do with optimal transport. This is the so-called C D condition produced by a lot of PLEA. And this class of spaces, I won't give any definition, but perhaps let me just mention that this class of spaces contains, among other things, Fisler manifolds, which is great if you want to have a theory that is essentially encapsulated both Fiemannian and Pislerian altogether. It is less great if you are looking for strong geometric rigidity results, because things are manifold subjects too flexible. And so this coups dimensional condition, if you are looking more Dimensional condition, if you are looking more to you know geometric kind of results, has to be announced with infinitesimal invertedity, which is something that I proposed a few years later. And this concept of infinitesimal invertibility is related to the structure of sovereign functions. So here, so because there are sobolt functions here, in some sense, in this business of metric measure geometry, particularly related to lower-rich bounds. Related to lower each bounds, the Banach spaces, elliptic operators, they tend to play a crucial. Now, in this approach by Cavalier and Mondino to lower each bounds in the Lorentzian setting, basically what they do, one of the things they do is to try to imitate and generalize, adapt the approach by Los Permeli to the Lorentzian setting. So the class of space they consider contain Contain what we should call a Fiesler-Lorentzian setting. And it is natural to wonder whether we can rule out Fiesler-like geometries even in this Lorentzian setting the same way we did in the elliptic setting, in the Riemannian setting. And so this naturally pops up the question whether we can do anything similar to what IPRemay Bertianity has done in the elliptic case. Case. And this already, per se, brings out a question: okay, wait a moment, if it is Ribertianity is related to assembled functions, at least in this category, I certainly know what is assembled function over a Riemannian manifold. But what if I want to do the same in a Rorenser setting? So I have a Lorentz manifold, Minkowski, after the the the Minkowski uh scalar product. What is this of the function over there? As you know is there any option to sort of push? To sort of push. But anyway, so this is my motivation, certainly. But in that sense, I will really say almost nothing about the NOS mode settings. So you can forget about the slides if you don't care about. So that's the concept of my talk. So I will say cover what I need to introduce this setting, and then I will discuss somewhere functions with pattern space. All right. All right. So, okay, one to twelve. Maybe. Okay. So I will, I will, so my slides are will always be divided into two basically. There is a so on the above, I will describe the Riemannian or elliptic situation that is what I'm certainly most familiar with, and where this concept that I go to describe, some of the functions, et cetera, are already well known and well understood. And well understood. And then, given that I want to highlight similarities between the Lorentzian setting and the Riemannian setting in the bottom of the slide, I will describe this Lorentzian macrobiotic setting. There are some colors that here are not rendered very well, but yeah, anyway, so there is a reddish color and remain a setting and a bluish colour in the other colour. Okay, let's see. Let's see. Okay. So, yeah, let's start, you know. So let's start, you know, geometry, let's start with the flat case. So above the flat Ariemanian menu for this R T, the Euclidean R T, where we know everything, right? So that is the metric tensor, it's just the, you know, G V is just the sum of Vi squared. We have the ball, the ball in the D is clearly compact, complex, and of finite measure. We have the familiar triangle inequality. We have the familiar We are the familiar quality, and these are valid for any couple of vectors of objects. Now, what is the flat Lorentzian guy? Well, it's basically the Minkowski space. And in the Minkowski space, we put this Minkowski metric tensor. I use this choice of a signature, so plus, minus, minus. And the reason is that I want to take the future cone. Future cone and I want to put on it on this future cone on this hyperbolic norm, Lorenzen. So I take the square root of this guy. So in order to take this square root, this guy should be positive, and this guy is positive in the future and on the past cone, but I just fix one of the two. And if you want to know, say, how to extend or how to think how to extend this norm on vectors that are not future directed, well, then it's minus FP. And that's the thing. So, if I said the directions we can move on only the directions, so transcent and past we cannot go. And the unit ball, whether you want to think of the unit ball as, you know, this side of the purple or the other one, in either case, is not compact and not of finite measure. And if you take the bottom part, it's not even convex. So it can't be certainly rather relative. Certainly, rather relative. But there's one thing that I want to underline, and one of the reasons why I'm restricting to future is that if you restrict to a future code, it would be the same for the past, but not the two together, is that you have a reverse triangle in a and you have a reverse consistency. So this opens the possibility of, well, having a variational approach of distances that is crucial if you want to. Is that it's crucial if we want to define the analog of a metric space in this set. So these are not true if we go out of the future, but as far as we stick their all right, so from flat to say smooth curved case, so the you know, above the definition of Riemannian manifold, we all know what it is. And let me point out that essentially, because of the triangle. Essentially, because of the triangular inequality, because of the triangular inequality, we can define a distance on a manifold by taking, you know, you fix an exponent q bigger than one, and then you define a distance by taking this inf of the action, where the action is, you know, integrals p to the power q. And if this, you know, if then you take the sq root of the q root of this, the resulting function does not depend on q, okay, and it's the distance of everything. The distance of that thing. And geodesics are local minimizer. This is basically related to the fact that on Rd, of course, you have equality in the triangle inequality if and only if the three points are aligned. And that's how the analog of this is your equality, the triangle inequality, basically, if and only if the three points are along the 2D6. So this is the familiar parameter. Now, in the Lorentzian setting, Lorentz manifold is a manifold with a Minkowski scalar polarity on each tangent space. And I'm going to assume global hyperbolicity, which is in the Kausa ladder, is basically the strongest assumption we can make. I just want to say if I don't want to discuss what sort of craziness, if you want, that can arise. So I will assume that my manifold is time-oriented. So we have a choice of future codes. So, we have a choice of future cones, which is consistent along the whole manifold. I don't have closed causal curves. So, if I start from a point and I go to the future, I will never be able to be back to my point, my original point. And I'm asking for compactness of causal diamonds. So, what is a causal diamond? Well, once you have a time orientation, you can see whether a point Y is in the future of a point X. The future of a point x. Basically, if you can go from x to y with a smooth curve, derivative always points to the future, then y is in the future of x. And the causal diamond is you take two points and you pick the set, the collection of points that are in the future of the first and in the past of the other. And so that's the shape of a diamond, if you think of the Minkowski setting, and we ask this to be compact. So basically, this is the analog or the best analog of what, I mean, of a completeness no. I mean, of a completeness notion that we assume typically when we deal with the Riemannian metrics. We cannot say that the metric is complete because we don't have a Riemannian Riemannian distance. We don't have, in particular, we don't have a triangular classically intended. We have another triangular encoded. So we can do the analog of what did above with the minimization of the action functional. This time we can maximize the action function. So as before, take a parameter q, but rather big. Parameter q, but rather bigger, rather than choosing it to be bigger than one, we choose it to be smaller than one, and possibly negative. And then you take the soup of this function, and then you take the q root, this, and the result is a function that does not depend on q, and it's called either Lorentzian distance or time separation function. Okay, and if we agree that L is minus infinity whenever y is not in the future of x, basically what we get. Definition of x basically, what we get is a function that satisfies this reverse triangle. Now, I will just one slide about the notable setting. So this triangle inequality and this triangular quality can be used to axiomatize what a metric space or, say, hyperbolic metric space is. We all know the definition of metric spaces given by Frechet. I'm recalling it just to point out that more than 100 years passed before somebody. Last week before, somebody was brave enough to try to give a definition of what it is, you know, the analog of metric space in this Lorentzian setting. And this is what Kunzinger and Salman did a few years ago, and it was one of the crucial starting points for these programs about non-smooth Lorentzian geometry. So knowing what is a non-smooth Lorentzian manifold, this was, of course, a crucial sort of part of this question, at least. And so, what it is, well, let's say, let's call it a hyperbolic matrix space. Hyperbolic matrix space or Lorentzian length space in the terminology of integral and summer, well, it's just a set if it contributed function that is either positive or minus infinity, which is equal to zero. Lxx is zero and satisfies the reverse direction. And we can use, just for the records, we can use this so we can encode all of the closest structure and chronological relation. Correlation that we have in the smooth Lorenzen setting out on this time separation function. So you can say that y is in the you know in the causal future of x, provided l of xy is greater or equal than zero. That would be the causal relation of a mean cost here or ancient manifold. And you can also define a chronological relation, you know, provided you know y is in the chronological fusion of x. lies in the ecological future of X, provided L of X Y is strictly bigger than C. And when you have this later order relation, you can use it to use a topology on your space. Basically, the collection, what you want is basically the collection of Y's in the future, the project of X, they do form an open set for any X, and vice versa, when the points are past the open set, X and the dependence. In a global hyperbolic Lorentzian management, this would be the topology of the management. That's a way of building a topology, a reasonable topology out of this time sequence. So if you want to go into no smooth range and setting, basically there's your first definition. But I will not go there, but I just wanted to highlight that there's room for having this sort of and of course the reverse of handle inequality. And of course, the reverse to angle inequality is the starting point for any kind of variational argument. You can speak about geodesics, for instance. The three points are aligned if you have equality, this reverse system. All right. And now what are some of the functions? Well, first of all, let's say before going to sobre functions, you know, that there is one step that we have before. Before having sobre functions, we have soboleph energy. Okay, so let's see what. F energy. So let's see what our sub energy is in the Rd or in a minor setting. And notice that the map that takes a smooth function f and returns the norm of the differential of that function at any given point of R D or Riemannian manifold, whatever you want. This function is convex, okay? This is a way of tracing uh the a triangle in a point. That's the d what you want, the the dual triangle. Triangle input in the dual space. Triangle importing the dual space. Well, now fix an solvent for voltage exponent p bigger than one. You can think it is the dual of the cube that means for defining the distance. And consider the function up, I mean the graph is over there as you know 1 over p z to the p. This function is convex and increasing. And therefore, if you compose that function convex and increasing with the norm of the differential, this map over here. Differential, this map over here, F to UP of the F is convex. Easy to check. And therefore, when you integrate it, you get a convex function for the space of convex functions. And if you properly extend it, you basically get a convex and lower semiconductor. Okay, what do we do in the Lorentzian setting? Well, we first define, let me say that the function is a time function whenever it is monotone with respect to the causal relation. Respect to the causal relation. So, y in the future of x implies f of y greater than or equal to f of x. In the class of time functions, the map that takes f and returns the modulus of the f is concave. Okay, and again, this is basically the dual of the reverse triangle inequality that we have in the Minkowski set. Okay, now, as before, rather than taking a stable of exponent, this time smaller than one. Touble of exponent, this time smaller than one, and we take the same function as before, so one over p z to the p. So that is still increasing, but this time it's concave and is either positive or negative depending on p, but the shape is kind of always the same. So derivative plus infinity is zero, then derivative zero is zero to plus infinity. Well, then, because this is concave and increasing, and because this guy here is concave, this map is concave. Therefore, I change sign, I integrate, and what I get. Sign I integrate, and what I get is a convex and lower centric continuous function over the space of time functions. So, that's so this is the sample of energy, the Riemannian setting, and this I want to say is the analog of the sample of energy, the Lorentzian setting. There's at least one crucial difference between these two settings, and the fact is that in the Riemannian setting, being soble is Being soblef is already a regularity information. So, not every function is solef. Here the situation is a little bit different because, in order, well, as soon as I sort of insist that my function is a time function, this function will always be finite. Such as being a time function is already a first-order regularity information, like the denote is greater than zero, and and therefore. And therefore, this is automatically debounded. But nevertheless, I want to insist that this is an interesting fact. And my goal is to try to convince you that this is the case. For the moment, it's just an interesting. All right. Why do we care about convex energies? Well, first of all, there's one reason. So, as soon as you have a convex functional, you can take for free basically one derivative because convex functionals. Derivative because convex functionals, you can, convex functions, they admit directional derivatives. Okay, so let's see what happens if we take directional derivatives of this to these functionals E P that I just defined. Well, if we do this in the Riemannian setting, what we end up with is basically the P Laplace. So the variation of the first variation of this P energy is the P L Laplace. So whenever I say that is sufficient, it's mostly. Well, so the point of the convexity is that the difference portion always has a limit when epsilon goes to zero, that is the monotonicity of different portions that is given by convexity. So that limit exists. And it is basically under some a little bit of assumption, but not too many, it's a linear functionality. And depending on the continuity property of this function, you can basically try to extract, you can say that f as a P l applied. To extract, you can see that f has a fila plasma whenever this you know, this limiting quantity that appears over here can be represented by you know scalar product in some function, say in the two forms. Okay, but you know, formally, you know, you differentiate this energy and you integrate by parts, and what you get is the spillaplash. Okay, Laplacian, we all know what it is. I mean, it's a nice operator, it's not as nice as Telaplash, but the little brother of Telaplacian speak whether it is. So, let's do the same. So let's do the same in this Lorentzian set, hyperbolic setting. Literally the same. What we end up with is basically the Petalumburg. So it's really the same format. So we differentiate, we integrate by parts. What we get as variation of this energy is the speed of inversion. Again, if P is equal to 2, we end up with the Dalamversion. But here we cannot take P equal to 2. P here is smaller than 1, so it must be far from. As a remark, I will not really dig too much into this, but let me point out this conceptual curious. So, we can use this approach to define P-Laplacian and P-de-Lamburger in a setting where the only thing we know is what it is modulus of the L. This is a bit crazy if you never thought about this, but if you only know what the modulus of the differential of a function is, well, you can use this sort of trick to define the Laplace or P Laplace. To define the Laplacian or P Laplace and the P da Rodros. And therefore, and I'm adding a lot of dust under the carpet, but therefore, you can try to use this set of ideas to define pillar flash and or pillar inversion in an entirely non-smooth setting. Of course, there's a lot to say. It's not that trivial. But you build on top of at least. You build on top of, at least in the Riemann setting, you build on top of ideas of Koskella, McManus, French, Galligan, and Rosso Sabre and myself. Basically, you have a notion of sober function in metric spaces. And then what I did was to use this basically this trick to define Laplacian and through integration by parsing measure geometry. And let me just point out one theorem, basically, what? Theorem, basically, well, one theorem in the in the okay, I present this in the non-smooth setting. In this move setting, this is basically Calabi. The nozzle setting, the theorem tells, roughly speaking, that if you assume, so this C D zero n condition, forget about the Q for the moment. So, the C D zero n condition means suppose we are in a setting where in the sense of log true novel, we have non-negative Richie Kurbat and dimension bounded from Bob. And dimension bounded from by n. Well, then, basically, if we take, let's say the p is equal to q is equal to 2, and take the function one-half distance squared from a point, well, basically, this result is telling that the Laplacian of that function is bounded from both by end, much like the classical estimate by Calabi is telling us in this setting. Why I'm mentioning this in the Nosmo setting? Well, so, first of all, of course, I'm cheating. Well, so first of all, of course, I'm cheating a lot because I'm stating a theorem without defining what is the C D condition. Okay, I don't want to do so take too much time. What I want to insist on is that the C D condition that, as I already mentioned, was introduced by Los Angeles, is related to optimal transport. And now I'm mentioning that basically what I want just to, the point that I want to stress is that through this definition, a priori-based and optimal transport, or inside the definition, there is already encoding. The definition there is already encoded a Laplacian comparison estimate that is very much you know a differential kind of encoding and relates more to sobolet functions than Laplacian. And of course, in the smooth setting, this was already well known, I have nothing to do with this, this Calabi that Shigeran Gromo sort of interpreted this the originalistic Calabi Calabi in the very sense they interpreted in the And then also it would be the interpretive in the more distributional sense, but still, the estimate was the sense. What is perhaps a little bit more interesting is that, well, first of all, this theorem above has an analog. So the eight of us produced the perfect analog of the above theorem in the setting of, say, in Lorentzian signature, working with this called T C D condition, so time-like purvas two-dimensional condition. This was the condition introduced by Cavalier Temonino that I was referring in my initial slide. That I was referring to in my initial slides. And again, the theorem tells us that if you take this function one over q, sort of the Lorentzian distance or time separation distance to the power q, well, then the p-dalab version of this function is less than n. Now, written in this way, I have not find the please here in the setting cube is p is less than one. Yes. So, okay. So, okay. Yeah, what is the standard P in this field? So, so I'm sorry, so dividing into so the ah, sorry. So, here, P and Q, they are greater or equal than one, and one over P plus one over Q is one. Here we are in the Riemannian set, they are both greater or equal than one. And the classical estimate you will ever see is P equal to equal to. Ever see is p equal q equals 2. Okay, so that's the Laplacian comparison. If you want to play the game with different p and q, well, you just remember what it is, the p Laplacian, there is no divergence of modulus. And it's the same theorem. There is nothing that's a now in this Lorentzian signature though, both P and Q, they are both smaller than one, still with the relation one over P plus one over Q equal to one. Okay? Equal to one. Okay? And there is no classical case. I want to argue that there is, you know, I'm not as far as I know. I guess the so one that you will find often in paper, I mean, everything here is very recent, so often names the last couple of years, basically, people have been writing. So is say P1 alpha and Q minus one. That's one choice. Another choice. Another choice, which is a bit of a limiting choice, but for some reasons, maybe I want to argue is kind of the best one, is p equal to equals zero, in which case, of course, this makes no sense. Then this goes basically to a log of the time separation. But let's stay far from that limiting. So let's pick Q equal. So Q equal minus one and So Q equals minus one and P equal one half is a possibility, or vice versa, okay? That they both. But yeah, thanks for this question. Yes, there is no preferred choice. As of today, I see no preferred choice. In my last slide, I will point out why p equals 2 equals 0 maybe is the most natural one, but time will tell, I guess. Yeah, so what I want to say is that, yeah, the comparison estimates for the The comparison estimates for the Dalamversion of the time separation function, they're very much, they're very well known in essence. They are the starting point, for instance, of the splitting theorem. But for this speed Dalam version and for this time separation to some power, I have not really seen the statement. Although, of course, much like in the Riemannian setting, you can reduce to the classical statement by some just change. You know, the classical data version comparison for time separation, you get speed of. You get um, you get speed analogies, okay. But again, why should we care? I mean, why is this irrelevant? I'm just phrasing well-known results in a more complicated manner. And why should I do that? And this is basically the, in fact, this is the only slide I should have presented. So let's illustrate this. So, as I mentioned at the beginning, so when we work in the Renssela signature, the Dalam version, which is the divergence of the equalistian gradient, is the The equivalent gradient is the replacement for the Laplace. And what I'm saying now is: well, perhaps rather than Dalam version, which is the linear operator, I mean, there is this other guy that pops out rather naturally by analogy with the remaining setting, which is the P-delamversion. And why we should care about this other guy? Well, the point is that the classical inversion is hyperpopic, while the P-dale inversion is the limit. So, and that's basically the whole point that I. That I really want to make. So, the space of time functions. So, this is not defined on functions that are not time because modules of the differential might be negative in some sense. So, they'll see. So, I don't know what it means to raise this to some real power, such as p minus 2. So, I want to restrict to a space of functions, a cone of functions, at least, where that guy is well defined as positive. And how do I know that this is elliptic? Know that this is elliptic? Well, I know because I already said this. So it arises as the variation of a convex function. And variations of convex functions always produce elliptic rhythms. What do I mean by elliptic, by the way? Well, pick the definition that you prefer. So either, you know, you linearize this guy at any time function, and then you look at the resulting matrix, matrix that the transition is positive and mid. Or in the sense of non-linear operators are. Operators are avis, it's this monotony. Notice that as is so the given the time separations function, so much, so in the Riemann setting, grad of the distance is one, right? And that's the same in the Lorentz setting. So grad of the distance, Lorentz distance is one. So as far as you are concerned only with time separations, you really don't see the difference between this two. Okay, so that. So that perhaps, I guess, could be an explanation of why people don't really care, because if you only care about the Lamborghini comparison for the time separation, then they do what they see. But this guy is elliptic. So let me sort of try to further argue in this direction of ellipticity because there is, I think, much more to say. And one point which I think is worth to mention is that once you start thinking in this direction, Once you start thinking in this direction, you realize that maybe there is a case, and Agrašov has been shouting this the last 25 years at least, for studying neither Riemannian nor Lorentzian geometry, but perhaps Hamiltonian geometry. So there is a common viewpoint that encapsulates both the Riemannian and the Lorentzian setting at the same time. And the point is to study Hamiltonian geometry. This is Hamiltonian geometry where you take a smooth manifold and rather than putting either a small And rather than putting either a scalar production or because the scalar product, you just put an Hamiltonian on the manifold, the tangent part of the manifold. Each point, you have an Hamiltonian, if you want, I mean, in the cotangent space. And in the Riemannian setting, the Hamiltonian will be something like, you know, one over P momentum variable to the power P for P bigger than one. And in the Lorentzian setting, it will be minus one over P momentum to the power P. Moment to the power p for future-directed covectors and for p in this case smaller than one, okay? And plus infinity for vectors that are not future-directed. In both cases, this is a convex Hamiltonian. Okay, and what do you what can you do? Just a very brief, you know, very, very, very, very brief introduction to Hamiltonian geometry. Well, once you have an Hamiltonian, you can build a duality relation between tangent and cotangent spaces, because you know, you can use the know you can induce the from h the lagrange l and by definition of you know complex duality uh you know uh the duality between uh covector and the vector is always bounded from both by h of p plus l of v and then you can say that you know the the vector dual to a certain covector is the vector for which you have equality and this gives you uh a nice although uh nice in the sense of nicely tied to Hamiltonian geometry but non-linear relation Geometry, but no linear relation between cotangent and tangent space. So you can define the Hamiltonian gradient of the function as that vector for which those vectors, if you have more than one, for which you call it yours. If h is one half p squared, squared in the sense for you have some metric, Riemannian metric tensor, then this graph is precisely the gradient usually to the Riemannian sense. And once you have a gradient, you can take the divergence and that gives the Hamiltonian Laplacian, if you want. And the P Laplacian, P delanversion basically, in this format, become the same operators. There's just the Hamiltonian and Laplace, depending on your choice of the Hamiltonian, but they're the same guy. And then Richie curvature along either every, every, or. Either every, every, or just future directions can be read in terms of a suitably defined Hamiltonian rich curvature. And this was what basically Otta did, this paper of 10 years ago. So you can interpret lower rich curvature bound in terms of just in terms of this Hamiltonian properties. And here is something extremely, extremely interesting that Ota did. Ota realized that tied to any That tied to any Hamiltonian, convex Hamiltonian, there is a highly non-linear Bochner identity. Let me perhaps write for recall what is the Bochner identity, the classic Arimanian setting. This is the crucial identity, especially whenever you are interested in lowering corrosion bounds. You have to Write it and then I comment relation plusion of F plus the exchange. Okay, so the Bochner identity tells us that the Laplacian of the fraction of f squared over two is basically composed of three terms, one of which is the hash, the hay-pressed norm of the H. hash at the hay-perspect normal diet's word okay then one term is the ricci and then there is another term which is the differential differential of laplace now one of the reasons why this is so useful in the setting of studying manifolds below the risk of response is that well if the risk corresponded from below this guy is bounded from below and therefore and therefore you can use this identity to basically extract information about the hash out of Out of function to which you know how the Laplacian and the differential is now in the Lorentzian setting, so this is basically just algebra. This has nothing to do with the signature of the metric transport. You can pick any G, non-degenerate, whatever signature, how many plus and minus you want, just those zeros, for instance, just be sure to have a nice wide creation. Nice white relation with tangent and cotangent, and you can you can write this. The problem, I mean, what you should realize is that here I'm writing as df squared or h and f squared is a quantity that is not anymore positive, it's just g of df df or g hash and h. So that can be either positive or negative or zero. And that's the reason why people in the rents and geometry and general relativity don't really use that much book network identity. That much Bookner identity of the resulting Bookmap equality because knowing in a signature that is not positive, knowing that this guy is zero will not tell that the Hessian is zero. So what people tend to do is to try to use something like the Reichsha-Dubi equation, which basically is a sort of kind of relation that you kind of tend to divide or split your fiber, your Lorentzian manifold into a Or Lorentzian manifold into a certain family of Cauchy hypersurfaces. On these hypersurfaces, you have an actual Laplacian, Manion intended, and then you can describe how this Laplacian valides when you move in time-like direction. And the Rashad-Doulet equation helps you understanding that. But you don't have really a full Bochner identity or a useful Bookner inequality in this Lorentz signature. But what other realized is that it is. Is that it is a Hamiltonian formalism? You actually do. So on the left-hand side, you have this expression that in the Riemannian setting basically amounts at the difference between Laplacian, which what is called sometimes the gamma two operator for those of you familiar with the Bach Riemanni for brain is a Laplacian df squared minus df d Laplacian f. And this is what comes out out of this relation with h is d squared over. If h is p squared over two, okay, and on the right-hand side, you have these two terms: one which is the Hamiltonian of F, you know, squared normal plus the Ricci curvature. And again, the Ricci curvature is the one that, at least in this, you know, when you reduce to either the Riemannian or Reynolds setting, is the object that is actually bounded from below, as in the usual Riemannian formulas. And this guy, and this difference, this guy, this is an elliptic framework. This is an elliptic framework, unlike the Hessian term Hawkins identity in Lorentzian sequence. It's elliptic means, so this guy is always non-negative, and it is zero if and only if something very digital pulse. That is to say, if and only if F is affine along the Hamiltonian flow. Okay. Okay, what is the Hessian? So, what is Hessian H? Well, I won't give too many details, but you can think. So, when you have an Hamiltonian, you have So when you have an Hamiltonian, you have the Hamiltonian flow, so the curves, you know, for which Hamilton, the Lagrangian, so the Lagrangian is minimized, if you want. And these are your replacements for 2D6. And now once you have this, you can say, okay, I pick a function, say a smooth function, I differentiate it twice the direction of this Hamiltonian flow. And I, you know, the second derivative basically is going to be described by a tensor, and this tensor is this session. And then going to take the L. And then I'm going to take the L the Hilbert norm of this Hessian term with respect to a certain scalar product. And this scalar product is basically the Hessian of the Hamiltonian computed at the differential of the function. I'm going fast, but the Hamiltonian is a convex function. Whenever you take the Hessian at any covector field, you get a non-negative scalar product because by complexity, and you use that scalar product to compute the Hilbert spinner of the. Uh, the Hilbert Smith of this guy, okay, but it doesn't matter, so I don't want to get too technical. So, the point is that, unlike the in the Lorentzian signature, um, uh, uh, this guy, uh, this guy is elliptic, okay. If you want the relation, and and and there is the relation between this Hamiltonian Hessian and this norm, uh, uh, the relation to the pedal and version that we've seen before is somehow, you know, like the relation between the standard Hessian and the Laplace, right? So the Hessian is a Laplace, right? So the Hessian is a matrix, so you take the trace, you get the Laplacian, and then the bottom identity, take the L2 norm of the Hessian, and it's kind of the same. This Hessian F is highly non-linear in F because the L2 norm we use, the metric tensor we use, depends on F in a non-linear way. But still, this guy is, you know, Jamat, is sort of the trace, the norm, the Higgsman norm of a matrix. And this matrix is related to the P-down version. The PIDA version and yeah, it has an elliptic flavor. Let me check the time because I want to so 15 minutes. Let me just try to further convince you about the value something useful by presenting you an application of both those semi-tunnel properties to display. Of auto-synamic properties to the splitting theorem. Now, the splitting theorem, of course, has already been mentioned several times. It's the Ricci cases that perhaps the prototypical example of rigid result under the Louis Richie force bounds. So, Shiri and Romol, they prove that the manifold is the negative rich and contains a line, then it splits. Okay, so it's a Euphium product of another manifold times pi. And Yao conjectured. Conjectured that the same should have been true in Lorentz signature, provided that each equator was non-negative in time-like direction. And in this case, and you have a time-like line, say a curve as before, which is a geodesic whenever it's restricted to any proper sub-interval of R. And in that case, if that occurs, then M should be the Minkowski product of R and C. Of R and some Riemannian manifold with a negative region. Minkowski product means that on M we put this camera product dt squared minus g. And this conjecture by Yao has been proved by Gallo, Ries and Vernon in a sort of a set of papers under slightly different assumptions on the structure, underlying structure of the Lorentz manifold. But basically, the acquisition is true. And how did they prove this? Well, they, I mean, it's an amazing. I mean, it's an amazing two-default because they would have started from the Dalai Burger comparison for the distance function that I mentioned before. But then, given that the Dalai Burger is not elliptic, they had, I mean, the use of maximum principle and stuff like that was very, very delicate. They had to use this relationship to the equation that I briefly mentioned and a number of other delicate results that I will not discuss. What I want to point out is that via this Hamiltonian formalism, you can have a proof, at least for. You can have a proof, at least formally, of the splitting theorem that resembles very much the Riemannian one. So, let me very briefly mention this proof. So, how do you split? Well, basically, the first observation is that you go from true method to an issue if you wish. So, a manifold splits if and only if you have a function which is non-constant and with zero hash. We have already seen this question yesterday in the talk by. And the same is in the Lorentz signature, although in this case, given that you want such as this R has to have a specific direction, which is that the function, non-constant has to be a time function. And how do we get this function? Well, this is the Booseman function. It's basically the distance from infinity from points on the line. Now, when you have a line, you have two possible Booseman functions. Line, you have two possible Boozemann functions: one distance from you know, basically plus infinity, the one distance from minus infinity. You can define those most in the Riemannian and the red cell signature, and they have this property that you know, one is above the other, and they agree along the function. The fact that one is above the other is basically a consequence of triangle. Okay, so how do we conclude from this? Well, you know, if you look at the you know underlying If you look at the underlying geometric considerations, the proof of the splitting is really two lines. And technicalities can become extremely complicated. But the bottom line, the geometric point, is that we split these two lines. So first of all, what one uses is the negativity of the Ricci and Laplacian comparison to get that this, you know, the Laplacian of the function in the Liptic case. The Laplacian of the function that sits above is less than zero. The Laplacian of the function that sits below is greater than zero. But one function is above the other. But one function is above the other, and they two touch a point at a point. So, by the strong maximum principle, they have to agree. So, they agree, and therefore, in particular, they are harmonic. Okay, now you plug this in the Bookner identity. You use the fact once again that the region is non-negative to conclude the dehession of this Business function is zero and of the proof. And the interesting point is that this Hamiltonian formula is basically the same. Formally, it's basically the same, the same works formally. So, we have no negative reach, so we have an acuter and version of P-dale and version comparison for the Booseman function above and below. Okay, and as before, you know, the Bozeman function, you know, we have one which is above, the one which is below, they touch at the point, and therefore, by the strong maximum principle, in this case, I should call it strong tangency principle because they are not, we have a non-linear operator, but still, and we have basically a pier modifier. And we have basically a pier monitor function. And then you plug it in the Booker Note identity. You realize that this left-hand side is zero, as before. The reach is non-negative because of the time-like rich condition. So this guy is zero. And you end up proving that the Muslim function is a zero Hessian. Now, in the Lippy case, this, of course, has been already made rigid by Chili and Common, like 50 years ago. In this Lorentzian setting, we don't have yet a rigorous proof, meaning that the A rigorous proof, meaning that the operator is elliptic, but is non-uniform elliptic. There are some regularity issues that we haven't dealt with yet. But still, at least formally, this is, I think, a very convincing argument in favor of this kind of formalism. And there's also something else that is worth to point out. This sort of argument, much like, so in the elliptic case, you have automatically room for estimates in case you want to. For estimates, in case you want to go toward an almost fitting theorem. That's, of course, what Shiger and Koldig did. So, if your each equivalent, rather than being greater than zero, is greater than minus epsilon, and maybe you don't have really a line, but you have a long judiciary, what this argument tells is that you have some estimate on the hash of it. And that's the same here. Okay? So, if rather than having exactly the assumptions of the split. Exactly, the assumptions of the split almost then, you get some estimate of some form on the S of L. And this opens up. You don't have anything of this form in the better known proof of Gallup, Escherboog, and Euro, right? But this formality gives you some estimate, and you can try to prove an almost pretty result in this Lorentz, these Lorentzian signals. We are trying, nowhere near the conclusion, but with Melanie Graph and Eric Hulgar, we are trying to actually. Frederick Hulger, we are trying to actually see whether this works. But let me point out that as of today, as far as I know, there are no almost rigid results at all in Grand Satzette. There are none of them. And part of the reason is because the metric analog, this Kunzinger-Seiman approach to metric Lorentzian hyperbolic spaces was not yet there. So it's not very clear what's the correct category was starting. Make these sort of studies. But even now, even having the correct category, if you don't have any sort of elliptic object to work with, it's very hard to make almost everything. Let me perhaps three minutes. Just a couple of comments about Banach spaces. I guess we can. So So, okay, perhaps one way to phrase the question of a mind is the following. Maybe suppose that I convinced you that this p-dalam version is a natural guy to work with. Well, then sooner or later you will end up wondering what is a pi-harmonic function in this setting. And now the question is: take a pier harmonic function, say locally defined, some open set of Microsoft space, for instance, take its differential. And is there any natural Banach space where this guy blocks? And the answer is not so clear because you have a given that you have a reverse triangle inequality in the post-detangian and the cotangent space, there is really no way of speaking about Cauchy completeness of any space of future directed vector filiinkovsky. And now, okay, here, okay, this is maybe more of a personal comment. Of a personal comment, I mean, I was born analyst. If you take me out from me, the completeness, I feel sort of alone and make the cruel. It's a place I really don't want to be. And so some sort of completeness, it's a sense, you know, is crucial in order basically to get the existence of objects. And this is even more true when you are in a non-moved situation, in a potentially non-moved world. So, just very briefly, of course, we all know what a Banach space is. Of course, we all know what the Banach space is, it's a vector space with a norm which is complete. And what basically the definition that I want to sort of suggest is that an hyperbolic Banach space is, well, not anymore a vector space, but just a cone. So I want to find the sort of functionality analog of the future-directed space of future-directed vector fields in Minkowski. And so I really insist that this guy is a cone and not a vector space. vector space and sense this will both provide a solid mathematical theory or quite solid mathematical theory and I think also I mean it's it's not so crazy from the physical perspective anyway we can only go to the future so this actual space of real you know potential direction we can move on but really just the future once so they form a core not really space okay with an hyperbolic node okay so With an hyperbolic norm, okay. So, so an hyperbolic norm is a is a what satisfies the reverse triangular. Now, of course, in the standard Banach setting, completeness is intended as Cauchy completeness, which makes no sense here, as I mentioned, because you have a reverse triangular equality. And so, what can you do? Well, basically, you can rely on the cone structure to induce an order. V is smaller than W if there is Z, such that B plus Z is W, and then you can ask for order completeness. For order computers. And this is not so crazy because, I mean, even the realign, so the realign is complete. We have two different ways of thinking about complete and realign, like Cauchy completeness or dedicated completeness. And the classical Cauchy completeness is what is in place in the standard functionality setting. And dedicated completeness is what I think is the correct analog in this Lorentz kind of signature. And of course, one words in one setting and not. One words in one setting and not in the other. And of course, we have already seen the theory of rich spaces. That is to say, basically, Banach spaces which have an order, which they are dedicated, complete. It's very rich. But what I'm insisting here and now is that we don't have a Banach space underlying. We really just have a cone which is complete in its sense of dedicated. And okay, you can start building a theory which has some interesting analog with the Some interesting analog with the classical theory of Banach spaces. I don't have time, so I don't want to go through. I just want to point out one class of example also to answer Virginia's question earlier on. So the basical example of Banach space, one of the basic examples, the L-P spaces, okay, for P bigger than one. And now you can guess where I'm going to. A typical example of hyperbolic Banach space is the class of L-P spaces with P is smaller than one. So we define this norm. So we define this norm in the same way that we define in the elliptic case. And we're used to saying, well, don't take the p-root in order, otherwise, you won't get the triangle inequality. And what I want to stress out, perhaps, is that maybe we won't take the p-root precisely because you want to have the reverse triangle inequality. And if you do so, you have a you have, you know, there are nice, quite nice parallelism because, you know, the dual of LP is a Q in the classical setting and even here is the classical settings, you know. And even here is the classical set. Is you know, the dual is infinity with the same representation. The dual of L infinity is L plus infinity, where the norm is the slope of F, and this case is L minus infinity, where the norm is the inf of F. And there is this self-dual case. This is the answer to the question. So P equals 2 pops out in the classical Banach setting as the only P from which the dual of the P is the same P. And in this hyperbolic setting, this is P equals zero. And which only in some And the which only in such s but is only well defined for limiting reasons when the total mass is one. And then the L0 norm is basically the geometric mean. And here are the pictures of the unit ball, basically. Start from p equal infinity, you have this curve, from p equal to you have the ball, from p equal one, you have the sort of diagonal, and then things start bending in the other direction. And let me just conclude by pointing out that for p equal two, you have this. For p equals 2, you have this classical parallelogram in equality. I have sorry, equality. And for p equals zero, there is this other identity, which is a little bit interesting. Unlike the paragraph quality, this also relies on some algebra property of the point in consideration. So here we're taking the product of FNG. And it is curious to observe. I have no idea what this means, but it's curious to observe. idea what this means but it's good to observe that uh you know this uh classical paragraph identity resembles you know the equation x squared plus y square equals something which is the circle equation and this y resembles x times y equals something which is the hyperbolic equation i have no idea why that happens but i think it's good and that's all i wanted to say sorry for taking
