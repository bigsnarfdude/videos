Surface to volume ratios. There are several methods to produce nanofibers. Four of the most important ones are listed here: melt blowing, electro spinning, bicomponent spinning, and centrifugal spinning, also known as rotary jet spinning and force spinning that we focus on in this presentation. The three first methods are actually suffering from. Are actually suffering from low production rates or limitation on material choice. Centrifugal spinning on the other hand can work with the high throughputs with both polymer melt and polymer solutions and with the low operational cost. So The centrifugal spinning is a very simple device in which we feed in which we have a schematic view of centrifugal spinning here and also a real experimental work in our lab. In the centrifugal spinning, one feed the polymer solution into the rotating. The rotating actually chamber, also called also known as a spinneret. And then, when it rotates, the polymer solution emerges from the nozzles in a very high curve in the form of very high curve jets, stretching through the domain till it sits on the collectors, which are actually static rods. Despite the That the sensory card spinning is a very promising and simple device. It suffers from beat formation due to the jet instability and it cannot produce fibers as fine as the electro spinning methods. And recently, in that it's many aspects of the device are still unknown. So in this So, in this project, our main goal is to understand the centrifugal spinning deeply. To this aim, we actually develop a mathematical model customized for the CS process using which we aim to Characterize the CS process using the key-dimensional parameters, mainly to consider the viscoelastic effects, solvent evaporation, polymer, actually temperature change during the device, and many other important parameters that we talked about. We will talk about in the next slides. So, to consider the CS process, we follow two method experimental and mathematical modeling approach. Here is the schematic view and experimental setup of our CS setup, our CS lab setup. Setup. We use the polymer oxide dissolved in deonized water as a prototype polymer solution. And we actually work with the two nozzle spinnerets. Our setup is actually equipped with the high-speed imaging camera and powerful lamps to capture the trajectory of the jet. And we also use the data acquisition box to control the To control the flow rate of the spinner. Also, we use the characterizing test, rheometry test, and the SEM test to characterize the polymer solution and the resultant web quality. In the mathematical phase, first we listed the most important parameter phenomena and forces in this problem. Phenomena and forces in this process, as we schematically showing here. There is evaporation during the centrifugal spinning process, inertial force, viscoelastic force, and surface force, direct force are most important ones along with the centrifugal force, of course. And after this, we characterize, we define some dimensionless numbers. Some dimensionless number to characterize such a phenomenon forces. As you can see, the most important ones are listed here. Russby as a ratio of inertial force to rotational force, Reynolds, Fraud, Weber, Weisenberg, aspect ratio of our device, sharewood, Nusselt, and other dimensionless parameters. In the next step, In the next step, we listed the equation that we are solving to model the centrifugal spinning, which are listed here: incompressibility condition, continuity equation, convective diffusion equation, both for the concentration and temperature, actually along the fiber. Dynamic boundary condition. Also, we use a kilometric boundary condition, but we would end up We would end up with the continuity equation also. Momentum equation, and for including the viscoelasticity, we use the Gezigas constitutive equation into our set of equations. So to solve this set of equations, we first extend this equation in the curvilinear coordinate system, which is non-orthogonal. So we project the equation onto a Equation onto the or onto orthogonal basis vectors like Frenet bases, and then using the asymptotic series, we simplify the equations to get the uniaxial equations by keeping the just the leading and second order equation, second order terms, and then we solve the final equation, set of equations. Final equation set of equations using decallocation methods and Newtonian methods. Newton methods. So here we are showing some of the experimental pictures from a growing jet till it meets the SDSA condition. As you can see, at first, As you can see, at first the jet is fairly straight, then and with the pendant drop at the end of the jet. After a while, it curves through the domain forming anti-jet, and then after a while, it hits the steady state condition. After it reaches the acid state condition, the jet shows the steady behavior in a way in a sense that it doesn't In a sense that it doesn't, the trajectory doesn't change with time anymore. So, we also use the experimental modeling to actually verify our modeling results. As you can see, we use the trajectory of the jet and the change of the radius of the jet through the domain to be compared with the experimental. As you can see, there is a good angle. As you can see, there is a good agreement between the experimental and numerical modeling results. Also, there is a discrepancy at the we saw a discrepancy in the radius of the jets at the higher rotational speeds. So, in the next phase, we consider Consider the centrifugal spinning by changing the different dimensional numbers as the most key parameters of the process and to characterize the device. Here, we actually consider the effect of ROSP on the jet formation and the trajectory. Here in figure A, you can see the A, you can see the trajectory of the jet in an XZ plane at three different rust speeds. And as you can see, the fiber, obviously actually, the rotation speed is larger, the fiber curves more and the length of the fiber would be larger when it meets the collectors. So with this, we also when We also, when we have a larger centrifugal force, we have a smaller fibers and we have a larger evaporation because we have a larger length. So we end up with the larger viscosity of the jets. So here we are showing the Reynolds. The Reynolds as you can see with increasing Reynolds, the jet shows a very high viscose jet and it resisting about the resisting against the bending through the domain. And so as you can see, when the Reynolds is small, the viscous Is small, the viscous force are large, and the fiber have a larger radius at the collector. But after a while, as you can see, when the inertial force takes over, all of the radius of the fibers actually converge to the same value. So, here is also, we can see for the longer fiber, the evaporation is larger. Fiber the evaporation is larger, so the final viscosity is actually become larger. Here, we are showing the evaporation evaporation rate by changing the Eschmid number, which actually is changing the properties of the air. Decreasing the Eschmidt number means that increasing the That increasing the Reynolds of air so the fiber, so the drag force on the fiber would be larger, and then the drag force pushes the fiber towards the spinnerette. As you can see in this, for the trajectory of the fiber here, it curves more towards the spinneret. Here, we also show the cross-section of the jet at different positions, and as you can see. positions and as you can see with the larger with the smaller Schmidt number you can get a smaller evaporation rate because the jet cannot as evaporate the solvent cannot evaporate into the air phase as easy as the other cases So, here we examine the effect of pecklet number inside the jet. As you can see, with increasing the pecklet number, the diffusion rates is actually decreasing, and we have a non-uniform actually concentration profile inside the jets. These are these two actually. Two kind actually two cross-section B and C are the cross section of the JIT at the middle of the JIT at the end of the JIT. You can see in the smaller pecklet number, the concentration profile is very smooth because of the larger diffusion in jets. But it's not remarkably. But it's not remarkably affect the jet trajectory. It is affecting the jet trajectory because of the mean viscosity of the jet, but it's not a remarkable change. Next, we consider the effect of weber. As you can see, with decreasing the weber, the surface force are getting larger, so the fiber again carries more towards the. Again, curves more towards the spin rate, but it doesn't affect the radius of the jets, and it has no remarkable effect on the viscosity of the jet because the change in length is very small. In reality, actually, when we work with a smaller Weber, the jet is prone to breaking. So for this, for the For the small cases, one have to actually consider the instability of the jet. So finally, we consider the effect of Weisenberg number. And you can see as the Weisenberg is getting larger, the viscoelastic forces are getting very large and resisting thinning. Resisting tinning in a large segment of the domain, the fiber resists tinning compared to the smaller Weisenberg, which are showing the very similar behavior as the Newtonian ones. And for the trajectory, as you can see, the Weisenberg at a higher Weisenberg The fiber acts as an elastic solid rod and actually follow the rotation direction of the frame and it actually fly very close to the spinnerets. Unlike the other cases that are flying farther, going farther. Away from the spin rats. So, here we in this project we consider the centrifugal spinning process with considering the different effect of dimensionless parameters like Rossby, Weber, Weisenberg. We extend our mathematical model to study the viscoelastic curve jets. The curve jets and according to our results, Rossby and Weisenberg have a significant effect on the fiber behavior and radius. But Pecklet, Weber and Pecklet star doesn't show a remarkable effect on the fiber trajectory or radius. So here are the contribution and at the end I want to. Contribution and at the end, I want to thank you from Begal, Canada Research Chair, FRKMT Innovation Canada, and NCERC for their financial supports. Thank you. And I would be happy to take any questions. Okay, good. Thank you, Siran, for the nice talk. There are currently not many questions, so please, if you have any question. So, please, if you have any question, write it on the chat. Meanwhile, I have maybe one curiosity in connection with the modeling. So, can you perhaps go back to the equations that you use to solve? Yeah. Okay, so you have a convection diffusion equation for the concentration. C is the polymer concentration. Concentration. So, are you how heterogeneous in the concentration enters in your viscolastic model here? Can you comment a little bit? Because you will have different viscolastic effects depending on the local value of the concentration, right? Okay, for yeah, for the for solving the Solving the concentration of the polymer. So we didn't actually solve these two equations in a frame because these are two projects, two separate projects. First, in a project, we assume that the fiber is Newtonian and we just consider the effect of evaporation. And then after seeing that evaporation is not important. Not important because of the very large characteristic time of the evaporation. We go on with the effect of the Weisenberg and the viscoelasticity. So these aren't a coincident phenomena in our simulations. So okay, but you are you are not solving this convection diffusion equation that you show here? Question that you show here? Yeah, I'm solving it. When I'm solving it, the flow is Newtonian. It doesn't coincide with the viscoelastic effect. Okay. Okay. Okay, so but in the case that you want to solve it, because when we solve the viscoelastic effect, we solve the temperature guide. Effect, we solve the temperature gradient, you have to change the, you have to actually have a dynamic actually parameters like relaxation time and viscosity of the polymer based on the concentration. So you can use the actually the Arnius laws to consider such effects. such a thing okay yeah i would expect that this is is somehow entering the the gisecus model through the through the beta uh coefficient perhaps or or the weizmer number anyway so and what about the the peclet number that you saw here so you you you mentioned some of your uh later slide two uh peclet one peclet is the order of ten to four and another peclet star which is order of four Another Pecles star, which is order four. Can you comment a little bit on these two different definitions that you consider here? This PE star, four. And here? Yeah, yeah. Okay, peclet star is actually picklet of the air. Diffusion of the solvent into the air. Okay, picklet is a diffusion of solvent into the fiber. So because the Because the controlling parameter in a solvent evaporation was a diffusion along the radius of the jet, we couldn't solve it in one-dimensional and we forced to solve it in two-dimensional. Okay. Okay, good. So thank you again for the answers. Thank you very much.
