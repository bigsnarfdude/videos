So um this is uh joint work. Well indeed not okay. It was joint work with um Evan Jerry Zakos and Shuye Cha, who are uh students at Stanford. Um uh Shuye just finished this year and Evan Jerry not that long before. And so let me just remind you what the cone is, so what you think is a cone. So an exact cone is just a product space, so a half line across the link, which is process. Which is cross-section, which I call in Y here. And then the metric is not a product metric, it's this wall product metric. So it's like if I call the half-line variable r for the radius, it's dr squared plus r squared h, and the sort of standard non-singular, not very conic-looking example is if the cross-section is the unit sphere, this is standard metric, and then this metric G is just the Euclidean metric written in spherical core. Written in spherical coordinates, co-words, or unit coordinates. And so here, asymptotically conic. So per cone has two ends, like the half-line has two ends, zero and infinity. So here, asymptotically conic is asymptotic to the large end of the cone, so near infinity. And so some arbitrary behavior for purposes that wouldn't be relevant in a compact region. And the precise sense of this depends on the problem. Depends on the problem, like in what sense we want the essence of behavior. And I think I'm going to, especially given that it's a half-narrow talk, I'm going to downplay this. And so, Merrow is for this class of metrics, scattering metrics, so hence the parenthetical part of the title. Of course, various versions were the, so scattering because they play a role in what analog was to be plebeian scattering theory with this remark. But of course, various versions earlier played a significant role. Earlier, I played a significant role already as you say GR because of the importance of asymptotic flat spaces. Okay, so let me just quickly record that I'm sure most of you are very familiar with is when the X-ray tracks pop up, we just integrate functions or maybe little widespread objects like tensors along curves. And so, concretely, in this case, the curves are geodesics. Occurs at geodesics, but that's little importance that the actual geodesics for the function transform. It's more important for other problems that we alert later on. Anyway, so integrate functions along geodesics. And so what you know, what you're given, is what the integral of a function along all geodesics or whole bunch of geodesics is, so some collection of geodesics. And then the question is: can you find the function? And so, of course, you might need some conditions. So, of course, you might need some conditions, I mean, even just to make sense of this transform, if you are integrating over a non-compact interval, so like the real line, for instance, and also you might need some condition on the behavior of geodesics. So, you might want the geodesics to go to some well-behaved places like infinity in this conic situation. So, for instance, you might want to smoke trapping, which is what So, for instance, you might find this normal trapping, which is what I just mentioned, and you might require in this sort of setting some sort of polynomial or maybe super polynomial decay, so like exponential decay of this function at infinity, so the integrals actually make sense. And as usual, this problem can be interpreted in many ways. So, you can ask for interactivity, you can ask for stability, you can ask for reconstruction. You can also further tweak this by localizing. So, maybe what you will want to be able to do is, given only the integrals of this function along geodesics that stay in an open set, you want to, well, of course, then you can't recover the function outside this open set, for sure, but you might want to recover the function in this open set. And concretely, in this essence of connect spaces, you might want this region, this open set, to be a region where the radio variable is bigger than a con. Where the radial variable is bigger than a constant, R0. So it's like a color neighborhood of infinity. Okay, so in order to get a bit of a feel for this, because geodesics are of course connected to geometry, we should think about what this geodesics and geometry looks like. And I'm sure this goes back a long while ago. Some must have thought this. But a concrete place where you can definitely look this up in these terms. Can definitely look this up in these terms. It's works of Merrills and Merrills and Tworsky on the estimate behavior of geodesic spirit infinity and this sort of geometry, so it's asymptotic geometries. And one of the conclusions is that indeed it's automatic that sufficiently far out, when R is sufficiently large, all the geodesics that are sufficiently close to being tangent to a level set of the radial function at a point. Of the radial function at a point in this region are non-trapped, so tend to infinity in both directions. Okay, so think about this very large spheres including in space, but you maybe messed up something in the contact region, almost tension to this file. It doesn't matter what's happening in the contact region. And so concretely, just to see how this goes, it's actually useful to write given into the reciprocal of R, so because infinity is very far and we want to bring it closer. It closer. So I'm going with x. And then I'm writing this, okay, because of the left-hand side, the right-hand side has a funny sign. So I put the minus sign in front of the coefficient with dr, and then it's y is at the link variables, the cross-section variables. And then, you know, putting the weight in front, that is so usual from the spherical perspective, right? So R dy is the unit, like in all corners, right? The Euclidean metric is unit. All corners, right? The Euclidean metric is built up of dr and rv. So I'm writing into this r, this is really r dy as a unit, and I'm still calling the coefficient of this mu, and calling the coefficient of dr minus tau, because of this relationship. And so, okay, I'm going to do this. And then now, what you can say is that there's geodesics or by characteristics from the Hamiltonian perspective, what they look like. What they look like after reparametrization is this. So remember that here that this x is the reciprocal of the radial variable. And so y is the cross-section variable. And so I'm writing, and so to is the coefficient of minus dr. This mu was the coefficient of the r dy, and so I'm at the magnitude, is what I'm writing here. Is what I'm writing here. And then the renormalized version is this mu hat. So where you write mu as the magnitude times mu hat. So that's unit normalization. So anyway, what these biocharistics look like, geodesics look like, what we project geodesics look like, is like this. So this x reciprocal of radial variable is like a sign where the interval is going from this minus t0 to minus t0 plus pi. So if you take t0 equals 0, it's 0 to pi. 0 equals 0, so 0 to pi, so the sine is the bump of the sine. So from 0 to 0, that corresponds. Remember, x equals 0 was the back, well it was infinity, it's a vector in front of our r's, corresponding things to infinity. And then, meanwhile, the other really interesting part is this. What happens in the link is that you get a flow, it's the Hamilton flow, unit speed, that's what this assures, because we normalize here. So unit speed, and again, this is an intervention. And again, this is an integral of length pi. So you flow in this y, so this isn't an exact column. You flow in this cross-section distance pi. So on the sphere, this is the antiportal code, right? So that's where you end up. And the thing to notice is that because of the behavior of sine, as it's max halfway, so the maximum of x, the minimum of r, like how far you come in from infinity, or how close you come in from infinity, is Infinity, which is where the GSS are tangent to the level sets of R, it's reciprocal. So it occurs halfway in the domain of this biocharistic, so it's distance pi over 2 in terms of this y variable from either endpoint. So that would play a role. Okay, so here's then the result with the Emergency Zagos from a couple of years ago. So, if you are in an at least three-dimensional setting, which will always be the case from now on, for reasons that I maybe will be able to get to in a bit, and so you have an asymptotically conic metric. Again, I haven't testified exactly how asymptotic, but it's a pretty soft asymptotic behavior in this case. So that the cross-section has no conjugate points within I over R2, then color neighborhood of NT. Then, colored neighborhood of infinity, the geodesic X-ray transform is injective on appropriate Gaussian-rated function spaces. So, exponential of minus r squared constant times r squared. But actually, Gaussian really means with respect to any positive power of r, so it could be r to any power. It's easier to use because it's a little bit of rewriting to get the general statement. Anyway, and then a corrosion. Anyway, and then a corollary of this is that, in particular, if the cross-section is close to the standard sphere, then we call the neighborhood of infinity, the geodesic exchange transform is injective on these function spaces. So because on the standard sphere, the injectivity radius is pi, and pi over 2 is well away from pi. So if you perturb pi, you're still staying very far away from pi over 2. Now, a reason this is interesting is the following. So, one thing is that a couple of years earlier, Guillermo, Lasis, and II showed that on asymptotic conjugate spaces, if there are no conjugate points or negative curvature, then the X-ray transform is injective on appropriately polynomial weighted spaces. So here the weight is less serious because you have polynomial decay as opposed to the Gaussian rather than the exponential decay. But the well, two of these authors, plus someone else, wrote another paper at the same time in which they showed that essence of the Euclidean metrics, so when the cross-section is actually a standard sphere, so these metrics show that conjugate points are actually flat. So the absence of conjugate points is actually a strong hypothesis. So on the other hand, our result covers this case, although under strongly So it covers this case, although under stronger decay conditions. And so the key point really is at the end of the day, if I just go back here, maybe here, is that what I mentioned here is that the maximum of this and the minimum of R happens halfway on this reparametrized curve. And so this And so, this what you really need is no conjugate point to for our argument, is no conjugate points to the point of tangency to these level sets. And so that hence the pilot 2, as opposed to the more global thing that shows up in their case. And so, maybe just quickly say that once you have this and a color negative infinity, you can use earlier work with Gwinker-Rule one. With Winter Ruhman to proceed and determine this unknown function globally. And so here now we're working about the region, so it's really applying Rubatin. And so just recall that in this case, what was actually needed, I mean, there has to be some hypothesis here, right? And so what you really need is a function, which, for example, can take to the So, which for example you can take to be r minus r0 or r squared minus r0 squared in here, r equals r0. And what you need is that the level sets are a convexity-concavity properties, strict concavity properties from the correct side. So, basically, maybe this is a bit more illustrative. So, think about this as you are on the top side. And so, this is the sort of, but this is actually three-dimensional, keep that in mind. Keep that in mind. And so, what you need is the strict concatenation from above of these level sets. But in the case of this asymptotic conex spaces, it's sort of easier to actually think about it like this. So, these are the level sets of R then, which have this problem. Okay. And so the theorem with Brother the proof proceeds by a The proof proceeds by a layer script environment, so really go little by little. And we can also do some loss of GRSC, et cetera. Okay. Now, one reason why I didn't want to mention this is because, and in particular this layer stripping part, so that you go little by little. So, let's see today. So, you will go think of this as maybe. Like, think of this as a, like, maybe in the first step, you're going to recover the function in this top region, and then you're going to recover it in this next region, et cetera. And the thickness of these regions is supposed to be quite small. And thinness is here, is determined both by geometric and analytical information. And so the geometric things are sort of natural. I mean, this is a geometric problem, so there's no way of getting around it. The analytic part is sort of The analytic part is sort of serious because it demands, so the analytic heart of this is a pseudo differential operator algebra parametrics construction, which requires an error with a small norm. And this is guaranteed in this work with Gunther by making these regions thin. And then, actually, in recent work, I have developed sort of a little bit before this work we have in Jellyman philanthropy. I developed a somewhat different approach using the semi-classical scaling, which has the advantage that the steamness requirement is purely geometric and actually under a geometric hypothesis correspondingly can be eliminated. And that's very useful also for this present problem because there are more things happen. So you don't want to have to deal with the thinness of the thing as well in addition to this essence of functional behavior. And so there's also a similar result. And so there's also a similar result for one forms and tensors. And again, there are analogous results for PRMLS and 2, which are, so our results are under, so their results under stronger geometric but weaker BTA conditions, things in the function case. And so let me just quickly recall that a major issue for the X-ray transform, so what you do in the X-ray transform, right, is that for a function just integrated. Is it that for a function just integrated a function on the geodesic? When you have a one-form or a symmetric tensor and you evaluate it by first evaluating the tangent factor of the geodesic in every slot, and then integrate the results. You integrate the function at the end again. And the general issue is that this has a big kernel, namely potential tensors, which are just symmetric gradients. For two tensor case symmetric gradients in one form, or in the one form. In one forms, or in the one-form setting, just the exterior derivatives of functions. And so the function, in this one-form setting, this kernel really is, honestly, just a fundamental thing of capitals. And so actually it's robust. It has nothing to do with geodesics. The two tensors, I think it is related to, it's more geometric. It has actually something to do with geodesics. And so as usual, you can circumvent the sort of kernel by. Serve kernel by imposing gauge conditions, which basically what you do is you specify complementary subspace to potential tensors. And the analytically best-behaved choice tends to be various tolerancer gauge conditions, which basically say in this two-tensor setting, and so another thing is the one form setting, that a divergence or modified divergence of the tensor vanishes. And so for local approach. So, for this local problem, so this is the analog of this local determination with Gunther that you can determine the function in sufficiently thin regions in this bounded setting. So it's actually useful to modify this. So taking the adjoint with respect to an appropriate metric, which in fact pushes out the RPPUSHA boundary to infinity, effectively. And so it's like a Effective bit. And so it's like a Witten-type gauge condition in a sense. And so the result with Plammen and Gunther was that indeed the X-ray transform satisfies all the things that one wants, so ejective and stable when the gauge condition is satisfied. And actually, I mean, in a sense, this is also constructive. So, in principle, if some In principle, if someone is a numerical analyst and likes to IDOs and wants to develop a code for this, it's in principle should be algorithmic, this determination. And so you can also rephrase this, that, of course, you can't, without the gauge condition, you can't find the tensor, but you can find it modulo the symmetric gradient of one form that I'm just. One form that mentions the analog form. Okay, and then the result with GHI is just the analog of this in this essence of the Koni case. It's basically you take the result with Kleinman and Gunther and take the result with Evangeli and then just combine them. So there's this Gaussian twist in the gauge condition and you get the same result. And again, you can rewrite this in terms of the determination. This is in terms of the determination of mutual potential densities. Okay, so I think I do have a little bit of time to actually give some idea of what is actually behind this. So let me recall the basic things about the X-ray transform. So it's sort of nice to think about the X-ray transform as going from functions on the underlying space to functions on the sphere bundle, unit sphere bundle of the space. Of the space. This overprimer is geodesics because to each point and unit tangent vector I assign a geodesic, but of course, a geodesic defect of points on it. In any case, that's fine, I can do it. So let's just do some dimension counting. So the space of geodesics has dimensions, dimension 2 and minus 2, if the underlying dimension is n, right? Because the sphere bundle has dimension n plus n minus 1, it's 2n minus 1, but this the geodesic itself is one dimensional, that's about overcount. Is one-dimensional, that's about overcapping. And so now you just compare these two. And so the output is that the transform is formally determined if the dimension is two. This doesn't really mean very much, but it doesn't have a meaning in principle, but if you have free integral operators, things like that, it could be sequences. And the other thing is it's formally over-determined the dimension is three. And so at least. And that's why we are in this dimension at least three setting, because one has more flexibility. Flexibility. And so, what happens is that, in fact, it's this flexibility that allows one to sort of change the analytic category in which one is working. So, for example, in this work with Gutenberum, where we do this vocal determination, the metric is just, we put in this artificial bandwidth, like how far we're trying to recover in the metric. This is this strictly concave hypersurface, that looks like, right? Hypersurface levels, right? So the metric is just smooth up to there. It doesn't have any infinities or anything like that geometrically. But because we have this flexibility, our flexibility is concretely coming from which geodesics do we want to take into account. And so how we implement sort of a normal operator. How big is the collection geodesic that you take? And depending on the choice you make, And depending on the choice we make, we get a different analytic category: like what kind of an operator is the normal operator. And so you can go from this sort of smooth setting, this is smooth up to this actual boundary, to much better things like the scattering setting, which is so asymptotically going up to infinity, in which you have much better analytical tools. And so, just to break away the, you know, and in particular, you know, concretely, how does this two versus high dimensions difference happening? So, what you want to do is to consider sort of a normal operator, which usually would be something like i star i. So, i is the x-ray transform. So, technically use some replacement for it. And here you put in a localizer. So, just multiplication operator that's a cutoff function on the sphere bundle. I mean, which points in the sphere bundle, so which geodesics are you putting a positive weight on? And so that under non-conjugacy conditions, and again, this non-conjugated condition. And again, there's no contributive condition. This is, of course, only four geodesics on which you are putting a positive weight. So, this is a two-differential operator. And so, just remind me, the thing that you want from pseudo differential operators is the ideal case is to be elliptic. So, the behavior, as the momentum variable goes up to infinity, should be non-degenerate. But then you have a Have a flat form theory, and so you get up to five dimensions, you get invertibility. And so, concretely, the principal symbol is going to be an initial is going to be the integral coming from, well, I'm going to write the middle q as the function by which the q is multiplying. And so, what you do is, like the principal symbol is supposed to be a function right on your phase space, and so what I'm doing is we're taking the And so, what I'm doing is we're taking a covector in your phase space, so that's a sphere, a co-sphere bundle of x, I have to think about the geodesics whose tangent vector is annihilated by this, so called orthogonal, if you do it geometrically. So you're just annihilating them. And then you can ask for which one of these is this weight positive. So you want to put, given any covector, you want to put a positive weight for at least one j. Positive weight for at least one geodesic, before the way it's got a positive way, too, because it's going to be smooth. And so, if you do this, then you automatically get an elliptic operator and semi-fratform theory and all that. Everything is going good up to five-dimensional obstacles. But of course, there are these fine-dimensional obstacles, and so to remove this, it's useful to have a small parameter. And so, there are at least. And so there are at least two options for these. So one of them is what came in this work with Gunther Ruhmann, which is to use geodesics that are almost tangent to the level sets of this function, with strictly concave level sets. And the tangency, like how close they are to tangent, gets closer and closer. I mean, this becomes stricter and stricter as you go towards this artificial band. Towards this artificial band, at how far you want to go. And so the key point is that the dimension is at least three, then this condition, at least the condition I mentioned, this definite Ulman condition, is satisfied always by, so if you take your favorite co-vector, you can always find, so say like this, you can always find something that's a tangent vector that's annihilated by, that's tangent. So say this is the levels that says tangent to the levels. And so And so, yeah, so that's the role of three dimensions. So, two dimensions, this is not the case. Okay, so you would like a small parameter, two options. You either work in thin regions, so that was the original work with Gunther, or you introduce a semi-classical parameter and work more globally. And so, in the steam region, this is the scaling that Gunther and I used. So, as you approach the As you approach the zero-level set of a function x, the angle of geodesic, how close they are to tangential, they are, is shrinking like the distance to this zero-level set. This global version uses semi-classical parameter, it just globally shrinks. And you can combine the two, and then you have a combined cutoff. And so you have to use exponential rates of the relevant the relevant type to actually Relevant type to actually, so the matching type, I should say, to get the actually even the membership into differential operator algebra. And yeah, so it's important to use this way. And so let me just not go through these things, just more detailed, given the time. But I do want to say at least one more thing. So what happens concretely is asymptotically conic spaces. Asymptotically conic spaces. So, this is where the underlying analysis is in principle scattering, right? I said the merrows for the scattering metrics. And so, if you don't do anything, like take something like a normal operator, you end up with a two-differential operator, and things are going in your favor. You end up with a pseudo-differential operator in the scattering logic program. But then, of course, you are putting a weight on geodesics that go to the far into the interior, and you have tracking. Far into the interior, you have trapping websites, so it's not so. So the flexibility that this gives you, this localization, is that you can go in a different, you can end up in a different algebra. And so concretely, the scattering algebra, scattering vector feels like just a form like x squared dx and x dy and generated by these sort of things. And what Evan Jerry did in her thesis is actually to develop a new is actually to develop a new algebra, two differential operator algebra, which is for the one cus, where instead of x squared dx and x dy, which is what these things are here, right, so this is dr, well minus dr, and this is the 1 over r spherical derivative. So it's the analog of what you see in the two main setting. So instead, there's an extra power of x here. And this is still a very nice operator algebra with symbolic calculus, et cetera. Calculus, symbolic calculus, etc. And so that was her thesis. And then you need to do a little bit of extra work to combine this with semi-classical methods, etc. to prove yeah. Thanks all. So thank you very much. All right, we have time for a quick question. Is there audience? All right, if not, we have a couple. We have a coffee break now for about half an hour before our double header of two talks before lunch. So if you have any questions for Abrash, please feel free to ask her.
