So I'll give an overview about non-semi-simple TQFTs and then mention some applications along the way. Okay, so our motivation actually came from quantum computation, and so we heard a lot about this in Sean's talk. So I'll give a kind of a quick review of this. So classical information or bits, these are strings of zeros and ones. Quantum information or qubits, it's a linearization of these, so it's linear combinations of zeros and ones. Combinations of zeros and ones, and maybe a little bit more precisely, it's elements in some finite-dimensional Hilbert space. So a single qubit is an element in a two-dimensional Hilbert space. So we have a basis spanned by ket zero and ket one. This is a Hilbert space where the inner product of these two things is zero. This is an orthonormal basis. A quantum circuit, the manipulation of this quantum information, is a sequence of unitary operations. Is a sequence of unitary operations as we saw in Sean's talk. And so here's an example of a single qubit operation, the X gate. This is like a quantum version of the NOT gate where it exchanges ket0 and ket1. Okay, so in practice, depending upon whatever technology you have, you have access to a certain finite set of gates, certain finite set of unitary operators, and you would like to construct a general unitary operator. And you would like to construct a general unitary operator by up to some approximation. And so a standard choice for a single qubit quantum computer is this H, this Hadamard gate and this T gate, this diagonal gate. And so by taking compositions of these things, of these two matrices, you could approximate anything in PU2. Okay, so there are various technologies to Various technologies to construct quantum computers, and as we've heard, a new paradigm was developed by Katayev and Friedman in the late 90s using TQFTs. So just to run through maybe a quick example. So we let UQSL2 be a small quantum group, where Q is a root of unity, and the standard choice is a fifth root of unity. So this is a non-semi-simple category, as we've heard. As we heard. But the standard thing to recover, to get three manifold invariants or 3D TQFTs, is to extract a semi-simple category. So this is the UQSL2 mod underline. This underline means the semi-simplification. And so the idea is you throw away representations and set quantum dimension zero. So in this case, at a fifth root of unity, you basically get four additional representations. V0, the one, the one. V0, V1, V2, V3. This is a trivial one-dimensional representation. This is extended two-dimensional representation, three-dimensional representation, four-dimensional representation. The Steinberg has quantum dimension zero. That would be the next thing here. So that gets killed under some simplification. Okay, so we get a braided, we get a ribbon category, and V0 is the minoidal unit, so it's standard to denote this by one. To denote this by 1, and V2 is often denoted by tau for some reason. And so, this Fibonacci category, which we heard about in Sean's talk, it's a subcategory inside of this semi-simplified category just generated by 1 and tau. And it's pretty straightforward to show that tau tensor tau decomposes into tau plus 1. So, this is kind of a recursion you see for classical Fregnau sequences, which is. For constant Fibonacci sequences, which is why it's called the Fibonacci category. Okay, and so now, how do you construct a quantum computer from this? So first we need to get a Hilbert space. And so hfit, it's HOM from tau into tau tensor tau tensor tau. And using these fusion rules, which I have here, it's easy to see that this is a two-dimensional vector space. And so I read diagrams from I read diagrams from bottom to top. So tau is in the bottom, and at the end, it's tau tens of tau tens of tau. And there's two possible representations to put on this channel here, either the monoidal identity or tau. So this is clearly a two-dimensional vector space, and there's also a natural inner product on these things. So these two vectors are orthonormal, and maybe just to Orthonormal, and maybe just to have a quick mention of what is the inner pairing. So essentially, if I wanted to pair V1 with V2, I take the tree for V2, and then on top I reflect the tree for V1, a tau here, and I have one here. And so you have part of a morphism which goes from this irreducible tau into this irreducible one. And there's no non-trivial map from time to time. There's no non-trivial map from tau to one. They're not isomorphic simples. So this is your so these vectors are orthogonal. There are some scalars which get involved, which are which are a little delicate to compute the pairing in general. And I'll mention this a little bit when I get to non-semiclical case. Okay, so that's the quantum memory. Then the question is: how do you simulate unitary operations? And so, as we've heard many times, this is where the brain is. Times, this is where the braid group comes in. So we braid the representations or the particles at the top. So sigma 1 acts on V1 in this way. And then using relations in your category, you could simplify this. Sigma 2 acts by breaking the second two strands. And in the basis of V1 and V2, it's straightforward to write down the matrices for these braiding operators. So sigma 1 is some. So sigma one is some diagonal matrix, and sigma two is a bit more complicated when this phi is the golden ratio. I think I actually took these formulas from the survey of Sean's. Maybe I should say, maybe a simpler way to think of sigma 2 is that sigma 2 is a conjugate of sigma 1 by a matrix of 6j symbols. Okay, and so a major result, although in this simplified setting of 1 qubit, this is certainly overkill, but as we heard Certainly overkill, but as we heard, Jones studied when the image of the break group is infinite or finite, and density questions were addressed in the seminal paper of Friedman, Larson, Wang. Okay, and in this baby case of one qubit, the subgroup generated by sigma one and sigma two in the projective unitary group is dense, and so one could approximate any unitary operation by just using these braids. The proof in this The proof in this small case is relatively straightforward. Sigma 1 and sigma 2 generate an infinite non-abelian subgroup of PU2, and then by making some Lie algebra argument and exponentiation, you could prove that it's the entire group. Okay. And I don't know if it's easy to see the slide, but so now we know we could approximate any unitary operation. And the question is, well, are there algorithms to do this? And many groups of people study this. This and many groups of people study this. There's a group, Bonesteel, Primozi, Sikos, and Simon, who study it's called weaves, where you just move one strand throughout. You could actually prove that we could get anything in PU2 just by creating one strand. And so this is an approximation of, this is an optimal approximation of this X kit. Okay, so that's a semi-simple story, and there's a lot of research being done on this. Research being done on this. And so now I want to move to the non-semi-simple world. And a major player in this story is the unrolled quantum group. So for simplicity and also for applications at the end, I'm going to fix Q to be a fourth root of unity. I should say, as we heard in Sean's talk, at fourth root of unity, you don't have these density results. Okay, so this unrolled quantum cube would be UQHSL2. It's an algebra over C generated by ES. Over C generated by EFKK inverse. These are your standard UQ SL2 generators. And then you throw in an extra generator H. So one should think of H as the Cartana element for SL2. Maybe you should think of K as the exponential of H. So as I said, EF and K satisfy standard EQ-SL2 relations. We're working at a fourth root of unity, so it's standard to also quotient out by E squared and F squared. Get a finite dimensional algebra. Squared, get a finite dimensional algebra from these things. But now you throw in this H. So H and K commute, and HE satisfy the standard SL2 relation, and HF satisfy also this standard-SL2 relation. Okay, so now I'm going to discuss the representation theory of this quantum group. And again, I'm just mentioning this for fourth root of unity, but everything goes through for an arbitrary root of unity. Infinity. So fix a complex number alpha could be any complex number. And we let VÎ± be a vector space spanned by two vectors, V0 and V1, where E is a lowering operator, F is a raising operator. These coefficients are some quantum numbers. It's like the standard quantum I times Q minus Q occurs. H acts by this diagonal, and K acts by the exponential of this. And kx by the exponential of this. So the eigenvalue for k is the exponential of the eigenvalue here. So on the level of representations, k is the exponential of h. So for any complex number, these are all representations. And the quantum dimension of these v alphas is zero. That's a very straightforward calculation. And so when you do the standard semi-simplification process, these are representations that you would throw away. They would never appear in manifold invariance or in TQ of T's. Invariance on TQ of T's. Okay, one more class of representations before I get to a classification result. For any integer, we let C2A be the one-dimensional module where E and F annihilate the basis vector, and H acts by a scalar, and K acts by the exponential. Okay, so then C is the category of finite-dimensional weight representations, H and K. We're just saying that. H and K. We're just saying that H and K act diagonally. So I should say that a result of this form is in a paper of Costantino, Gier, Cacho Moran, but maybe this goes back even further to Otsuki. So anyway, so every simple module in this category is one of the following. You have these one-dimensional modules, and then you have these V alphas, except these V alphas are not always simple, they're generically simple. Generically simple. If alpha is not an integer, unless it's an even integer, it's a simple module. So all of these V alphas in this list are projective. These one-dimensional symbols are not projective, but they have some four-dimensional projective numbers. Okay. And so maybe one of the crowning achievements in this area is this three-manifold invariant obtained by Constantino, Guier-Pacho-Moretto. Constantino Guier Pachelmorand, sometimes called the CGP invariant. It's a WRT-style invariant. There's a Kirby color, but there's all sorts of difficulties you have to overcome in order to define this. This was extended to a 3D TQFT by BlanchÃ©, Constantino, Guero Pasha-Morand. And again, the point is that we're using all these d alphas, which would be annihilated under semi-simplification. The underlying and The underlying innovation for these three-manifold invariants is a replacement for a quantum dimension, which is sometimes called modified dimension. Because the quantum dimension of these representations is zero, so you get trivial Jones-type invariants. But with this modified dimension, which is not such a complicated definition, but it's a little tricky to define, you could actually recover non-trivial topological invariants. And I should mention first that the notion of modified dimension and its construction was in a paper of. And its construction was in a paper of Pierre, Patrick, Moran, and Tarai of maybe 12 or 13 years ago. And since then, there's a bit of an industry studying its modified dimension from an algebraic and a topological point of view. Okay, so some advantages of these TQFTs. So there's so many representations, and I should say I'm being very quick about the data needed to define these three-manifold invariants. You need a homology class in your manifold. Class in your manifold. But anyway, there's a large supply of objects which leads to a larger supply of TPFTs. These three-manifold invariants distinguish lens spaces, which the classical WRT invariants do not do. They provide a faithful representation for the mapping class group of the torus. Proves that mapping class group is linear from a TQFT perspective. Of course, that's a well-known result from other methods, but and this. And this ties into the next point: is that for large enough roots of unity and for surfaces of genus G higher than 3, higher than 2, there are elements in the mapping class group which act but with infinite order, which is not true in the normal WRT case. So there's maybe an ambitious goal that one could prove that mapping class groups are linear by finding faithful representations coming from this TQFTs. Okay, so Aaron and I entered the story when we wanted to think about the applications of these non-semi-simple TQFTs to quantum computing. And motivated by work of Kirilov and Vensel, we proved that a tensor product of these V alphas has a non-degenerate Hermitian pairing, proving that Proving that tensor product, proving that it's closed into tensor product was a little technical. And the consequence of this, and we'll see it in a couple of minutes, is that Hom spaces have a non-degenerate Hermitian pairing compatible with the break-off action. This is what you want for funnel computer. So these results could be extended, say, all the roots of unity and other data. And maybe a summary theorem before I kind of get on to the last part is that this. Part is that this CGP3 manifold invariant along with this TQFT is a Hermitian TQFT in the sense of TOI. Okay, so maybe to get more explicit with an example, in the section, let's fix alpha to be an irrational real number. And we let H alpha be comm of V3 alpha into V alpha tensor V alpha tensor V alpha. And I didn't write down the fusion rules for these. And I didn't write down the fusion rules for these V alphas, but V alpha times our V alpha is V alpha plus 1 plus V alpha minus 1. And so this home space using these fusion rules could be seen to be two-dimensional. It's kind of an analog of what was going on in the Fibonacci case. And so, this is a two-dimensional vector space. This has a natural Hermitian pairing coming from the theorem in the previous slide. I'll mention this in the next slide. So, as we saw before in the Fibonacci case, we have Brady matrices, sigma 1 and sigma 2, but braiding the first two strands and the last two strands. And so, sigma 1 again is a diagonal matrix. But something which is very different from the technology case is that these. Case is that these, sigma 1 has infinite order, and alpha is irrational. And so, again, we're at the fourth root of unity, where in the Fibonacci, in the standard EQSL2 case, sigma 1 is in a finite order, so we're getting something different in the fourth root of unity here. Sigma 2 is a conjugate of sigma 1. What are these matrices? Well, A is a matrix of 6 J symbols. And N has to do with this non-trivial Hermeschapari. Hermitian para. So one has to do a bit of technical work to calculate these scalars. So this basis I have here is not, it's orthogonal, but not quite orthogonal. And so one of our results is that alpha, so remember alpha is some irrational number. If alpha is in between 1/3 and 1, this two-dimensional permitian vector space actually has a positive definite pairing. Definite pairing. For other alpha, the pairing could have mixed signature, could have negative definite signature. So you have a whole family of different types of Hilbert spaces depending upon this parameter alpha. And we also, and we have the subgroup generated by sigma 1 and sigma 2 is dense, just like in the Fibonacci case. When argues again at sigma 1 and sigma 2, generate a non-abelian infinite subgroup of fess of 2 and d2. If alpha is not in this range when you have a mixed signature, we actually also, so then the breakgroup, the image of the break group lands in PU11 or SL2R, which is maybe not ideal for quantum computing, but still maybe interesting for mathematical reasons. And we have density here as well. Okay, so maybe a quick slide about how good are these. Slide about how good are these, how well could you approximate a matrix? And we know we have these density results, but how efficient could we approximate a unitary matrix? So an extremely important result in quantum computation in general is this Solovey-Katayev theorem, which says that if you have any finite topologically generating set S, which has to be closed under inverses, one could approximate up to some error epsilon an arbitrary element with a circuit of arbitrary element with a circuit of which has a circuit of length which is polylogarithmic in one over epsilon and for many years that that exponent in this polylogarithm was above three in the ground bait in the groundbreaking paper of cupolberg from a few months ago that exponent was gone down to 1.15 okay um but maybe getting back to topological quantum computation um for the fibonacci category where you have For the Fibonacci category, where you have these two generating elements, sigma one and sigma two, this group of people, Vakharov, Klitsch, McCoff, and Swor, showed that the exponent in this polylogarithm could be brought down to one. But that was for a very specific generating set, so it doesn't subsume Cooperberg's result. And we also have a similar result. This is, in some sense, an efficient way of approximating Freiberg elements. Right for elements by unitary operators. Okay, so I don't know how hard it is to see this slide, but what's going on here is that we wanted to approximate the IX gate. On the x-axis are alpha between 1 third and 1, and the y-axis indicates the error. So up to 12 crossings, so the Fibonacci, this red line is the Fibonacci error, which is 0.4 something. And for various values of alpha, For various values of alpha, we beat Fibonacci. Some values of alpha were worse than Fibonacci. I think it's maybe an interesting question to figure out why certain values of alpha are better than others. Okay, so maybe to start getting to the end of this talk, so these are results about a one-qubit quantum computer, and of course you'd want to scale up by taking more strands. So if J is minus n. So if j is minus n plus 1, minus n plus 3 over n minus 1, we have this vector space, or this Hermitian vector space. And of course, we have a break group action here. And we would like the break group action to generate a dense subgroup here as well. So it turns out we didn't, well, we had a kind of a negative result, and I'll explain what happens. So let's let S be IQ the alpha, and B N S be the reduced Bureau representation. The reduced Bureau representation of the break group at this parameter. So, in a paper from the 80s, Squire endowed the Bureau representation with the Hermitian pairing so that the representation is unitary. And then a suggestion of Immanuel Wagner, which turned out to be true, is that the case exterior power of the Bureau representation is our representation. This is a TQFT kind of explanation of the Bureau representation at certain values of alpha. The reason why this is The reason why this is problematic is that if k is not 1 or n minus 1, then the Bray group factors through a diagonal group, so you don't have density. So you have a negative density result, unless k is 1 or n minus 1. Okay, well, luckily, at least for k equals 1, we do have this density result. So the break group action into PU of this Hilbert space has dense image. And I should mention that. Dense image. And I should mention that Nick Salter from a couple years ago has related results about the density of distortion. So maybe just to kind of close off with an idea of the proof, which is not particularly complicated in this case. So I think we get the main idea by considering four strands. So the Bureau of Presentation here is three-dimensional, and we have these three trees. Trees. So sigma 1 and sigma 2, which permute the first two strands, it stabilizes the space, the subspace of E1 and E2, and stabilizes E3. And we know that from the one-qubit case, sigma 1 and sigma 2 generate a subgroup, a dense subgroup of PU, E1, E2. And then sigma 3 maps Maps is a bridge between the subspace spanned by E1 and E2 and E3. So it takes some elements here, some element here. And a result by some quantum computationalists, by Aranov, Arad, Iban, and Lambda, say that, well, if you could generate something dense here and something dense here, you have a map between the two, you actually get something dense in the entire system. And for higher values of n, you just proceed like this by the. Values of n, you just proceed like this by adoption. So, a very simple down-to-earth linear algebra proof for this case. Okay, maybe this is a good place to stop. Is the universality results only for the specific root of unity or in general? We only did it for this root of unity. I suspect it will be more general. I suspect it'll be more general. We're working on, I think, an eighth root of unity right now. But I'm not quite sure yet. So you need to know, in this case, for the first routine unity, you really need to use the fact, you use the what? The explicit formula for the base. Yeah, we use the explicit formula and we use this bridge lemma, which basically you have density here and then. Basically, you have density here, and then you have some two-dimensional space, and you have a density here, and then you have a bridge here. So, we're able to kind of inductively build up density piece by piece, which for more complicated things might not be half this luxury of doing it in this kind of very simple inductive way. So that's another barrier. But yeah, you need a formula to prove density on like the seed, as these computational people call it, and then build up using this bridging. So the parameter representation should should be just part of this, right? Is this just one particular representation that you get? Yeah, so, well, I mean, so we, I mean, we have, so first of all, I should say there's some more flexibility of what you put here and then what you put down here. You could put, so these are simple modules, you could put projective modules in each case, this is my last couple of slides. In which case, this is my last couple of slides. But if you fix all of these to be alpha and this down here, then we got exterior powers of zero. Right. Yeah. But that's all we get into. So the difficulty is, is in rows, you lose area. Yeah, exactly. You lose density. Density. Yeah. These representations are kind of yeah, and these you lose density. What's the classical distribution? It's a good question. I haven't we haven't really thought about it very very deeply, but I I think there's other chance yet that will come up at the world. Other questions?
