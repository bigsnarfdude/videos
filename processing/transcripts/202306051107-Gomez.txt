Hello? Hi. Yes. Okay. Can you then? Okay. So, in the second half, we'll have Gomats telling us about hogs, out of birth, and smaller. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. Let me just thank the organizer for giving me the opportunity. Organizer for giving me the opportunity to join this conference. Unfortunately, I should do it online and cannot attend in person as was my wish, but okay, let's try the best. Now, the title of the talk, as you can see in the transparency, very elementary transparencies, because I am using just hand-written transparencies. I imagine that this will not be a problem. It's clocks, algebras, and cosmology. It's based on two recent papers that you have here. Based on two recent papers that you have here, the archive numbers. And the reason algebras appears here is because, okay, I will present the problem of cosmology, the problem of time in cosmology from the point of view of Grisen approach to entanglement in quantum field theory based on fundamental algebras, factors, and all that. But the seminar, since it's only half an hour, will not be technical. And okay, I believe will be. I believe it will be easy to follow. Okay, let me start. Everybody can hear me okay? Okay, let me start with something very basic that I call the problem of time in quantum gravity. This is something that you can find along the years in the 80s, in the 60s, in the 70s. Essentially, the problem of time in quantum gravity is very easy to understand. There is a very beautiful paper that I found recently, I didn't know before, by Dom Page. didn't know before by Don Page and Butters in 85 or something like that, that is a very clarifying paper on what is the problem of time in quantum gravity in that sense. In quantum gravity, you require in order to define physical observables invariance under D for under reparametrizations. And let me just concentrate only on something simpler, which is just simply invariance under time reparametrizations. Now, if you impose this condition as a constraint, the algebra of physical observables, The algebra of physical observables, defined by satisfying time reparameterization invariance, is the invariance of algebra defined here, which is simply the set of operators in whatever is your algebra of observable. You can imagine a system where you have the algebra of self-adjoint operators that commute with whatever is the Hamiltonian of your system. Now, this is what you will require just from reparametration invariance to be your candidate for your physical, for your algebra or physical. Your physical Fourier algebra of physical observables. Now, notice that this is very similar to a problem that we are very familiar with, which is the problem of superselection charges. Again, when you have a superselection charge, you define the physical observables not just as any self-adjoint operator, this is the reason you call it superselection, but the set of self-adjoint operators that commute with the generator or with the superselection charges. Now, in the case that we declare that the In the case that we declare that the algebra physical observables is the observables invariant under time-reparameterizations, in other words, the ones that commute with the Hamiltonian, we run immediately in a trivial problem. It's that this algebra cannot explain, cannot account for the observed changes in time that we see in the universe. Why? Because all observables in this invariant subalgebra are stationary. This is a problem that people knew for the supersalation charges in the old days in the super. And in the case of supercellation charges, the problem manifests in a very simple way is that if you impose that the algebra of physical observables is the algebra of observables that commute with a supersolation char, then you cannot define superposition of states with different char. If you have a superposition like this one, this will be an observable. Now, in the 60s and even before, people, Digner and many people asked how to solve this problem. As how to solve this problem. And the solution of this problem is very much in connection with what we are doing these days in order to understand the algebra of observables in the citr or for the black holes. Let me say what was the suggestion. The solution originally was suggested by Acharanov and Saskine in 1967. An idea that now is very popular in quantum information theory, since we are related with quantum information in this Congress, let me just mention, is in the language of quantum information. Is in the language of quantum information to add to the physical system in which you could that you are interested to describe what I can call a reference is called in quantum information literature a reference frame quantum system. What is a reference frame quantum system? A reference frame quantum system is characterized by a Hamiltonian that have nothing to do with the Hamiltonian of the system that you are working with and an algebra of observables that simply represent the dynamics of this reference frame. Of this reference frame. And you define the algebra of physical observables, not as before, that was A invariant under the Hamiltonian H, but now you tensor multiply your algebra by the reference frame, and you consider the algebra of invariance under the combined action of the Hamiltonian of the reference frame and the Hamiltonian of the system. If you are interested in superselection charges, as was the case in the original paper of Aharanov and Saskine, you will put here the Q, which is the... You will put here the Q, which is the supersolation chart, and the reference frame will be defined by some system characterized by some QR, Q reference, and some algebra of reservoirs, and some small Hilbert space. Now, these are the algebra that now is much better than the one before, because this algebra is non-trivial. And in the case of super selection charges, will allow you to have superposition of states with different charge. And in the case that we are interested, when we have invariance under. When we have invariance under time-re-parametrization, while the original algebra, in many cases, as we will see for the sitter in particular, is trivial. In the case you extend with this reference frame extra piece, the algebra becomes non-trivial. Now, we will generically refer when we are interested in reparametation invariance. In other words, when we are interested in Hamiltonian age in time evolution and defining invariance under time reparametization, we genetically Parameterization, we genetically refer to the reference frame quantum system with Hamiltonian IHR as a clock and to the elements in this algebra, this will be familiar for people working in gauge theory, as clock dressed observables. In other words, you are familiar when you try to introduce a gauge constraint that you normally dress your operators, for example, with a Wilson line, and this dresseth operators becomes now part of the physical algebra, commute with the corresponding cost, satisfy the corresponding cost rate. In the case that we In the case that we are considering, the way we are defining this dressing in order to define physical observables that satisfy the constraint of time reparametation is to improve your algebra with an extra system, which is the clock, with a clock Hamiltonian, and to define this algebra that we will discuss in detail in a moment. Now, we can consider elementary clocks just in order to fix ideas with just one degree of freedom. Ideas with just one degree of freedom, you will see immediately this. And then the Hilbert space in which we are working once we add this reference frame clock is just simply the Hilbert space of the system we are interested to discuss and cross L to R, simply the wave function square summable for one degree of freedom. This space can be represented also, and this will be interesting for future discussion, like the square assummable functions from R into the Hilbert space. These two spaces are iso. Hilbert space. These two spaces are isomorphic. Now the coordinate time, let's not talk yet of physical time, the coordinate time will be parameterized by this real line. And the coordinate time translations or the coordinate time transformations are generated in this Hilbert space by two guys. One is the Hamiltonian of the system that will define on this Hilbert space time transform time translations, and then the time translation on the Hilbert space of your. On the Hilbert space of your clock or the Hilbert space of your reference frame system, which is what we call HR. HR, because we are just simply working with one degree of freedom, will be simply represented by derivative with respect to t, because t, which is the parameter in this real line, is what we are interpreting as coordinate time. The algebra of the observables of the composed system is in principle the algebra of the system we are interested to discuss, the algebra of all bonds. The algebra of all bounded operators for the clock, which means all bounded operators acting on the normal Hilbert space of one degree of freedom, quantum mechanism, one degree of freedom. But the algebra of gauge invariant observables, which are the ones that you consider physical, will be just simply the invariant part of this algebra under the action of the Hamiltonian of your system and the Hamiltonian of your clock. Okay, so far so good. Just simply is recalling, if you want, the ideas of Akharanov and Saskai. Of Aharanov and Saskine on reference frame that became very, very popular in quantum information theory, and they have a deep meaning in quantum information theory. But I have not time to discuss these things. Okay, let's see the problem of tinning the zeta because we are going to talk about cosmology as Robert before. What is the problem of tiny deseta? I am going to consider no quantum gravity. I am going to consider simply quantum field theory on a fixed desitter background. Fixed the sitter background and in the weak gravity limit. In other words, the mass length, you can set it to infinity in all what we are discussing. This means that we consider just quantum field theory on this background, but in this quantum field theory, you can consider also degrees of freedom corresponding to the quantum fluctuations of the metric. But not back reaction in such a way that you modify the metric, no quantum gravity effects. This will be suppressed by one over m plan, and then g n equal to zero sends m plan to infinity. Plan to infinity. It's just quantum field theory on the zitter background. Now, in this, this is the Penrose diagram of the Zitter that probably you are very familiar with. Then, the way to interpret this Penrose diagram is that you can imagine in this vertical line, you are an observer, you are moving in this vertical line, this is your world line in the universe. This time, parameterize your local time. These red lines are the cosmological horizon. Great lines are the cosmological horizons. This is the full desitter, and this region is the static patch, which is the region physically that is accessible to this observer. In other words, this observer can know something about the physics or everything about the physics happening in this static patch performing local measurements. Now, once you have this thing and you are interested in quantum field theory on this particular background, you define two objects. One is the Hilbert space of your quantum field theory. This is the quantum field theory Hilbert space, not the quantum gravity Hilbert space. Hilbert space, not the quantum gravity Hilbert space. This defines all the possible states that you can define in this background. And notice that these states contain information that is not accessible to this observer. Contain information because this stage can be defined for a per surface that goes from here to here, equal global time t, and then contains information and describe probability amplitudes or whatever of this region, which is the static patch that is completely unaccessible to this observer. Go to this observer. This is the quantum field theory Hilbert space. The algebra ideas must be defined physically. This is for this observer the algebra of local observables with local support in the static patch. In other words, it's the algebra of observables that represent measurements that this observer can perform in the region that is accessible to him. Not one important thing that will be interesting in the future, not that the full decister group is acting on the Hill. Group is acting on the Hilbert space, but not on the corresponding algebra associated to the static patch, because there are parts of transformations of the Zitter that are static patch outside. In other words, ADA. Sorry? I have a question. Can you hear me? So, how did you define the accessible region for the observer again? This is the Penrose diagram. Okay, imagine that the observer, you just have. Okay, imagine that your server, you just have one observer that is moving on this line. Okay, this is the cosmological horizon, and this is the region that is causally accessible to him. Okay, this is the what is called the static patch. This is nothing and not saying anything original here. But he can receive signals from the bottom part. Right, right, but right, but yeah, but okay, here, okay, this will lead us into a different discussion. This is what is called the two theory. Different discussion. This is what is called the tube theorem and something else. Let me just simply consider this algebra as the algebra of observables with local support in this region, which is the static patch of this observer. The only thing that here I want to mention is that the symmetries of the full Hilbert space can be represented in the full, of full desitter, can be represented in the full Hilbert space, but this region, which is the static patch of this observer, is not invariant under the full desitter group. Not invariant under the full desitter group. There is only a part of the sitter group. One of these part is translation on this line that are the ones that are acting actually as isometries of this algebra. Now, the generator, now you want to say the generator of time translations for this observer, the generator of translation should be associated, you know, should be associated to a global killing of the zitter. And the global killing of the zitter that you have is a transformation that A transformation that moves in this direction in the static patch, and in the opposite static patch, translates in the opposite direction. I cannot explain many of these things because we have only half an hour, but okay, this is for sure a global killing of the Zitter. And the interesting thing is that the generator of the corresponding time automorphism on the algebra of observables of this transformation defined by this killing is what is called the. This killing is what is called the modular Hamiltonian of this algebra. For us, because we are not going to enter into high mathematics or something like that in half an hour, the only important thing here is look for a keyline that is globally defined in the Ziter and define a generator that defines the define the transformations generated by this killing of the algebra of observables on your static patch. Now, this Hamiltonian is. Now, this Hamiltonian is the Hamiltonian H, and this Hamiltonian is the modular Hamiltonian of this algebra. Let me make a few remarks about this consideration, because this is a lot of technicalities that enter into this, but just for us. H, which is this Hamiltonian, repeat, this is the Hamiltonian associated to the global Keeling vector in the citer, is not part of the algebra. This time translation define outer automorphism of the algebra alias. Of the algebra alias. That's the reason it's the modular Hamiltonian. Now, probably something that you would be thinking immediately is: say, oh, wait, this guy is defining this global keyline going upwards in one static patch and in the other direction in the other static patch. The reasonable thing to do, if you are an observer here, is to think in time translation that move like that and they are not doing anything in the race of the static patch, which are disconnected by these cosmological horizons. By these cosmological horizons. Then you say, okay, very good. I can define age associated to time translation in this sense. The problem, and this is a typical problem of the city, and this is what now many people are describing using factors of von Neumann factors, is that this H is ill-defined. It's ill-defined for two reasons, equivalent reason. One is that this region and this region in full decision are infinitely entangled. And the second reason of equivalent. And the second reason of equivalently is that when you add with the Hamiltonian representing these time translations on this static patch and doing nothing on the rest on your Hilbert space, this is unbounded operator. In other words, the norm of H psi is infinity for any psi in your Hilbert space. Physically, this is due to the divergent fluctuation on the cosmological horizon. Another remark is that we can identify because we can represent the full desitter group in the We can represent the full desitter group in the Hilbert space. We can identify in the Hilbert space ds a typical desiter invariant state, which is what we call the Bands-Davies vacuum in people familiar with quantization in the sitter. Now, in these conditions, you will say, oh, I have very thin. I am an observer in the sitter. Imagine that you are an observer that you are interested in doing cosmology. This will come in a few minutes. That you are just an observer, you have your algebra. An observer, you have your algebra of observables, and you say, Oh, but I want to consider physical observables. I don't want to consider observables that I can change by just reparametrization of time. Then you say, Oh, very simple, because since you now have a candidate to define the representation in your algebra of time reparametrizations, simply choose an algebra, which is the algebra invariant under reparameterization of time. This is the notion to use the first. Notion to use the first transparency how to define physical observables in the center. What is the result? The result is crazy. The result is that this algebra of physical observables in the center is totally trivial, only contains the identity. This is not necessarily well known, but it's something that is related with very basic properties of local quantum field theory in the citadel, which is a local region surrounded by a horizon. The reason for that is that this Hamiltonian, that is the module. Is that this Hamiltonian, that is the modular Hamiltonian, is acting ergodically, and therefore this algebra becomes trivial. Another way to put it is that this algebra, ADS, of local observables in the static patch is a type 3 factor. But I don't want to enter into that. But I want to make the physics message very clear. No one theory gauge invariant observables. Sorry? Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah. One question. One question. What is so special of the considerable? Can you do this in Brindler, for example? What is so special in order to get this trivial result for the zitter? Okay, the technical answer is that in the zitter, the static patch is a bounded region of spacetime. Now, the algebra of observables in arbitrary quantum field theory, in a local bounded region of spacetime, is a type 3 factor. What this means? This means that the generator of time. This means that the generator of time translations is acting ergodically on your algebra of observables. Acting ergodically on the algebra of observables means that the only invariant part is the identity. Then it's a consequence of two physical facts. One, that the sitter you are forced to consider in the static patch a boundary region of space-time. And there are general theorems coming back to Araki and many people that the algebra of local observables in a boundary region. In a boundary region of space-time, in local quantum field theory, local quantum field theory means locality for the algebra of observables. This is a type 3 factor. And automatically, this means that your algebra of potentially time invariant reparametrization observables is trivial because the time generator, the generator of time reparametrization, of time translation in your local region is the modular Hamiltonian that is acting erodic. Then this is a very subtle region. Then this is a very subtle reason. The physical reason for that, the physical reason for that, is that this algebra of observables in the static patch in this region, in this region, is infinitely entangled with this region. The reason for this happening, the reason you don't have any gauge invariant under time reparametrization of physical observable locally defined here, sorry, is because this is infinitely entangled from this. You cannot separate these two guys. You cannot separate these two guys. That's technically the reason that you have the ergodicity of this Hamiltonian and the fact that this algebra is just identity. This is what I call the problem of time for the zitter. Then how to get a non-trivial set of gauge invariant physical observables in the zitter? This has been answered by Chandra Sekaran, Longo, Pennington, and Witten recently. And let me just summarize the answer that you will find extremely familiar after the previous discussion. After the previous discussion, the idea of these people is essentially what we were doing following Aharnof and Saskaim when we consider superselection charges. Don't consider only the algebra of local observables of the Ziter. Add a reference frame clock. What means as a reference frame clock? This means that go from the original Hilbert space that you have, where you have, for instance, your Bunch-Davis vacuum, to an extended Hilbert space where you have the Hilbert space of the sitter, quantum field theory on the sitter, and the Hilbert space. Quantum field theory on the sitter, and the Hilbert space of the clock. Still, I didn't tell you what is this clock. This is this. The simplest way, intuitively, you want to keep in mind what is this Hilbert space is simply the space of paths from the interval minus infinity to plus infinity that you can parameterize with time into paths in the Hilbert space of states, which are squaresummable. In other words, the norm defined by the Seskilinear form on this Hilbert space must be finite the integral. What is the algebra of physical observables? The algebra of observables of the zitter, the algebra of boundary operators of the clock, but restricted by the constraint associated with the generator of time translation for the zitter, the modular Hamiltonian, and the clock Hamiltonian or reference frame Hamiltonian HR. This is essentially exactly the same picture mathematically that here. Now the elements in the new algebra are just paths, are functions square sum of from minus. functions square sum of from minus infinity to plus infinity to the algebra of a circle. Note that this would be very important that this Hamiltonian HR is formal because this Hamiltonian HR defined by simply the derivative with respect to t has an spectrum that is the whole real line. And this will be important in a moment. Now the so-defined algebra is known as the cross-s product of the algebra ADS of local observables we support in the static patch. Support in the static patch by the action of the modular group. And then this we will denote it by a cross. Now, here are some technical remarks that you can ignore in this short lecture, but let me just say. For ADS, this algebra is a tied to infinity factor. What this means? This means that there is a linear form on the algebra into the complex number satisfying the trace property. However, the trace defined by this, that's the reason of this. Defined by this, that's the reason of this infinity here, is not finite. There are many elements for which the trace is infinite, in particular the identity. Then the elements in this cross-set product algebra, which are observables of quantum field theory defined of the city, dressed by the clock effect, which is these factors here, this is the dressing, are defined in that way. These are the functions that I was putting here. That I was putting here. And these reset observables require in order to be defined to use the t-hat operator that we will see what is the meaning in a moment, that is acting on the Hilbert space of the clock simply as coordinate and H as momentum. Now, there is an important fact that I will discuss at the very end, but only very superficially, that there is always in this algebra a projection, means an operator satisfying ps. means an operator satisfying p square equals p such that if you define the projection of this algebra y p the factor that you get instead to be a tied to infinity factor is a tied to one factor this means that when you extend the function five to this projected su factor a projected type to one factor this now is a trace which is finite and is also associated to a vector state in other words phi of a can be represented like a standard in quantum mechanics Like a standard in quantum mechanics, but for this psi-hat, a state in the standard Hilbert space, the Hilbert space of the city, the Hilbert space of the clock, and projected by this projection P. You will see in a moment what is the meaning of this projection. Now, this psi state, when you introduce this projection P and you use this projection P in order to define a type to one factor, is this state that probably you have heard recently about it. This is the state that is. It this is the state that is representing the maximal entropy state of the zitter. This is a state that represents flat entanglement in the sense that the corresponding density matrix that now you can define because you are in a tied to one factor is just dated. Now, then what is the lesson until this point? The lesson until this point is if you don't add a clock in the sitter, you cannot define gauge invariant fluctuations under time reparametrization. Under time reparametrization. In other words, when we are discussing cosmology that we'll enter into a second, and you are interested in discussing a quantum fluctuation created in your static patch that will leave the horizon later on, but you want to define this quantum fluctuation located in your static patch, you will ask, oh, I want this quantum fluctuation, a scalar fluctuation, to be a real fluctuation, not to be something that changes arbitrarily by time reparametrization. But then the solution is that. But then the solution is that you don't have any if you work in pure decister. You have a lot if you combine pure decister plus this external clock that I have not yet told you how this works. I only represent algebraic. Now let me just a brief parenthesis here. Because I told you, oh, we have a clock with a Hamiltonian that is the derivative with respect to t, but okay, this is not a good Hamiltonian because it's not positive. Hamiltonian because it's not positive. The problem of time in quantum mechanics is a problem that comes back to the early days in quantum mechanics. And this is a discussion that has been running in the 30s, in the 60s. And it's essentially, you are teaching quantum mechanics, you will teach to your students delta P delta Q bigger than or equal to H bar, and you will say, oh, this is very easy to prove. And it will be an exercise for the student to derive this relation for PQ equal IH. But then later on, you explain. But then later on, you explain the uncertainty principle energy time. And then the student can be and can ask, oh, teacher, how I derive delta E, delta T bigger than H bar from some algebra. Then even Heisenberg in the original paper introduced something like p hat, time operator, H Hamiltonian. This will be conjugate variables. This will be derivative with respect to X, and this will be X. This will be derivative with respect to time, and this will be time. What happened? What is the problem of time in quantum? What happened? What is the problem of time in quantum mechanics? Why in the books in quantum mechanics we understand this, but we have lots of discussion about what is the meaning of this. The problem is that if you impose two self-adjoint operators to satisfy this algebra, the spectrum of H satisfying this algebra is the whole real line. This means that this cannot be a good Hamiltonian because it's not positive. Then no time operator in the corresponding Hamiltonian conjugate to the time operator is positive. Time operator is positive. This is a problem of time in quantum mechanics, well known from the 30s. Then, how to define a physical clock? With some clock Hamiltonian positive. There's a beautiful paper by Aharanov and Bonn that addressed this problem. Let me just represent this thing because it will be interesting for discussing inflation in a moment. The simplest way you can define a clock in quantum mechanics is to use a quantum system with a coordinate, some observables, that is telling you the time. That is telling you the time. For instance, you can say, oh, when this free particle is in such position, this will be time 12 o'clock. Then you characterize time by the position operator of some quantum system that is defined by normal algebra, a coordinate momentum equal IH bar, some Hamiltonian H clock that defines the time derivative. Of course, this will not be a good clock if you don't use good clock quantum states. Well, because you don't want a clock that is moving crazily with Is moving crazily with a lot of uncertainty, and so on, and so forth. Then, what kind of clock quantity state do you define? You define a clock quantity state such that the variance of the derivative response to time of the observable set that you are using to tell time is much, much smaller than one. This is very close to a slow roll, as you will see in a moment. This is simply to look for a parameter that is telling you this must be very, very small in order to have something that works nicely like a clock. Works nicely like a clock. Now, in this particular case, the time uncertainty will be derived from the time uncertainty of the coordinate set that you are using to define time and the expectation value on your clock state of Z dot. It's a trivial exercise that delta T delta H is bigger or equal to H bar coming from this expression and this expression. Now, Aharonov and Bonn in 61. In 61, they decide to define what we call the t-hat operator in this particular case. And they say, Oh, imagine you use a second free particle in such a way that the time is the position of this free particle. Sorry. We started late, but I think we can continue for another five minutes. Is that okay? Okay, very good. Just five minutes will be. Okay, very good. Just five minutes will be more than enough. Okay. Sorry? Okay. No, the problem is that the sound from the meeting room is arriving to me completely broken. That's the reason I have problems to understand when somebody is speaking from the meeting room. Okay, then these people just define this T-hat, define it in that way. And then you can immediately see that T-hat satisfies this condition. But then you say, oh, this guy was cheating because he. And then you say, oh, this guy was cheating because he told me that this cannot be true if H is positive definite and this cannot be more positive definite. Now, the problem is that this T hat is not well defined when Pz, when the clock is stopping, when Pz is equal to zero or Z dot is equal to zero. Then, okay, let's go to the final part, the problem of time in inflationary cosmology, just to connect with the previous speakers. What is the key problem in inflationary cosmology? The clip loading inflationary cosmology is. The Klipplovin inflationary cosmology is to identify gauge invariant quantum fluctuation, in particular scalar, during the primordial exponential expanding desitter phase. In pure decister, I was trying to convince you that the set of gauge invariant quantum fluctuation is just the identity, non-existent, in the case of pure decision. If you are a practitioner of inflation, you know that, but in a certain different way. You know that when you are in pure decister and you try to compute the power spectrum, you get divergent quantities because the epsilon in the denominator. Because the epsilon in the denominator produces for you divergences. This divergence is a manifestation that essentially what you are doing is a little bit crazy. You are just considering as gauge invariant quantum fluctuation something that is not gauge invariant. The only gauge invariant is the identity. The lesson of the previous discussion is to add a clock and to work with the state death algebra for some clock Hamiltonian. Now, what this means? This means that the famous Muhanno-Sasaki gauge environment observables are simply clock-dressed. Observables are simply clock dresseth operators. Recall that the typical clock dresseth operator was of the form that, where A belongs to the decider algebra, T hat is defined by the corresponding clock, and H is the modular Hamiltonian. Then you can enjoy an exercise, trivial exercise, and say, oh, what is the Muhannow-Sasaki variable defined in the scalar curvature fluctuation? It's defined by that, where this quantity is defined by the linear fluctuation on the metric, where it is conformal time. Now you Is conformal time. Now you can enjoy yourself saying, oh, what is this eta? This eta of Buhano-Sasaki variable is a clock-directed operator, very simply clock-directed operator, where this T-hat is characterized by rho divided by rho dot, and this HDS is acting on the side of defining the linear part of the scalar fluctuation at Habel radius. This is perfectly rigorous, and you can do it. And this is just simply telling you that the Simply telling you that the famous Muhano-Sasaki variables, any gauge invariant cosmological fluctuation is simply a part of a cross-product algebra defined by the cross-product of the algebra of the citadel by a clock, an external clock. This external clock is Tihat. That here you immediately recognize is what you will call the inflaton clock. This simply means that the scalar, the bef of the scalar, The bef of the scalar of the inflaton is defining your clock coordinate. There is a Hamiltonian that is defining phi dot or rhot dot. And following the previous transparency, you are defining the corresponding t hat. And then you dress with this t hat and you get the Buhano-Sasaki variable. Now, the power spectrum will be just to enjoy computing this on some particular state, which is a state in Hilbert space of the sitter and the Hilbert space of the clock. But But here you can say, oh, this guy says nothing new. Essentially, what we are saying is the inflaton is a necessity because the algebra of gauging variant observables in the city without adding something that plays the role of the external clock is trivial. Once you use the inflatable field as an abstract clock with an abstract clock Hamiltonian defining phi dot, then in the extended Then, in the extended algebra, which is the cross-set product, perfectly mathematically nicely defined, I can find precisely the Muhano-Sasaki variable. But in a certain sense, what you did after all this blah, blah, blah, blah, is to transform what is the inflaton potential into the clock that you introduced. Now, the question is, can we define a model-independent natural clock in the citadel? With this, I will finish. I will call it volume of clock. The volume of clock is defined using the conformal time on the planar patch. On the planar patch, using the Desiter, pure Desiter volunteer transformation, to define the representation of the clock Hamiltonian on the Hilbert space, which is a product of harmonic of creation and equation operators for mod K and for minus K. People familiar with inflation. Pure decister, I'm not introducing any external thing. Define clock states as squeezed states in this Hilbert space. And now the phase of this. The phase of this squeeze at the stage is precisely playing the role of the T-hat, that is, the clock that we need to add in order to have a non-trivial set of gauge invariants, time invariant parametrization fluctuations. Now, you can define the power spectrum for the Muhano-Sasaki variable, but the Muhano-Sasaki variable defines it by the dressing of this ti-hat, this volube of time that I introduce. You can compute the power spectrum. You can compute the power spectrum. And in particular, you can compute the power spectrum directly because you can compute the variance of this phase five, of this state k eta, and this is precisely the corresponding t-hat squared value of the power spectrum. From this, you can get even numerical results. I don't want to enter into that because this is beyond the target of the seminar. But the summary is very simple. The summary is that cosmological scalar fluctuations. Scalar fluctuations are elements of this cross-site product algebra, which are operators addressed by the C-terre volume of clock. And what is the message? The message is you don't need to invent your favor inflatome potential. That will mean your favor clock. You need to introduce an inflatome because you need to create an algebra of gauge invariant reparamutations invariant observables non-trivial. And you can only do it composing the citer, quantum field theory on the citer. Composing the Zitter, quantum field theory on the zitter, with something else that is playing the role of the reference frame. Now, for this reference frame, you can use something very strange on inflaton that is moving in this potential like that, in this potential like that. But you can say there is nothing in the sitter that is playing like a clock. Of course, there is something that is playing like a clock. It's like to say, for me, a clock in the sitter is a free particle in the zitter moving on the planar patch. What is the characteristics of this eater clock? Clock, the zitter clock, the volume of transformation defining the derivative with respect to eta in pure desitter for this for this particle. Now you address your operators with this clock, and in that way you define a natural power spectrum completely model-independent. Now, I believe I can finish here. I have something else, but I don't want to go beyond my time. Okay, thank you very much. I don't know if I went too much out. I don't know if I went too much out of my time. The chairman can tell me. Okay, so I was a bit short, but we were still in questions basically. So we've been learning recently from, for example, Nima Lashkari and collaborators that these check-free factors have, in the context of black holes, have some connection to the information paradox. Is there any way that in Desider there's that this time problem in DeSider This time problem and etc. Yeah, actually, actually, as you can see, probably because in the screen, the final comment was precisely that. The final comment that is the citr slash black hole that is related with papers related with how to address the information paradox and so on and so forth. It's interesting because here I want to make a comment that can sound interesting to some people. Now, the Citadel and Black Hole are very similar in a certain sense. This is the Penros diagram. Similar in a certain sense. This is the Penrose diagram of the citer. This is the Penrose diagram of the black hole. In both cases, you can say, oh, I am the exterior observer. Then this is the region external to the black hole. This is the interior. I am the observer in the center. This is the region that is inside my cosmological horizon. And this is what is beside my cosmological horizon. In this case, you have an algebra, ADS. In your case, you have an algebra associated to this region, A black hole. Algebra associated to this region, a black hole. These are different because this asymptotic observer is living at infinity and this observer is living at r equals zero. This region is a bounded region of space-time, and this is an unbounded region of space-time. But forget about that. Both algebras are type three factors. Type three factor have problems. Then you add a clock. In both cases, a clock or a clock.
