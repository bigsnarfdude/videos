My talk is a kind of non-linear Scherenguer equation, but dispersion coefficient depends on non-linearity. We started this work with Palanz Kerry Kiddis from Massachusetts and his student, and recently continued with analysts from Karsu, Michael Plum. Just to identify solitary waves, I will give you just a brief classification: that there are bright solitons and dark solitons. Bright solitons and dark solitons. The terminology is just due to nonlinear optics. Bright solitons are localized solutions at the zero background, and the typical model would be a focus in non-linear shredding equation. And dark solitons would be a localized solution on non-zero background. And a typical model would be the defocus in non-linear shared equation. These are the two solutary ways I would like to talk about. However, I would like to go beyond non-linear Schrodinger equations. Beyond non-linear Schrodinger equation. Analysis is a fundamental model, it brings together linear dispersion and cubic nonlinearity. If you study applications in fluids, in optics, you would like to maybe work with extended versions of this equation when you take into account high-order dispersion, cubic derivative term we were speaking, we were listening and talks about, and then on-site quintic nominate term. And these corrections, coefficients, they introduced new phenomena in the Introduce new phenomena in dynamics of solitary waves. However, the models I would like to talk about are different. They are very simple, just dispersion, non-linear dispersion equation, but the dispersion coefficient depends on the intensity, on the nonlinearity. And these models were introduced in optics quite some time ago. Recently, we were inspired by this paper in optics letters. And people in optics can actually measure how disparate. Can actually measure how dispersion coefficients depend on the intensity, and in some cases it is decreasing, so that is an extreme situation when the dispersion coefficient vanishes at the intensity, which is normalized to be the unity. And in some cases, the dispersion coefficient can increase with intensity, extreme case when it's increased all the way to infinity. Now we have to deal with the first challenge. Okay, so you will see that in the left model there are bright solitons, in the right model there are dark solitons. I'm going to speak about the existence and stability of solitary solutions from an energetic point of view. At this point everything is all At this point, everything is open with respect to time evolution, local velposeness, sobriospacies, global velposeness. So if you are interested for a new project, that would be one of the possibilities for the new projects to go. So let's start with the first model for which the dispersion coefficient vanishes at the unit intensity. This model has conserved quantities. It's a Hamiltonian system with the energy invariant, which is just a squared inhomogeneous. A squared inhomogeneous Sobolev norm, H1. And then the mass invariant, which for small intensities is just a squared L2 norm, so that for small intensities when psi squared is much smaller than one, you can hope to get the local and global solutions in the Soviet space H1, like it would be in the regular cubic non-mini-Schönber equation. However, if you are interested not in a small data, but in a solitary wave propagation, then there is no wave. Propagation. Then there is no way we can avoid the singularity, because the solitary wave is a solution where the intensity squared amplitude crosses one. And this can be very easily understood already from OD dynamics. If we do the standing wave solutions and look for the solitary waves from this OD, then for the exponentially decay to zero at infinity, omega as a parameter has to be positive, but once it's positive, it can be immediately scaled away. Immediately scaled away so that we would have just a very simple OG with no parameters here, integrable ones, and then all orbits of this system can be plotted, can be studied on the phase plane. And then we will see that the stable and unstable curve from the 0-0 equilibrium point intersect the point of singularity here 1. So if we want to study bright soil at once, there is no way to avoid the Sense there is no way to avoid the crossing point, the singularity point. And in this way, from a formal point of view, we can try to think about smooth orbits of this system gluing together somehow. One of the simple ways to glue is to glue the unstable curve to the stable curve, which would give us what we call cusped solitude. The intensity is always below 1, but it touches 1 and it has infinite singularity positive. Has infinite singularity for the first derivative. But this is not the only way to glue the orbits. We can glue the unstable, unstable curves with curve here above intensity 1 to form what we call bell-shaped solitons. And in fact, depending on the parameter C in the first order environment, we have multiple continuous ways of viewing this. And every time when we view, we have this bell-shaped case. This bell-shaped K curve above 1, which has different widths. So, with the parameter of the first-order invariant, we have a continuous family of solutions which we can obtain in this formal way. The question I ask, in what sense they exist? Can this glued be rigorously justified? What is the nature of singularity when the bright soliton crosses one? And can these solutions be characterized very Solutions be characterized variationally by using conserved quantities, so that at least without knowing well-positions aspects, we can conclude on energetic stability of solitary waste. These are the scope of what we will study. For the first point, we can think about the weak principle, reformulation, getting rid of the smooth curves because they have to be glued, and think about the weak formulation and say multiply it by test function. Say, multiply it by test function, integrating by parts to get some kind of weak formulation with innovation L2. And then we can quickly realize that any H1 solution will be a good candidate to satisfy this weak formulation. Because of so-bully-embedin of H1 to L infinity, all the terms in these inner products are well defined. For the test functions which doesn't have For the test functions, which doesn't have to be sufficiently smooth, it could be just H1 function. And in order to justify this, in order to be able to fit the organs of the smooth problem to this weak formulation, we will have to justify the integration bypass techniques to see that there is zero contributions at the points of singularity, so that at the singularity there are no extra matching conditions between the smooth orbits. The smooth orbits. And in fact, this is what we can do, and that's our first result: that all this one-parameter family of the gluing together smooth orbits would satisfy this weak formulation. So, in other words, there exists a one-parameter continuous family of weak, positive, for definite and simple Ham solutions of the bell shape, parameterized by parameter C, which defines the length of the bell head, of this bell shape. Of this Bell solvent. So we can prove that the solution obtained by gluing this trajectory exists in H1, and the singularity for the first derivative is small enough such that if we multiply by 1 minus u squared, it vanishes at the points of singularity. And the key to this result is to study, to use ODE theory, and to study formulations of orbits from integrating this first-order environment. So it's like an implicit equation. So it's like implicit equation. We think we have solitary waves to be a graph from x to u, but we do it from u to x in implicit formulation. In this particular setting, it's a casp soliton in the sense that when u approaches to 1, x goes to 0, but in fact, we can always add an extra orbit for the bell shape and introduce it in exactly the same way by using PC function formulation. So here, analysis of B. Analysis of behavior of this integral for ultra going to one. It has been done in my work with some completely different people because it appears that the same singular integral appears in other contexts, in a different context. And we have studied behavior of this integral and proved that the singularity is of the type of x square root of log. So if we differentiate it, it's a square root of log singularity, it's a squared integrable across the singularity. Squared integrable across the singularity point with no problem. And also, it is so weak that derivative times is x log x, which vanishes at the point of singularity. And this asymptotic holds not only for this cusp soliton, but for any orbits which are glued together across the single activity. And so, as a result, we have this continuous family parameterized, as I said, by parameter C here to such a C here to satisfy the weak formulas. And this is good so that we can think about whether we can obtain at least energetic stability of such solitary waves by looking at the kinds of quantities of the equation. So one way to get energetic stability is to formulate the critical, to formulate solitary waves as critical points of a certain action functional, which consists of conserved quantities. So here, for example, So, here, for example, if we have a linear combination of energy and mass with the parameter omega, then this would give us the same Euro-Lagrange equation as the problem for existence of bright surfaces. However, if we expand this action functional in the neighborhood of this good H1 solution, we quickly realize that the weak formulation we used before is actually not so good to study bright solutions from an energetic point of view. And the reason for this is that we And the reason for this is that we have to extend logarithmic functions in a Taylor series, and even the first variation would have this term for which the singularity is non-integrable. And since the test function perturbation of the bright solar atom doesn't range at the point of singularity, we are in trouble here with this term to be completely non-defined. So, in other words, the definition of the weak solutions for which we can justify gluing of the orbits is completely false. Is completely false in order to study stability of right solitons from an energetic point of view. So, in other words, we need spaces for which this test function as a perturbation multiplied by the singularity to be squared integrable and bounded. Then we can continue on extensions of the Lagarifnik term in the mass invariance in high orders and at least define the first variation, the second variation, and extend it to the high order. Standard to the high order. And this allows us, I mean, this prompts us to change the formulation. So, this behavior of energy quantities, mass invariant near the single bright soliton, prompts us to introduce a concept of length between the two singularities. So, if I also put one big picture here, Soliton of a bell shape. Then, at the unit and density here, we would like to break the real line in partition the real line in a compact interval, exactly by the intersections at the unit intensity and outside of this compact interval. So, with this, we have to fix the length between the two singularities such that Singularities such that the bell head is on the compact interval and the cusped tail is outside of the compact interval. Then, in order to define the test function of the perturbation, we would fix one particular element of this space which satisfies the required singular energy asymptotics which we obtain here, such that we would just define a new formulation, new weak formulation for the bright solution. New weak formulation for the bright solitons, so that the first variation of the action functional vanishes. And it is possible for the test functions, for the perturbations, to multiply by this singular weight associated with the fixed function, to be square, integrable, and bound, such that necessarily this test function has to vanish at the points of singularity, sufficiently fast. And so, with this first variation, it vanishes, and we can And we can think about variational formulation of the bright solitons. In particular, the precise theorem we proved is the following: Fix the length between the two singularities and define the subset of H1 functions. Fix the energy functional, which is a squared homogeneous H1 norm. And then find the minimum, the minimizer of the mass functional. If you are familiar with the theory of stability of solitary waves, it's usually Of stability of solitary waves, it's usually the other way around. Fixed mass, find the infinite energy. Because mass is usually the squared L2 norm, behaves very nicely. Here, the squared H1 norm is the energy, so we would like to fix the energy, while the mass is in fact this integral of logarithmic function, which is not so nice. So we would like to study to minimize this mass. And in order to do this, in order to prove this theorem, To do this, in order to prove this theorem, we need to obtain some technical results about monogynicity of the mappings, in particular this energy and the length between the bell head between the two singularities. Use scaling transformation to prove that there exists only one critical point of action functional associated with this constraint variational problem for the two parameters to be fixed. And then identify that the action. And then identify that the action is actually convex, so that this unique critical point is a minimizer. And I think I will have time just to maybe go through very quickly. So for the first part, for the technical proofs of the monotonicity of the mappings, we can use the same implicit function formulation which is so useful in ODV theory. So in particular, the energy can be expressed here through the integrations of all. Here, through the integrations of all these singular square roots, and the lengths between the two singularities can be expressed like this. Then, monotonicity of the first mapping is almost immediate because this integral is differentiable with respect to parameter and the result is strictly positive. Monotonicity of the second one is much more complicated because the integral is already weakly singular, because at the at the turning point the d the the denominator vanishes. The denominator vanishes. However, there is a powerful technique which is based on analysis of the period functions for the periodic orbits. And with this powerful technique, we can re-normalize this integral such that we could reduce it to the continuously differentiable integral. And then from certain technical computations, we can actually prove monotonicity of the mapping. On comparison, the mass functional is very bad. And the maintenance Is very bad. And the mapping is not monotone, which is here well illustrated by the graphs. The length between the single energy monotone, the energy monotone, but the mass is not monotone. That's why we would like to fix the length, we would like to fix the energy, and we would like to minimize the mass. And so with this, we have two parameters of the constraint variational problem. Formally, the Lagrange equation has this parameter omega, and as I described, there is also internal parameters. There is also internal parameters of this bright soliton family of the solutions of this normalized equation, and the scaling transformation can be used. With this, we have explicit parameterizations of the family by using parameter omega and C, but we need to study parameters mu and L. So there is a mapping from this. But this mapping can be inverted, and the reason this Jacobian is expressed by using these derivatives which we already proven. Derivatives, which we already proven to be strictly positive. So, by Lisa-Funson's theorem, the mapping is invertible, and for every μ and L, there exists only one choice for magnitude, such that we have a very unique critical point of the action functional constructed from the smooth solutions of the system. And then, because in the weak formulations now, perturbations have to satisfy. Perturbations have to satisfy this zero constraint so that logarithmic function can be extended in the Taylor series. Then, in the neighborhood of the bright soliton, we have quadratic terms and the non-n terms, which are now nicely behaving and bounded as cubic terms in the size of the perturbation. And so, again, the perturbation here has to vanish at the points of singularities. So, in other words, we are not allowed to. In other words, we are not allowed to change the length of the singularity. It has to be fixed and all perturbations have to satisfy Tirichle conditions at the points of singularity. With this, quadratic variation is also well defined in this space, and from the quadratic forms here, we can easily see that Q is coercive and positive. Q minus it may be not very seen. For the casp soliton, this is positive definite, therefore, parametric form is positive. But even for the well. Is positive, but even for the bell-shaped surgery, we can still prove percivity of the second quadratic form. So the only critical point which we had for fixed L is automatically the minimizers of the variational point. And there is no problem with this escape in sequence because the translation variance is now broken by this uh partition of the of the real line with two points of singularities fixed at the point minus L and L. At the point minus LLN. So, this is basically the story I have for the bright solitons. Two main results: continuum of single bright solitons exist, and from the point of energetic conserved quantities, it is stable relation, it's stable energetically. But well-posedness, evolution, possible regularization, maybe some kind of a dispersive regularization or diffusive regularization, is completely open. Is completely open for further project. But if we have established energetic stability of bright solid on a single limit, then probably this is somehow transfers to any regularized versions of the same equation. And this is open for further discussions. In the rest of my time, which I believe about 10 minutes, right, I would like to talk about the other model which would bring us to duct solutions. So the other model for which the coefficient, the current The coefficient of the dispersion is singular, it can be brought towards the time evolution term. And then we can see immediately a connection to the defocusian analysis. With the standing wave transformation, we get precisely the local cubic terms for the D-focus and analysis. Moreover, the standing wave solutions are identical. Thank you. That's a key book. It's called black solitons on the subjects of the optics. One can consider also trivial wave solutions, which are Also, Travan wave solutions, which are called Dux solitons, and Travan wave solutions are now different because of this term in front of the derivative. However, the analysis can again be used in order to prove the existence of Gauss orders for any speed C. In what setting, in what function analytical setting we would like to consider these solutions? We would like them to be far away from the singularity. Singularity is again at unit intensity, but the axometric go to the But dark solitons go to the unit intensity at infinity. Therefore, we are thinking about the set of functions which are always below the singularity, but approaches to the singularity at infinity. And in fact, all the entire family of Dark Solutions exist in this setting of functions. Again, time evolution is completely open, but what we know is that if we think about the solutions approaching to the unit intensity exponentially, The unit intensity exponentially fast in space, we can justify consideration quantities for this model. And here it is the same energy consideration as before, much better mass consideration. Instead of logarithmic term, we have here much better mass consideration. And even momentum consideration, which reminds us re-normalized momentum for the qubit defocusing analyst, it looks a little bit weird, but in fact, it can be very well analyzed. Not only for dark solutions, for which And not only for dark solitons, for which psi is bounded away from zero, but also for the black soliton, for the singular limit for which psi squared vanishes at a single point. And so, two results I would like just to present with no proof is the following. The first one about linearization at the black solid. So, we have the black soliton here, we are adding a perturbation, we are joking the evolutions to the linearized evolution. Here the factors appear in front of the time derivative terms. Front of the time derivative terms, but the operators on the right-hand side are exactly the same as in qubit diffocusing atoms. But what these terms appearing in the time evolution gives us, they give us a weight of the spectral stability problem. So in particular, phi squared is a t squared, so 1 minus phi squared is h squared, exponentially decaying at post-infinity. So for free, this spectral stability problem is formed. Spectral stability problem is formulated in a Hilbert space with exponentially decaying weights. And this is very helpful because, with this, we can actually prove that L minus and L plus have purely discrete spectrum with respect to this in this Hilbert space with exponential weights. Moreover, we can compute it as a standard simple exercise, we can compute them precisely. And then for the non-self-adjoint spectral status. For the non-self-adjoint spectral stability problem, we cannot compute the eigenvalues, but we can prove that there is no continuous spectrum. The eye spectrum is purely discrete, consists of eigenvalues. And these eigenvalues are located on the imaginary axis, which means that the dark solitons, the black solitons, are spectrally stable. Within spectral stability problem. And so this is a remarkable result. For KGV solitons, linearization. For KDV solitons, linearization introduces continuous spectrum and zero eigenvalue is always embedded. For dark solitons in diffocus and unless there is a continuous spectrum, the zero eigenvalue is always embedded. Here for this new model, we have full compactifications of the perturbations, they are just purely displaced by the second result is about again energetic stability of the black solitons. The action functional is a combination between energy and Is a combination between energy and mass. Very nice and very standard for the defocusing cubic NLS. We would expand it in exactly the same way with quadratic terms and cubic remainder terms. Quadratic terms are related with these two self-adjoint operators and cubic remainder term is here. However, it is well-known and notoriously difficult problem to get some kind of a career C V T here to conclude energetic stability. Why? Because operator L minus Because operator L minus, if we look, has continuous spectrum which touches zero. And it will not be as if in H1 norm, no matter what orthogonality conditions we introduced, because of the continuous spectrum touching zero. But if the perturbation, in particular L minus, acts on the imaginary part of the perturbation, if the perturbations are not in H1, then this remainder term are not remainder term any longer. It's not cubic. It's much stronger than cubic. And so these two problems. And so these two problems were understood by Grevizat and Smith in 2015. They were able to cover these problems by not just the following. They thought about this type of decomposition and brought this term back to the Q plus, which makes automatically Q minus, and introduce a new variable here such that the remainder term is just the L to norm squared of this. squared of this of this quantity eta, such that the decomposition is just a sum of three quadratic forms. And they can analyze these three quadratic forms by using a Banach space for which the first two terms are just for the conservation of energy, conservation of mass, but the new term has this exponential weight and they somehow arbitrarily impose this exponential weight on the perturbation. What we have here. What we have here is that exponential weights appear naturally as the time evolution or part of the analyst equation. In addition, we can work with four orthogonality conditions under which both quadratic forms, so now it was Q plus, now it's Q minus on the real part and Q minus on imaginary part, are just coercive and strictly positive under two orthogonality conditions. And we can satisfy this orthogonality condition by defining a family of taxonomic. Defining a family of tax solitons which has two translational symmetry parameters and also the speed parameters, so we translate away from the zero speed, but then an extra parameter which is not present in the qubit diffocus analysis. This is a scaling parameter because here with a scaling transformation, we don't change the boundary conditions while in a qubit deforecusing analyze equation the scaling transformation changes the boundary conditions. So with this Conditions. So, with these four parameters, we can control orthogonality conditions in time. And assuming that the initial value problem can be proven to be well posed in this set of the functions below the singularity and approaching singularity at infinity, we can prove conservation of these conserved quantities and orbital stability of black circles. Black solitons. Without well-posness results, these are just energetic stability results. So, this brings us to the end of the talk on dark solitons, with the two results that linearization consists of only isolated eigenvalues, quite a remarkable property, and again there is energetic stability result, and the road is completely open with respect to time valuation. Thank you very much for your time. Dimitri, what about the asymptotic stability? Have you any idea? I don't think that it will be possible because the spectrum is still discrete. It's like behavior of a bright or dark solitude in a harmonic tract which breaks and changes spectrum and places spectrum. I don't think that asymptotic stability. Even if well paused would be completed, the first question is, of course, well poursness, but even if well pausedness would be completed, asymptotic stability I believe are impossible in the case when the spectrum of linearization is purely discrete. Because it will be just a superposition formula and the initial data will just superimpose through the modes which are all fully localized. The second question is. The second question is uh you confirm then that uh you were not able to get explicit expression for the dark uh soliton for this uh OD. This is true? Yeah, yes, absolutely, absolutely. So for standing wave solutions here for the time independent part, I mean here, time independent part, it comes immediately from a balance of two. From a balance of two terms. But if you think about Travian wave solutions, then this gives us the first derivative term. And it is integrable ODE, but the best you can do is to use implicit formulations like I was doing it for bright soil. So you can prove existence of the dark soil and you can prove the properties. So one of the interesting properties that in the quiet focusing case there is a sum speed, cutoff speed, such that the dark solitons only exist from The duck solitons only exist from zero speed to the cutoff speed, and here there is no cutoff speed. So, for any speed, there is a unique dark solitons in the set of these patches below below the unit intensity. But they are not available in analytical form, but nevertheless, properties of this pins are well studied, and they were studied in our paper. Thank you. Your result about the spectrum when you consider the the back solids you said that you consider also the case of not set magnetobreakers and in that case you also have that very the spectrum is purely discrete. And for the proof, do you have any further difficulties compared to the self-adjoint? This compared to the set of joint case because usually, I mean, in the non-set adjoint case, you don't have the spectral theory in the variational characterization of the spectral, so it might be more tricky. Yes, of course, of course. This is much more tricky. So, for the self-adjoint case, so when we just look at the spectrum of these operators with respect to this exponential decay, that's a problem with the squared potential, which has been solved in Morse and Fairburg and methods of theoretical physics for a hundred and fifty years. Physics for 150 years, so one can just use the very explicit solutions to get these very explicit formulas which shows where the eigenvalues are. But for this non-self-adjoint problem, it is impossible to do so. Then one can have one has when you're working with resolvent operators with some paths that speed in different parts and proving this by many iterations. So it's quite a long proof. And we have no locations of the idea, it's just you know the interviews in the public, very nice indeed.
