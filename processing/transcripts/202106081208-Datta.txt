Elasticity numbers are very high, purely elastic turbulence in 3D porous media. And I just want to mention a quote from someone earlier today. So Ian asked this question after Arezu's talk, and I thought it was a perfect segue to what I'll tell you about today. Ian said, I see a lot of great work at the core level. How feasible is it to eventually upscale these approaches? Feasible is it to eventually upscale these approaches to the Darcy flow level, flow scale? And that's essentially the motivation for the work that I'll tell you about today. And so, today I'll tell you about how using experiments and mathematical modeling, we've tried to actually connect elastic turbulence at the Poor scale to the macroscopic features of transport of polymer solutions at the Darcy scale. And so, first, I want to highlight the incredible graduate student who has led all of this work, Chris. Who has led all of this work, Chris Brown, in my lab? We have an earlier paper that we published in JFM last year on biostability that Erizu actually explained beautifully, so I won't mention that today. Today, I'll describe some of our more recent work studying flow of polymer solutions in full 3D porous media. And this is something that we put on the archive a few months back. And I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Please check it out if you're interested. And of course, Check it out if you're interested. And of course, we benefit tremendously from interactions with our colleagues both here at Princeton and elsewhere, some of whom are listed here. And I look forward to interacting with many more of you in the future. And so I don't think I need to convince you all that studying how polymers flow through porous media is an important problem. It's both fundamentally very interesting, but also it's important in many engineering applications. Polymers are used in oil and gas recovery. A related problem arises in groundwater. A related problem arises in groundwater remediation for formulations used to remove contaminants from porous underground aquifers. Polymer flows arise in filtration and chromatography and other separation techniques and in additive manufacturing. And in all of these cases, we want to be able to understand how polymer solutions flow through tortuous porous media, what the typical pressures and flow rates are, and all of these very basic questions. And so our starting point. So, our starting point actually is this puzzle that's been around for over 50 years, right? And this is a puzzle that we've sought to address in this world. And to our knowledge, the first incidence of this puzzle was published by Marshall and Metzner at Delaware in the 60s, and then followed up by Chavateau later on in the 70s and 80s, where the idea is very simple. You take a solution of high molecular weight, flexible polymers, typically add Polymers, typically at or below C star, the overlap concentration, and these are typically shear thinning. So, if you just measure the shear viscosity that's shown here by the open symbols as a function of shear rate, then it goes down as you increase shear rate, right? These are different concentrations of the same polymer that we're going to use in our experiments. But the puzzle is that when you then take the exact same polymer solution, inject it in a porous medium, measure the pressure. Porous medium, measure the pressure drop across that porous medium, and just use Darcy's law to infer what the apparent viscosity of that solution is. It turns out, so that's shown by the solid symbols here, it turns out that above a critical flow rate, which corresponds to a given shear rate, that anomalously increases, right? The macroscopic flow resistance anomalously increases only when these polymer solutions are injected in porous media, right? So, here's an example right here. Media, right? So here's an example right here. Here's another example right here. And the question is why, right? That's the basic question that we've been trying to answer in our work. And so several different mechanisms have been speculated over the years, right? As the polymers go through these converging pores, pore constrictions, right, they can get extended. So maybe extensional viscosity plays a role. People have speculated that as you extend these polymers, they can absorb to the salt surfaces and clog up the porous. Surfaces and clog up the porous medium. And then, more recently, people have speculated: well, we know that elastic polymers can generate purely elastic instabilities. We've heard some mention of that already, which can give rise to chaotic flow dynamics and what's known as elastic turbulence, right? And so, people have speculated this and investigated this in various simplified geometries. But then, more recently, it's been speculated: well, maybe this isn't. Well, maybe this isn't the case in porous media. So, Jeff Guasta's group very recently did these beautiful experiments where they just injected polymer solutions into two-dimensional micromodels made of these cylinders, obstacle cylinders arranged in a given array. When they're ordered, you see that they generate these elastic instabilities, but they showed that as you introduce disorder into this arrangement, right, and disorder is inherent in all of these natural. Disorder is inherent in all of these natural porous media that actually suppresses the onset of this elastic instability and elastic turbulence. So they suggested that disorder suppresses elastic turbulence. And so maybe this isn't the case in real 3D disordered porous media. But then even more recently, Simon Howard and Amy Shen just put this beautiful paper on the archive just a few days ago, where they showed that actually this is sensitive to how these cylinders are ordered, right? Cylinders are ordered, right? Depending on how you initially order them, in some cases, actually introducing disorder promotes the onset of elastic instability. So it's a really confusing picture. And maybe indeed it is the case that elastic turbulence arises in disordered porous media, right? And that in turn gives rise to this anomalous increase in the macroscopic flow resistance. So the question is: is this the case? And so I'll just jump to the punchline of our work by directly visualizing the flow. By directly visualizing the flow in 3D porous media, which are disordered, we have found that elastic turbulence arises in these porous media, and we've shown that the anomalous increase in the macroscopic flow resistance, at least in part, reflects the dissipation arising from the chaotic flow fluctuations that arise in elastic turbulence. And so, what I would like to leave you all with at the end of the day is that, you know, we have experimental data, we have some mathematical modeling. We have some mathematical modeling that indicates these two punchlines. But at the end of the day, our results motivate new studies, particularly computational and mathematical studies, of how fluid rheology and flow fluctuations and boundary conditions all play a role in determining the flow resistance and the features of this flow. And so, how do we do these experiments? We make our own model transparent 3D porous media. So, the idea is very simple. So, the idea is very simple. We use this a lot in my lab. We take borosilicate glass beads, all of which have the same mean size, some polydispersity, so they're disordered, pack them together into a quartz capillary, and sinter them so that it's rigid, they don't rearrange, right? And our porous media are typically tens of beads across and hundreds of beads long, right? So these are macroscopic porous media. And what we do, right, these are still opaque. If you look down at one of these, it's completely opaque. These, it's completely opaque. But what we do is we formulate refractive index matched polymer solutions, right? And so when we infiltrate the pore space, everything becomes transparent, right? You no longer have light scattering off the interfaces. And then we can see the solution with fluorescent tracer particles and use particle image villasimetry to map out the flow behavior inside the 3D porous medium. So I promise you, the porous medium is still there. You can just see through it because now we've infiltrated with this refractive index match solution. Active index match solution. Simultaneously, right, so not only can we image what's going on inside the pore space, here, for example, we're using confocal microscopy to section through the porous medium. And you can see the black circles here are the glass speeds making up the solid matrix. The bright regions are the pore space. We can map this out. We can put these together, map out the 3D geometry of the porous medium. So here's a small view of that, but we can also measure the overall. can also measure the overall pressure drop across the entire porous medium and thereby determine the macroscopic flow resistance. And so what's a polymer solution that we use? We use the same polymer solution that people use in applications. We use high molecular weight partially hydrolyzed polycrylamide in a viscous background solvent, glycerol, water, and DMSO that matches the refractive index. And so this is a Boger fluid. The shear viscosity is essentially constant. Viscosity is essentially constant over the shear rate ranges that we test. We're operating at half of the overlap concentrations. So these are solutions. Our beta is 0.2 times the overall viscosity. Our Weisenberg numbers are between 1 and 6, right? And we can measure the first normal stress deference as well. And I should mention, we measure the solution rheology before and after the experiment. Before and after the experiments, and we don't see any change, right? We don't think that degradation plays an appreciable role in our experiments. And so, the first thing we can do, of course, is just inject one of these polymer solutions through, measure the pressure drop across the porous medium, and increase the flow rate and see how the pressure drop varies. So, this is the measured pressure drop divided by the overall length of the porous medium. So, this is the pressure gradient as a function of the characteristic interstitial shear rate defined by. Interstitial shear rate defined by the flow rate per unit cross-sectional area and this pore scale length scale given by the porosity and the permeability of the medium. So this is an effective shear rate at low flow rates or shear rates. This just agrees with Darcy's law given by the shear viscosity. But above a threshold value, we again see this anomalous increase in the macroscopic flow resistance. This is similar to what other people see in all of these previous experiments. But now we can actually Experiments. But now we can actually watch what's going on inside the porous medium as we do these measurements. So at low flow rates, right below this deviation from Darcy's law, we see that the flow is laminar, it's stable, it's unchanging in time. This is just an example pore that we've chosen basically. It looks like a cross-slot geometry. Above this deviation, we see that the flow becomes highly unstable. So here's a movie. Unstable. So here's a movie of that. You can see it fluctuates strongly both spatially and temporally. This is purely due to the elasticity of the polymers. All of our Reynolds numbers are much smaller than 10 to the minus 3. And so the question is, what happens at this intermediate point, right? Right when this pressure drop starts to deviate? And what we see there is that we see these bursts of instability. So what I'm showing you here is So, what I'm showing you here is a plot of the flow speeds in this pore, right? Or I should say the fluctuations in the flow speeds. So, we've subtracted off the laminar baseline over time. Purple is just a laminar baseline flow. Blue, green, yellow are increasingly unstable flow. And we see these bursts of instability and then it goes away, flows laminar, stable, bursts of instability again, right? So, we see these intermittent flow fluctuations. These intermittent flow fluctuations just at the onset of this deviation from Darcy's law. And then at higher flow rates, we see that the flow becomes highly unstable. So let me show you this, right? This is shown by the green and the yellow here. It's really strongly fluctuating both spatially and temporally. So here is a high resolution movie of that. This is one of these pores. We see coherent structures in this flow. So I hope this comes across in Zoom. Okay, this these black. This these black regions here are the beads surrounding this pore. So, this is a single pore, and you can see that the flow fluctuates very strongly. We see these coherent eddies that form, that dance around, and that die away, right? So, this is elastic turbulence, right? Here, again, is the same data, but now we've processed it using PIV. And you can see these beautiful swirls that form and move around and die away. And so, we can analyze. And so we can analyze the features of this flow. For example, we can just measure the power spectra of these fluctuations, both temporally and spatially. We see these characteristic power law decays, right? Characteristic of elastic turbulence. And I'd like to note that even though this is a highly fluctuating flow, 95% of the total power is in fluctuations that arise over time scales much longer than the Much longer than the Polymer relaxation time, right? So, this is a really slowly fluctuating flow field. And so, if we want to characterize this transition from stable flow to this intermittent fluctuations to this strongly fluctuating flow, how do we characterize this? Well, you know, as our order parameter to quantify this transition, we just measure the fraction of time that a given pore is unstable for. Pore is unstable for it, right? So if it's zero, that means it's completely stable laminar flow. If it's one, that means it's strongly fluctuating. It's always unstable. And then as our control parameter, we use the macroscopic Weisenberg number. So this is a Weisenberg number defined using the macroscopic control parameters, right? So we define it as the first normal stress difference divided by two times the shear stress, right? But these are evaluated. Right, but these are evaluated for a given flow rate, evaluated using the bulk shear rheology at that characteristic shear rate, right, corresponding to an imposed flow rate. And I just should point out that we can map this out inside the pore space itself because we have the flow field using PIV. And this characteristic macroscopic Weisenberg number is the upper limit of the distribution of poor-scale Weisenberg numbers that we measure. And so here are the data. Measure. And so here are the data. So, what we did is we took many different pores scattered randomly throughout the porous medium and just looked at each pore at low Weisenberg numbers. All the pores are stable, unchanging in time, right? So this fraction of time that it's unstable is zero. At a critical Weisenberg number, above a critical Weisenberg number, each pore increasingly becomes more and more unstable. It's unstable for longer and longer periods of time. Unstable for longer and longer periods of time until it's fully turbulent, right? And what's interesting is that the different pores have different critical Weisenberg numbers at which they become unstable. But when we rescale the data by the different critical Weisenberg numbers, they all seem to collapse, right? So all the pores seem to exhibit the same universal increase above this critical Weisenberg number. And so we can measure this distribution of critical. This distribution of critical Weisenberg numbers in the porous medium. And so, what's the consequence of this? The consequence of this is that at different flow rates, different fractions of pores are unstable, right? At low flow rates, these are just three examples, all three of these pores are stable. And then as we increase the flow rate, this one becomes unstable, but these two remain stable. And then this one becomes unstable. And in an even higher Weisenberg number, all of them become unstable, right? So we have patches. Right, so we have patches of unstable pores that coexist amidst a sea of stable pores, and in fact, we've zoomed out and we've tried to look at nearest neighbor correlations. And in fact, it seems that there aren't strong correlations between nearest neighbor pores, right? These are highly localized phenomena. And so DeGen, in describing the coil of a stretch transition, described it as molecular individualism. Different polymers become stretched out at different flow rates. Stretched out at different flow rates. Well, we call this porous individualism. Different pores in this porous medium become unstable at different flow rates. And so, going back to our original question, going back to Ian's question, how do we relate all these pore scale phenomena to what's going on at the macro scale, right? Ultimately, we want to explain this anomalous increase in the macroscopic fluoresistance. So, how do we do that? So, these are the pressure drop data that I showed you before. We can recast them as that. We can recast them as the apparent viscosity. This is what people typically do using Darcy's law, right? And again, at low Weisenberg numbers, it's just given by the sheer viscosity, but above a critical value, it anomalously increases and then actually seems to saturate. We want to explain this curve. And so motivated by what people do in inertial turbulence, we said, okay, we're just going to do a very simple steady state power balance. But in this case, of course, throwing away all the. But in this case, of course, throwing away all the inertial terms. And so we can balance the pressure work by the fluid and the viscous energy dissipation in the flow. And so by integrating over the overall volume and applying the divergence theorem, we can relate these two quantities. But of course, this quantity on the right-hand side that I'm showing you here is very difficult to evaluate because it depends on the full strain history of the flow in 3D. History of the flow in 3D. So, how do we deal with this? So, there are two experimental observations that motivated a simplification in our analysis. One, I already showed you that these fluctuations are very slow. And so we can assume that the flow is quasi-steady. But two, we can actually measure the Henke strain using the PIV in the different pores. And we find that the Henke strains are always much smaller than one. That is to say, they accumulated. That is to say, the accumulated strain, we think, is much less than one. And typically, you need hanky strains of three or larger for polymer extension to play a role in the overall dissipation. So, we think that local polymer extension drives the onset of this instability, but the accumulated extension is not a strong contributor to the global dissipation, right? And so, using these two experimental observations, we can simplify our analysis. Rob, I'm guessing. Analysis. Rob, I'm guessing. Okay, I'm going to finish up right here. And ultimately, we can come up with a very simple energy balance where we can relate the macroscopic pressure drop to your typical Darcy's law, which arises from the viscous dissipation of just the base laminar flow, with an additional component that reflects the viscous dissipation of these additional chaotic flow fluctuations. And we can directly measure that from our PIV. That from our PIV. We have the velocity field, we can measure the velocity fluctuations, the strain rate tensor, and directly compute this added viscous dissipation. And if what I'm telling you is correct, if this anomalous increase in the overall flow resistance indeed just reflects that added viscous dissipation generated by elastic turbulence, then this left side should be given by this right side. We know everything in. We know everything in this equation, so we can relate the two. And indeed, with no fitting parameters, this is what we get for the apparent viscosity from our pore-scale imaging. And it does a really nice job. And by the way, we've thrown out all the strain history effects. And so with that, I'm going to conclude and just point out that, look, this distribution of critical Weisenberg numbers is actually reflected here. The onset of this uptick is when the first cores become unstable. Is when the first pores become unstable, more and more pores become unstable until they're all unstable, and then this saturates out and continues to decrease. And strain history probably plays more of a role up here. And I won't go into details of this, but just putting in some numbers, this effect actually, we think, plays a role in the field using characteristic length and time scales and flow speeds. And so with that, I'm just going to conclude by saying that what we found using our experimental visualization is that Experimental visualization is that elastic turbulence is sufficient to explain this anomalous increase in the macroscopic flow resistance. And we think we've shown how to relate the pore-scale features of these fluctuations to the macroscopic flow behavior. But there are questions that I think will be best addressed by computation and mathematical analysis. What sets these critical Weisenberg numbers in different pore geometries? What determines this dissipation function that we This dissipation function that we just directly measured from the PIV? What's the influence of pore geometry and fluid rheology? These are all questions that I would like to pose to all of you. So, with that, this is my amazing lab who actually make this work happen. Thank you all for listening. I'd love to hear your questions. Thanks, Sujit. I think we've got time for one quick question from Marco Alero, if Marco's there. Yes, can you hear me? Yes, loud and clear. Okay, beautiful. So, thank you very much, Sujit, for the very, very nice. For the very, very nice talk. I think that this will stimulate plenty of questions, not one or two, I think, here. But I just want to know from you is so what happened when you see this drug or this enhancements or this increased resistance, what happened if you ramp up and down the flow rate? Do you have essentially reversible behavior? So you just go along the same pattern, or do you see? Pattern, or do you see some kind of deviation, hysteresis, or anything? That's a great question. So, Chris is actually here. Chris is doing those experiments right now. We're looking for hysteresis. That's something that we're currently doing. Oh, I see Chris is in the lab. So he's doing this as we speak. I don't have a good answer for you just yet, but that is something we're very interested in. In the experiment that I showed you, right, we sit at a flow rate and wait a long time and verify that it does approach some kind of. Approach some kind of dynamic steady state, but what happens when we go up and down? And is there hysteresis? That's what we're trying to look at right now. And the solid fraction play any role? I mean, the concentration? The volume fraction or the polymer concentration? Volume fraction, volume fraction of the solid phase of the... Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that essentially rescales the interstitial flow speed and that rescales the shear rate, right? So if you have more. So, if you have more solid, lower porosity, then for a given flow rate, the interstitial flow speed will be higher, right? The shear rate will be higher. And that's taken into account through our phi parameter. Okay, very, very, very nice talk. Thank you. Thank you. One quick question, Suji. You said it's saturated, but that was kind of based on just one point at the end. Have you got more data which kind of shows it saturates? Good question. Yes, we do have work data. In some cases, it saturates. Some cases it saturates, in some cases, it seems to not. And we think we understand what's going on there, but maybe in the interest of time, I'll just leave that as a tantalizing view towards the future. But we do have additional data where we've actually been mapping that out, and it seems quite interesting. Okay, we'll look forward to the follow-up talk at the next meeting then where you explain that. Thanks very much. That was a lovely talk. Thank you. And now we're going to move to Canada, Li Xi from McMaster University. From McMaster University. So we've had Fernando talking about polymers modifying inertial turbulence. Sujit just talked about elastic turbulence. And now we're going to have a couple of talks on
