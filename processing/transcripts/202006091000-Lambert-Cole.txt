So, right, so like I said in my abstract, I'd say about seven years ago, I was talking to Dave Gay. And so there are these things called symplectic four-manifolds. And there are these things called trisections of four-manifolds. Four manifolds, where I'm not going to define it right now, but you just cut something into three pieces, which is what trision means. So that's pretty obvious. And then this question was, what goes, what's the, how do you unify those? How do you see when a four-manifold emits a symplectic structure from a trisection? Or, you know, is there anything interesting you can say? And I thought about this really hard. And I thought about this really hard for a very long time. In fact, probably like years and years and years, and it's only now that I understand what you should look for to understand trisections of symplectic four-manifolds. And surprisingly, it came from looking at a different problem, which was trying to understand something that is well known from Gay's theory of four-manifolds, which is the adjunction inequality. Okay, so that's something. So, Matt talked about that yesterday in the relative case, but I'll just do something simple. So, when you have an omega, a symplectic structure, you get a second cohomology class, which is the first Chern class of the associated complex, almost complex structure, which I'm just going to say C1 of W. So, there's something living in H. W so there's something living in H2 and then if sigma is an embedded surface, then the simplest version of the adjunction inequality says that I take this first churn class, I pair it with the class of sigma, and I subtract off the The soft intersection of sigma that gives me an upper bound on the Euler characteristic of this surface. So you get an upper bound on the Euler characteristic or equivalently a lower bound on a genus. And then this is a key tool in solving the minimal genus problem. Solve the minimal genus problem. And so, an example of this is known as the Taub conjecture, which says that in CP2, if sigma, if the class of sigma is D times the generator, then the genus of sigma is at least one-half D minus one. is at least one half d minus one d minus two okay um and so this was proved by um krohnheimer and morovka uh using um uh signer-witten theory and there are some other gauge theory proofs and then uh two years ago i gave a proof using um trisections Trisections. And so the basic ideas there were to use trisections of a trisection of CP2, some new ideas introduced by called bridge trisections, some contact geometry, some covato homology. So it sort of put together a lot of different geometric ideas. And so let's say, sort of the L C and And then, what I thought about next was how can I generalize this to more interesting four manifolds? Whether you can cover something like the injunction inequality in more general four-manifolds using these ideas that I used to do the time conjecture in CP2. And the surprising fact is that actually, you know, when I started thinking through this problem, it actually worked out and gave me a character. It actually worked out and gave me a characterization of symplectic four-manifolds from the perspective of trisections. So, I want to talk about some of the geometric ideas and then say something about what you can prove using trisections and without gauge theory, just reducing down to something combinatorial like Kibano homology. Okay, so what's the idea? Well, I want to introduce something called. Well, I want to introduce something called a J-convex polytode. Okay. And this is supposed to be a suggestive terminology, and hopefully it gets at exactly what I'm trying to say. Well, let's say that the old and busted way of looking at symplectic format folds is you think about fillings and caps. is you think about fillings and caps. So you have some, you cut it into two pieces, you filling a cap, and this is sort of, this is called the convex side. And this is, you have a corresponding concave side, and you've cut your sympathy to four manifold into two pieces, and the boundary has some interesting sort of geometric structure, and what that means is that you have a contact. And what that means is that you have a contact structure on this. So convex means that you have some compatible contact structure, which is positive. And then on the concave, you have a negative contact structure that's compatible with the symplectic form, meaning that it dominates and it gives you an area form on those planes. So what I want to do now is I want to cut. What I want to do now is, I want to cut somebody take four manifolds into more pieces. Okay, so the new hotness is we're going to cut something into three pieces, you know, into multiple pieces. There are, instead of having a filling and a cap, like a convex and a concave piece. Like a convex and a concave piece. Now, what I'm going to have is these things are going to be what I call J-convex polytopes. So, what's going on here is that instead of being convex or concave, these sides are going to be levy flat, which is a fancy way of saying that there's a natural taut foliation on that. On that three-dimensional piece as the boundary that's compatible with the symplectic structure. So I have these flat pieces, and then they're going to meet at a convex angle. Okay. And that's something you can define intrinsically. It doesn't necessarily depend on the metric, but the basic idea of a J-convex polytope is I'm going to have something that has flat sides, meaning a convex. Has flat sides meeting at convex angles, which is exactly what you think of as a polytopen affine space. So I want to have a different sort of geometric boundary condition on these symplectic pieces. And when I start thinking about the boundary in this way, as opposed to convex and concave, then I can actually start gluing more pieces together than just by filling in a cap. I can take three pieces together. I could take as many as you want. I mean, there's something arbitrary about trying. Something arbitrary about trisecting a four-manifold. You could do lots of, you could cut it into many more pieces. But the essential idea is that you want to think about these things as convex, or J-convex polytopes, because you can glue along these flat sides. So the sort of, in order to glue something convex to concave, one has to be convex, one has to be concave. But when you have two flat sides, you can just glue them together. And in a same way, and then now you can start cutting things into more pieces than just two, which is about a billionaires. So I'm not necessarily going to define what this is, but these are, I mean, if you have some experience with fillings and caps, you can work out almost immediately what the definition should be. But there are some basic examples of these things that should be familiar. Of these things that should be familiar. The first is let's take the bidisc D cross D. So sitting inside CP2, oh sorry, sitting inside C2. So let's think of this as a I like to draw this on a axis here. So this is like So, this is like the Z1 axis, this is the Z2 axis, and you have the unit disk. And its boundary consists of two solid tori. Okay, so these are the two boundary components. And you can see that one of those boundary components just looks like the solid torus, and there's an obvious top foliation on the And there's an obvious top foliation on the solid torus, which is just the foliation like discs. Okay. And then they meet at this convex angle here, which is the neighborhood of that two-taurus. And it's a J-convex polytope in the sense that, like, sorry, these flat sides and you needed a convex angle. And you can smooth it in a natural way to get a contact structure. Contact structure. And then this smooth to B4 with the standard contact structure on the boundary. Okay, so this is sort of like, yeah, I have this, the boundary conditions are, I have this piecewise foliation on the boundary, and then when I, if I smooth off that corner, I could smooth everything out and get a positive contact structure on that boundary. On that boundary. A second example is let's say I have a Lefschetz vibration over the disc. I have some so let's say Lev Shetz vibration. Over D2, let's call this X. So I have a disk, and I have over a regular point of this disk, you know, I just have some surface with boundary, and then over these singular fibers, it collapses to a vanishing cycle, and I have some monodrome around that vanishing cycle. Well, the boundary of X consists of two pieces: there's the horizontal part and the vertical part. So the horizontal part Which is, you know, what comes across here is just going to be S1 cross D2. So it's a solid torus because it's just my disk cross. Oh, I guess like copies of, which might have several components. But basically, it's just that disk, which is my base of my left X vibration, times the boundary of that surface, which is my. Boundary of that surface, which is my fiber. Okay, and again, this has that same obvious taut foliation, which is the foliation by discs on a solent torus. And then the vertical piece of the boundary is that what that's what comes out along the boundary here. That's just a vibration over S1. Okay, so I, you know, the base is the boundary of this disc, and I have a vibration over the boundary of this S1. Vibration over the boundary of this S1. And so these are two both taut foliations of three manifolds with torus boundary. Okay, and then when I smooth, you get the open book decomposition for a contact structure. I guess what I should say is this. I guess what I should say is this structure that I described, the sort of boundary, is the open book decomposition. And then, once you smooth, you would have a natural contact structure on the boundary, which is supported by this open book, which is given by these two pieces. You have the binding part and the vibration over the complement. And when you can think of those as meeting at some corner in this Lefschetz vibration picture, and then when I smooth everything out, I'll get that contact structure. And if these are And you know, if these are, if all of my monodromies are right-handed dane twists, then this has a stein structure, so it's the eclectic structure on the interior. So, this is an example of something that I would call a J-convex polytope. So, these are not sort of, you know, they're sort of, this is a generalization of things that people are well familiar with. And I just want to put it into this idea. I want you to think about like this as something that I want to call a J-convex polytope. That I want to call a J-convex polytope. So, sort of flat side, so side with these top polyations, and then we meet at angles, and then when you smooth, there's some natural contact structure on the boundary. And I'm not necessarily going to talk about it in this talk, so I only have 15 minutes, but I came up with this term. I came up with this term and I called them grafted contact structures, which is the sort of actually induced contact structure on the boundary of a J-convex polytope. Okay. And so, I mean, in the first, in example one, that was this, ended up being the standard type contact structure on S3. In this case, it's the contact structure supported by the open book. And the so where does this, what does the term grafting come from? Well, you know, in horticulture, what you can do is you can graft two types of trees together. is you can graft two types of trees together. So you're going to have one type of tree which is, you know, if you want to grow apples, what you're going to do is you can have some piece, which is the rootstock, which is really the base of this tree. And then you graft in some above-ground piece. And so you can join two different species of trees together to get one tree where the Where, you know, the, you know, and they glued it, they sort of how like the two trees, you know, you cut a little piece off, cut us on the bunch off, then they grow together, like graft together in that way. And the basic idea is that the reason I think about this is that I'm going to have, so that the way that you get this contact structure is you think of perturbing the top foliation. To a contact structure, and then step two, you graph them together, which is that there's a way of merging these two contact structures together to form one continuous contact structure over the whole of that formula. And the basic idea here is that you're going to have these contact structures on the boundary that are meeting at, because you have this angle, the contact planes are going to meet at right angles. And you kind of interpolate between the contact planes on one, you know, the contact planes on one foliation are almost tangent to that foliation when I perturb it to a contact structure. On the other one, the contact planes are tangent to that foliation. They're going to meet at angles in the right way. And you just interpolate between those two. Then you just interpolate between those two, which is essentially the standard way that you construct a contact structure from an open book decomposition. But the idea is that you want to sort of take, yeah, you want to take these pieces and you want to graph them together to get one context structure over the whole of that thing. So I mean, I wrote this down in somehow coordinates. I can send it to people after the talk. But it's a sort of very simple idea that generalizes the way. Very simple idea that generalizes the way that you construct the Thurston Winkle Camper construction of contact structures from open book decompositions. Okay, so all right, so let's do an example. So let's go back to the adjunction inequality, and I want to talk about the trisection of CP2. So, the standard picture for this is the two simplex. And there's a, so you get this from a moment map. And the basic idea is that each piece is one of these bi-discs. Let's call this Z1, Z2, and Z3. Okay, and so this. Okay, and so this is some, there's some way of obtaining the trisection of CP2. And so what you do is you cut it into sort of this is cut into three fours. And depending on how, which one you choose is first, second, and third, it becomes the zero, two, and four handle of the four mantle. So we could call this the zero handle, this is the two handle, and this is the handle handle. And this is the forehandle of CP2. Okay, so that's the topology, the handle decomposition of CP2. And smoothly, what the trisection does is it sets all those three handles on the same setting, which is just like the way in which you have three affine charts on CP2. And, you know, depending on which one you call first, second, and third, tells you which one is the zero handle, the two handle, and the four handle. But what I have is geometrically, I've cut it into three boxes. Into three bi-discs, which are these J-convex polytopes. And then when you glue them together in this way, what you get is a closed symplectic four-manifold. So this is the trisect of CP2. And so let's go back to the Tom conjecture. So let's so let's see, let me let me draw this a little bigger. Okay, so let's take sigma as my embedded surface. Okay. Then what you want to do is you have this surface sitting inside this CP2 here. Okay. And you move it into put into some fancy work, some sort of there's some geometric condition. There's some geometric conditions you need, but something called bridge position. Like, I won't get into the technicalities about what you actually need in terms of the type of geometric bridge position, but you put it into this sort of nice position with respect to this trisection. And what you want is that I want, so I have these grafted contact structures on the boundaries here. So I have these three contact structures that are the boundaries. That are the boundaries of the smooth sectors of my trisection. Okay, so these are the grafted contact structures. So, and then you want it such that sigma intersects, let's call this. So these are, let's call these sectors z, and this we'll call this y lambda with a contact structure. So you want that it intersects this contact structure in a transverse link. Okay, uh L Landa. Okay, I'll add that. All right, so I have these transverse links. And then the idea is that you look at the self-linking numbers of all these things. So they're trained links, they sit in the contact structure. They're non-homologous, they have a self-linking number, and the sum. And the sum of the self-linking numbers of L lambda is related to D, which is the degree of C. All right. And then what you, and then the last piece, which I have to move right over here. Move right over here, which is that use and see the bottom of your screen. Oh, I see. Okay. Degree sigma. Oh, yeah. Okay. And then you use the slice behind inequality. To relate the Euler characteristic of this surface to the degree of sigma. So there's a relationship between the self-linking number of this link and some surface it bounds. And what you can do is you get this, you use these self-linking numbers to bound the pieces of the surface in each sector. So you get some relationship between the topology, you know, using this contact geometry, you get a relationship. Using this contact geometry, you get a relationship between the links, which are the boundaries of the piece of the surface in each sector, and then you can relate the Euler characteristic of the total surface to the degree using these self-working numbers. This is not going to tell you anything if you don't already know how this works, but the basic idea is that you're going to use some, you're going to sort of use the geometry and this genus bound that comes from contact geometry to bound the genus of this surface in some way. Genius of this surface in some I'm sorry, I have a question. Yeah. At least in my mind, the slice Bentkin inequality is a generalization of the term conjecture. I mean, what I would do to prove it, I would do surgery and embed interest manifold and use the junction inequality in separate witness. I mean, what I would do what Gordon and Paulo Lisca did. So it's, isn't that? So, it's isn't that a circular argument then? Well, so the slice-Bedekin inequality is equivalent to the local Tom conjecture, which is on the slice genus of Taurus knots. And you can prove that using Covano homology. So, yeah, so they're related. And one way of interpreting what I did is that you're actually going to use, you're going to go to Going to use, you're going to go the opposite direction, use the slice-Pennekin inequality, which you can prove using Cobano homology to prove the adjunction inequality. So that's, yeah. Thank you. Yeah. So yeah, so they're all the same ideas and they're all essentially the same. They're all essentially the same. But the key thing is that you're going to use a slife bound in a four-ball. A slice bound in a four-ball in order to get a genus bound in a closed four-manifold, a closed surface in a closed four-manifold. Okay. So now what's the next step? So then I started trying to think about how do I generalize this to try and get genus bound to recover the adjunction inequality more interesting for manifolds. So, the idea is that we're going to think about something called a Weinstein trisection. And what this means is that I have a trisection of this four-manifold, and each piece. And each piece has a Weinstein structure. So Z1. So there's a Weinstein structure that consists of a four-manifold boundary, a symplectic structure, a Liouville vector field, and a Morse function. So this is And this is Morse. And so these are so what I have is this is a Weinstein structure. And so on each sector, I have some vector field that's pointing outward along the boundary. Okay. And each of these pieces has some Weinstein structure. And so this is a different way of talking about the J-convex polytope condition. You know, sort of a different way of stating this, which is that if I thought about this as this is somehow a smooth version. somehow a smooth version of cutting into J convex polytopes. And so you have some sort of nice, you have some sort of structure on this symplectic form handle that comes in by cutting into three pieces and And the theorem, which is due to myself, Jeff Meyer, and Laura Starkson is that every X omega admits a line seems to be. Edmits a Weinstein trisection. And the proof is just that you start with, so there's a branch covering map from your synflexic 4 manifold to CP2 by RU, and then there's another result with Result with Katsukov. But you take this branch covering from X to CP2 and you just pull back that standard, all the geometry from the trisection of CP2. You pull it back via this branch covering to your symplectic four manifold X. And this requires you. And this requires you to putting the branch locus in some nice position with respect to the trisection. And so the work of that paper is just showing how that, you know, you put everything in, you have to put everything in the right position. And then when you pull back, you get everything that you expect. But this is sort of a general result for all Weinstein trisections and for all simple I take four manifolds. And uh, okay. So, for as an example, um there's a branch cover from S2 cross s2 to CP2 over the quadric curve, let's call it C lowercase two, spinning inside CP2. All right, and so what you get is All right, and so what you get in this pulls back to a genus 2 trision. So that means that I have I've cut it into three pieces. And there's this sort of this central piece here has some genus, which is Which is a genus II surface. And the way this branch covering works is that I get some taut foliation on this piece here. So downstairs, I had this solid torus on that sector with this top foliation. And the branch locus is some arc that looks like this. Okay, and it pulls back to a solid halo body of genus 2. Here's the branch locus. Actually, let me do this on. And my top foliation with solitaurus pulls back to something I'll call a top foliation. Something I'll call a tot foliation in the same way. So I have a two-to-one branch covering map like this over that sector when I do this branch covering. And it's taught in the sense that meaning that there exists some closed games. Some closed gamma transverse to all leaves. All right, and then you have some issue with these hyperbolic points on the boundary. But this structure, everything, once you sort of set it up nicely with respect to the trisections, you get some taut foliation on this piece. And then the grafted contact structures pull back to grafted contact structures. Structures pull back to grafted contact structures. So I have these contact structures again on these pieces. And so you can repeat this argument. You can repeat a lot of the arguments for the adjunction inequality. So, right, so in this case, you're going to have you're going to have let's see I think I've probably gotten very gotten very confusing but let me let me say what I can prove so uh you know um So if x omega admits a G0 Weinstein trisection, there is a cone C sitting inside H two of X. H2 of X such that for all sigma sitting inside, so if you have some surface that sits inside this cone H2, then you satisfy the adjunction inequality. So, what does this mean? So, so let's see. So, G0 Einstein. So, G0 means that the genus of this trisection is equal to. The genus of this trisection equal to the second Betty number of x, and pi one of x is zero. So in the case where you have some simply connected four-manifold that has a trisect decomposition with respect to such that the genus is the same as the second Betty number, then I can prove this version of the adjunction inequality for symplectic four-manifolds. And this is not. There are lots of manifolds, four manifolds that admit this. So complete intersections in CPN admit G0 line scene trisections. So, there's a lot of surfaces that emit this. So, in particular, S2 cross S2 is a, well, it's just a hypersurface in C3, CP3, K3 as well. And so that's what, so there are lots of manifolds that emit these types of trisections. What does that comb condition mean? Well, it means that, so if I think about S2 cross S2, Cross S2. That's z squared, which I can think of as living on some plane. This is, I think, this is z squared. And my cone condition is that, so this is, so it's generated by two classes, let's say A and B. So I have the A axis and the B axis. That cone is just going to be something like that, sitting inside H2. So basically, everything where I have these two spheres that generate my second homology, as long as I say have both of them are non-negative, then I can prove some adjunctions. Are non-negative, then I can prove some adjunction inequality. And the reason for this is that there are these issues with like B2 plus is one or B2 plus is greater than one that you have on applying the adjunction inequality that affects when you're going to expect to get something like this in this form. So you can only really expect something of this form to prove an adjunction inequality. But you can sort of see in the case. But you can sort of see in the case of S2 cross S2 that this cone isn't very restrictive condition. I can just do diffeomorphisms to change orientations on things, and I can sort of get this adjunction inequality for the whole four-manifold because I have some obvious diffeomorphisms. Okay, so what can you, so what are some results you can prove with this? Okay. So uh so results so these are all results. So you can prove one of these sort of this let's call this a week a weak version of the 11 A, which is that 11 ace, which is that K3 has no S2 cross S2 suband. Okay, and the way that you prove that is that sort of proof is that has no, you know, no plus zero spheres. So the rejection inequality. So the ejection inequality tells you, relates the self-intersection number to the Euler characteristic. And so you can use the ejection inequality to check that there's no sphere with trivial normal bundle, so you can't have an S2 cross S2 sound. So this is one of these Donaldson results from the 80s. That's sort of, you know, that one of the first big applications of gauge theory. And you can prove this without using gauge theory. You're just, everything's being reduced down to essentially. Everything's being reduced down to essentially Kabana homology in a four-ball. The second one is that you can detect exotic smooth structures on closed formula folds. And the way that you prove that is that there are no plus one spheres using the adjunction inequality. So yeah, so these are kind of these two main applications of these techniques because the injunction inequality in this case is strong enough to be able to understand K3. You have a lot of diffeomorphisms on K3 because of the Torelli theorem. K3 because of the Turelli theorem for K3 surfaces. And so, what you can do is you can rule out all of these spheres from living in these four manifolds of those particular classes, and that tells you that you're detecting an exotic symbol structure, and you're also detecting that there's no S2 cross-s2 suband. And again, this sort of the point is that no gauge theory theory Just slice genus. You just have to know something about the slice genus in B4 by the S invariant in Colano homology. Okay. Um Um all right, so uh all right, so then going forward future, okay. Um, one question I have is uh Have is trying to understand minimal genus in connected sums. Okay, so for an example, I don't actually know what's known about this problem. So let's take CP2 connect sum CP2. All right, so this does not have a symplectic. So, this does not have a symplectic structure. It doesn't even have an almost complex structure. And some things are known about the minimal genus problem in this four-manifold, and some things aren't. So, my question is, if let's say we have, so we have a bi-degree surface, so we have the second homolog. The second homology has a generator from each copy of CP2, so we can talk about the bi-degree of some surface. Does it satisfy something like the Tom conjecture? The answer is no. In general, you can have, so there's a sphere in the class 3, 0. But what I don't know is whether there's any surface that would violate this inequality. If both degrees are strictly positive. So, if someone knows the answer to that, in fact, there are lots of examples that I know, or more than one example I know of, where one of the factors is zero. And this has to do with slice genus in CP2 and CP2R. But I don't know, actually, know what. But I don't know actually know what you can say about that. And then my second question is: again, another version of the weak 11 ACE conjecture. If I take a bunch of copies of K3, can I split off an S2 cross S2? Split off and S2 cross S2 summer end. So again, what you would try and do is like, oh, sorry, let me go back. So the reason why this is interesting is because all these questions are being reduced to understanding sliced genus in a four-ball. You're not looking at any sort of global analysis. So all these cyber-Witten invariants, any sort of gauge theory that vanishes once you start taking connected sums of things, you're not trying to bound the gene. You're not trying to bound the genus from that perspective. You're just reducing everything to some geometry and some slice genus in a four-ball. So it's possible that you could be able to get some genus bounds in cases where you don't have genus bounds from gauge theory. So, all right, so that, you know, I have three minutes left. That's basically the end of what I prepared. That's basically the end of what I've prepared. So I will stop there. All right, let's unmute and applaud. Are there any questions for Peter? Yeah. So basically based on the last question, do you have any initial insight about what happened? Initial insight about what happens to the cones under connected thumb, or any sort of initial thought? Well, I mean, well, you first have to, I mean, well, you first have to be able to just like prove an adjunction inequality in that case. I don't even know how to do that. I mean, I knew that in the like the case of just CB2, you have to assume that the degree is positive. So I thought a little bit about this. I thought a little bit about this. It would make sense if you had to have both degrees positive. But I just, I'm not sure I understand that case enough. I mean, this sort of like still remains something that is beyond my knowledge of whether you could actually do this technically. But, you know, my hope is that by doing things without case three, you can get to some cases where you might vanish. I mean, I still don't, I don't actually have a good comprehensive view of what is known about the. Comprehensive view of what is known about the minimal genus problem in CP2 connects on CP2. I know that there are some examples where one of the degrees is zero. This has to do with like the right or left-handed trefoil is sliced in CP2 or CP2 bar. Anyway, there's some sort of like, there's some tricks where you can get some torus knots that you can, you know, like their sliciness is one less than. Their slicing is one less than what it would be in the four wall. But, and then you can kind of make some more examples of this. But I need someone, like, maybe someone can, who knows this, can tell me what is known. So, Peter, do you have any idea about how to approach these questions? I mean, since you're not going to be able to get those whatever Weinstein kind of trisections. Kind of trisections. Well, so you, yeah, so everything actually just comes down to knowing what's going on in these three contact structures. So if you right, so like I'm not actually using any of the four-dimensional symplectic geometry to do this adjunction stuff. You're just everything is working in these contact junctions. So if you kind of, you know, if you sort of, if you can. Of, if you construct the context structures yourself without thinking of them as coming from some symplectic structure, then you can start trying to run the same arguments, I think. So you don't, it's just sort of a problem I haven't had time to really think about in detail, but I mean, that's one of the hopes that I'd like to pursue. But the existence of this kind of decomposition doesn't give you a symplectic structure. Decomposition doesn't give you a symplectic structure typically. I mean, like, could it be the case that the symplectic structure is an obstruction? It's not the case, you're saying that it's that the symplectic structure is an obstruction to this type of decomposition? Well, I mean, so like, I guess I sort of think that, like, well, what do I want to say? I mean, What do I want to say? I mean, I don't actually know how you would actually prove an adjunction inequality in some connected sum, but the sort of if you sort of, instead of assuming that these contact structures come from global symplectic form, and you kind of like construct them in, you construct them on your own in the standard way without expecting them to glue together to get a symplectic structure. Maybe you could run some of the same arguments. That doesn't answer your question, but I. Yeah, my question was really just whether or not you had examples in mind where you had this type, where you could actually, you know, maybe produce such a structure, but you knew that it didn't have a symplectic structure. Okay, yeah, so once you start, well, so the key thing is that when I get these graphic contact structures together, like these contact structures, one right here, what I don't know anything about is like conditions. What I don't know anything about is like conditions for when these are tight. So, in the case of the trisection, tight means is equivalent to being fillable in the appropriate way. So, tightness was the essential thing, but I don't know criteria on grafted contact structures for when you get tightness, which is another question. So, which would require me probably to write down a definition, which I can make available to people. But questions about when you start putting these topics You start putting these calculations together and they're tight, I know nothing about and is relevant to, like, and I just know that in the case of the trisection, if what you get is tight, then it's fillable and you get some global symplectic structure. Thanks. Are there other questions? All right, then let's thank Peter again. All right, then let's thank Pierre again.
