Today I talk about this capillary folding of thin elastic sheet. And this is a joint work with my PhD student, Zhu Xian Li. And actually, Zhu Xian was Qinghai's former master student. Now he's doing PhD with me. So let me first introduce the problem. The problem. So, here's the setup. We have a droplet. You look at this picture. We have a droplet which is placed on a thin elastic sheet. So the sheet has a finite size. So now there's interaction between the droplet and the solid, the sheet. And in particular, the fluid exerts forces. Forces, right, like the pressure and also the capillary force on the sheet. And that will result in a three-dimensional structure. For example, if initially the sheet is flat, then because of those forces, eventually the sheet can fold into a three-dimensional structure. And these are the experimental pictures from Pictures from experiments which I took from this paper. So, in this work, we studied the equilibrium configuration of this coupled liquid, solid system. Okay, so this is not, there's no fluid dynamics, which is interesting, we just studied the steady state, the equilibrium configuration. Steady state, the equilibrium configuration of this coupled system. So we derive the governing equations from the energy, from variation of energy, and also because of this very complicated system, the equations are high order and also coupled nonlinear equations. It's quite challenging to solve those equations. To solve those equations directly, so we introduce relaxation dynamics to simulate the folding process. But this is a fake dynamics. This is a gradient flow. Again, there's no fluid dynamics. So of course, we are not the first to study this problem. There are some several earlier work, but most of these earlier work focus on the 2D system, which means the model. System, which means they model the sheet by a one-dimensional curve and also used some simplified models for the elastic energy. So that because of those simplification, they can only study the small deformation of the sheet. They cannot simulate the whole folded system. Okay, so here's how we how how we model the system. First, so here we have two surfaces, right? The first one is the sheet. Here we parametrize the sheet by the Q. So Q is a function, a vector function defined on this reference domain. The reference domain is, you can think of the reference domain as the undeformed sheet. It was denoted by here sigma zero. So this is the Here, sigma zero. So, this is an undeformed sheet, and this is a deformed sheet. So, Q is a map from this reference domain to the current physical domain. And so this is for the sheet. Then for the this is a droplet. The droplet surface is modeled, is puncturized by R, okay, and the drop surface denoted by gamma. Here's the total energy of the system. So, the total energy contains Total energy contains actually two parts. So, this part is the interfacial energies. This is the interfacial energy on the drop surface, and this is the interfacial energy at the sheet interface, sheet fluid interface. And this part is the elastic energy of the sheet. And this elastic energy, again, it contains the stretch energy. The stretch energy, this one, and the bending energy. So, here, A, this is a fourth-order tensor. It's the elastic tensor. U is a Poisson ratio, and sigma is the stretching strain, and B, this is the stretching strain, and A and B are the first and the second fundamental forms for the sheet. For the sheet. So then to derive the equilibrium equations for the system, we minimize the total energy with respect to Q, the sheet, and R, the drop surface, together with these conditions. So this condition says that the contour line, the contour line is. line the contour line is pinned the contour line is the right is a boundary right the boundary uh where the uh the the fluid surface meets with the solid and here we assume the the contour line is pinned at the boundary of the sheet so uh at equilibrium we don't have the young's equation the young equation does not in general does not hold okay uh the counter angle can take The counter angle can take arbitrary values depending on the volume of the droplet. And this one is the constant volume constraint. We assume there's no change in the volume of the droplet. Then we minimize the total energy subject to these two conditions, then we can derive these governing equations. Yeah, so this one is familiar. So this one is familiar, the Young-Laplace equation for the drop at the surface. And here, this is the H is the mean curvature of the surface. It's the jump of the pressure across the drop surface. Then the sheet satisfies these equations. So this is here we have actually three equations. This one is a four. This one is a force balance in the normal direction to the sheet. And this equation is the force balance in the tangential direction, okay, to the sheet. Here M is the M is the elastic moment and S is the elastic what's it? Moment. What's it? Moment, elastic stress. S is elastic stress. M is elastic moment. And again, this is the mean curvature of the sheet, and this is the pressure jump inside and outside as a fluid. Okay, so here we have these tensors, B is the second fundamental form. Fundamental form of the sheet, and C is the third fundamental form of the sheet. So these are the equations for the Elastic sheet, and these are the conditions at the pin, the counter line. And the first one is the movement-free condition. Okay, the counter line of the movement is zero. And these two correspond to these two, these force balance, okay, the counter. These false balance okay, the content will also have false balances, and that given by these two equations. Okay, so now here you see that so these are these equations are quite complicated and the fourth order, the M involves a second derivative of the sheet. So these are fourth order PDE and the coupled, right? The coupled equations are highly non-linear, because these are highly nonlinear equations. These are highly non-linear equations. So, to solve these equations, we use this gradient flow. This is the gradient flow for the sheet. Here we assume the droplet is at a static, quadrastatic. Droplet is a quadraste. So the drop surface satisfies the Young Laplace equation. And this is the evolution of the gradient flow for the sheet. For the sheet. And right side are the forces. Right side for the gradient, the gradient force on the sheet. So then, and at any instant, at any time, we have the droplets satisfy this Young-Laplace equation. So here's a, I briefly go through the numerical. Go through the numerical method. So, in time, we use a semi-implicit oral method to discretize the gradient flow. And so, first we solve for the configuration of the sheet. So, then once we have the configuration of the sheet, we compute the sheet, we compute the droplet. Yeah, we compute, we solve the Young-Laplace equation for the droplet, for the drop surface with these conditions, with the constant volume constraint and this boundary condition. So then actually we so this is for the speech the temporal discretization. Now in space we discretize the sheet using The sheet using a subdivision element method. We use a fourth-order polynomials to discretize the sheet. Then to solve the Jan-Laplace equation, actually here we don't solve the Young-Laplace equation for the job surface directly. Instead, we minimize, we use this very small Original formulation to compute the constant curvature drop surface. So this functional is given, this is the method proposing this paper. So here the functional is given here. This is the squared area. carrier functional. Now the minimizer of this functional gives a constant mean curvature surface. And so this is for the constant volume constraint. For example, this integral gives the volume between between the sheet and the volume of the cone between the sheet and Between the sheet and the origin, okay, you connect the sheet with the origin, then the volume of this cone is given by this integral. And similarly, this one is the volume below the drop surface, including droplet and the cone. So, this is the drop volume. So, this is for the to impose a constraint. The reason we use this formulation is that Formulation is that first of all, the minimizer gives the constant mean curvature surface. And most importantly, the minimizer had this nice property. It's uniformly pressurized by R in the sense that the Jacobian is a constant. So that can, to a certain extent, it can preserve the quality of the mesh. So then we discretize the job surface using piecewise linear polynomials. Now this is the overall algorithm. First we at the M's time step we solve for given at the M time step for given sheet, the configuration of the sheet, we solve for the drop surface and we obtain Surface and obtain drop surface gamma m. Then we check the quality of the mesh for the drop surface. If the Jacobian for the drop surface belows below some threshold, then we We continue the calculation, otherwise, we do a rematching. Yeah, go do a rematching. So, now, okay, so this is since this workshop is on mesh generation, so I think I have to show a picture of mesh. This one, this shows, this is the mesh on the reference domain, and this is a mesh for the drop surface. So, here you see that this part and it's quite. see that this part and it's quite it's it's significantly deformed right it's the quality becomes bad and then we do a remeshing so this is the mesh after remeshing and this in this picture the corresponding axis is the time and these are the times which remeshing is is performed okay so here's the numerical I cannot But I cannot prove the order of the I cannot do numerical analysis for this numerical method. So here I just show some empirical test on the convergence and the order of convergence. So this is the convergence in time. So here we refine Refine the timestamp. Here we so this is for this system. The sheet is given by the triangular shape. Then the so the in time the convergence is first order and in space the convergence is about the second order now these pictures Now, these pictures show the total energy. So, this is the energy of the system again following the gradient flow. So, total energy decays and this is for refinement of time and this is for refinement of the spatial mesh. So, next, I present some numerical results and the result and compare a numeric result with some experimental result. And all the parameters are taken from this paper, including the thickness of the sheet, the size, person ratio, and so on. So we use all these physical parameters. First we consider a triangular sheet. We consider a triangular sheet. Now, these figures show the snapshots along the relaxation dynamics. So, this is the initial time, the initial configuration, this later time, this is at equilibrium. And these curves are the energy, the last one, no battery. Okay, so the last picture shows the black curve is the total energy, and the other curves are the different components of the energy, including the surface energy and the elastic energy. Yeah. Okay, so uh this one uh is uh the uh this one uh has a different uh a different uh sheet. Different sheet. The sheet is obtained by, so we have a box, a unit, unit, unit box, and then we cut the box, then extend it, right? So we have this sheet. Then you put a droplet on top of it, then eventually we get this picture. This is for a large droplet. If you have a smaller droplet, then eventually you can actually, if the droplet evaporates, eventually it can close. It can fall. It can form a closed box. Okay, now this one is a spherical encapitulation. Here we have a unit sphere, and then we cut it into how many six pieces and extend it. Then we put a droplet on it, and then due to the capillary force, eventually it can form a sphere. Now, here you can see actually the problem is not easy, right? It the problem is not easy, right? Because when you compute the job surface, it's highly irregular. The job surface, you have these right, these pieces is very irregular. So now we compare with the we compare with the experimental results again from this paper. We can actually obtain all the we can obtain all the configurations observed in the experiment. So this is for a triangular sheet. And these are different. So this is for square sheet. For square sheet, depending on the parameters, when the elastic elastic modulus or the and other parameters can take it can eventually form a different shapes. So we can obtain Ships. So we can obtain all these different shapes. Then this is for cubic and spherical encapsulation. Then they, okay. So those are actually in those simulations with the drop volume is fixed. So now we simulate the dynamic the relaxing the dynamics with Relaxing the dynamics with decreasing drop volume. So, this is not a real evaporation. Okay, we don't simulate the fluid dynamics, the evaporation process of the fluids. We just gradually decrease the drop volume. The volume decrease very slowly. So, at any given time, actually, we solve the system to Of the system to the quadostatic. Here we consider a triangular sheet, and these are the typical configurations at equilibrium. The first two have a two-fold symmetry, and the last one has a three-fold symmetry. Now, depending on the parameters, in particular, the banding modulus, after After the droplet is fully evaporated, then the sheet can be folded into different configurations. For example, this one is in this simulation, we use a large boundability. The sheet has a large boundability. Then we start, sorry, you cannot see. So the horizontal. So the horizontal axis is a volume. The vertical axis indicate the indicator the shape for the sheet. So when the droplet, sorry, it doesn't. Oh, yeah, you. Okay, this one we start. This one, we start with a large droplet. Then, initially, when the droplet is large, it has this threefold symmetric state that will gradually decrease, gradually decrease the volume of droplet. At a certain volume, it jumps to a different state, jump to this two-fold state. So, then when the droplet completely evaporated, eventually the sheet. Eventually, the sheet becomes flat. This is when the bandability is large, right? The sheet is very stiff. This is to be expected. Actually, there's another configuration, this two-fold symmetric state, but it's never realized during this dynamical process. Then this So this this one in this simulation we we use a very small okay abandonable abundability is small now when it's small so which means the sheet is very soft then initially again this is the volume and then when the volume is large it takes this configuration it's a threefold symmetric configuration Configuration, then when we decrease the volume, then it stays in this state. So when the droplet is completely fully evaporated, then it just is completely folded. You obtain a complete folded state. And these two states are not realized during this process. Now, for intermediate abundability, actually we obtained Actually, we obtained a different configuration. So, this is the initial, this is the wind drop volume is large, right? Which has a three full symmetry. Then, at a certain volume, and it jumps to this branch. Along this branch, the sheet has this two-fold symmetry and stay on this branch. On this branch until the droplet is completely evaporated. So you can see that by changing the bandability of the sheet, we can actually manipulate the system and obtain the different folded state. Okay, I don't want to go through the weighting process. So for process. So for so what I just presented is for a pinned counter line. The counter line is pinned as a boundary. But if you have a large sheet, then the droplet is relatively small, then you may have a moving content line, right? In that case, you have to solve You need to solve a model the fluid dynamics together with the moving counter line, then this problem becomes much more complicated. Then we have a model for this system, but we don't have a good numerical result yet. Maybe I skip this part. Okay, I go to the summary. So here we proposed the proposed a model which in this model actually we use the the full model for the elastic energy okay that's that that allows us to to model the a large deformation of the sheet and we derive the governing equations then we we we consider relaxation dynamics for the footing process okay so this is the for relaxation the gradient flow for the sheet Gradient flow for the sheet, and we develop a numerical result based on this final element methods. And these are the two references, two papers on this work presented here. Okay, yeah, thank you for listening.
