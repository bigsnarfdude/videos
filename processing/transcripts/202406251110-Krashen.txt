As I was saying, motivation. So there's two motivational questions. The first is somewhat related to what Max has been talking about, and that is how complicated are, let's say, Brower classes, or more generally, cohomology classes. Comology classes over some field. So this might be a question of like, what do we know about the index of such classes? So the kind of period index problem. And the idea is this should depend somehow on the arithmetic of f, but in what way? How do what can you? in what way? How can you move information from various arithmetic measures of complexity for F to information about the index of a Brouwer class or something like that? The second question is what I'll focus on for the most, for probably most of the talk, and that is, if you're given a, I don't know, loosely speaking, complexity constraint. So, that is like if I tell you I have a brower class and I know the index and I know the period. So, I've already said kind of how what the index is and how complicated that is. How easy is it to actually write it down? Is it to write the class in terms of, let's say, In terms of, let's say, simple or simpler objects or classes. Okay. So basically, I'm going to give some, you know, kind of partial results and some progress. But mostly, I want to kind of explore the depth of our ignorance about all this and kind of explain what we would want to know. What we would want to know. I probably won't get to, you know, so there was this, there's like this question which came up before of like, you know, is it better to focus on the kind of like substantial, you know, like proofs and actually give you some math, or should I more just give you some vague impression of things? We're kind of. Of things. We're kind of going to lean towards the vague impressions, unfortunately. I'm, I don't know, it is what it is, right? But, but, you know, so I'll just say that like, you know, if I were to like give you a bunch of proofs of some things, then what you might get out is like, if we knew about, if we knew more about certain of these techniques that we use, that would help us prove more results of these sorts. Of these sorts. So, like, I'll just say, like, I'll just put out there right now some things that we need. So, for the young people out there to go and develop things for us, you know. So, like, in order to get good information of this sort, things that go into it are things like essential dimension. Dimension are understanding generic splittings. Like, so generic splitting varieties, like norm varieties is kind of where created in the kind of block cado stuff. Chain lemmas. Chain lemmas basically say, like if you have a couple of very simple cohomology classes, symbols, and you know that there. Symbols, and you know that they're isomorphic. Can you explain why by a series of very simple kind of transitions from one symbol to the other? Cycles on homogeneous bases. So, I think the one thing that I might say a little bit about, we'll kind of you'll see a little bit of how this comes into one of these questions. And understanding maps between classifying spaces for linear algebraic groups. Okay, so I might, some of these things might come up in more detail, but just to have in the back of your mind, these are kind of like the actual ingredients. So I think, you know, in some So, I think, you know, in some sense, there's a reasonable philosophical intersection between some of the things that I'm going to talk about and some of the things that Max will talk about. But I think the kind of approaches that we're going to discuss are kind of relatively orthogonal in some way, maybe. So complementary, let's say. Okay, so let's go ahead and start with this symbol length problem. This symbol length problem. So it goes something like this. So in terms of the Brouwer group, so we're going to just assume, kind of like Max was saying, I'm just going to assume that the characteristic is nothing harmful for anything that I'm going to talk about. For anything that I'm gonna talk about. So it'll be primed to whatever I need it to be at the time. And I'm gonna assume for the moment that we have a plethora of roots of unity so that I won't worry too much about how things are twisted. So, what we know by Mercury of Susslin is that this guy is generated. By the classes of these so-called symbol algebras, which we write as you know, AB maybe sub n, where so this is a degree in algebra, so you're generated by i and j, where i to the n is a, j to the n is b, and i j anti-commute modulo this root of unity. Okay. Okay, and so these are like kind of generalized quaternion algebras. So these guys, which you can, so think of via, let's say, if I'm looking at like the intorsion, so this should be an H2, let's say F mu n. Well, if I'm, if I have my roots of unity, then it's okay if I list this another time. And these things are just the cut product of. things are just the cut product of the kind of A and B residue classes in H1. Okay, anyway, so we know you're generated by these things. And the question is then, if you have some algebra, how do you write it in terms of these things? Okay, so I'm just going to like. Wait, I'm already like five minutes behind. I was like, really. Okay. I put like. I put like these like maybe aspirational like kind of like minute marks in my notes. I don't know why I do that. I probably just do it to torture myself. Okay. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so the so I mean the so the deal is like you have um this this natural um right so so Milner well So Milner, well, any K1, so this is just like F star, and this maps to this thing, which is naturally F star mod F star to the N. And you can take, you know, cup products. So of course, the Milner K-theory is generated by things in H1, like in degree one. So if I look at, I don't know, Milner, I shouldn't use N, let me M. shouldn't use N. Let me M. The very different M's. You shouldn't, does not. Anyway, so things inside here, you know, you have these cut products of your things, which are usually just written like that. And, you know, the, so Blockado tells us that if you look at this map, Look at this map, then it gives an isomorphism if I mod out by n over here. So this map gives an isomorphism. So these elements, these AB in the Brauer group here are just the targets of, let's say, AB in Milner K2. These go to the algebras that I'm calling AB sub n. B sub n. Yeah, so that's that answer. Okay. All right. So let me let me start. Let me just start counting so you can just kind of get a flavor of this. So I'm just going to look at the different ends. Okay. If n is two, check. Those are quaternion algebras, and that's how they look. Okay, if n is equal to three, well, check. So this is an old result. So, this is an old result of Wetterburn, which says that every degree three algebra is actually a cyclic algebra. So, you know, roots of unity present, they look like this with n equals three. So everything just is a symbol. Okay. Four. Okay. So there's so, okay, so now, oh, actually, I'm not. Okay. Oh, actually, I'm not. Okay. So for n equals four, what you know is that you don't, I don't know if you have a cyclic splitting field. I should know that actually. I mean, you have you have an abelian splitting field. You have a Z2 cross Z2 split at maximal splitting field. That's an old result of Albert. So to look like this, you need a cyclic maximal subfield. You always have one that's elementary abelian. So that's Albert from the 30s. Sorry, what does a check mean? So a jockey. Okay, it was kind of ambiguous, wasn't it? But it's just is our. But it just is actually a symbol. That's why you're saying that it's generated by symbols. Yeah, but what I mean is if you have oh, oh, oh, this is an N. Oh, crap, crap, crap. Okay. Sorry, what I meant to say is index, not or degree or whatever. If you have an algebra of index two, then it's actually so. So, okay. Then it's actually a symbol. So, okay, so I should, let me kind of clarify. So, there are two symbol length problems that one could talk about. And I'm really doing a bad job with this exposition. But there's what we might call the symbol length problem just full stop, which is to say, given a field, things are a product of symbols, but how many symbols do you need? Okay. But then there's what you might call the Call the index symbol length problem. Just like there's the period index problem, there's like maybe the index symbol length problem. And that's really what I want to describe. So if somebody tells you the index, or really maybe even the index and the period, what do you know about the symbol? Okay. And I should have looked this up, but I don't actually know what the answer is before. But, Danny. Answer is for four. But Danny, take a random bi-quaternion elephant. Yeah. I think it has a cyclic splitting feel. I mean, this is recorded, and I feel like if I say the wrong thing, I'll be like kicked out of the Brower group. So, like, I mean, I like, you know, like, all my friends are going to watch that. Does it have to advertise that we own the domain Brower.group? That's right. That's right. I mean, if it were true that every index four thing, oh, sorry. Oh, never mind. Sorry. Never mind. Okay, okay, okay. So let me not like take too much time. Like, I should know this. I don't right now. I feel horrible. But like, if you have index four, then if you have, then I don't know. I know you have an abeeling splitting field. Know, I know you have an abelian splitting feel, but I don't remember if I don't, you probably don't have a cyclic splitting field. Why would you, right? I feel like somebody told me once that you do. Okay, anyways. Okay, but if your index is four, then your period might be four or two. If your period is two, then there's this very famous theorem that you're a tensor product of two quaternion algebras. So the language. So the length in this case is two, your tensor product of two quaternions. Okay, what happens about degree five? Okay, so degree five, well, there's a conjecture that some people believe that you are a symbol if you have roots of unity. This is one of these big questions. There's a, there's a, for all we know, um, every For all we know, every algebra of prime degree has a cyclic splitting field. That might be true. The best we know right now is that if you go to a degree six extension, then you get a cyclic splitting field. And so then you can do a so then your algebra arises in some like restriction, co-restriction kind of way. And you can use like these Rossetate, like, you know, Like, you know, symbol length things for co-restriction to tell you that the length is, let's say, no more than a tensor product of six symbols. Okay. So this is like, we're starting to get into the realm of like, you know, trouble. Okay. Okay. Really, we can just stick to prime powers because that's kind of the only interesting thing. Degree eight, again, I'm not sure what's generally known, but once you restrict yourself to period two, then it's at least hopeful you might be a tensor product of maybe three quaternions, right? Because that's how many you would need to multiply to get eight. That doesn't work. There are counterexamples to that, but it's a very kind of nice result of row and Result of Rowan and Tenyol that the length is at most four. You're always a tensor product of at most four quaternions. And that's really kind of where things start to go haywire beyond that. So as I'll explain what we, so in these cases, kind of like, in this case, four is optimal. Like we know that you can. Four is optimal. Like, we know that you can do four, and you know, you sometimes need exactly four. But if you look at the next kind of interesting prime power, let's say degree nine, period three, for example. So for the case of nine and three, um With some hypotheses about the field, what I'll say is that the length is going to be somewhere between, we don't know what the, the optimal number is going to be somewhere between three and three to the 11 minus one. Okay, so I'll see if I can kind of explain where the lower end. Of explain where the lower and upper bounds come from. I mean, both of them are somewhat non-trivial in the sense, like, you know, one has to know that two isn't enough and a priori, and like, and like one has to find some way of getting an upper bound. You know? Okay. So I should mention, by the way, that, you know, it's, it's, uh, It's been kind of like a folklore thing that there is an upper bound. I mean, I wrote it up like 10 years ago, but everybody knew it already. Like if you fix an index and period, there is a uniform bound. So basically, because there's a generic algebra and its bound is going to dictate what happens to everybody else. Okay. Okay. So let me kind of explain maybe briefly where this. Oh, I'm only a few minutes lower still. Okay, it's not, it could be a lot worse. Okay. So where does this so the upper bound really comes from from a result of Mozri's? Result of Mozeries that Max talked about. And the lower bound actually uses a little bit of K-theory. So it's like, there's, isn't that great? Okay. Okay. So let me explain the upper bound real quick. So the upper bound. And by the way, this, so for this bound, this is like if F contains an algebraically closed field. In the case, if F is characteristic, you know, P, whatever, then I, you know, but maybe doesn't contain an algebraically closed field, I can get this bound. Okay. And if you are just some random characteristic zero thing, we know there's an upper bound, but nobody knows how to get it. If you go through the proof of the Mercury of Susslin theorem, does that, I mean, is it effective in principle? Not that I can tell, no. I mean, I don't think so. I mean, I yeah, okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like, okay. I mean, like, so, yeah, I'm not, I'm, okay, so there's not an obvious way in which it's effective, but I mean, maybe it's possible to kind of re-look through the proof and exactly, but I'm not sure. Yeah. So, Danny, I just want to like the general characteristic zero case defines. To the zero case, some other round would reduce to a purely tangential extension of q, where like you have one variable for each entry, and then you just have a publication table. Yeah. So we have no way, if you look at Matsri's argument, this would come down to something about those. Well, but the problem, the problem, uh, okay, so so Matsri's argument, uh, so let me let me just uh tell you the like Matsri's result really, really briefly. So, so Matsri's. So, Matsuri shows that if your field has this kind of Sin Lang property kind of thing, Cm, the Cm property, and let's say alpha is a P to the T torsion class. And if the index Is bounded by P to the S, then the length of alpha, kind of written in terms of sensor products of symbols of degree p to the t, is at most t times p to the m minus one minus one. Okay, so this is what Mazdri shows. Is what Monstery shows, and I mean, this is so this is like this is like an obvious upper bound, it's just so stupid that nobody likes to talk about it, you know, kind of for obvious reasons. But the point is, like, if somebody gives you some division algebra over some field, then it has some field of definition, which is probably considerably smaller than the field that you're given. And if you're lucky, that field will have. Lucky that field will have some Sinlang property. And then you'll it's defined over some field where the symbol length is bounded, and you just do that, right? So, so the whole point here is that there's this particular bound given by Beck and Mercuria, where they are really computing the essential dimension of central simple algebras with a given period and index. And what they show. What they show is that you can always find kind of a subfield with transcendence degree, so the kind of essential dimension is at most p to the 2s minus 2 plus p to the s minus t for your for this given like, you know, period and index bound. So, in other words, if somebody gives you your field f, gives you your field f and you choose whatever subfield you want, the algebra will be defined over this, something transcendental over this inside of here with transcendence degree at most this. So that's anyways, so that's the idea. Then you, so my claim is that if you take this and you combine it with Mottsbury's bound, just in a really, you know, stupid way, then you get Then you get the following bound that I'll just let me just scribble it down over here, maybe. So in other words, so maybe I should write it over here because that's close to everything that I'm talking about. So with these properties, with all of this, sorry, no, with Of this, uh, sorry, no, with with this alpha of this sort, what you get is that the length of alpha is going to be bounded by um what t times, I need more room, um, t times um p to the power of p to the two s minus two plus p to the uh s minus t. Minus t let me say plus epsilon minus one minus one symbol. So this is how many symbols you need. Okay. Where epsilon, so this k is assumed to be c epsilon. You know, so in other words, if you have an algebraically closed field, epsilon is zero. If you have a finite field down there, epsilon is one. And if you have q. And if you have Q, you're out of luck, and we know nothing. Okay. So, okay. So, in other words, so if you plug it in for this one, you got those bounds. Okay. Now, okay, any questions? Is that all right? Yeah, so let me say the lower bound. I'll just tell you why the lower bound isn't. I'll just tell you why the lower bound isn't two. Okay. So, in fact, the lower bound, I mean, so the lower bound of three is originally due kind of independently to Carpenko and Kelly McKinney. Although, I want to kind of present a slightly more general result, which is so, which is in this kind of context of period P to the S index P to the T. Oh, wait, do I reverse those? P to the T index P to the F. Good. That's what I did over there. So in this case, So, in this case, if you're being very naive, you need at least, well, enough so that if you multiply a bunch of these guys, you can get at least this. So that's the ceiling of S over T, I guess. Right? And so, theorem. And this is really, this is like kind of This is like kind of, I don't know, a cautionary tale for the younger people. Like, this is like an old result of mine that I never submitted yet anywhere or finished writing up. And I feel really bad about it. And so, like, don't do that. Okay. I promise now that I'm talking about it again, I'll write it up. I promise. It's, you know, okay. Anyways, so theorem. Anyways, so theorem with quotes that, you know, I can't fully get credit because it doesn't exist yet. Question? Yeah, so wait, what do you mean by me? So very naively, like if you take, if you have like some algebras, you know, R algebras where each of these has index p to the t, the degree of this thing is going to be, you know, p to the rt, just a flat out. RT, just the flat out degree of it. And if you're going to get something with the index is that, you're going to have to at least get that far. Okay, so this really, so this is like, so this is saying why for, you know, for the nine, three, you need at least two, because that's the only way you can get up to nine. But the theorem is that you always... Oh, question. No, it's the minimum transcendence. It's the minimum transcendence degree of a field over which it's defined, of a field of definition. Yeah, okay. So the theorem is that you actually sometimes need s over t plus one. So you can always, you know. You know, so like there are always counterexamples to the small one. Right. So now I'll let me say just a couple of words about the proof, really just a couple of words, because, you know, because it's part of what binds us together as a Brower K-theory community, right? Okay, let me just move on actually. No, no, no. No, actually, it's like a, yeah, it's not. Do you want me to tell you? I mean, okay. Like. Okay, okay. I'll just, now I really have to write it up, right? But the but the proof idea is kind of Is kind of it's kind of nice. So what you do is you look at, see, you imagine that you have some sort of like a Brouwer equivalence where you have, you know, some number of algebras. So this R, maybe is going to be this actually, or something like that. And you try to say, like, you know, is it possible that I can, you know, write my algebra in this way? Write my algebra in this way, but what would that mean? And so the deal is like, okay, first off, then you have to, so this is like Brouwer equivalence, but maybe then you pick some particular like size matrix so that you actually have an isomorphism. And when you, and then you can kind of make a geometric kind of avatar for this kind of relationship, which is to say that, so for each of these, there's the kind of Severi-Brower variety, which parametrizes. Variety which parametrizes, let's say, minimal right ideals, ideals of a certain size. And so if you look at the product of all these Severi-Brouwer varieties, that actually maps into the Severi-Brouwer variety of the guy on the right, just by this very simple thing where you take an ideal, a tuple of ideals, and you take their tensor product. So, I think this was like observed by Karpenko back in the late 90s that this is an interesting kind of map to look at. And this is actually a kind of twisted version of like, what is it called? Segra embedding. Yeah. So this is a kind of twisted segra embedding. And so you see, well, if A has this kind of decomposition, or if the matrix algebra has this decomposition, then inside of here, there's a certain cycle. Inside of here, there's a certain cycle, which is the just put the fundamental class of this guy, right? And then what you can do is you can actually write down various A's where you can just flat out compute all the child groups of this thing. Okay, so the basic observation is that if your A is kind of like generic enough, so then so. So I'm not sure how to exactly, I'm not going to explain that exactly, but if A is generic enough, so you start with some A that has kind of like that has kind of some certain genericity properties in terms of how it's, maybe it has like period equals index, and maybe you need a little bit more. I can't remember. And then you extend scale. You extend scalars to function fields of other Severi Brow varieties that kind of lower its period and things like that, to alter its behavior. And what you can then find is that for these things, the Cha groups are going to be actually computable just straight up by the gamma filtration on K-naught. So typically you're going to be off by some torsion. Typically, you're going to be off by some torsion and stuff like that, and you're going to have some kind of weirdness, but like, but if you're kind of generic enough, then you're just going to be like, you know, generated by this gamma filtration. And then, and also in this case, you can really write down exactly what kind of your generating vector bundles are going to be. And then it's just a matter of like, it's really just a matter of very kind of like, I don't know, classical kind of combinatorial algebraic geometry. kind of combinatorial algebraic geometry just like pushing around a bunch of like um you know a bunch of like um you know churn classes and and playing with symmetric functions and seeing what you actually end up getting and what you can show is that in this you know if you if if you're just if you just try to do it with s over t and you look at where that cycle goes the generic guy doesn't have the right cycle in it doesn't have to and then so it isn't of that point And then, so it isn't of that form. So, anyways, it's like a very concrete, interesting thing. It's really just, it's not my idea. I mean, it's my proof, but it's not my idea. This is, you know, really Carpenko's idea from the late 90s, just pushed a little bit further in one of the directions. But there's no way to make that one into a two by some other. Into a two by some other. No, I mean, because it, because, like, there's no cycle theoretic obstruction for this one. I mean, like, you say, well, can I write it as this thing? And you look at that, that cycle and okay, that is actually in the chow group. So there is a cycle that at least, you know, is rationally equivalent to that one. Did it actually come from such an embedding? Who knows? Probably not. But there's no obstruction of this sort. But there's no obstruction of this sort. So you're saying the segue class of this embedding is the obstruction plus one thing. That's what gives you the plus one. Yeah, exactly. Well, so what you show is that like if there was a segreg embedding inside of here that exhibited this decomposition, then you would get a cycle in here that you can show usually doesn't exist. Usually doesn't exist. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. It is the Sega embedding. Absolutely. Yeah. So there's a form of the Sega embedding. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and so more generally, like, I mean, you know, this, the, you know, if you say like, This, the, you know, if you say, like, what is the, um, what are all the twisted forms of Sega embeddings? They're more general than this. And so you're actually getting a more, a slightly stronger result than saying that you're, you're not a decomposition like this. You're actually saying that you're not a co-restriction over an appropriate atal extension. So it's like, so you can actually talk about like in the paper that I have never finished writing, I talk about co-restriction length and stuff like that. Co-restriction length and stuff like that, and it gives you some sort of bound like that. Okay, anyways, um, let me uh if any other questions, okay, so um so now let me um kind of slide over a little bit. Um, so I want to just mention um just Just an interesting recent kind of variation on this kind of question, somewhat recent, I guess. And then I want to go ahead and say a little bit about higher comology, just kind of at the end. Okay. Maybe I theory also gives a lower bound. It's really just, I mean, it's so, okay, the only K-theory that actually comes in. The only K-theory that actually comes in here is just the fact that if A is kind of nice and generic, then the child groups are computed via the filtration on K-theory, the gamma filtration on K-theory. So that's, I mean, you know, so normally they're kind of closely related, but there's kind of some issues. But here they're actually, they actually line up. So it's, so it's really this, it's really this. The statement that you can really compute the child groups by using explicit vector bundles and their characteristic classes, and then it makes this thing actually computable. All right. Okay. And again, it's all Carpenco stuff. I mean, I'm just like, you know, reaping the benefits of the theory that he's laid down. Okay. Okay. No, I mean, I mean, so we're not really doing any like, there's not really any like kind of intersection theory going on or anything like that. But anyways, I mean, everything is homogeneous. I mean, everything moves very well. So, but it doesn't really come up. So, if we're talking about, okay, yeah, so one variation, which I think is kind of interesting, is so you might ask, like, instead of just restricting the index of the class, you might actually say something about its splitting fields as well. So, suppose A, you know, has index p to the s. index P to the S, period P to the T and admits a cyclic maybe I should have said this differently. Wait. Yeah, maybe admits a cyclic splitting field. Of degree P to the S. So maybe, like, it's not right. So, not only does it, you know, does it have like some splitting field of size P to the S, maybe it has a cyclic one, then what can you say? So, so for these kind of things, so. Things. So let me see if I can look up the where is it? Where is it? Ah, right. So here there's a result which is kind of implicit in an old result of Tinyol, but kind of spelled out. But kind of spelled out more explicitly and generalized in a recent thing of Matsri from last year. And that is that the length of such a class, you know, alpha, in this case, is actually bounded by p to the s minus t, which is kind of lower than the kinds of bounds that one has over there. So knowing that you have a cyclic splitting field up top, that it's not just an arbitrary algebra. That it's not just an arbitrary algebra p to the s index tells you quite a lot more. So, you know, this is kind of billed as the symbol length of symbols, right? Because knowing that it has a cyclic splitting field means that you can write it as kind of like an AB P to the S, but that it happens to also be similar to a tensor product of some guys with a P to the T. So it's a symbol if you look at it p to the s, but like, but it actually has smaller periods, so you can write it as a bunch of these. So, what's the p to the t symbol length of a p to the s symbol? Anyway, so this is a very nice result that one can get. And let's see. So, and I guess I like. Yeah, so like I guess like one thing you could do is take a PCS and that has yeah exactly it has smaller in this case in that example it was length one wasn't it no it wouldn't just have length one actually because if you if you take if you take P times AB P to the S, that's actually P to the s, that's actually similar to a b p to the s minus one. So it turns out that you know that it's still a symbol if you do that. This is like a non-optimal bound. This would be a non-optimal bound in that case. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let's see. So let me take a side step and just go right into higher comology. Higher comology. So, all the stuff that we're talking about for Brower, you could talk about as well for higher comology. And let me say that it's worth first starting with the period index problem for higher cohomology. And there is, I think, a little bit of an issue because An issue because it turns out that there's actually a lot of different things that one might mean by index in higher comology. So indices in higher homology. Well, I mean, in some sense, everybody has already agreed on what the index is. I mean, Max gave a definition of the index, and that is like kind of the accepted definition, but. Definition, but it coincides with a bunch of other things in the case of H2, which it diverges from in higher cohomology. So, for example, let me just suppose like I have like E over F is some Galois extension. It doesn't really have to be Galois, but it kind of makes it simple to kind of say this. So, we might have the question of like kind of index in terms of like this thing splitting our class. So, we might ask, like, given alpha. So we might ask, like, given alpha is alpha E like trivial, this is one notion of index. You shouldn't think of it as Gala in this case. But there's another condition, which is to say, so this is asking, like, is alpha in the kernel of Hn F whatever you're in? You're in to HNE, you know, are you in the kernel of that? But there's also the question of: are you in the image of the map from the kind of a relative homology to HN of mu. Right, so if you take the degree of this, the smallest possible. The smallest possible degree of an E that satisfies this, the condition? Yeah, or maybe the GCD of the degrees or something like that. Yeah. Oh, okay. But I guess I just want to kind of point out that for H2, the kernel of this is the image of that. And for hierarchomology, it's not. So, you know, so you could call this thing like splitting index, and this thing, I think I was. And this thing, I think I was calling like representation index. But then there's a bunch of indices in between as well, because really what we're talking about here is there's a, you know, what we're really talking about is if somebody gives you an E over F, then there's this Linden-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence that then computes this H and F mu. This is the The kind of like top edge of the filtration. This is saying, like, you're not in the top, you're just a little bit down. And this is saying you're all the way in the bottom. And then you could ask anywhere in between, does E put you at this level of the filtration? Does E put you at that? It's like, are you this level of a splitting field or this? And then you could take into the G C D of those things. And there's just different notions of index. And when you're kind of looking to generalize things from the Brow group, every Brower group, every now and then one of the you're looking at the wrong index. So it's it's just something to kind of keep in mind, okay. But I mean, I'm going to keep like kind of Max's definition, though, for the kind of statements that we make, but this is kind of like a warning that one has to be a little bit careful. So now I'm going to present my own conjecture on this, which has very little evidence. Which has very little evidence. So, conjecture: if F is Cm and alpha is in Hn F, let's say mu L to the tensor N minus one. I feel like this is kind of the natural place to look at these indices. This is like my personal feeling. Yeah, because this is where, this is where the Because this is where, this is where the this is the Brouwer place. And this is where kind of cohomological invariants tend to lie and stuff like that. And it's, anyways, and it's where certain local global principles hold and stuff like that. It's kind of a more a natural place. Then the index of alpha should degree the period of alpha to the n minus one, choose n minus. Minus. Okay. So I had like this really nice, like, heuristic argument for why I believe this was true. And it was based on a bunch of other conjectures about how I believe period and index should behave. I told it to my grad student at the time, Storb Gassavi, and then he disproved all of my rationale basically. But so even. But so, even though I now have no kind of like good reason to believe that this is true, I do now have some examples where I can prove that these bounds kind of work. But I'm not sure why they should work, but I mean, but it, I mean, so I can give you, yeah, anyways, okay. So, for example, though, one of the expectations is that we expect kind of in the top top degree. Kind of in the top degree, the period and index should coincide, for example. And as Max was saying, in various cases, we actually know in the top degree, you have symbols, like in this case of Suresh and all that. You know, so for example, in some recent stuff that I did with David Harbator and Julia Hartman, we show that if you're given That if you're given actually any finite collection alpha one through alpha r in this H3 as above, or where f is, let's say, the function field of a surface over a finite field, then there exists a degree L split. Degree L splitting field. So this is in, let's say, mu L to the tensor two. There exists a degree L splitting field simultaneously for all of them. Okay. And it turns out that you can make some interesting bootstraps with this, actually using some ideas of Gustavi, actually. Of Gustavi, actually, that you can actually prove that these bounds are kind of like tight upper bounds, I guess, or not tighter. I don't know if they're really tight, but like we can prove that these upper bounds hold, at least, for some, I'm just going to give you like an example of like the kind of field that you. example of like the kind of field that you get for like these kind of upper bounds holding it's like where you take let's say fq you look at like a curve over fq you like have some like maybe laurent series or maybe you do some like vid vectory kind of things i don't know how many you have and then you look at a curve over that so for a field like this you can you can have you these upper bounds you can show hold and You can show hold in various degrees. So, this is also kind of from this thing of a couple of years ago. How about when n is greater than m? Is this known in that case, the conjecture? Sorry, when n is greater than m. Oh, you mean in? Oh, so do the cohomology? Well, interestingly, that's an interesting thing. So, that's actually a conjecture of Ser. A conjecture of Ser. So there's this, yeah, so the conjecture is a consequence, you mean, of the, of the, of the, yeah, I think I know the conjecture you're talking about. That's the conjecture that CR, that's C. If F is CM, then the cohomological dimension of F is bounded by M. What's on? Yeah, I mean, so if you put like a like at P, the chromological dimension at P, it follows actually from the Milner conjectures that this is true at P. So this was observed by Sayre in his Gallochomology book. He observed that at P equals two, it follows from the Milner conjectures. So we now have the Milner conjectures. So check. For higher P, actually, it Actually, it wasn't even known that there was a bound, but actually, I don't know, a few years back, Ellie Matsuri and I gave some upper bound. Let me see if I have it written down. So what we showed is that, let's see, do I have it written down somewhere? I mean, I can't remember exactly what it says, but so one would want to know that. So if this is true, then they're equal. Like if you can get close, then it's like going to grow at least linearly with slope one. We show that it grows, that it, that the comological dimension grows at worst linearly with slope log base two of p. So, there is some bound on the cohomological dimension. And for some small things, we get actually a sharper bound using kind of like kind of these low number coincidences, like using things like Albert algebras and stuff like that. But the question is, can you like write down some like some actually homogeneous polynomials that force things to be, that say that your classes are zero? Your classes are zero. Okay, I guess I'm almost out of time, but maybe there was another. Well, let's see. You know what? I mean, I don't really have anything more substantial to say. I mean, are there questions? You know, the difficult thing about the hierarchy is kind of the lack of like kind of concrete algebraic models. I mean, so there isn't an analogous thing that we can kind of construct that's going to say, like, you know, if this cycle exists or if you have like, you know, or if you have some bound on the symbol length, then you can. Symbol length, then you can construct some relationship between varieties or some algebraic object. Or, I mean, this is horrible, actually. I mean, like, really the problem, and this, I mean, I think indicative of this problem is our lack of understanding, for example, of generic splitting variety, right? So if somebody gives you, you know, some cohomology class in H3, and they might say, okay, is it zero, right? You would like to say that there are some equations that you. Like to say that there are some equations that you can write down such that if you can solve it, then you would know that it's zero. I mean, it's unknown whether or not such a variety exists for a general class in H3. And I suspect that no such variety can exist in general. That's my suspicion, based on some kind of religious ideas, I guess, about physics. But so. But so, I mean, the you know, so I mean, the proof of the block color control, this construction of norm varieties, tells us that if you have a single symbol, then you can write down a variety such that it has a point exactly when the symbol is trivial. But that variety isn't like a hypersurface or something. It's not like some obvious single equation of some fixed degree that then you would know this about. I mean, there's no, I mean, it's really kind of not constructive. Could have not constructed in such a nice way. Oh, in this construction, let me think about that. Yeah, I think it probably is actually. Yeah. So, yeah. The CD is really Galois Comological. Yeah, Galois Comological Dimension. Yeah, Gawa Comological Dimension. I've actually Yeah Well So I mean the the I think the CM property is not exactly Is it really? I mean I mean so they're they're And so there, I mean, there certainly should be a result of that flavor. Could you so the question is basically what if you're looking at kind of so to speak, like bad characteristic? Like, what if instead of looking at Galois homology, you're looking at like these like kata things with like, you know, with like, you know, log differential form vectors. Log differential form vit vector stuff, you know? And I, you know, so there's certainly, yeah, as I'm looking at this, I'm thinking like that I think that's that looks that looks kind of doable, actually. So I think it's, yeah, I mean, I think, yeah. Yeah, because so they so I guess so at least so it turns out that for that there are some nice ways of writing down like triviality of symbols at least at least if you're looking at mod P, I'm not sure about when you like are you having higher bit vectors? I think it's Having higher bit vectors, I think it's a little more awkward to write down, but but like but like mod p stuff, I think there are some nice tools where you could write down some actual varieties to do that. Yeah, there's this nice stuff in the last few years where, uh, yeah, um, yeah, I was actually, I was actually meaning to talk about that. Like, so yeah, um, you know, so so there are, so we So, I do have some recent work in progress actually with Adam Chapman and Kelly McKinney, where we consider this kind of symbol length of symbol problem in bad characteristic. And we, and so, so the, the original, this original result of Chinon Maastri was actually also done in characteristic P by Mercuryev, and I'm trying to remember who he did it with. I can't remember the co-author. Remember the co-author. But there is some nice kind of recent stuff with kind of higher cohomology that came out. And we've been able to leverage that and actually compute some upper bounds on symbol length of symbols for hierarchy and mod P in the kind of, you know, I don't even know what that stuff is called. Like, I mean, like, what is the name of this group? I mean, I write it, I mean, I, like, I just, you know, I mean, I like, I just, you know, you can like, I just write it like that. I don't even know what, but it's so, it's like, you know, you look at like the bit vectors and you tensor with some f stars and you mod up by some. But I don't know. What's no, I know it is, but I mean, does this thing have a net? I mean, you know, you don't say like Gala Cohomology, you say. It doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it? Anyway, so like somebody should name this properly is so that we can just I think this talk is over. Okay, okay, we can move on. Yeah, thanks. Don't do that. Don't do that. Are there any other questions? Full power. No, no, no, no. Crank it all the way, full power. Two notches. Okay, hopefully people agree. If I know something about great index problems for like a specific Yeah, I mean, so I mean, of course, so I mean, so I don't say this exactly. I mean, so one can actually like leverage a funny relationship between. Relationship between cohomological dimension and symbol lengths, actually, using kind of reduced power operations. So, this was like, I mean, other than that, I haven't seen anything kind of fruitfully done, but this was kind of a nice observation kind of made in the kind of in the kind of quadratic form context by Bruno Kahn that I wrote down kind of in more generality. Maybe it's worth just mentioning. It's kind of funny. I haven't figured out. just mentioning it's kind of funny i haven't figured out i haven't figured out any practical like place where this has helped me but it's kind of been a funny little observation which is that like um so like if um if h um let's say uh 2n for example of f I don't know mu l l is some prime harmless prime Harmless prime is non-zero, then the length in H2 is going to be at least n. So, right. So, in other words, like you know, if you have like not If you have like non-vanishing hierarchy, then you had better have classes in H2 that can't be written as very few symbols. And the reason is, like, if you have, it's really stupid, but like, the reason is if you have one of these guys, like, I don't know, let's call it like alpha one, beta one, alpha two, beta two, you know, some, some, something like that. Then this is. Then this is like obtainable as taking like the kind of reduced nth power kind of thing of that. And if this thing could have been written as a smaller list of symbols, then when you did that, you would have gotten zero. So like, this is just a very silly observation, I guess, but it's kind of interesting. The problem, the practical problem with this. The practical problem with this, the reason why I've never found it useful, even though it's kind of a cool fact, is that if you have, in practice, if you have a field and H2N is non-zero, you know, I mean, there are like kind of weird fields that you can construct in your basement with like infinitely, like infinite towers of like kind of, you know, whatever. But like the fields that you find out there, like, you know, on the street, the fields that are there, if you have H2N. If you have H2N, if you have like, let's say, cohomological dimension 2n, then typically you have like Diophantine dimension 2n, like you're a C2n field or something like that, or you're something like this, or typically you can actually construct in practice, like division algebras that are actually lengthy. Um, uh, two and minus one, and our division. You can construct in practice tensor products of symbols like that that are actually division with any field that you find in nature that I've found. Right. So, like, so, so this bound, knowing that you need at least n, in practice, you actually can often find examples where you need at least 2n minus 1. So, like, um Um but you know but but of course you you know there's nothing special about H2. You can do this for you know for whatever but and you know and you can construct there you can construct fields where this helps you but yeah.
