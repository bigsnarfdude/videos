My pleasure to introduce Michael Brannon, who's going to talk about spot and bottom horses and groups of high-dimensional space star objects. All right, thank you very much to the organizer for the invitation to join you and also give a talk here. So in the invitation to give a talk email, I was asked to say something about subfactors, maybe connections to tensor categories. And unfortunately, I probably won't say too much deep stuff. Say too much deep stuff in that direction, but I will probably say the word subfactor and tensor category. So, anyways, so what is this talk about? It's actually about a very nice and natural class of Hopf algebras or compact quantum groups that give rise to interesting two-on-factors when you look at their G and S completions with respect to their R state. And these arise as the quantum automobile. Quantum automorphism groups of finite quantum spaces, which are finite-dimensional C-star algebra. So the objects we're going to be looking at are B. This is just a finite dimensional C-star algebra, which is always going to be just a direct sum matrix algebra. Okay, and the thing we're interested in looking at is we want to study Study the compact quantum group of star allomorphisms, which I'll denote by G sub B of my C star algebra. Okay, so what is this? Well, this is going to Well, this is going to be, in the language of Hawk algebras, this is going to be a universal Hopstar algebra. So Hawk algebra together with the compatible evolution. O of GCV, together with a faithful And of course, my Hopstar algebras are going to be of compact type, so they will have positive R integrals. And this Hopstar algebra is going to be essentially determined by a faithful co-action of this Pop algebra on B, which turns B into a star co-module algebra. Okay, so a faithful star co-module. Our co-module algebra structure on B. Okay, so what is this? So to have B as a co-module algebra, this is really just saying that we have a unital star homomorphism for B into B tensor O of T E. L of T D okay, and this also has to be a co-large algebra. Okay, so that is alpha alpha tensor 1. Alpha is the same as one tensor co-multiplication alpha. Okay? And also, of course, one tensor co-unit alpha is the identity. Is the identity graph of B. Okay? So we have a star. Question: If you mind just so this is not replicated, I'm just going to ask: if B is just a similar matrix algebra, does this maybe acquire a more familiar name? Is that the thing that we need? Yes, so the question is if B is just a matrix algebra, yeah, this quantum group, and I'll actually go into detail a little bit about this in a few minutes, it's the projective It's the projective free unitary quantum. And when B is a Belian C-star algebra, so functions on endpoints, this is just a quantum permutation on endpoints. I'll sort of point those out momentarily. So yeah, we have a co-action of V or of this Hoppalgebra on V. And what does it mean to be faithful? Mean to be faithful. So, this means to be the co-action faithful. So, what I mean by that is, of course, that I want O of G B to be generated by the coefficients of alpha. Right, so in other words, if alpha In other words, if alpha, if I fix a basis for B, call it EI, then I can always write alpha of EI as sum over j, ej tensor, let's say u j i. Then I'm just asking that this algebra is actually generated by this co-module, the coefficients of this co-module. So in the language of compact quantum groups, this is just saying that v is a fundamental or a generating representation of the underlying compact quantum group. Of the underlying compact policy group. Okay, so this is what it means to be faithful. And of course, if this is actually a group, what this is really saying is that G embeds into the automorphism of B. All right, and then universal, I want the analog of saying not only does G embed into the automorphism group B, but it should be all automorphisms. Okay, so being universal means, I can just write it right here, universal. Universal is just saying if I have some other H acting on B as above, so if beta from B into B tensor O of H, where O of H is some other Hopf algebra, okay, with the above properties, okay, then what I ask is that there exists ask is that there exists a surjective morphism from O of G V onto O of H, a morphism of Hop algebras, okay, which intertwines beta and alpha. So such that beta is really just identity tensor pi alpha. So this is sort of the universal property. And yeah, so this talk is really about some And yeah, so this talk is really about some things that we know and don't know about these Hopf algebras and their related things. But actually, as I defined this here, this Hopf algebra, actually the universal object doesn't quite exist. You have to be a little bit careful. It's a problem. GB does not exist in general as a compact. General as a compact Following group. And the issue is: if we want to have a positive R integral on this, the representation category at the end of the day has to be a rigid C-star density category. So we have to have a nice notion of duals, which means B should a priori have some sort of distinguished Silver space structure associated to it. So we can talk about it to help them. All right? So what happens? Alright, so what happens is the following. So you need to also, in general, consider a faithful form phi on B and it's going to be positive. Okay, so faithful functional that's positive on B. And consider coactions which are covariant with respect to phi. Okay, so what does that mean? That just means that phi is a covariate for the coaxial. So that just means. So that just means, you know, if I apply alpha, I can then apply phi on the left leg of the range, and then this is the same as not applying alpha at all. All right. So why should you smoke with the race? Not necessarily. Though I will actually only consider the case of a trace. The main reason for this is twofold. One is I really only can say anything new about these things where phi is a trace. And the other thing is that when phi is a trace, the associated half algebras are a path type, which means that the hard integral is a trace and then one gets nice 21 factors at the end of the day. Yeah, okay. So yeah, so in reality, what we're looking at is really the data of b together with the functional. B together with the functional, and g really depends on b and phi. So today I'm just going to only consider the tracial case. And I'm actually going to pick a very natural trace, which maybe you might like to call the canonical trace or the Planch-Rel trace on a finite-dimensional C-spare algebra. And so if B has a decomposition. And so if B has a decomposition as over there, this is the trace that I'll take. So why am I taking this trace? Well, it turns out, I won't really go into much details about it, but taking this trace as opposed to some other weightings on the blocks makes the representation category of this compact working group as small as possible. As possible. So if you add different coefficients on these weights here, then the structure becomes a little bit more complicated. But at the end of the day, it's not too much more complicated because one can describe things in terms of free products. So in a sense, this is the case that one wants to understand. It'll be. So in a second, yeah, I was going to say exactly what the representation category is. Exactly what the representation category is, and it's the Britain Jones. If it's not, if you change the trace, then you're introducing more morphisms. B becomes more reducible as an object. Yeah, so this is the object situation. And yeah, so maybe examples. So when B is C to the N, I mean this Phi is obviously just a uniform measure. Just uniform measure on the underlying endpoints. Right, so what you do is you fix your favorite basis of projections, EI for C to the N. You write down the defining action. Right, so the algebra for this thing is going to be generated by some Pij's or PJI's. IJ's or PJI's. And so O of G, and actually, so I'm not going to, I'm going to suppress phi now because I'm always just going to assume this canonical choice. So O sub G V in this case is going to be actually generated by these Pij's. And what are the relations? They are that Pij star is Pij is equal to Pij squared. is equal to pij squared, and the sum over i of dij is the sum over j of pij that's equal to 1. So those are the relations you can uncover just by ensuring that this alpha is a homomorphism. So you could just see how the relations translate to the coefficients, you get this. And these relations are pretty well known in the literature. So if you stick the Pijs into a So, if you stick the pij's into a matrix, these are exactly the entries of what are called a magic unitary or quantum permutation matrix. So this is really quantum analog of the permutation group. So, and this is often written as Sn or permutations of that plus. Permutations and then a plus for, well, it's somehow bigger than just Sn. It's a Belonization is exactly the permutation thing. Okay, so that's one basic example to keep in mind. The other example is kind of the other extreme where B is just simple matrix block. You can write down everything nicely in that case as well. Case as well. So if V is Mn, well, as Pori reminded us yesterday, if you have a matrix algebra or B of H more generally, the star automorphisms are given by unitary conjugations. So if A is a star algebra then, you can see how this might generalize. You can see how this might generalize. So if I consider u, a matrix with entries uij in mn of a, okay, and I ask that this be unitary over in this SAR algebra, then I can define a map alpha from Mn into Mn tensor A by sending X to U. 2, u x tensor 1, u star. So essentially conjugation by this now generalized unitary. So my entries are no longer scalars, but still, this is going to give me a star homomorphism. Okay? But there's an issue. It's not actually trace preserving in this case. So you need more structure on you to be trace-based. So alpha is phi covariant if and only if, this is a little calculation one can do, u is bi-unitary. Okay, so that is u transpose is also unitary. Which is an additional assumption, of course, when you have non-commuting edges in the matrix. If the edges of your matrix are commute then, obviously you being unitary, you transpose. Transpose. Okay, so in fact, theorem, Bonnica, due to Bonnica way back in the 90s, is that actually O of G when B is MN is the Hopf algebra associated with the projective version of the free unitary quantum theory. So, what is the free unitary quantum? Quantum group. So, what is the free unitary quantum group? The free unitary quantum group is the universal C-star algebra generated by the coefficients of a bi-unitator. So the algebra generated, universal algebra, generated by these uij's such that u is bi. And what is the projective version of this? This is the algebra simply generated by the coefficients of the fundamental representation. Coefficients of the fundamental representation of the tensor with its conjugate. Okay, so this can be the object generated by UIJ. Let's say UIK from maybe UKI. UIJ star. So that's a UI by UJ. So very much analogous to what you know about ordinary matrix algebras. You just have to, so in a sense, quantum automorphisms. So in a sense, quantum automorphisms of that end are inner in the sense that they really arise from conjugations by quantum volume theories. All right. So yeah, what do I want to say about these things in general? Of course, as you might expect, if I have a multi-matrix algebra, the relations then become very ugly. No one ever remembers them. And they're not really super enlightening. They're not really super enlightened. So, a natural question, of course, is that really the theme of this talk is that: so, like, what can we say about the algebras of GB in general? And also, I'm interested in their analytic completion. So, C of G E, this is going to be the C star algebra, the reduced C star algebra of continuous functions. C-star algebra of continuous functions on Gv, and also its von Neumann algebra, L infinity of Gv. So, what are these things? This is really if I have my R state here, then I can get a GNS representation for this R state. And this is just the closure of the image under the GNS map in the NOR. And this thing here is And this thing here is the commutes, double-commutines. And these are generally, you know, tracial C-star algebra, finite von Neumann algebras. And more generally, it's known that they're pretty much always non-minimal to one factor algebra. So specific questions that one might be interested in are finding things like Finding things like finite-dimensional approximations of these algebras. So, for example, is this Hauf algebra always residually finite-dimensional? It's pretty clear from the two examples that these algebras are not finite-dimensional, very non-commutative in general. But nonetheless, you might ask, you know, is this residually finite-dimensional? And you always find point-separating families of finite-dimensional representations. And knowing that, well, actually. And knowing that will actually allow you to say things about the von Neumann algebra, for example, that it is con-embeddable. So it satisfies the con-embedding property, embeds into an ultra-power hyperfinite move factor, things like that. Other things that one might ask are like, what kinds of approximation properties do these things have? And of course, the key to studying these things is at the very first level you want to study the representation category. The representation category. Okay? So, what is the representation category of these quantum groups? And I already told you, theorem, under the assumptions of my, so let's assume that the dimension of B is bigger than or equal to 4, and I'm going to let delta be, delta squared be the dimension of B. Okay? Then this theorem is again due to Bodyka. It says that rep GB is exactly the even part of the temporary lead-Jones category at least parameter delta. So what is why is this plausible? Well, if you think about the representation category of this thing, Of this thing, it has one generating object, right? B. And then there are natural morphisms which are built into this representation category, which are the structure maps of V and the unit map. So we have the multiplication and the unit. Okay? And the monoidal equivalence of these categories is given. Equivalence of these categories is given by basically sending multiplication to, I guess I'm going to draw my diagrams this way. That is delta to the negative 1 half. And the unit map is going to be the cup up to a scale value. So of course these fixtures generate the even part of TLJ and one thing. And one can play around and actually check that actually this determines the model equivalence it's got to work. So this is quite striking, actually. What it says is that of course G V, or the op algebra rather, let me just say that GB only depends on the dimension of V up to monoidal equivalence. Up to monoidal equivalence. So, a lot of questions you want to ask about these things could really be phrased as questions about the temporally leap categories, computations of those, in particular approximation properties, the fact that, for example, the L-Betting number of this Hopkin algebra, the first L two-Betting number of this Hopkalgember vanishes, that's known because the L2 Betty numbers of the temperature. Because the altitude ID numbers of the temporary Jones calculation. But lots of nice things like that. I thought you would say something about like a fiber functor in order to say that there's a little extra data you need to say that it depends on dig B. There is. Yeah, I'm being kind of loose here. Yeah. Okay. So this is nice. And so a natural question is: how do these actually depend on me? So when you look at, for example, So when you look at, for example, Sn squared plus, so this is the quantum automorphism group of n squared points, the n squared dimensional C star algebra, versus the quantum monomorphism group of mn. So these two C star algebras have the same dimension. How are they related? And in particular, how are these Hof algebras, or these Long Revolution algebra, C-Ser algebra? Or these Loneux algebra, C-Star algebra, I believe. And the reason this is kind of an interesting question is because there are things we know about this quantum group that we don't know about this one. Right? And also, there are things we know about this one that we didn't know about this one. So in particular, problems of matrix models and residual finite dimensionality is much easier to answer for this quantity versus this one. So I should go. So I should go to LEN20 after? And similarly, it's known that the two-on-one factor associated to this quantum group is strongly unbounded, whereas directly it's impossible to, at least at present, to see what's going on for this. But we know these two quantum groups are monoidally equivalent in the sense that they have unitarily tensor equivalent representation, by the way. So these So these algebras, so for example, if you look at C of Sn squared plus, they're not isomorphic. If you look at the C star algebras, okay, this is a result of O and the way he did this is he computed the K-theory. But nonetheless, of course, when you take von Neumann algebra completions, okay, things can get very Things can get very different. Let me just state the main result, which is theorem. So our theorem is, and I'll state it kind of informally at first. So up to matrix amplifications, And cross products by finite B leading groups. Any quantum automorphism group of a finite-dimensional C-ser algebra is the same. The same as O of S dimension of V plus. So although when you look at the generators of relations, for instance, of these two algebras, they sort of don't look too related. But nonetheless, they can sort of be transformed into each other as long as you don't mind taking cross products and major template. So more precisely, the following. So I'm going to like Following. So I'm going to let gamma be the direct of the product overall k going from 1 to m of z n k squared. So these are cyclic groups built according to the decomposition of B Then there are actions alpha one and alpha two of gamma. Of gamma on the Hop algebra O of gb such that I can form an iterated cross product O of gb by gamma O and then I can extend the action again for alpha 2 gamma such that this is m d squared of O of Sn plus and N is a dimension. And isn't dimensional. So very, I guess I have one minute. And there are, you can, you can define actions going the other way. So I can write, for example, actions on this algebra and write the iterative cross product as matrices over this algebra. So maybe. So, maybe in the last minute, let me just say where this comes from. And actually, maybe I'll just say what these actions are. Maybe that's even more useful. So, in the case of here, so when B is MN, right, so remember, O of B, this is really has a fundamental representation given by the tensor square of the fundamental representation of the The fundamental representation of the free unitary quantum group. And what is the action? Alpha 1 on generators, which are essentially coefficients of this, are given by, so I'm being notationally a little sloppy here, but alpha 1 amplified to this thing here is exactly x tensor x bar, where x is the poly x matrix. To the S. I guess I have an alpha one, R S. And then this one is going to be X measure X bar to find shift because it's NN. Sorry? Yeah, so this is the X, yes, it's like the 10,000. And then alpha 2, same thing with Z. Okay? So essentially, the pole. Okay, so essentially the Pauli error basis implements these uh morphisms. And uh I'm out of time, so maybe I will just end by saying like, okay, you know, why does this even come up? And the sort of high-level idea is that the Pauli matrices implement finite-dimensional representations of the Hofgal law objects associated to these mono. Objects associated to these monotonic equivalents of these quantities. And if you look at, for example, the associated linking algebras, you very naturally arrive at kind of matrix embeddings of all these Hoff algebras into each other. And then you can sort of lift them up to finite dimensional, or rather, actions. Big class problem. Thanks to all of these things. I'll stop here. Thanks. Mike, what are the two K theories? Ah, they are. So there's a general formula for this, the trigger K1? I don't remember that. So K0 is for this one, is Z to the N squared. Z to the n squared minus 2n plus 2. And this one here is z to the, or z to the x from zn. And can you recover that result from this? That's something I've wondered about, and I haven't. I was hopeful you could, but then I'm not an expert in K-theory, and I kind of felt that K-theory of cross-products is not really a trivial. Keith theory of cross-products is not really a trivial sector. Sorry? Yeah. You can use claims to all of the microscopes. Yeah, yeah. So, okay, cool. Because Christian's paper is... Is it like a BomCon thing? Yeah, he does BomCon for SUQ2. And do you know what the pairing with how Trace works on these things? It is known. Vanika also has a construction uh that uses uh inclusions of uh yes, right? So how do you play this game for inclusions? Yeah, that's a very good question. Um since we wanted to make up the microphone. Yeah, I I think yeah, that's right. I guess that would be a natural thing. Uh yeah, I actually I never said sub factor, sorry. But these are subfactors of each other now, finite index. Yeah, that's close enough. Question. So, this temporary leaf category is basically representations of quantum like PGA2, yes? Yes. Okay, and so it is known So it is known, so fiber, so qualify quantum fiber factors of this category. And these factors, so if you had the whole category, it would be like Belgium of non-degenerate bilinear form. So this is more or less that. And so these quantum groups correspond to some specific non-degenerate bilinear points on space of dimension M. Points on space of dimension M squared, the subsequent space of dimension dimension B? Yes, I think that I think that is true. They should be maybe these are the question I think. The question is actually important. Yeah. In your case, probably the second minute of matrix by that. I think that's true, but I would have to
