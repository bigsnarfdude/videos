Yeah, so this is a slightly unusual talk for this uh workshop. You know, um Oscar started by saying how good it was, uh good it feels to be among his people. And anyway, sometimes it's also good to be a guest. So this work, I think the best way to proceed is for me to at least say a few words about the motivation. So the motivation comes from something called the Argol conjecture. real violent origin conjecture. And this is a conjecture about half-dimensional embeddings. So at least in some sense, it should be dear to differential topologists, but it's half-dimensional embeddings in a very specific context. So I'm going to use the notation Q for closed, move. And associated to this to such a smooth manifold is its cotangent bundle. The fundamental thing to know about the cotangent bundle is that it is equipped with a canonical one-form called a neutral one form. The easiest way to write the neutral one-form is to decide that you're going to draw the cotential. That you're going to draw the cotangent bundle like this. This is q, this is the conomal direction. And you, coordinates in the q direction are going to be called little q, coordinates, and then the dual coordinates we're going to call p. This is dual coordinates. Now the dual one form is ppq. So you have to interpret. Of course, you have to interpret this in higher dimensions as well. So you write some pi dqr. So this is a one-for-bit, obviously not closed. And it's differential, depending. So this is what's called the canonical symplectic. So here, symplectic, what it means, okay, it's closed, obviously, because now it's closed, because d squared of it is. Because d d squared of is zero. And uh symplantic means that it defines uh um uh an anti-s anti-symmetric pairing on the on the tangent bundle or on the cotangent bundle. So we're some kind of perfectness condition. So this is a symplectic manifold. And you add this word exact because of the property that this two forms These two forms actually have a point. So, our null conjecture is about this and half-dimensional embeddings. So, we're going to consider L, which is a smooth, closed, smooth manifold in dimension N, and an embedding in side t star q. And then what we will impose is the condition that omega restricted to L vanishes. That's when it leads to the Lagrangian. And finally, I arrive at the last condition we will impose, which is we will say that L is exact if lambda restricted to L isn't exact. So it's a lot of words. You may not have seen this before. And now I just want to state the conjecture. And now I just want to state the conjecture and then make some completely. So the conjecture is that any such half-dimensional sub-manifold satisfying this property is in fact isotopic to the most obvious one you can write down. And the most obvious one you can write down is q itself sitting inside t star q. Because if you take lambda and you restrict it to q, you're setting p equals zero. Thanks. Anything's actually watching? Closed? Sorry, I didn't say that there. Anyways, that's a topic. We can actually through exact Lagrangians to the zero section. So if, you know, quite a few people here know stuff about embeddings, and then you can see how strong this condition is. It basically says all the stuff that you guys are interested in, you know, trivializes, and only the trivial example remains. Okay? Any questions? Right, two things? Two things. In particular, one, L is diffeomorphic to Q. And two, something that takes a little bit of work to do, but what you can check is that the Lagrangian condition, so this is not in particular, but a psi. So the Lagrangian condition implies that the pullback of the tangent space of Q to L, if you complexify it, is a canonical isomorphism to the complexification of the tangent space of L. So how am I going to use that? So it implies that this diagram, L to Q to V O to B O to V. BO to BU, the diagram commutes up to canonical homogeneity. Which means that if you then take the map from L to BO given by TL minus TQ, that then lifts the fiber of the matrix. Of the map from BU to BO to BU. And that fiber is U model. This map in general is called the Gauss map. It is a measure of how the tangent space of L is twisted around the tangent space of Q within this tangent space of this sympathetic manifold. And this conjecture implies. And this conjecture implies, this is end of a side now. This whole thing is on the side. Okay? So now end of a side. So conjecture implies that the Gauss map is not. Now, if you ignore this isotopic through existing, the zero is the same. Isotopic through exact Lagrangian, these two conditions would then put you in a place where those people in the audience who like to think about embedding calculus would come very close to trying to figure out whether these two things are actually, these two embeddings are actually isotopics through embeddings. And we've discussed that aim of no embedding calculus, I've known this system now. First, you're supposed to check that isotopics or inversions, and this will give it to you. And then you have to think. And then you have to think a little bit. But to be, you know, even if you had that, you would sometimes get through exactly the logic. What these techniques can be. Any questions? Is it expected it's like unique in some way, the isotopy? I attempted to be a little bit precise about what is. You see, I tried to say it's maybe actually I'm not. Maybe I actually am not good at being precise. So, do I mean, like, what is what choice of dipheomorphism are you using here? You have to figure out how you're, you know, whether things are parametrized or unparametrized. So, anyway, I think the answer is there's no real expectation because nobody has thought about it carefully to understand what should be true. And the HP question exactly is going to be: if it's unique, do we mean unique up to reparametrization or not? No, no, I'll know very well. But the hope is indeed that the That's uh their hope is indeed that there will be a contractible space of such if you set it up right. Okay. So what is no? No, I want to say before no before saying um I want to give just one very basic example for how you produce these things. How do you produce these things? It's going to be a very stupid example. If f from q to r is a smooth function. Then um the graph of D F. The graph of df is subset of t star q. Of course, it is a subset that is diffeomorphic to q by canonical diffeomorphism. And you can check, well, that it is isotopic to blah, blah, blah. So the zero section just by rescaling f. Rescaling f provides an isotope. An isotope. Now, in the last part of the talk, if I get to it, I will describe some construction which in some sense generalizes this, okay? And will give you two, but not one. So whatever I'm going to be describing is. Anyway, so just I want to say this here because it will show up later and at least it illustrates something not true. Now. Now, what do we know? So, we know, first thing we know, this is a result of a long, long march, starting with work of Seymour on spheres. Anyway, so what we know is something that a group of Thomas bought a few years ago, and that is that projection Projection from Q, from L to Q, is a simple homotopy force. So again, already you see that it's not just the conjecture that tells you that the world is very different, the symplectic world. In the symplectic world, they're different from what you expect from differential topology. This is not, you could never get this out of some tangential condition plus half-dimensionality. There's no, so that's the first thing we know about it. And then another thing we know is about this Gauss map. So L, as I said, maps to G1L. As I said, max to do one O is to describe it as B of Z cross B L, which you can then further map to B plus Z cross B to B plus B. What we know is that this map is not. This was, so I think the first time this was proved is also a paper, another paper with Thomas. And we may not have proved this full strength. We may only have proved it after one loop. Shin Jing proved it, I believe, in this strength here. So that is what we do. So the next thing I will say is about this one housing tube space. So one hundred tube space will appear. And let me make sure that I this correctly. Correctly. Here? So I will define. So this is due to Port Thomas. I say Thomas because I assume some of you know him. And Stephanie. So So let T stand for Alhausen's stable two space. I will explain what I mean by this after statement. Yes, I know if the conjecture is true for some specific one. Good question. It's true for S1, it's true for S2. That's all. It's true for this. That's all. It may be no now for the tutorials. But the point is that the most you could hope with current techniques to prove it is to prove it for topological surfaces. And beyond that, it's just beyond hope. Actually, I think for the two torus, it is known, but the isotopy is not known to be through the garachis. Thank you. That's a good question. Okay. Okay. So there is this chip space and there is and there is the rigid optope and let B O T be the rigid F. Again, I don't expect you to know what this is, I will explain, but if you're for experts, this is sometimes called the patcher Hatcher. I'm forgetting. Sometimes has the word hatcher attached to it. Okay. Then there is, if you know, if L is an exactly quantum, closed exactly quantity. Later I will stop saying this. And the map from L The map from L to U mod O that I just talked about here, there is a factorization. So this is, okay, let's exit PO. So this goes to T mod O Hello and yeah, right. So this goes here. So the factorization is I would say. Okay, so what's the map from here to here? Well, just, you know, you see there's a BO here, and it is something that you're quotienting out, like BO. So if you go. out like BO. So if you go from T mod B O to basically like point mod B O, that's B squared O, and that's, since inside here is the component of degree zero. Maybe I can just write that so coromari. So the coromari, I just want to just say that this has consequences. That this has consequences. The corollary, this is basically building on work of Bookshaf. Maybe also Boxhaft, but it's an interesting bookstep. So the map L to U mod O is non-homogeneous. Why is that? Because Bochsted proved that this rigid tube map from the map from BO to T is a rational homotopy equivalence. And then you can use that and then analyze what happens to torsion to then do some work and conclude that this map cannot do anything interesting. Basically, it all comes down to understanding this map. So we wanted to say something, okay? We wanted to say something, okay? Come closer and closer to say that this is possibly trivial. And at least, you know, using some small, small piece of Walthausen's theory, we managed to extract some non-trivial geometric consequences. So now, but what do we really want to do? What we really want to do is use the fact that this is a simple homotopy equivalent. That this is a simple homotopy equivalent to start running the surgery program. To show how And then there is this thing, result, which unfortunately I can only say is in progress. It's been in progress for maybe since before the pandemic. And I will explain exactly why it's still haven't it. So this is a middle. Hey. Where is Camilla? One person. And it says that, oh, maybe I'm just assuming everybody knows surgery. So maybe I won't assume everybody knows surgery, and I will just say just one word here. Here. So, what happens in surgery, little I know of it, is that there is some sequence of sets from some kind of simple spectrum set of Q. This is the space of manifolds over Q. Let's say it's simple to equivalence to Q. So, L is a point in here. And if you have a map over Q, And if you have a map over Q, which is simple homotopy equivalence, then what you can do is you can compare the tangent space of Q and L, take the difference just like I did over there, T L minus TQ. But it turns out that the underlying spherical vibrations are the same. So if you go all the way to G, you have a null homotopy. So therefore, you can lift it fiber. So this maps from Q to G model. And there is something here living in the model. There is something here living in stop in front of it, which is some L group that I know nothing about. Sorry, I just want to be clear. And they appear when you try to actually like to know that the tension bundles are the same. You'd like to do some surgery and middle-dimensional surgery to algorithm to obtain a Cobortism to obtain an H-coordism, and this is where the instructions are. So, everything that I know about this problem, symplectic diffeimorphism problem, it does not manage to recover any information on the left-hand side. It's all about taking here and going there and trying to extract information. So that's what I'm going to do. Okay, so the claim now is that, oh, and then the other thing that I'm going to say is I will remind you that we know that L and Q are simple homogeneous. I will remind you that we know that L and Q are simple homotopy equivalents, so I can just trade Q for L here. It doesn't really matter. And here I stated it in my notes, and L, it doesn't really matter the difference. I can map L to G1O factors through T mod V O T mod V O goes to okay, so Oh, yeah, okay, yeah, this is exactly the way I should do it. BG max zero. Okay, and here, there is something actually shouldn't do that. This I already told you about from the previous thing, but maybe I'll put it over here, because this is where our work is. This map is the Hop map. So the Hop map uses the triple loop spaces. The triple loop space structure of G model. So if you have a space y, then there is a natural map from loop three of y to loop two of y given by loop two of y to loop three of y given by composing with the Hoffman, you just apply it to the fact that this is a triple loop space. So this theorem is in progress because roughly speaking, this map here, which maybe I should also put in the quote, no, the map exists, it's the factorization. This map here was studied by Wachstein and Wolfhausen. But they didn't, they roughly, so they kind of tried to study some map from here to here and showed the factors to Vg cross mod VO. This is something that I'll talk about when I actually describe the tube space, but their factorization is not sufficiently robust to, so they did it at the level of, you know, without taking quotients. They showed that there's a map from T to G, which factors through VG, and we need to show remotely about the action of VO, and that's just part. Lots of coherent. Part. Lots of coherence data. Okay. It is not established. Okay, and if this were true, then you would actually have a non-trivial consequence. So this implies, this would imply, that the image of L thought of as an element of the structure set in model, so this would apply. That the class, that the normal invariant, okay, let's use some fancy words is an is to torsion and in the image of the Hopman. So now some questions. So now some question, probably not exactly for this audience, but like what is the Hoffmap on Gmodo? So you can actually see that this actually doesn't force into these. I asked Mark Behrens at some point, and he showed me that there is some non-trivial element somewhere in terms of the dimension. But there is one thing that nobody yet has managed to give me an example of. Managed to give me an example of. So let me ask him now. Consider the map G mod O to G mod top. So let's not do smooth surgery. Let's do topological surgery in the top category. So, and let's put it together with this diagram. So, is So is the composite V um G mod O to G mod O to G mod ton, which also, of course, factors to like to do it like that helps you, to G ma ton G ma tongue, is this composite null. And again, this is probably also another question. Again, this is probably also not a question for this audience, but I do want to raise it. And the reason that this is tempting to ask is because G Montop was understood by Sullivan to be a product of eigenverton plane spaces, but this product is only a product of eigenverton spaces as a space, not as an infinite loop space. And in order to define these maps, This one. We needed to use the infinite loop space function. Now, I should have spent some time last night reviewing the literature, but I believe that Manson, maybe also Milgram and Mattson, showed that G mod top is a product of Eilenberg complain spaces as a double loop space. Gmod top is G modulated. Maybe PLASP clearances. Too loady, I guess. Yeah, the whole question is too local because I already know that everything. But you are right. Okay? But in fact, they also showed that it is not a product as a triple loop space. So the thing that I care about is exactly the first place where things are non-trivial. Nonetheless, because it is the first place where things are non-trivial, you can hope to compute. I can't hope to compute, but I can hope that somebody can compute that. Okay? So it doesn't Okay? So it doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility for I to either show that this is null or show that it is not null. It's not that often. I mean, it doesn't seem that often, but I don't know how to do it. Okay, so that's the end of the... Yeah, I could have said some of these things yesterday, but it would have taken 15 minutes. So maybe it's better to just do it. Okay, any questions? Okay, so now that I kind of asked my question, let me tell you what two spaces are. Let me tell you what tube spaces are. So a tube is a subset of the sphere, which is two dimensions here, sort of some anti-boundary. Three dimensions. Smooth in this case. Smooth, in this case, doing smooth tubes, there's version PL in the top category. Smooth, dimension, zero, submitful boundary of the sphere. So therefore, the spaces, these tubes, they should have two parameters: one recording the dimension of the sphere that they live in, and one recording, well, something else that we have to say, which is. Say, which is isotopic smoothing to our neighborhood of standard SK inside of Sn. Okay, something like this. The most important thing to know about a tube is that it has a complement, which is also a tube. So, this is what I said. Tubes have a, you know, they have two parameters. There are two parameters: this dimension and this dimension, and there's some kind of duality with this duality, which in this case just takes maths one and considers mistakes. Having defined it like this when I was stating the theorems, I said there is a map, rigid two map, B mod O, a B O to the two space. It's obvious. B O. Oh, sorry, I haven't talked a lot. Oh, sorry, I haven't talked about it. Haven't stabilized yet, but you can do it even if it's stabilizing. But let me just now say. So you can the stable tube space is a collimate of tube spaces with respect to two different kinds of stabilization maps. The first one just takes SK inside Sn and then embeds it in Sn plus 1. Just does that. And the other one does the same thing to the complement. Sorry, the complement. Sorry, the complement is not a tugular neighborhood of the standard embedded S0 in this case. No, so the complement is, so okay, this was not precisely said. The complement of the two is the two, which is isotopic to a neighborhood of Sn minus K minus 1. You take your 2 and you follow the isotopy to the standard, and you do isotopy extension, and you see the complement goes to the other, to the The complement goes to the other, to the to the complement of the standard one, which is the other one, which is a neighborhood of the other one. Does that make sense? Universalized to make expression. So that was two other statements. As we consider some kind of space of tubes, confused, what you do? There is a there is a space of all such. Okay, space of all tubes. Yes, you look at the space of all tubes. Okay, is it the same as space of formatics, model uh different marketing? Uh specific betting of like uh solid uh solid torus probably only stably. Because you th this says that it's not knotted. Right? This is unknotted. Right, but okay. The past component. Um yeah. But you still uh model the different. No, no. I only consider it a subset. No no no no. There's no parametrization. It's considered as a subset. Is considered as a substitute. Okay, so this is the stabilization map does this, and then 2 does the same thing. So take the complement, which of course I could have done in different ways, right? I just like to say it like this. So I don't have to describe two operations. Sn minus k minus 1, sn greater than sn. If you do things carefully, you actually end up with, if you do things carefully, kind of remembering this kind of difference. And then you end up with z times the two space because it's irrelevant to our discussion. It's irrelevant to our discussion. Okay, so now I said that there is a natural, when I was describing things, I said that there is something called the rigid tube map. At your Waldhausen map, that's the word, which is some kind of denooping or looping, maybe delooping of the Hatcher Waldhausen map. And so there is a map. So Stable two spaces are called T, call the T over. We have EO T, which just says I take a linear subspace of, I take Sn, I think of it as the unit sphere inside Rn plus 1. I take a linear subspace inside Rn plus 1. I intersect it, what do I get? I get something which up to rotating back to the standard situation will give me the standard sphere. So this is what is this is called predictive. So this is what is. This is copyrighted. On the other hand, the tube, by definition, is some subset which is homotopy equivalent to the SK, because it's just a tube in a neighborhood. There's a map from this to B. There's always a little bit of... There's always a little bit of, you have to be careful about base points, but stably, base points don't matter. So, what you have is a factorization of the math from BO to BG, which takes the vector number to its underlying spherical vibration through the two space. So, now comes me, so yeah, and then this is what I said while Hochen's. Walt Hutchins showed that this is a, I'm sorry, Bachett showed that this is a rational homosexual importance. Okay, so what I want to explain is that there's a map, so in this kind of box. There's a map, so in this kind of all this stuff about the Hofmap has not appeared. My questions about how to be types of various things, they have to do with the Hoffman. Right now, we don't see what the Hoffmap is doing. No one wants to have it. So to see the Hoffmap, what I have to do is we have to change perspective. You can describe two spaces in an alternative way. So here's the So here's the picture that I could draw. So I'm inside the two-sphere. Okay, now I have some two here. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to decide that infinity is on the boundary of the two. So by infinity I mean I write as a different this perspective for the sphere. This perspective put the sphere. In order for me to see the rigid tube, I put the sphere as the unit sphere. But now I want to take the sphere and think of it as a one-point compactification. So write Sn as Rn minus 0 and think about what your tube space looks like. And in this region, of course, everything is standard, up to some choices which become contractible and go to infinity. So what you can therefore think of as What you could therefore think of as, I'll give an alternative description of 2 as subset of Rn still couldn't mention 2, which outside of the backside. Looks like this. So you have a distinguished, you pick a distinguished coordinate. Inside the compact set, you don't know what's happening. Outside the compact set, you have everything below. That's exactly what these pictures look like here if you invert the sphere inside out and take this point and put it out to infinity. So here you don't know what it is, but what you do know and is isotopic. And is isotopic to what you get when you attach one handle, to a handle of fetches, to a standard handle of fetches. So this picture is the original picture. I believe the one that I said here about spheres, embedded neutral neighborhood of spheres in the sphere is probably the In the sphere is probably due to rawness. At least that's where it first saw it in the literature. This is not exactly how well Pausani describes it, but it's quite close. So what I mean is, so the standard thing would look like this. And if you're curious what the rigid tube map looks like here, what you want to do is you want to have to do something very messy and thinking. Want to have to do something very messy, and thinking about this as like a tangent space at some point, then bend it down and bend it down. It's really quite messy to describe the two together. Okay, so why is this slightly advantageous? Maybe we could just do it the other way. First of all, because it's what we naturally think from the point of view of syntactic technology. So now consider function from Rn to R. R with f inverse or zero, with with you know with tube equals f inverse of minus infinity zero. Okay. So you can now describe this tube as a pipe function and then make it su plus the gradient at infinity. At infinity is linear. In fact, you can just assume that the function is linear. Why do I do this? I do this because now, given this function, consider gradient. This is a map from Rn to Rn. Okay? And I've just basically made Okay, and I've just basically made sure that I can make sense of it so I can extend to infinity. Extend to xn. This is an element of machine. Stable homotopy homotopy series. Um well, stable maps, but it is a sta it is a homotopy equivalence because I assume that the two have one name. Because I assume that the tube has one angle. This is one of my cause. So, okay, so this is called the Wadthausen derivative. And now comes this theorem of Box true. That I mentioned earlier in Waldhausen, which says the map from the two space to Vg, which is just a very stupid map, but accordance homotopy type factors, Vg, this is the Warhausen derivative, and then this is the. And the proof that they give is rather sketchy. Is rather sketchy, but correct, as far as I understand. But its nature is such: when I said there's something in progress, you have to make sure that everything is equivariant with respect to the action of O or here or so on and so forth. And that becomes Okay, great. Sorry, I brought something the wrong way. Sorry, I wrote something the wrong way. Yes, thank you. Yeah. I assume that was just fine. Oh, maybe not. Okay. So, great. So now, what does this have to do with what we started with? Well, when I started, I said exact Lagrangians, and I said here's a very silly kind of example of an exact Lagrangian. You take the function on a sweet manifold and you put the graph of df. And look at the graph of df. And now I'm back where I started. I haven't really looked at the graph of df yet, but that's basically we're looking at the gradients. Same thing. So there's a notion, something called generating family. So now we're back to syntactic topology. So there's something called a generating family family. And it comes in many, many, many, many versions. Exaggeration. It comes in two essential versions. One is where you take some trivial vector bundle and where you take an unfriendly vector bundle. And then we have some new version, which is a twisted version. Let me focus on this. So generative end-way is map from q cross Rn to To ask what you do, just look at this picture. But you can associate to this, you look at the, you can associate to this, like I said before, a Lagrangian, the graph of df which lives inside t star q plus Rn. Exactly I say. But I'm not interested in Rn. But I'm not interested in Rn. Well, I'd like to project this away. But I cannot just project it away. Because if I projected it away, the dimension would be completely wrong. But what you can do is you can intersect with T star Q cross Rn, parentheses like this, which is embedded here. So, what you do is you take the zero section of this Rn direction fiber waves. You look at the points with the gradient in this direction, maybe you think of it as a vertical direction, vanishes. And you look at those points. And that condition exactly ensures that, again, generically, that you have something of dimension equal to the dimension of Q, and then you project. And what you get, and what you get is an And you got this inverse of Roman channel in general. It is not too hard to show that such an immersive branching always has trivial Gauss loss. The point I want to make is that the functions that, you know, if you just do this, the fact that Rn is not compact means that you have no control at infinity. And that is related to the fact that this immersed Lagrangian that you get, you don't have much control over. There's very little. There's very little room for trying to prove it's embedded. In fact, more precisely, you know, we have some way of defining some third-the-tick invariant, whatever, or Morse theoretic invariant. Oh, let me just say it like this: the easiest way to say it. There is no way to do Morse theory with a function like this unless you impose something in the trends. Now, Giroux proved the converse, which means he showed that if the Gaussian line is trivial, trivial Gaussian. Schindler does not implies that there exists a generating function, but with no control in the field. And while I let me stick to this case, because it's going to make life harder. I mean, you know, otherwise I have to say some words about twisting and I will do it just first I want to say first the simplest statement. Simplest statement. The first thing we prove, first result we prove, is that if you, so he proved the converse, i.e. trivial Gauss map here for immersed Lagrangian, proves that if the Lagrangian is embedded, which is the case we care about, Still with this Gaussian at this function, then the function on Rn can be chosen to be fiberwise of two type L. What does it mean for something to be of tube type fiberwise? It means exactly what I said before, which is it is a function whose, which is smooth, which has some nice property of infinity, and whose sub-level set is a tube in the sense of Waldhouse. So, conclusion. So, L, exact Lagrangian L. Exact Lagrangian L, then, but you have to be exact. Here, also, proved converse, true flagasma for exact inverse Lagrangian. L, blah, blah, blah, exactly, gives rise to a map from Q to 2C. All the statements that I had, I swapped back and forth between L and Q. But if you try to be precise here, this would be the geometry. Be precise here because geometry is important, not just things of tomatopy, the map actually will go for each other. So, this means that banishing of the Gauss map condition, of the Gauss condition allows you to use the full tools of, in some naive sense, Morse theory, blah, blah, blah. But there's something much more powerful than using Morse theory, which is to actually think about the homotopy theory, what's going on. The last thing that I will say is that one of The last thing that I will say is that what happens if the Gauss map is non-trivial? So, as I said here, if the Gauss map is non-trivial, you cannot have a map to the two space. That is impossible. Chrome gives you an obstruction. By the way, if you're over here and you know that the Gauss map is trivial, then this gives you a further lift of the normal invariant. lift of the normal invariance to if the vector bundle is trivial by the energy model. So if it's non-trivial, then you could try to measure its non-triviality. What does that mean? Well, you know, it's non-trivial, so it's nothing down to u mod O. Okay, but you see, again, L and Q are how much of the equivalence. Let's take nothing there, Q to U mod O. And as I said before, U mod O is 3. And this is something which map from here to here might be thought of. From here to here might be thought of as some kind of twisted vector bundle or twisting for vector bundles. I'm not quite confused about how to say this. Which means you can, so now we can just now we have to at some point we have to do some geometry. You can't do just how much theory. It's like. To just tell me to be theater. It's like only eating salad. So you have a cover, okay, dessert, whatever you want to call it. Something that you choose. So you have a cover of Q, you have some linear algebraic data, trivial vector space, you have the usual transition functions. But then over here, cosycle condition doesn't hold. Fails. But its failure is controlled by optimists. Okay. So if you have such a thing, then you could try to do the same thing as before. Then on each patch of q. You can look at Qi cross Rn and apply the generating function philosophy to that. At some point we have to think about this Z. In the world, this is Z doing, but it means that Z doing actually is that there's also some kind of change of dimension. You may have to raise dimension as we go through. So, fine, look for, consider. Look for, consider a generating function on each of these. And then have the generating functions vary when you, on the overlaps, have some comparison on the overlaps, which again is not going to satisfy a strict comparison, but rather compare a strict comparison relative to this changes of Changes of coordinates that are given to you by the maximum script. The degree on overlaps the maximum script. I'm not being good at this last bit. Again, it should probably be B is equal to B. And this notion And this notion is what we call a twisted generating function. And the first thing we proved is that every Lagrangian, whether it has a trivial Gauss map of or not, immersed Lagrangian, whether it has trivial Gauss map or not, has a twisted generating function. This is the twisted analog of Gieloux's result that I mentioned to me here. And then, if it happened to be embedded, then you could assume that this twisted Then you could assume that this twisted generating function was such that fibrilized it was of two type. And then, where do you land? You land in T mod B O, where B O is this, where you two, because that's the ambiguity that you're allowing yourself when you're jumping. Okay, so that's more or less the end of my talk. Thank you. Any questions? Questions? So I still try to understand the cube space. So, like, in a finite dimensional approximation, isn't it the same as the different marquism of the sphere quotient by different marquism that preserved Taurus quantifies the under curves? I don't know. I'm not saying no, I said I don't know. But it's kind of hard to understand. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense that I try not to make statements about high-dimensional topology because I haven't thought about it. About high-dimensional topology because I haven't thought about it enough about it. I'm using it. Talking about high-dimensional topology, the map from the part of the cube space that is relevant to you probably is only somewhat finite-dimensional, right? No, because L is mapping to it. Right. No, you're mapping from a compact space. Right, but what I mean is the tubes that you construct geometrically are going to be. That you construct geometrically are going to be of somehow like twice the dimension of the thing you start off. Is that? No. No. There is no a priori bound on how high a dimension you have to go to when you study Lagrangian. Even if you fix the dimension of the Lagrangian? Even for one and two. Actually, probably even for one, I could. No, yes. No. You cannot bounce. Yes. That's really cute. So, yeah. This is really cute. So, yeah, if you, okay, this is a hilarious thing. So, if you do like Morse theory on a manifold of dimension n, you only see critical points of index zero and up from zero up to the dimension, okay? But if you do, okay, so now I'm going to use some words. If you do flir theory on T star S1, which is basically some model of this, just this story here of just T star S1, you see things of arbitrary index. You can just wind around like this and raise. Wind around like this and raise the index arbitrarily. So even on the circle, we have to go up to infinity. Great question, because I didn't know the answer when you asked. There's some version of the space of Lagrangian so that all of this is like level construction for a single Lagrangian, but yes, everything. So this has not been done yet. This has not been done yet with two things of two type. There is a much stronger constraint that was imposed by Ellisberg and anyway, there's a non-really, when I said there's many notions, really are many notions. But anyway, Gromoff studied some version of this generating function stuff, and they show something like there is a SAR vibration, okay, whose base is the space of immersed, of embedded Lagrangian and whose total space. Lagrangian and whose total space is immersed Lagrangian together with the choice of generated Lagrangians. We don't know much about what the fiber looks like. But yes, there is space-level versions of what I'm saying. I just did it for one of them. And the obvious thing, since you were asking, the obvious thing to ask, I'm not going to do space-level. I'm just going to say, like, pi one. What is the pi one question you may want to ask? Which is a great question to think about. If I take the zero section, okay, which is the one, the one. Which is the one, the one sort of manifold that I know. And I move it in the space of exact Lagrangian embeddings, and I bring it back upset, I will get a diffeomorphism. What constraints in this diffeomorphism satisfy? Of course we're going to say it's isotopic to the identity. It's smoothly isotopic to the identity. That would be the s that would be, no, there was a question at some point, but uh We know there was a question at some point, but is this space contractible? Okay, so this is what you would want to know. First thing you'd want. We don't know. Of course, it's pretty clear from what I said that if you take this perspective on the tube space, you will get some information about what we could do. Beyond that, I don't have much to say. Any other questions? Just
