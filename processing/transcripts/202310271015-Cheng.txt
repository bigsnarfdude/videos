Many thanks to organizers. I'm very glad to be here to give this lecture. My English is not good, so please take a take a check. Okay, let me start. Let me start. My title is personalizations and KP integrable systems. Are we all I will give this talk from the following aspects. Firstly, I will give some backgrounds and then give personalizations for AKP, BKP, CKP, and DKP. Then I will report some recent results from me. And last, I will give some discussions. Firstly, personalizations is very Personalizations is very important in mathematical physics. There's one book written by this professor, the first professor in US. In his book, there are many collections for the articles of Bosnia editions. Here, we are only interested in are only interested in the personalizations in integral systems. Here I will list three typical ones. The first is Boson Forminan correspondence, which is the famous work in Q2 school given by Sato, Jimbo, David Jimbo, Mewa, Kashwaro, and Mewa. The second is the cast Second is the cast and one loop. It is the super boson forming correspondence. And the last is a boson correspondence. Maybe I will show you the first one. The first one. The first one is the chart from chartered free for me only for me charted free formulas. performance, which is given by the first line, the first line. And their relations are the second line, at the second line. The major element is the cosmere operator, which is in the third line, in the third line, and another important element is the fermionic focus piece. Then, space then the the kp hierarchy is given by uh give is given here is given here uh this is a the very famous uh kp theory i called this equation is the fermionic kp hierarchy and next i will use different personalizations to give different equations different equations uh in order to show personalizations uh Personal details. The useful tools is the lattice vertex algebra. Lattice what is algebra is given by by the second the second line. The second line. The second line means lattice vertex algebra is unlinear space equivalent with equivalent with with one space. with one special multiplication multiplication. And the multiplication is given by the first line. The first line. First line. Here, the basic fields, basic fields are showed here. So for the first personal additions, first personal additions, I will use the lattice, only one lattice, lattice. only one lattice lattice uh generated by by v uh the inner product uh of v and v is uh is one is one in this case the bosonite uh the the boss uh the fermionic fog space can be identified uh with the with another uh bosonic fog space uh and the correspondence is given by is given uh in this line is given In this line, it's given in this. In this case, this case, we can obtain the Euro KP hierarchy. This is the first personalization. While for the second personalization, here we only relabels, only relabels of the ferminants, uh, the formulas. For example, this is only one one kind of relabels, uh, relabels. kind of reliables are reliables. In this case, we need we need the lattice. The lattice is a two-dimensional lattice, two-dimensional lattice. In this case, we can identify the fermionic foxpiece with another bosonic fox piece. In this case, the toe function is given by the second line from the bottom. line from the bottom from the bottom so in this case the kp hierarchy the the formionic kp is the two component uh two is the two total lattice hierarchy uh so you can see uh so so you can so so you can see you can see if i use different uh different personal efficiency if i use different personal efficiency we can obtain different uh different integration different integral about systems next I will introduce similarly we can obtain the BKP as a BKP the BKP the for me only BKP is the is the third line from the bottom from the bottom and if I use the if I use another personalization you should for example personalization you should for example the personalization three we can obtain the small pcapie this is the urally this is the euro big ip here big up here while if we we use this if i if i i still relabel and relabel uh relabel the formula uh we can obtain we can obtain the large package a lot because you can see this is another big large peak action large bkp is first Large BKIP is firstly introduced in Jinbo Mewa's original paper and also named by Hayota and Ota called KP, called a couple of KP. Recently, the Lux equation, the Lux equation is given by Krita and Dubluti or so forth. Sorry, the L L plus and minus, the Lux of Richard is something. The luxury is something wrong because it is u lambda inverse. The second line from the bottom should be u lambda lambda plus inverse inverse. This is only the plus is correct. The negative is wrong. The negative should be u lambda inverse and the sum should be uj minus lambda j. Lambda J, Lambda J. This is the correct one. Their constraint is given by this, this is part of this. In fact, this large BKP is one special case, is one special case given by me and Professor Miranoffo, Miranoffo, which we called it D-type total. E-type total. total uh a large bkp is uh connected with uh with the two component dkp uh by uh by gauge uh by by this gauge transformation by this gauge gauge transformation uh you can see if i use this gauge transformation such that such that the first of the first one the first first lux operator l plus the coefficient is one is one is one then we can obtain uh obtain Overtin uh the constraint of the constraint or two component two component totem uh in this way one two three four five in five line in five line five line and the toll functions related with the totem by this way by this way this is given by by subludin and he's a phd student sorry and and the last is a is the example for large equipment another Another important KP is the C-type KP. In my opinion, there are three types of toll functions. The first toll function is given original paper inherited from KPM. In original paper in transformation, the series paper six. series paper six six uh uh uh it is said that it is said that the toll function the total top function can be constructed by uh by uh by three bossons uh three bosons so uh so so so wonderloo all of and shirota uh construct it in this way but their the butter their their top functions um requires uh in quite inquires In quite a super available, I will introduce. So later, Professor Chang and Chao Jong Wu gave the unique tau function, a unique tau function. This is nonlinear. This is nonlinear. We cannot write it into Hiruta bilinear form. We cannot return. In fact, by relations among But relations among them should be this. Firstly, the Kp tau function, also sorry, sorry, that's a square. Sorry, there's some relation should be there's a square here, there's a square here, the square here, the square here. This is a That's where here. This is given by me and my professor and my tutor. And recently, I found I found the top 31 and the top 51 and also others can be expressed by Tau zero, can be expressed by Tau zero. So so the professor Chao Jung Wu conjecture We said that just mentioned that there should be this relation. This should be this relation. You can see this the CKP top function should be the expectation vacuum value value in worse inverse should be. So for the personality So for the person additions or CKP, we can there's the following ways. The first we can we can we can use three formulas in this way from this way. You can see this is the you can see the first line is the it is constructed by free for formulas by free formulas. So so so so the So so so the corresponding uh focus base is the subspace subspace. In this case, this is the Euro secret here. Also, this is a piece is suggested by Q2 school, suggested by Qtus Go just use three bosons, three bottoms. Free bottoms, you can see this is the this is the bosonic CK. CKP. Personic CKP. If I use this kind of personalization, this is just the one low follow Shiota. This is just the Euro capital. Here you can see, here you can see the T the T half, a half order number, T half order number is super variable. T half order number is a super variable. So this is this is the in this. the the the in this case see is just one special uh it is a sub hierarchy of super big because because this comes from super big sub here so top zero to just let t head to be zero uh while t three one just differentiate this top function with respect to t one half and t one over three and then let t head And then let t hat equal zero equals zero equals zero. This is this personalization. Another personalization we can use FM personalization. In this case, we can obtain another kind of CKF, another kind of CKF. This is for the C case. At last, we are introduced to the DD D case. The D case is. The decays is quite similar. You can see the first line is just the fermionic decoupling. If I also use different personalizations, we can obtain different integrable systems. Firstly, if I use the first one is given by Professor Yu. Yu. This is the first personalization. You can see. You can see, see, in this case, BKP is just the small BKP. In the second case, we can rotate in omega 0 or omega plus and omega minus. This is the charged formula, charged free formulas. And the boss narrative and the 10, we can express the omega d in terms of neutral formulas. Of the neutral formulas, a neutral forminence. This is a two component of BKP. And the last one is just the DKP. I mentioned to given by me and Professor Miranova. This is the first notation of detection. Recently, I use this kind of source to do some things. Firstly, I studied performing. I studied performing from ionic double transformations. The secondly, I constructed a constraint, two components, coordinate tota. And the secondly, I studied the symmetries for large big IP. And the last, I showed the equivalence of SL2 integral hierarchies. Firstly, you can see that for me oniciate. me only cap for me on only peak cap for me only cap uh i i uh if i set uh if i set toll one equals um uh equals the beta plus toe beta plus toll then bit plus tau is just just the new is just the new new toll function just the new toll function and the in lux of return in lux of return it is a corresponding point t dq tdq is just the elementary double transformation double transformation operator operator this is a just the uh just this result is it is no it's not new it's not new uh but here i i want to i found i found uh for founder for for for found this uh uh expectation a vacuum value uh well expectation a vacuum value a view value v u v v this kind of piece for formulas this kind of thing formulas this kind of thing formula because i because i i i know i know it is very important for for for for this vacuum expectation value uh vacuum expectation value this is very important and usually beta plus and and beta minus is mixed are mixed not in this order and not in this not in this order or not in this order not in this order not in this order order but now i can i can use a use use the method of double transformation a double transformation to to to to compute to compute this kind of kind of values for for example i use the use this you can see you can see for beta two plus beta beta one one uh beta one plus it is equal Bit one plus it is equals q q to one q to q to one is just the just the transformed eigenfunction eigen function after the after the elementary elementary track elementary double operator TDQ1 and TDQ1. So in this case, this case I just you use this just you just you use this we can we can find it is it is the it is the raw ski it is just But the ROWSKI is just raw skip. You should very easy if we use the results from double transformation. So for general case, I just show for N greater than K case, it is the generalized. If I change, for example, if I change the beta 1 minus and beta n, beta n plus beta n plus, beta n plus, the result is the same. The result is because you can see omega is the integral because integral constant can be allowed, can be allowed. While in double transformation, beta one plus and beta n beta n. beta n uh beta n beta n plus and beta beta one minus uh can be exchanged uh can be exchanged so so use uh use kp dot kp double we can compute this kind of value this kind of value this is the first reason and the second this is the constraint kp uh just uh mentioned by by professor perhaps young i i use this kind of uh the constraint the constraint capital last formulation is in the second line is in the second line and the and the bilinear form the bilinear form is given by by the second part and the corresponding fermionic pattern is the is the last is the last part is the last part so if i use another personalization if i use another personalization we can obtain the constraint on total on total On total, on total. I only compute one case, only compute one case equal to two. This is the second result. And the third, the third, I computed to the symmetry for large BKP. It showed this. The other SVM formula, the connected exchange of symmetries on view function and top. view function and and the tau functions and the top functions it is given this way uh the juici the important uh important formula is just this lemma just use the just you use the personalizations it is okay another another is i showed uh so so so showed the so showed the the cost work motor construction is equivalent to to to this i just showed these these two bilinear equations are equivalent are equivalent equivalent are equivalent equivalent uh this is the very result so uh so uh so so so now i will come the last uh the last section uh for uh if i uh the personalizations in my opinion personalizations can link can link different different types of toe functions different types of toe functions and and the second it should be some some non-linear transformations Some nonlinear transformations, but the explicit form cannot be easily obtained. And the third, the third, the third, there should be some geometrical illustrations, illustrations. And the last one and the relations with some other areas. So the best contents are all. The contents all I will end this lecture for this podcast. So, the new contents is not it is very seldom. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much.
