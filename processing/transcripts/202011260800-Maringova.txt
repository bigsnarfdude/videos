Thank you very much for the invitation. I would also like to thank, of course, the organizers for the chance to present this result in such a beautiful conference. I will try to present more results, but I will focus more mostly on the dynamic slip boundary condition, but I will also mention another result. So altogether, I will be presenting joint results with Anna. Presenting joint results with Anna Abatiello from Teu Berlin and together with Miroslav Bulicek and Josef Malek from Prague. These are the two papers which are submitted for now. So the first one is more concerning on the maximal monotone graph theory on the implicit constitutive relations. And the second one is more focused on this dynamic slip boundary. On this dynamic slip boundary condition. So, in general, what I will be talking about: so, we study flow of homogeneous incompressible fluids in bounded Lipschitz domains in 3D. And such flows are described by a system which consists of balance equations, initial conditions, boundary conditions, and constitutive relations. And our main emphasis will be given on the On the specific boundary condition and on constitutive on the formulation of constitutive relations. Regarding notation, we will use V for velocity. This was all already presented in some of the previous talks, so I don't need to, I expect that I don't need to go into details. So as I mentioned before, the boundary condition, the specific boundary condition. The boundary condition, the specific boundary condition which we will use is called dynamic boundary condition and implicit constitutive relation. Somehow to explain what we call dynamic boundary condition and to motivate why we want to study it is that this is some effect which is well known in the chemical sciences in many years, and it is that under transient flow. That under transient flow, the slip of the molecules of polymer molecules close to the boundary is different from the one in the bulk. And somehow, due to the structure of the polymers, delayed slip is observed. It means that the slip is not, it depends on the path deformation, and due to that. Due to that, what we know, the models which we usually know, and here I will call them static slip models, are not enough to describe such phenomena. So as I mentioned, in the chemical science, this phenomena is well known since many years. And there were also, the chemists were proposing several models to describe such a flow. To describe such a flow, basically the common thing is that they include the time derivative of velocity in the constitutive in the boundary condition. And you can see examples of few models. So basically what we are trying to do with implicit boundary condition is to relate the shear stress, which is the small s and the velocity on the boundary. Velocity on the boundary by a maximal monotone graph. For the Navier slip, they are related in linear relation. And here is also the time derivative of velocity. So these are the three models, and you can see they are quite specific. And usually, what chemists were trying to do, they were trying to fit the mathematical functions or the models such that they follow experimental data. They follow experimental data. And for one given model, okay, so this motivation is taken from this paper by Hadik Riakos from 2012. There is also this image where you can see why this dynamic model is useful. So if we are only using the no-sleep condition, then we do not follow. We do not follow the experiment, which is this bolt line. And the static slip, which is this small one here, also is not capturing this overshoot here. So only with the use of the dynamic slip model, they were able to obtain this overshoot here. However, they need, well, okay, it needs to be fitted such that it corresponds, but you can. But you can already see on this picture that this dynamic slip is the best way to capture such phenomena. So these are the examples from the chemical science and we were trying, so what was our motivation was to provide existence analysis for reasonably, mathematically reasonably formulated dynamic slip condition. And this is the model. And this is the model which we consider. So, of course, we consider the balance loss, which are given. These are our boundary and initial conditions. So, it's just given V0 on the boundary. We have one condition, and this is the second one. So, this is what we put emphasis into. Also, implicit constitutive equations, this is related. So, we have implicit real logic condition and implicit boundary. Biology condition and implicit boundary conditions. And here, instead of the usual shear stress, we have this artificial function, we call it sigma. And this is the way to relate this part of the boundary condition to velocity. So you can see that in the previous slide, it was directly velocity and time derivative of velocity related to s. And here we have s related to sigma and time derivative of velocity, and this sigma is implicated. velocity and this sigma is implicitly related to velocity. Inside the domain, we will consider maximal monotone R graph for R between 6 over 5 and infinity. And on the boundary, this is mainly for simplicity. We only consider two graph. And alpha and beta are parameters which play the role in this boundary condition. So we assume they're non-negative. And this is the definition of maximal monotone R graph. So you could already see the definition was also well explained in the talk of Professor Silly on Tuesday. So what we call maximal monotone R graph, when origin is in the graph, its monotone, it's maximal, and it's R coercing. Three and as I mentioned before, our A is maximal monotone R graph and B is maximal monotone 2 graph. In general, this R can be between 1 and infinity, but due to convective term, we will have this restriction for 6 over 5. What is the first new result which I wanted to show, which is, I think, Which is, I think, extremely beautiful, but super technical. So, I don't want to talk about the details. But still, I want to present it. So, we found the equivalent characterization of this maximal monotone graph via a given implicit function. So, if we have an implicit function g, which is Lipschitz continuous, and g zero zero is equal to zero. 0, 0 is equal to 0. And if G satisfies these conditions, so G2 has these restriction assumptions on the derivatives of G and G three, so it's concerning these expressions, and G4 is related to coercivity. We are able to prove. Uh, we are able to prove lemma that uh then the new points of G define maximal monoton R graph. Somehow, just briefly, so this is clearly corresponding to A1 condition that originates in the graph. This is corresponding to the monotonicity condition. This G3 together with continuity gives us the maximality condition, and this is also very clear that G4. And this is also very clear: the G4 corresponds to coercivity in the maximal monotone graph. So, thanks to this characterization, we believe it's much easier for the numerical science to work with the maximal monotone graphs because these conditions are easier to verify than the general conditions of the maximal monotone graphs. There is also one new thing in this approach, in our approach. And that is that usually when people work with maximal monotone graphs, it was there is an assumed existence of a selection, it means the borel measurable mapping, which satisfies this, such that the graph can be described by this mapping. However, in our definition, we were able to avoid such an assumption, and this is thanks to the fact that any Thanks to the fact that any general R graph A, possibly without such a measurable selection, we are able to approximate by a Lipschitz continuous two graph A epsilon epsilon, which is also uniformly monotone, which means that this approximating graph has a beautiful selection with which we can work. And how to define this approximating graphs? So it's a two-level approximation. So first we shift in one variable and then in the second. And using this approximation, we are able to construct this approximate well. We are able to approximate this general graph without selection. This is approximating graph lemma, but I will go because I want to talk about this dynamic slip condition. So, this was the first result which we obtained together with Joshu Malek and Mira. And now, concerning the dynamic condition, which is from the paper with Anna Abatello, is now that what we called before static sleep now corresponds to beta equal to zero, such that we don't see this time derivative. Derivative, and we call dynamic sleep condition where this beta is non-zero, so it's strictly positive. Also, in what follows, we will not consider this case of beta equal to zero. We only assume that beta is non-zero, such that we don't need to compute it separately always. And anyway, this case of beta equal to zero is already. Is already well studied in the paper by Prague-Warsaw collaboration. And one can see that, okay, just to join, somehow bring it closer to what we are used to seeing, is that if sigma is equal to V, which is of course a very special case of a two graph, then we have this. Two graph, then we have this boundary condition, and we can talk about the perfect sleep, navigate sleep, no slip, and finally dynamic sleep depending on these parameters, alpha and beta. And from now on, we will only consider this dynamic slip where both alpha and beta are positive. This is a simple example in very simple geometry, very explicit solution. Explicit solution. We are able to compute the explicit solution is the case when we have two infinite plates. One of them stays in the position and the upper one is moving. So the height of the on zero level and this is on age level. And what we do that we will go with this delta to zero. So in the beginning, the plate starts. The plate starts to accelerate very quickly until it reaches velocity one and then it continues with this velocity. So this is the simple example. Then the system looks like this, which is clear only in here. I would mention that we consider this somehow relative velocity of the fluid, where this real velocity from this. velocity from this real velocity we subtract the velocity of this plane such that such that this is what we are interested in and of course we are interested in this effect as delta goes to zero such that such that there is place for this for this overshoot somehow it's it's more visible than delta goes to zero so in the limit we study In the limit we study, we study 1 minus UTH. So we are able to construct explicit solutions, solution in terms of Fourier series, which we call U. And what we want to study is the monotonicity of the response of this explicit solution against the stationary solution. So we want to study this is on this boundary, the one. This boundary, the one minus u bar is the stationary solution, and this is our explicit solution. And since we computed it explicitly, we have this formula. And what we can see from here is that the sign of this formula is given by this term. So for each i, the sine of each element is given because this is positive, this is positive. Is positive. And we know, which is also computed in the paper, is that this eigenvalue scale basically as a natural numbers. And due to this term, we can see that the first terms for the smallest values of lambda i, the first terms are the most important ones. And also we can see that the number of the terms for which this term is negative. Which this term is negative is given by this expression. And so, what we do is that we provide simulations to see effect of these parameters, alpha and beta. So, we study alpha over beta equal to 1 over 4 equal to 20 equal to plus infinity. And you can see that this is chosen exactly such that in the first case, 1 over 4. Case 1 over 4, this means that there are no negative terms. If there are no negative terms, it means all of them are positive. It means that the stationary solution is always greater than the exact solution, explicit solution, and the explicit solution is approaching the stationary solution from below. In the case when alpha over beta is equal to 20, we have four, the first four terms are negative and the others are positive. Are negative and the others are positive, and you could see the dynamic effect on the second in the second case. And this, in fact, corresponds to beta equal to zero, which is the Navier slip. So the last one will be the Navier slip, and we can see that all terms are negative, and it will be, so this expression is strictly greater than the stationary one, and it will be approaching the stationary solution from above. And in the second syllable, And in the second simulation, we fix alpha, which means the stationary solution for all three solutions will be the corresponding stationary solution will be the same, and we will only study the dependence on the parameter beta. So this is the first simulation. As I mentioned, in the first case, this is strictly increasing and approaching its stationary solution. In the second case, In the second case, this is the dynamic slip, so we can see the overshoot here. And in the last case, this is the Navier slip. So there is this jump as delta goes to zero. So this is already as delta goes to zero. And we can see that this is strictly decreasing. So this is the first simulation, and the second one, where we study the effect of beta. So this gray one is the stationary solution, and you can see that as And you can see that as before, alpha over beta is equal to here, it is equal to six, and I well, now it's dashed, so it's this one. So, for the small beta, the jump is bigger, for bigger delta. Well, and you can also see that for smaller beta, the solution approaches the stationary one faster. So, this is for the simulation. So, this is for the simulations and to some analysis. So, from a priori estimates, okay, so this cancels, this cancels if we test by phi. And if we substitute for the boundary condition, we obtain this alpha, sigma, beta, and time derivative. And what is crucial in the analysis is that we want to find a Gelfran triplet such that such Such that this defines the scalar product in H, and also duality on VR will be generalization of this color coder. So these are the spaces which we need to use. So this is how we define the spaces, such that we can construct Galerkin approximations with which we can Uh, with which we can converge, then I see it's not easy to fit within 20 minutes. Uh, yes, so after all, this is our a priori estimate. This is definition of weak solution and it exists. I would just to also like to like to briefly go through remarks on the proof. Briefly go through remarks on the proof. So, how to prove the result? So, first we construct basis which is orthogonal in V2, orthonormal in H, and we define this corresponding Galerkin approximations. We approximate the general R graph without selection by a Lipschitz continuous two graph. And we also approximate the problem such that we cut off the convect two term, such that in this case, we are able to converge. In this case we are able to converge with graphs to these general graphs and after all we use a Lipschitz approximation method to converge in the graph with this cutoff term. So this is the first approximating problem where we have these beautiful graphs and the cutoff function and the second level approximation is already with general graphs and the cutoff function and then we only converge in delta. Converging delta standing on the backs of the giants, so to converge with delta to zero, we use the results of bright deanning, Schwarza, her deaning, Ruzica, Wolf, and King and Luis. And this is all what I wanted to say. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, Erica.
