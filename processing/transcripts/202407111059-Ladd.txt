 Okay, so thanks for the invitation to come and talk. I apologise in advance that my talk is not particularly connected to the main topics of the workshop, but it does have a little bit to do with reactions and transport. So we see many beautiful cave formations. Many beautiful cave formations in nature. And you might think to ask the question, where do they come from? except that the answer to that's been known for about 200 years. And it's described beautifully, qualitatively in that statement by Lyell. It's not really Lyell's ideas, they're even older than Lyell, the end of the 18th century. But the crucial thing underlying that is the notion. That is the notion that the forces that shape the Earth are the same as in existence today. So, the same chemistry and physics that shape the Earth, for us today that's completely natural. That was a very controversial idea in those times. So, what I want to talk about is reactive transport modeling, which could be thought of as trying to make Lyell's vision a quantitative. And I'm going to focus on fractures in this talk because fractures dominate thermal transport on the subsurface. And the sort of motivation to developing reactive transport modelling in the last 30 years was mainly that the geochemists couldn't explain rates of weathering just based on the laboratory measurements of reaction rates. So their reaction rates would be like a thousand times too fast when compared with a field measurement. Compared with our field measurements, and that's fairly obviously to do with the transport of reactants. So if we want to think about fracture dissolution, then we can begin with the chemistry. So we can do more or less any representation for the reaction of the mineral surface. Here's one of the simplest, which is quite applicable to dissolution of calcite in neutral or very In neutral or very weakly acidic waters, or dissolution of gypsum or pure water. So there's just a reaction rate that's proportional to the under saturation of the calcium ions. And that has to couple into the transport equations. So that comes via a boundary condition on the fracture surfaces that we have to balance the rate of production of the calcium ions with the flux of calcium ions away from the surface. And at the same time, we have to move the surface. Same time, we have to move the surface because it's dissolving, and so the motion is normal, proportional to the reaction rate, and to the molar volume of the rock. And the important thing there is that the molar volume of the rock is much smaller than the molar volume of the aqueous ions. So there's this factor that comes into the equations, which is basically saturation times the molar volume, which is much less than one. That means that it dissolves very slowly, so all the transport is basically steady-state. The transport is basically steady state. So it's really a waste of computing to try and put time-dependent terms in the Fourier transport. So solve them as steady-state things. So you can simplify those 3D equations quite a lot by just integrating over the aperture and making use of the fact that a fracture has a very large aspect ratio. The fracture itself is big of the order of meters or tens of meters. The order of meters or tens of meters, whereas the aperture is very small, like a millimeter or less. So if we integrate over the aperture, then in the simplest case where there's only a one-dimensional variation, then mass conservation means that the velocity integrated over the aperture, this thing Q, which is the same thing as in Fregorac's talk, is a constant. And so then you can integrate. And so then you can integrate the concentration equation, making the assumption that the rate of reaction is fairly small, so the concentration is basically uniform across the aperture. And then you get an exponential decay of concentration. And you can integrate that again to figure out what the height profile looks like. And it basically goes linearly in time. There's an important parameter that comes into this, which is this penetration length LP, which is basically. LP, which is basically telling you how far the reactant gets inside before the solution is fully saturated. And that comes out to be less than a meter. And that's sort of interesting because that tells you that within a meter, there's no more dissolving power. So then how do you get conduits that can be up to like 100 kilometers, 100 kilometers long? And that was known as the cave paradox. And one possible solution to that is the fact that these. Solution to that is the fact that these 1D equations are unstable to perturbations in the aperture. So, what happens is that any tiny perturbation gets amplified exponentially. You get sinusoidal fingers, which grow into much sharper ones. So, they're the initial sinusoids. You get these fingers, and as the fingers extend, they shield their neighbours from the They shield their neighbors from the flow, so the neighbors don't get enough flow and they basically die out. So it's the concentration that you're seeing there, and you're seeing that the concentration that neighbor ones dies. So there's an interaction length over which it shields, which is proportional more or less to the length of the channel. So you get this hierarchical growth pattern where the number of conduits or whirlholes is a given length is proportional to the inverse of the length. Okay, so if we look at some natural formations, then one of the things you see here, so this is, I've never seen another picture like this with such a huge circular conduit. But what you notice there, the little yellow arrows are pointing to, I think, fracture lines. So this suggests that this thing grew out initially out of a fracture, which expanded in the sort of way you saw in that bootleg, and then became. Bootlep and then became its tubes. Another example here of two wormholes quite widely separated, and you can see the fracture line that connects them. So this suggests that these are downstream of the inlet, and so there's been a fair amount of competition between the wormholes, so they're quite widely spaced. On the other hand, the picture below is at the inlet, and there you see that the wormholes are much closer together. Are much closer together. So that's consistent with that picture that we had on the previous waver. So thinking about how we go from fractures to tubes, so I was looking at this problem with my postdoc then, Vitaly Stachenko, and we wanted to do these things with 3D simulations because fractures, especially as they develop into these conduits, are really three-dimensional objects. Dimensional objects. So we Vitali wrote this code based on OpenPhone to simulate this. And the important things about the code are that the interface conforms to the fractured boundaries. So points on the mesh correspond exactly to points on the fractured boundary. So that means that there's no interpolation from one mesh to another, there's no volume of fluid or any of those other things which introduce quite significant variables. Quite significant barriers. We can also make an efficient meshing of very high aspect ratios. So, fractures, if it's 10 meters wide and it's 0.1 millimeters, it's 10 to the 5 to 1 aspect ratio. So, if you're going to do that in a reasonable amount of time, you need to have elements with very high aspect ratios as well. And that can only be only be done if you have hexahedral cells, because otherwise the skew just makes it impossible. Just makes it impossible. So, what we did, we made use of the finite volume discretization of OpenAFO so that we could both use these hex cells and also make use of the fact that the conservation laws are maintained exactly. So, in finite volume, you basically integrate the equations over the control volume, and so you land up with fluxes on the faces, and whatever you take out of one cell goes into the other cells, and no matter how accurately or inaccurately you can. Accurately or inaccurately, you calculate the flux, the field itself is conserved. And then, of course, the difficult thing is that we have to include the mesh motion. So, when the fracture surface dissolves, the points have to move. You can't just move them because then the mesh will just tangle in a few iterations. So, we have to also have a mesh relaxation as well. And so, this is a bit complicated. And so, this is a bit complicated, particularly if there's topological changes. So, here's just a couple of examples of some simulations that we did. So, if you imagine two fracture surfaces, then there are these random perturbations in the aperture or in the position of the surface. So, we have two independent surfaces, and then we introduce displacements on each surface. And there's two possibilities. You can imagine a coherent displacement where everything moves in. Placement where everything moves in sync, and an incoherent one where they move in opposition, and you just linearly superpose them. So if it's a coherent displacement, then there's no aperture variation, and that typically is what happens at large wavelengths. If it's a symmetric displacement, then there is aperture variation, and that's usually what's happening at short wavelengths. And so we generate a displacement by Fourier synthesis with a small amplitude displacement. With a much small amplitude displacement. It's exaggerating the picture so that you can see what's happening. So I want to show you a video of what happens to an initially flat fracture with these small perturbations in the surfaces. It's a little complicated, so let me step through it first with you. So the top picture is showing the actual fracture. Is showing the actual fracture, and the color coding is the concentration on the fracture surface. So, this is the thing that's controlling the rate of dissolution. So, this is low concentration here, high concentration here. So, this part is dissolving faster. We're already seeing it at the time where the fingers are starting to develop. Over here is the transverse velocity, so the velocity in this direction. And because that field is basically zero in the beginning, Basically, zero in the beginning. This gives you the earliest signature of the instability. This is the concentration field. This is a cross-section in this location, so you'll be able to see the conduit developing. There are two line plots, one in the matrix and one in the two. So you see here the perturbation. This is the wavelength of the perturbation, velocity. Length of the perturbation, velocity is going in the opposite direction. Now you see it developing into the concentration field and then the conduit developing. And you can see it develops this characteristic elliptical shape which we saw in some of the natural fractures. And then down here you see how different the concentration is in the matrix, which basically only penetrates a short distance in, whereas a conduit basically goes all the way to the end. The other thing we can do is to use a symmetric displacement where now there's an aperture variation, and this is the only picture I have with loops in it. So after the initial conduit breaks through, it's the low pressure region and it draws the surrounding conduits, the surrounding fingers to itself. I think Stashek's going to talk more about that this afternoon. So, about the same time, Giotto had a postdoc, Florian Ossilin, who set up a microfluidics experiment to try and understand more about how fractures develop just by looking at videos of the things growing. So, the microfluidic experiment was on the right. And this was a simulation we set up with Vitalis Cove, and there are obvious qualitative similarities, both would show fingers, the pattern quality. Show fingers, the pattern coarsens with time. Quantitatively, it's not so good because the fingers in the simulation are growing much faster than the fingers in the experiment. So, we couldn't really understand why there was such a difference. And so, we wanted to find a simpler problem to probe, and that basically meant one that didn't have instabilities in it. So, the fact that there's instabilities in the fracture make it really difficult to do. Make it really difficult to do a hard comparison because tiny differences will make huge differences over time. So we tried a simpler problem. Okay, so instead of having a fracture, which in this microfluidic cell was basically a solid block of gypsum, and this tape Of gypsum, and this tape would be a little gap, so it would be cut out. And then, so then in the fracture case, we have flow over the gypsum. In this case, this is empty, so there's a space here, and it's filled with a little circle of gypsum. So, now the basic dynamics is that the fluid comes in, it flows around the gypsum chip, and then goes out. So, over time, the chip shrinks. But because the flow is going in one direction, the shape is actually. The shape is asymmetric and it develops this tail towards the output. And this is kind of nice because by comparing shapes you get information about local fluxes. So the typical kind of characterization experiment, we pump stuff in, we measure the effluent, but that gives you just an average measure of the dissolution. By looking at the pictures, you can actually see: is it dissolving in the right place as well as the right rate? Place as well as the right rate. And so we did these comparisons, and this is what was happening for quite a long time. So we're, for example, measuring the volume of the gypsum disk, and the circles were the simulations, and the dashed lines were the experiments. And in a sense, this was good because this was coherent with what we were seeing with the fracture dissolution. On the other hand, it was bad. On the other hand, it was bad because we had no idea why the experiments would be so different. So, if you wanted to map the experiments onto the simulations onto the experiment, you'd have to reduce the rate constant by about a factor of five because it's in a transport dominant regime. That didn't seem a reasonable thing to do. But Pyotr and Philip also noticed that when they dissolved the disk, there was always this dust left behind, which is obviously. Left behind, which is obviously coming from the impurities in the sample, which is plaster of Paris. So, with some effort, Philip was able to redo the experiment with analytical gray gypsum. It wasn't so easy to make the little pellets as it was with the plaster, but he did in the end succeed. And in that case, you saw a very different picture where the dissolution was much more consistent with the experiment. So, despite the fact that the plaster of Paris is only Despite the fact that the plaster of Paris is only a couple of percent impurity, it makes a huge difference to how it dissolves, which perhaps isn't surprising because the impurities were designed to make it dissolve slowly. This may be a sensible thing. But we also notice if we want to be critical that the simulations are still too fast, now once again, you could say, well, okay, we don't really know what the reaction rate is, but in order to get this to match with the experiment. With the experiment, we'd have to reduce the reaction rate content by about a factor of two because it's transport-dominated. So, is there a better solution? I'll explain that in a minute. So, the basic idea is we have to take account of the fact that the solution around the Egyptian chip is not of a negligible concentration. So, here's comparison now of the experimental images. So, the white and black is a photograph of the children. So the white and black is a photograph of the chip, and the circles are the simulated out the outline from the simulation at the same time. And the blue circles are what corresponded to the area plots I showed you before. So it's quite good in the beginning, but by the end, the thing is significantly too small. It's still dissolving too fast. So if you include a concentration-dependent diffusion, things are much, much better. And now you see that the shape at the end is the size is more. Is the size is more or less correct. So, what's the difference? So, the point is that this is gypsum. At saturation, the ionic strength is about 40 millimolar, and the activity correction goes as a square root of the ionic strength, so even 40 millimolar is quite significant. So, you can calculate the correction to the diffusion coefficient based on the my Hockey activity coefficient. Activity coefficient. And what we see there is that there's a reduction in the diffusion coefficient of about 25%. Of course, in the right region, right around the disk. Interestingly, this would be asymmetric in the case of acidization, because if you're acidizing it, the concentration will be low around the disk. And so that would be where you wouldn't expect to see any significant effect of activity. So, this sort of leads us to think about the reactive transport in a slightly different way. So, when we were putting the paper together, Florian emailed me a question. He says, okay, so you put the activity in the diffusion, but shouldn't the activity be in the reaction rate as well? And I said, yeah, but I don't know how to do that. So we just left it. But I've been thinking about this a bit more. And so when we usually do reactive transport, we usually think Do reactive transport, we usually think about concentrations, but perhaps we should think about chemical potential instead, because this gives us a much more natural way, I think, of connecting these things. So the chemical potential has a concentration part, and in an electrolyte solution, there's also a part due to an electrostatic potential, and this is basically what we mean by the activity coefficient. That would be the bipoker activity coefficient. So when we come to calculate the diffusive flux, then Diffusive flux, then you just need to calculate the gradient of the chemical potential, and that's what gives you the diffusion coefficient with the correction term. If you want to do reaction equilibria, you just have to do the stoichiometric sum of the chemical potentials, and then if it's a reaction rate, then you have to have something proportional to the imbalance in chemical potential. So I've been thinking about how to incorporate this. Most of it is pretty strict. Most of it is pretty straightforward. It's a matter of just adding equations to calculate the electric contribution to the flux, calculate the potential. But the tricky thing is that the electric potential couples with the reaction equilibrium. So just a very simple case, if you had silica and you put it in water, then some of the silanes would lose protons and you get a charged surface. And the charge on the surface. And the charge on the surface is controlled by the equilibrium for that reaction. However, how much proton, how much dissolution you get, also depends on the bulk solution. Because the charge density on the surface tells you what the gradient of potential is on the surface, but the actual solution for what the potential is on the surface depends on the far field on the divider. So it couples all these things in a kind of interactive way. Kind of interactive way. So I think what that means is you could start to get things like pH-dependent reaction rates as well as pH-dependent zeta potentials. There's also the idea that electrokinetic flows can dominate pressure-driven flows in very tiny, very tiny channels. So some rocks, like certain time, have very tiny channels, and there it the pressure driven flow cannot really account for the advance of reactive fronts. Advance of reactive fronts, maybe electrokinetics can. So I think that's what I have to say. That's still very much a work in progress. Thank you very much.
