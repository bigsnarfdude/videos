You have David Van Dyke and Adrian Liu's talk times, and we'll see if we can get that solved after the fact. So, Adrian Liu will be talking about machine learning, reconstruction of ethnic reionization bubbles. Great, thanks. So, I'm going to talk about 21 centimeter cosmology. And since I'm sure that's new to some people, I'm going to go over some background first. So, the basic idea is that hydrogen is everywhere in our universe. So, if we have a way of seeing hydrogen, So, if we have a way of seeing hydrogen, we have a way of making giant maps of our universe. And fortunately, quantum mechanics gives us a way to see hydrogen. If we have the proton and the electron spins flip, they emit or absorb a 21 centimeter photon. So if I go out in my universe and I look for absorption or emission of 21 centimeter photons, I can, in principle, make big maps of the universe. Maps of the universe. So here's a theory movie for something that we're interested in measuring. Where what you're seeing here are the first galaxies giving out ionizing radiation, and as a result of that, causing these ionized bubbles around them. And when that continues to happen, eventually these bubbles fill entire volume, and we say reionization is complete, and our universe is almost all ionized today. Universe is almost all ionized today. So that's what we hope to do someday. Make a map like this. White regions are where things are ionized, so with the ionized hydrogen, you don't have this transition, so you get blank spots. I can study this map and understand the details of the first galaxies. And people like me are involved with instruments like Hera, as well as QIIME and Horde, building these big radio interferometers to try to do just that. However, However, we haven't done it yet, and the chief obstacle here is that if I'm trying to see a faraway low-frequency radio signal, there's a lot of stuff in the way. So, for example, a Milky Way galaxy gives off radio waves in exactly our band, orders of magnitude brighter than what we see, than what we want to see. And so, we've got to get rid of those foregrounds. Foregrounds, and one solution is to filter our data. So, we're trying to see this, and because of the peculiarities of how these instruments work and the nature of the foreground versus the background admission, if I actually decompose this in Fourier space in terms of Fourier modes perpendicular to my line of sight versus along my line of sight, the foregrounds appear in this sort of characteristic white shape. White shape, and if you get rid of that wedge, the hope is that you can actually do a lot of science. Right now, we actually just work here and get statistical information, but someday you might actually want to clean this out and actually get some of these images. And that's where you have another problem, right? That triangular sort of filter is such a weird filter that if you take a map like this and you fold If you take a map like this and you filter out those foregrounds, you get something like that. It's not even like a blurred version of it, it just looks completely different. And so a few years ago, some undergraduates of mine actually wondered if you could learn this, basically learn a mapping back from the folder to the original data by machine learning. And it turns out you mostly can't. You can kind of see, I don't know, Japan here. I don't know, Japan here, and so on and so forth. You can also imagine that if you were to lay the galaxies on this simulation, they preferentially reside in the ionized bubbles because they're causing these ionized bubbles. So earlier this week, we talked about how small of a field of view telescopes like JWST have. You could imagine using these recovered bubble maps as guide maps for where to look for the. As guide maps for where to look for these high-range galaxies. And if you had something like a big survey telescope, like the Nancy Grace-Roman telescope, where you can actually map out a whole bunch of these galaxies over a large field of view, you could actually turn things around and actually do better in your reconstruction and get some of these smaller islands as well. Now, how does this work? You know, we put it. You know, we put it through, trained this procedure using a U-Net with your usual skip connections and all that sort of stuff. But to a cosmologist, this is actually a very mysterious thing. Because we're so used to Gaussianity. And for example, the cosmic microwave background made a histogram of those pixels. It's a very Gaussian distribution. And if you combine Gaussian. And if you combine Gaussianity plus the fact that we've got stationary statistics, so no special places in our universe, Fourier modes are actually uncoupled to one another. So you might say that's really weird. You killed some of the Fourier modes. How could you possibly recover those Fourier modes and make these nice images? And indeed, if I take one of those bubble maps and I Gaussianize it, we tried several different It. We tried several different methods. What you always find is that you fail to triangle, so you can't actually recover the bubbles. So, it really is leveraging the fact that these signatures, unlike in a lot of cosmology that we're looking for, are highly non-Gaussian distributions. And one of the lovely things about this conference is just hearing all sorts of words that I had never heard before and Googling them from day one. Them from day one. So on day one, I heard about zero-inflated models. I have no idea what that is. But then I googled it and I thought, like, maybe some of you have some techniques out there that might actually be useful for this problem. You know, I've got all these ionized bubbles. That's a huge spike at zero, right? So, and also with, say, Sam's talk yesterday, I think there could be some interesting discussions along with a whole stack of other problems. Questions, along with a whole stack of other problems, where I think like 21-centimeter cosmology just has a lot of things that we could talk about in the context of astrostatistics. So, thank you very much. I'll open it up to questions. Are there questions in the room? You're all online, start asking your questions at email. Of all of these questions, what is your top one? Yeah, so my top one, okay. So in terms of the one I would love to make progress on, field level inferences, right? So typically you give something to a cosmologist and our first impulse is, let's measure a power spectrum, right? That made a lot of sense with the CMB when everything's Gaussian and the power spectrum encodes everything. Gaussian and the Paul spectrum encodes everything. But what has become of an interesting problem to tackle is actually to take your initial conditions of the universe, we have a deterministic prediction for how we can create those bubbles, forward model that, actually do a very high-dimensional inference problem for the initial conditions, and then depending on your taste, either marginalize out the initial conditions or marginalize out the conditions. out the initial conditions or marginalize out the astrophysics to learn about the initial conditions. That's hard, right? Super high-dimensional, technically difficult, but I'd love to solve that. What do you mean by field level inferences? Is that like because you're looking at just a single field? Or I guess I don't understand. I meant field as in like the actually matching my images, you know, with all their phase information as opposed to compressing it down to a summary statistic like the Palace. Summary statistic like the power spectrum or. So, the missing data part, do you feel like what's missing depends on the values that would have been observed? Typically the context that I'm thinking about, that I spend most of my time thinking about in terms of missing data.
