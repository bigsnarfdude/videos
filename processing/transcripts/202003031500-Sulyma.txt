Alright, hello. There's a lot of people to thank. Certainly the organizers for the opportunity to be here and to speak. But more specifically, I want to thank Mike for suggesting this project, Andrew for supervising it. I should also thank Dylan, Wilson, and Aaron Royer for explaining equivariant homotopy theory to me. And also, China and Viklaik and Ning Kong for writing some great papers that I learned a lot from. Papers that I learned a lot from. So, I am talking to you about the slice filtration on THH. So, motivation for this came from, as we heard yesterday, from Akila a couple years ago, Bob Borrow and Schultz to construct some interesting filtrations on THH, and then use these and all the menagerie of T-spectra associated with that, and then use this to construct some new gadgets in arithmetic geometry. So, their construction worked by first establishing some kind of First, establishing some kind of descent for a THH, and then descending to the case of a perfectoid ring. So, a perfectoid ring is a mixed characteristic analog of a perfect FP algebra. And in particular, its THH, the THH of such a thing is Bachstedt periodic. So it behaves just like the case of FP, pretty much. This was proved first by Hesselholt in a special case and then by BMS in general. So locally, their construction is just given by Posmikov filtration. Given by the posmikov filtration, when you descend this to a scheme, you get something that's more interesting. So, Mike Hill asked the question: what would happen if you took their construction and then locally, instead of using the Posnikov filtration, you used the slice filtration from equivariant stable homotopy theory. So this results as the equivariant, not the motivic slice filtration, and it's the regular, not the classical slice filtration. So, this would give a filtration that's in some sense intermediate between the DNA. In some sense, intermediate between the DMS filtration, which doesn't use equivariance at all, the filtration constructed by Antio and Nikolaus using a cyclotomic T-structure that is a filtration by cyclotomic spectra. This would give you something, filtration by T-equivariant spectra, but not cyclotomic spectra. And so, this talk is about the local calculation involved in this program. So, what does the slice filtration look like for THH of a perfectoid ring? So the answer is: so the slices, as far as a perfectoid ring, the slice covers of THH are given by certain ROG-graded suspensions of THH, and the slices are given as certain ROG-graded suspensions of some Machif functors. More precisely, so here, I call the lambda analog of n. This is a circle representation restricting to, if you restrict it to Cm, you get the If you restrict it to Cn, you get the complex regular representation of Cn. And this thing will be the complex regular, reduced regular representation of Cn plus 1. And so then... So Cn means cyclic group? Cn, yeah, cyclic group. And T will always be the circle group. And then underline W is the Machiefunctor of width vectors. And then And then transfer sub nw, this is the sub-machu functor of the machu functor of width vectors. It's generated under transfers by the restriction to cp to the vpn. What is lambda? Lambda is the standard representation of the circle and the complex numbers. And it's possible that occasionally I might flip up and write Cn when I mean C and P to the BPN. And so so can we expand? Can you explain this notation that this is n sub lambda? Yeah, so I'll explain that soon, but this is sort of a q analog where I set q equal to lambda in the complex representation ring. Yeah, so we'll get to that. So yeah, I do unfortunately have quite a lot of background and notation to get through, but we'll get some interesting calculations out there. So rho CM means the real regular representation. The real regular representation. So, this tensor product that we have is the same thing as the complex regular representation. The complex regular representation. Okay, so oh, and then if R is p torsion free, so the only slices are even slices. And so this has the corollary that if your perfectoid ring is torsion free, the regular slice spectral sequence will collapse at E2. Although the case of an FP algebra is, perfect FP algebra is more familiar. Perfect FP algebra is more familiar to us, the torsion-free perfectoid case often turns out to be easier because you avoid some torsion stuff. Right, so the first thing I'll be talking about a lot is the idea of q analogs. This to me was a sort of centrifug, a unifying theme for the whole paper. So the q analog of n, if n is a natural number, is this formal expression 1 plus q plus dot dot dot plus q to the n minus 1, which you can express as a fraction. Expressed as a fraction. So this is a formal expression, but if we set q equal to 1, we would recover just the natural number at m. So in general, I'll refer to things as like a q analog or a q deformation of a classical concept if you recover that by setting q equal to 1. So these come up in combinatorics in a lot of different situations. So, for example, if we set q to be a power of a prime rather than 1, then the 1, then the q analog of n would be counting the points of the finite field, or points of projected n minus 1 space over a finite field of order q. And then if you went on to define analogs of the factorial, so the q factorial and a q binomial coefficient, this q minomial coefficient will count points of a Grassmannian over FQ. But this is a very different example from the actin examples we'll be seeing. We'll be mainly seeing examples. Be seeing, we'll be mainly seeing examples where q is close to 1 in some sense. Okay, so this rate zq has an action of the Frobenius. So this sends Q, the variable Q to the variable Q to the power of P, and in general, it'll send a polynomial in Q to f evaluated at Q to the power of P. Now we know that that is not the same as raising f to the power of P, but mod P, those agree. And so we would write, since it's And so we would write, since it's in portion-free rank, we can uniquely recover the difference, and so we call that delta. So this is an example of what arithmeticians call, maybe a delta ring, we would call a p-typical theta ring, something like this, but that'll be very important. So in particular, the Frobenius sends the Q analog of n to the Q of the P analog of n. So then these Q analogs, These analogs, q analogs, they're not quite multiplicative. They're multiplicative, but with a twisting of the Frobenius. So for example, if I looked at the Q analog of p cubed, I could write that as Q to the P cubed minus 1 over Q to the P squared minus 1, and so on. And then this is the Q to the P squared analog of P. This is the Q to the P analog of P. Hello? So I'm going to highlight. So I'm going to highlight several different occurrences, maybe four different occurrences of p-nalogs. So one, if we take Q to be, if we look at the Q-nalog of a prime number, then this is the minimal polynomial for primitive root of unity. And then if we quotient out instead of by the qn log of p, we quotient out by some Frobeniation of that, well, that would be saying now that. That? Well, that would be saying now that like u to the power of p was a primitive root pth root of unity, so u must be a primitive p squared root of unity. So then if we complete upstairs and we complete downstairs, then by taking a collimate over the Frobenius, upstairs we've added all p power roots of q, and downstairs we've added all p power roots of unity. So this might be useful to homotopy theorists. We know that we can't adjoin So we know that we can't adjoin power roots of unity in homotopy theory, but it turns out that this ring upstairs still contains all that information, but the roots of unity are somehow protected from screwing up the arithmetic of the ring. So for now, I will set A to be this top guy upstairs and R to be this bottom guy downstairs. It suggests we include some completions at P and at Q minus 1 for technical reasons. At P and at Q minus 1 for technical reasons. So then I claim that the A mod B higher Q analogs are actually something familiar to us, that this just works out to be the ring of width vectors, length and width vectors of this ring R. So we're maybe used to taking width vectors of things in characteristic p, but this is saying that just as length n width vectors is width vectors mode. Is width vectors mod p to the n in the case of an FP algebra. Here, we can recover width vectors by modding out by some deformation of the number of p to the n. What do you mean by definition? So yeah, this is a point that confused me for a long time. So width vectors have such finite lengths for every n, and those are connected by maps f and r going down and v going up. So I Going up. So I can make the, if I want to make these identifications, I can only make one of those maps a homomorphism of A algebras. So if you want the F maps to be linear, which is what I will do because I want to form Machifunctors, then I'll sort of take this normalization. If you wanted the R maps to be homomorphisms, which is what you would do if you were calculating TR, then you would use this other normalization. So I was confused about this for a long time. I was confused about this for a long time. Okay, so that's all I want to say. So, then, a peculiar normalization, I will actually take the q to the 1 over p analogs of p. This sort of reflects how this actually comes up in the arithmetic. It doesn't really matter for in this situation because we've had all power roots of q. So, from now on, r is going to be either R is going to be either Zp with all p power roots of unity adjoined, or, I'm not comfortable with the perfectoids, this, you can take it to be a perfect FP algebra, then A will be either Q with all P power roots adjoined, or the width vectors of this ring R, which in this case would be a perfect empty algebra. And then I will write the A analog of P to the M. This is either the Q to the 1 over P analog of P to the M. P analog of p to the n in the perfectoid case and p to the n in the process. So you can take just r to be fp and a to be zp and this thing to be p to the n for the whole talk and it'll still be interesting. You'll just have to do some less Frobenius juggling and you'll get a harder spectral sequence at the end. And then all the variants of THH will just refer to THH of R with P completed. I won't. I won't. Can you delete out the second C on the right? Yes. Sorry, I meant to leave out this C on the left. P C won't appear in this talk. Thank you, Kash. Or it could mean any one of these. Okay, so I think that's all I wanted to say about QM logs in the perfectoid world. QN logs in the perfectoid world, just to define what the objects we're working with. And so if you're familiar with perfectoid rings, you can take R to be any perfectoid ring and A as A inf, and this will all work, at least up to units. Okay, oh, yeah, so recall that we have this Frobenius lift on this ring. So this interacts with these Q analogs in a very important way. This is called the prism condition. So delta is witnessing that two things were. Is witnessing that two things were equivalent to mod p. So I find the delta of the analog of p is a unit of a. So first we'll just prove this. It's quite easy to check. So since we're q minus 1 complete, we can just check this after reducing mod q minus 1. So after setting q equal to 1, then this just becomes saying that delta of p is a unit in zp. But since phi has to be a ring homomorphism, phi of p is p. phi of p is p, so we'll get p equals p to the p plus p delta p, and then this is definitely a piadic unit. Okay, so now I want to comment on the significance. So first of all, why do they call this the prism condition? Well, so algebraically this is implying that p is contained in the ideal generated by this analog of p and this Frobenius twist of this deformation. Geometrically, this is saying the vanishing load. Geometrically, this is saying the vanishing locus of, if I take the vanishing locus of this analog and if it's Rabenius twist and I intersect those, those only intersect in characteristic p. So the imagery that Bott Schulze used for this is they decided that, oh, this is like you shine in a beam of characteristic P, and this ring A that they call a prism will refract, whatever the actual word is, reflect, decompose this. Decompose this theme of characteristic p into all these different deformations of the number p. But there's also an equivariant interpretation of the prism condition. So since each one of these analogs of p still at least divides the next one, even though they're not quite multiplicative, we could try to define a Machifunctor by saying, okay, the circle mod C P to the M is A mod the analog of P to the M plus 1. Then to transfer, we'll just multiply by this fraction, which explicitly would be something like this. And then for the restriction maps, we would presumably just use the projection maps. But this doesn't actually work. So one of the requirements, axioms for a Machief functor is that if you transfer and then restrict, that has to be equal to, well I guess multiplying by the summing up all the conjugates, but Summing up all the conjugates, but here all the actions are trivial. So this would just be multiplication by p. So this is actually will not be equal to multiplication by p. On the other hand, we're always working up to units, so we would be happy if this were at least equal to p up to a unit, and then we could use some unit times the natural projection after former Mafia functor. And so this would be requiring that this following thing, that for i less than or equal to j, we have some congruence. And this is just an elaboration of And this is just an elaboration of the present condition. Okay, so like I said, when in our current case, this is actually just isomorphic to a width vector Machifunctor. We're just keeping track of the A algebra structure. But the point is that you should be able to do something like this for any prisms. You can think of this as sort of a Machifunctor condition. Okay, so the next instance of Q analogs is in the following theorem, Haskell theorem. Theorem of classical theorem of Legendre. It says the piadic valuation of a factorial you get by summing over floor and over p to the r for all r. So a picture of this is as follows. So each, you know, we had a semester on illustrating math at Brown this past fall was a lot of fun. So first of all, I don't have any bars where there's numbers like one or two or four because I'm only interested in the I'm only interested in the contribution to the p-adic valuation. So each term in this sign, this floor, is counting up the items in one column. So floor n over p would be all the things in the first column, floor n over p squared would be how many things I get here. So then, remember we defined, we had some q deformation of the factorial. I know that I would get something totally different. I know that I would get something totally different if I put n factorial inside the brackets. So, a Q deformation of Legendre's formula was provided last summer by Johannes Anschutz and Altulses Ablippois in their work on the cyclotomic trace in degree 2, which they identified as a Q logarithm. So, since these analogs aren't multiplicative, when I hit, for example, P squared, I'm not going to get two copies of the PN. I'm not going to get two copies of the P analog of A analog of P. I'm going to get one analog of P and one Frobenius twist of that. So times a unit. So now the picture looks like this. So we have to count each contribution separately. So the reds would be the analogs of P, the orange would be the phi of bracket P, the yellows would be phi squared of bracket P. So this So, this formula was actually a major breakthrough in the paper for me because I looked at their paper and I had been getting the principal ideal generated by the right-hand side in my calculations, and I didn't understand what it meant. So now I will talk about representations of the circle. So, the complex representations of the circle, its representation ring is z adjoin lambda plus or minus, where explicitly lambda to the power. Where explicitly lambda to the power of i in this ring, that's the representation that's just the complex numbers, but now z in the circle will act as z to the power of i. So if I form a q analog in this ring, oops, wrong one, so the lambda analog of n would be lambda to the zero plus lambda to the one plus dot dot dot. Note that lambda to the zero will be a trivial complex representate function. So if we restrict this to C. So if we restrict this to Cn, this is sort of a well-known decomposition of the regular representation of Cn. Although I will mention I would really like to have a description of this thing as a circle representation that would imply this for all n somehow. Because right now this n here and the n here have to be the same, and that's upsetting. I will also define I will also define something similar, but where I start at 1 and go to n. So I know this is terrible notation, but I couldn't come up with anything better. Sometimes this is denoted lambda sub n in the literature. I will use lambda sub n for something quite different. And again, if you restrict this, you get the reduced complex regular representation. Okay, so in a p-local context, if I form these representation spheres, they're actually going to be equivalent if and only if the p-adic valuation of i is equal to The piadic valuation of i is equal to the p-iadic valuation of j. So I will set lambda sub i to mean lambda to the p to the i, and also lambda infinity will be a trivial complex representation, because lambda sub infinity would be lambda to the p to the infinity, and p to the infinity is zero since we're p to the infinity. So now I have to define more notation, unfortunately. So if I have some representation, I'll define d. If I have some representation, I'll define d sub r alpha to mean the complex dimension of the cp to the r fixed points. This is a virtual representation. And so I have two different ways of expressing a representation. I can decompose it into these irreducibles, lambda 0, lambda 1, lambda n, and lambda infinity, or I can express, encode this by the sequence of like d 0, d 1, d 2, and so forth. D1, D2, and so forth. So the conversion between these is: so if I had this expression to compute the dimension of the p to the r fixed points, I would sum overall ki for a i greater than or equal to r. Is that the formula for alpha really a finite sum, one of which happens to have a subscript infinity? Yes. Okay. So infinity is the trivial representation, but yeah, this will have to stop. But then this sum includes equals infinity. So this is lambda 0. Is that also a trivial revolution? No, lambda 0 is lambda to the p to the 0, which is lambda 1, which is the usual version of lambda. So explicitly, like lambda 0 has fixed points only for the trivial subgroup, lambda 1 has fixed points for the trivial subgroup in CP, and so on, which will be extremely important. Okay, so. Okay, so I define these bracket n lambdas as lambda to the one plus dot dot dot plus lambda to the n. Now I just want to decompose these sort of p locally. And so we observe that this is exactly the same problem as factoring this n factorial, where now it really is important that we're sort of keeping these contributions separate. So by the same idea as the Q-Lechandre formula. Kulichandre formula, the dr of this bracket n lambda will be floor of n over p to the r, and dr of this lambda analog will be ceiling n over p to the r. And you can probably ignore the formulas for kr. So a useful formula for converting between these is that ceiling n over p to the r minus one is floor n minus one over p to the r. And maybe you can think of a relation between these. And maybe you can think of the relation between these two reduced, like regular and reduced regular representations as some sort of categorification or vectorization of this equation. So the last thing I want to say about Q analogs is if we took this ring Z adjoining Q minus 1 and we set Q to the power of N equal to 1, this would be the group ring for Cn. And in this context, the transfer from E to The transfer from E to Cn of 1, that is exactly what we would be calling the Q analog in this terminology. One way of thinking about these Q analogs that might be appealing to an equivariant homotopy theorist is that we're deforming from a trivial action to a non-trivial action, such that multiplication by the number n gets deformed to a transfer for some index n subgroup. Explicitly, the action here is the action by the p power roots of unity. You can note that saying power is a root. You can note that saying p equals 0 in a ring is the same as saying that 1 is a primitive p through of unity. Alright, so I think that is all about q analogs. Are there questions up to this point? Any of this? Okay, so now I can quickly introduce the slice filtration. So if g is a finite group, we define an n cell. So again, this is the regular slice filtration. Slice n cell will be, I take some regular slice. Will be: I take some regular representation for a subgroup where the underlying sphere has dimension n, but then I induce that up to g. So then, once you have the notion of cell, you sort of get a notion of filtration formally. So we say that something is slice n connective, or greater than or equal to n, if you can build it just using cells of slice dimension greater than or equal to n. And you're slice n truncated if you try to map anything into you that's. Try to map anything into you that's of dimension n plus 1 or greater, and you get 0. So then we have a cofiber sequence of the universal n connective thing mapping to x, and then the universal n-miniform truncated thing that x maps to. So it's called the slice covers and the slice truncations, and then the slice is either one of these multiplied in this slice. Now this is for a finite group, so I am going to interpret this to mean I am going to interpret this to mean with a filtration such that if I restricted this from a T spectrum to a CP to the N spectrum, I would get the slice filtration for all of N. It's possible that there are other options that make more sense or just be interesting in different ways. I want to say something here. I recommend changing that top term, calling this a slice against years. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um all right, so how do we actually work with the slice filtration? So uh Mike Hill and Carolyn Yarnall proved an excellent result that says that okay slice connectivity can actually be characterized much more explicitly. You are slice n connective if and only if your h geometric fixed points are sealing n over size of h connective for all subgroups h. In our case, roots H. In our case, that's going to say that something is slice n connective if and only if the cp to the k geometric fixed points are sealing n over p to the k connective for all k. So then Donald Wilson gave a recipe to explicitly compute slices and also an identification. So normally we think of taking the homotopy groups of something as landing in abelian groups. There's still a lot of groups. Yes. Sorry. Yes. Then it's difficult to sort of identify spectra, G spectra, which are n slice, so n truncated and n connective, with something more algebraic. So Dylan did that. But what we're actually going to use is there's a recognition criterion for the slice tower. So if I have a bunch of things that So, if I have a bunch of things that fit together into my spectrum, and their limit is zero, and the nth term is slice n connective, and the nth cofiber is slice n connective and n truncated, then that actually has to be the slice filtration. So what we're going to do is basically just guess the answer and then show that it works. So we here said we could sort of work with either the slice truncation, slice covers or the slice truncation. Truncation, slice covers or the slice truncations. We are going to work with the slice covers because we have a good handle on those by box shift periodicity. Right, so these are just sort of the computational facts about THH that I will use. So T C minus is A, which you can think of as Z P if you like, adjoin the box shift generator and T. So T comes from the cohomology of the circle. Sigma is in degree 2, T is in degree negative 2. In degree 2, t is in degree negative 2. They multiply together to form P. Then you have this TF spectrum, you have this other version of the TF spectrum, and TP. And so since the operations, since sigma and T multiply to PA, the canonical map has to send sigma to, well, PA times T inverse since T inverse, T is invertible here, so it's the generator. The Frobenius map. The Frobenius map here is going from Tf to Tp, or I guess from Tc minus to Tp. So it is the limit over the Frobenius maps of TRM, or equivalently, it is the mapping spectrum from S0 to THH in cyclonic, like genuine equivariant, but not cyclotomic spectra. So Tc would be that mapping spectrum in cyclotomic spectra, Tf is in, and then Tc is in coarse spectra. And then PC is in core spectra. So then you can also do this at finite level. I don't know that we'll need this that much, but so tr is this mod p to the n plus 1. This is this thing, mod 5p to the na. And really what's happening here is we're modding out by 5p to the na times. By 5 p DNA times t. So over here, since t is invertible, that whole thing gets killed. And then up here, since sigma t multiplies to this, you actually are also killing p to the n plus 1a and the dimensions that involve sigma. Okay, so, but hopefully we won't need to get too much into the nitty-gritty of the computation. So the idea, though, is very simple. So if the slice tower has to restrict, the slice filtration has to restrict to the The slice filtration has to restrict to the Pasmakov filtration on the underlying. So, not equivariantly, the whitehead tower of THH is just even suspensions of THH connected by the Bachstedt operator, the Bachstedt element. So. So this is not a finite. This is meant to continue upward and definitely. Yes, definitely. Unless we've discovered that there are no numbers beyond 4. So if we're feeling optimistic, we could guess that maybe. We could guess that maybe these slice covers are given by some ROG-graded suspensions of THH with the appropriate dimensions. So for example, I think it was supposed to be somewhere there. I'll just say, so in order to check that these have the correct slice connectivity, we would use the We would use the polynarmal result and sort of look at their geometric fixed points. But if I take geometric fixed points of some representation tensor THH, formal properties, since this preserves tensor products, this is this, but then since THH is cyclotomic, Is cyclotomic. Write this. This is V, the representation sphere for the CP fixed points, tensor THH. So in order to make sure that these suspensions have the correct slice connectivity, I can actually just look for representations that have the correct fixed point dimensions. Let's look, for example, with p equal to 3. I could be looking at the Three, I could be looking at the two, four, six, eight, and ten slice covers. So over here are all the connectivities I need. So if I need the connectivity of the Cp squared fixed points to be at least one, and also this Cp cubed and so on, because of this ceiling, we get a bunch of ones here. Well, the only way I can add a fixed point for all subgroups at once is to take a copy of the trivial representation. is to take a copy of the trivial representation. Okay, so now I look in maybe two now, I've got fixed points of real dimension two for all subgroups. So I don't need to add anything more here. Here, so this has the correct dimension of fixed points for CP squared and Cp, but it needs to have an underlying dimension for. So if I want to sort of add fixed points without screwing up my Fixed points without screwing up the work we've done so far. Lambda 0, again, only has fixed points for the trivial subgroup. Lambda 1 has fixed points for E and C P, and so on. So we will sort of work from largest stabilizer in. So these two, we don't need to do any, add any lambda zero or lambda ones. Here, we've got under, so far we've got dimension two. For CP fixed points, we need at least three or at least four. points we need at least three or at least four. So we'll add a lambda one there and then finally we end up with this is what we would get. So lambda zero plus lambda infinity, two lambda zero plus lambda infinity, and so on. So this was uniquely forced on us, at least p locally. If we want to see a pattern we can recognize that oh actually if we wrote these integrally, well lambda infinity is lambda to the power of zero. Lambda this one was lambda to the zero plus lambda to the one. Lambda to the 0 plus lambda to the 1, when we picked up a lambda 1, that could be expressed as lambda 0, 1, 2, and 3. So what we see is that integrally these representations would be given by Vn equals this lambda n log of n. So if our guess was correct that the slices, covers of THH are of this certain form, then there's only one possibility. Now, of course, our guess could have been wrong. Maybe we have to deal with spokes and egg beaters. With spokes and egg beaters and such things. But for now, we live in the best of all possible worlds, and those things don't exist. So, how do we go about checking that this guess is correct? Well, there's four steps. So, we need to show that these suspensions are slice at least 2n connective, or sliced 2n connective. We need to produce maps between them. Then we need to show that the cofibers are both 2n truncated and 2n connective. To N connective. So we already did the first step essentially. For the rest, we're going to need to understand some ROG-graded THH. So how do we get a handle on that? So we have two sort of main sources for ROG-graded classes. First is one of the weight classes. So if I have a G representation and I look at the inclusion of the zero subspace, then this will give me a class of AB with degree Class of AV with degree minus V. This has some interesting properties. So if there was a non-trivial fixed subspace, then I could use that to define a homotopy from the South Pole to the North Pole. And so then that would be trivial. So as soon as you have fixed points, this class becomes trivial, which implies some other great things. So it implies that it will kill all transfers from the stabilizer, and it will be killed by restriction to the stabilizer. Restriction to the stabilizer. The very interesting thing is that, so when g is the circle group, if we look at this representation lambda, again, that only has fixed points for the trivial subgroup. So if we form an infinite comment of such things, we'll get a model for this e tilde squiggle. And so inverting lambda, a lambda 0, will be the same as taking geometric placement. So we can view the isotropy separation squared. The isotropy separation square as an arithmetic square for this Euler class. We also have some cell structures on these representations that will be very useful. So if we take G to be a finite subgroup of the circle, so as Cp to the end spectra, these representation figures have cell structures, two-stage cell structures, where the one skeleton is the spoke. But a really awesome. A really useful trick that I learned from Mike is that as circle spectra, these actually have one-stage cell structures. So we actually have an exact triangle T over C P to the R plus to S 0 to S lambda R. So you can go from Tf to Tr n plus 1 by quotienting out by lambda n. So this is sort of sort of the genuine Sort of the genuine, this is what you would use to transfer information from TF to TRN in the same way that you can transfer information from TC- or from TP to the finite level homotopia and TAID fixed points. So what was the statement that this is a cofibrations? Yeah, so this is a co-fibr sequence, so I'm writing it in sort of Waldhausen notation. What is the dimension of the But what is the dimension of the sorry? What is the dimension of is lem.r? Uh it's a two-dimens like underlying is a two-sphere, yeah. Yeah, and so the observation is just that this is actually the unit sphere when you have this available. Okay, so then how do you inisotropy separation square, the bottom things are all computed by spectral sequences. So if I wanted to compute, say, some ROG graded T C minus. Some ROG-graded TC minus, then I have a spectral sequence that's doing this, but this pi to the E THH, this isn't seeing any equivariance. So by picking some non-equivariant equivalents with the standard sphere of that dimension, I get these classes uv that will be invertible. They will not be invertible in the TF, but they are invertible in sort of all the Borels. This is basically just expressing that ROT grading isn't really something interesting for. Really, something interesting for free or co-free spectra. Quite explicitly, if you wanted to calculate such a thing here, you would take the usual homotopy fixed point spectral sequence and then just shift it by the dimension of the representation. Altogether in the isotropy separation square, we've got these blue spectra, including the purple one, are all periodic with respect to the u lambda i's and the right And the right column is periodic with respect to a lambda 0. So the sort of difference between these periodicities will produce a lot of classes in X. Class in purple is supposed to be periodic in both sides. Yeah. So, for example, in Engelbeit Gerhardt's paper, they do this re-indexing of the tate spectral sequence, and that is effectively exploiting A lambda 0 periodicity. ROS1 graded homogeneous. Uh ROS1 graded homotopy of F, P, Z, and L. Okay, so, um, right, so in order to use this, we need to understand how these classes relate to each other and to the Bachstead generator. So, we'll take our inspiration from something proved by Hill Hopkins-Ravenel, that they call the gold relation, that at least in the homotopy of HC, these classes, if I have a A lambda with a bigger If I have a lambda with a bigger j than the u lambda i, then those multiply together to p to the j minus i times, writing them in the other order. So this doesn't really help us since we are not modules over underline z, but it's inspiration. So here's what we're going to do. So there's an ROG graded version of tisillitis' theorem that will guarantee that Tf sub lambda i is actually isomorphic a priori to Tc minus sub lambda I. C minus sub lambda i. And then by the periodicity, this has to be given by, so a free A module generated by sigma u lambda i inverse. On the other hand, if we take those cell structures as t spectra, then and map that into th, we'll get a short exact sequence like this. So here we've got sigma u lambda i inverse. We multiply that by a lambda i. That by a lambda i, and we know the kernel of this has to be the analog of p to the i plus 1. So, what we get is this relation that sigma times a lambda is this analog of p to the i plus 1 times u lambda i. And then I can sort of write this for i and j, two different values, solve for sigma, and conclude that if I write these with a lambda j, u lambda i, i less than or equal to j, I can rewrite this as. I can rewrite this as, well, some factor, which you could think of as, say, the transfer or this quotient. Very explicitly, it's this Frobenius twisting of this formula. So this is a Q deformation of the Gold relations. Okay, so now we have some classes, we know how they work together, we're ready to go. The first claim is that when I compute TRN plus 1 of Of this representation, lambda j minus star. This homotopy is given by stuff that looks like the usual Bocksted generator in degrees 0 and higher. And then in degree 2, I've got something that's given by a transfer. This is actually quite easy to see or to check. So the blue classes, this is already predicted by Tosolitis' theorem that says in a certain range things are... That says in a certain range things are easy. Then, in the bottom dimension, so using these finite-level cell structures, we get an exact sequence like this, where A lambda would kill things, kill transfers, and be killed by restriction. But here, this is now landing in groups of negative dimension, and there's nothing there. This says that this Vershebung map is an isomorphism. So we have to introduce more notation. So we will let have some, well I guess the wid Machifunctor, I will use this to write the sub-Machie functor generated by restriction to CPDM. And then phi n is the co-fiber. So an example in this case might make it worse, make things worse, but we can draw it at least. So here we have our friendly witt vectors machie functor. It's doing the thing it usually does. It's doing the thing it usually does. So now the transfers here, the transfer up here would be the subgroup generated by 5PA. As a subgroup here, that is abstractly isomorphic to just not PA, including as this thing. So abstractly, this Machief transfers from the identity subgroup is what some people maybe call the dual Machie functor for the underlying ring R. The underlying ring R. And the stuff happens over here. So in this notation, what we just showed is: so we said the bottom-tokey Machif functor of in degrees lambda n minus lambda infinity, or yeah, yes, is this Machifer generated by the trace, or generated by transfers. So that was in degree negative two, and then everything above it was the usual. And then everything above it was the usual Bachstedt, the usual homotopy. So, what we'll do here is we'll take this suspension to now put this Machiefunctor into degree zero. Then we now have a class in degree two, sigma, which will sort of generate everything above that. Then we kill that off to just isolate this Machief. And now we can suspend this sequence by this funny representation. So remember that Remember that, so now this will end at lambda, this will be lambda 1 through lambda to the n. So if I do that here, I would get lambda to the 0 through lambda to the n, which is what we said the 2n plus 2 slice cover should be. Here, we will lose this last copy of n, so this is what the 2n slice cover should be. And so now we've produced a map between these slice covers, and the cofiber is that spectrum that I claimed it was. Claimed it was. So now we need to check connectivity, check that these things are actually slices. So one part of this is actually completely formal: that for any Machiefunctor at all, in fact, this suspension will be a slice 2n truncated. So this is sort of a dimension count. The cell structures imply that if I started out with a Machia functor and I suspended that, I could only have homotopian some range of degrees, and so you just sort of count the dimensions of this. So, you just sort of count the dimensions of this. For connectivity, here I'll just illustrate what happens. So, let's say I took the four slice. I want the CP geometric fixed points to be at least ceiling floor over three, so they need to be at least two connective. But when I compute this, so the four slice will be S2 lambda zero, tensor, this trace zero, transfers from zero machine functor. zero transfers from zero machifunctor. Well, this sphere has no CP fixed points. So when we take the geometric fixed points, it goes away. And so now we're left with, well, we need to get something too connective. We might be in trouble since we don't have this sphere to provide the connectivity anymore. But because we looked at just things generated by transfers, this geometric fixed point is actually going to kill this Machi functor. So, whereas if we had taken, say, the Whereas if we had taken, say, the E-geometric fixed points, we needed to get something at least four-dimensional, then we would get the force suspension of this mapping functor. So the conductivity will be either you have enough spheres to get you the conductivity bound, or the geometric fixed points will just vanish because you generated by transfer. So this is sort of why you need that in there. Okay, so that is sort of the proof of the identification. Now we can try to understand what this. Now, we can try to understand what this filtration looks like. So, in order to actually turn this into filtrations on homotopy groups, we were to put it into the slice spectral sequence, you need to know homotopy of Machu functors like this, or homotopy of like these suspensions of Machu functors. So, then this homotopy of suspension representation th is the same as pi star. Uh pi star minus representation of th. So now I need to know some more stuff about ones graded by negative representations, negatives of actual representations. So I claim that this is in fact generated just by the Bochstit class, the A lambdas and the U lambdas, subject to the gold relations. So it's generated by these, and remember, I'm not allowed to put A lambda J. To put an a lambda j next to a u lambda i if j is less than i, because I can rewrite it. So, explicitly, how you would calculate. So, the regular gold relationships. Q analogs. Yeah. So the yeah, so explicitly to see what the generator is, so there's two ways to go about it. One is start with the generator just for the copies of the trivial reference. For the copies of the trivial representation. Then, as I add in representations starting with the biggest lambda i's and swapping u's for, swapping sigmas for u's. So here I start out with sigma squared, now I'll swap that for u lambda 1. Now I will swap that for another sigma for u lambda 0. And once you run out of sigmas, you just continue, start using a's until you get the correct dimension, correct degree. Correct degree. Going the other direction, you could start by putting in all of the A's just for the representation, and then adding in sigmas to convert some of those into U's, starting starting at the end. So in particular, if you pass this down to finite level for the TRNs, then since you know that the A's kill transfers, you can tell what the actual group would be, the TRN group would be. End group would be. So, in the case of, say, FP or just like perfect FP algebras, these groups have been known for quite some time. But the multiplicative structure and possibly the Mackey structure as well is sort of new with these gold elements. So, now we have to grapple with the slice filtration. So, the slice filtration is, well, we look at the At the stuff we would get from the Jith connective cover up from what we are, and then mapping that into pi 2i. So the classes explicitly were generated by, the classes were sigma to the n times u race lambda inverse. And we saw that, well, okay, these representations decompose. Decompose P locally in exactly the same way that these Q factorials decompose. And we also saw that these A's correspond to, for representations, correspond to those analogs of powers of P in exactly the same way. So this shows that we have the following relation. So the P n here, the reason I'm multiplying by P is that like here if I increase n by 1, I will necessarily pick up another factor. Another factor. So then, for it's easiest to understand the filtration on, say, pi2. Here, the filtration 2j, the filtration of pi2, will be the factorial, 2pj factorial times pi2. So again, that looks sort of like this, that the first, yeah, the second filtration stage would give us this, the fourth. Would give us this, the fourth, and then the sixth, we would pick up a p-squared factor. So this sort of looks like the usual Pasmikov or Nyingard filtration for the first P minus one steps, but then at level P, it does this jump. And then it sort of goes back to having the same graded pieces, but then it does these other jumps. It powers it to P. Alright, so this is just the filtration on pi 2. To see the To see the, if we looked at pi 4, again, I want you to think about I had a bunch of, started out with having all the a's, and now as I add sigmas, I'm going to lose some of them. So if I were looking at, say, the filtration on pi 4, I would look at a picture like this, and then strip off one of the longest beams that I have. Or maybe strip off like this, and this, and then this, and then I could start going this, this, this, and this. And this. So it's a little bit ugly to express this idea in a formula that basically would look at how many, if I threw away this and this and this and this, then I can at least factor out one of these from all of those, and then I would multiply by something like this, which again is this guy, and then I use a Frobenius. So this pattern is the same as this. Is the same as this pattern where I use a Frobenius to shift it to the right. So the explicit formula is: well, when j is less than 0, or I is 0, the filtration is trivial. And this is sort of weird, actually, that we don't get an interesting filtration on pi 0. And otherwise, it is given by this. So then we can describe the slice spectral sequence. We can explicitly We can explicitly have that the 2i Machi homotopy Machifunctor of the 2n slice is this thing. I'm not expecting you to parse all of this. I just would like to point out that this formula here is mysteriously similar to some of the things Martin wrote down. So if we're in a perfectoid case, we only were concentrating in even degrees. In even degrees. In the FP algebra case, we get some junk in odd degrees. So this will be a lot easier to parse in this form. Okay, so let's see how this works. So first of all, the colors denote sort of the highest power of A that I have, but that also corresponds explicitly to vanishing lines. So if I restrict it from the surface, Vanishing line. So if I restricted from the circle group to the trivial subgroup, I would only see this stuff on the bottom axis. If I was looking at the subgroup Cp, I would only have the red and the orange, and so on. So on the bottom axis, I have here the full Machiefunctor of width vectors. That's a very lonely column. Along here, these are all going to be constant Machiefunctors for this underlying perfectoid ring. Then, so again, So again, so each colored dot represents a Machief functor. The color represents, so I've got, what is the name of this Machiefunctor here? The color represents the highest A that I have, which will indicate the geometric or the fixed points disappearing. So here, since I'm orange, the bottom level of this Machi functor is zero. Here, since I'm yellow, the bottom two would vanish, and so on. Would vanish, and so on. So the color represents how many levels are zero at the bottom. The shape is sort of representing, I started out with this geometric fixed points Machi functor, but then I quotient by something. So here the reason that I have an or a circle is that the generator here is named a lambda zero, and the generator one above this is named A lambda zero squared. A lambda 0 squared. So when I shear off the sixth slice from the sixth cover from the four cover, I'd be multiplying by a lambda zero, which works out to be equivalent to a p squared. The reason I have a funny triangle here is that this generator is called a lambda zero squared, and the guy above it is called a lambda zero squared a lambda one. So the names of the generators are always going to differ by exactly one a, and then which a that is will tell you the shape of this. A that is, we'll tell you the shape of this. We can also see that, so the so this is an atoms indexing, so each column is extensioning up to the final group. The vertical axis is the filtration level, so the diagonals are the contributions from each individual slice. So if we look, think about the p-adic valuation of, so we have to divide all the numbers by two, so okay, three will have two interesting shapes above the red square. Interesting shapes above the red squares, so this circle and this triangle, then these are all chaotic valuation one. Then, if we go to 18, now we'll have three interesting shapes in this diagonal. So explicitly, this would be, say, this mod where we mod out by analog of p, this where we mod out by a p squared, and this where we mod out by a p cubed. So again, the sort of analog of this in the Again, the sort of analog of this in the classical filtration would be you would still have this sort of color pattern, but the shapes would just only be circles. Whereas here you have this sort of jumping behavior at p minus 1. See what happens at p equals 2. Yeah, so the pattern's a little more compressed. You can see things. And then if we were in the torsion case, If we were in the torsion case, we'd get a whole bunch of junk and negative degrees. So I don't yet understand, well, I sort of understand how it works, but writing it down is very, very unpleasant. Okay. So that was the size spectral sequence. So how do I go? Just leave you with some. There we go. Just leave you with some further questions. So, these are not things that I am necessarily working on, just sort of questions for the discussion. So, first of all, what happens for real topological Hausholt homology? The question is, so in the Antio-Nikolaus work, they have this cyclotomic T structure, but that turns out to be essentially the same as the Posnikov filtration on TR. So, if slices and ROG. So, if slices and ROG-graded homotopy are sort of variations of the Posnikov homotopy groups, would doing something like this for TR as a cyclotomic spectrum tell you anything? It might be junk, or it could be something interesting. So then, again, Dylan Wilson has this sort of framework for understanding slices, interpreting slices algebraically. So, I don't really know what that would look like here. Another question, so as I said, this. Another question, so as I said, this paper by Anschutz and LaFa was sort of a really crucial breakthrough moment in the paper. Is their use of Q factorials have anything to do with what I'm doing with them? Generalizations, well, most of these arguments were quite formal. I used boxed at periodicity, certainly. I used pistolitis' theorem, but that was just sort of as a shortcut cheat. So, you could probably generalize this quite simply. So, you could probably generalize this quite substantially. Another question would be whether I can, this can be generalized to what we call prisms. So these are generalizations of perfectoids beyond having to be, have a Frobenius be an isomorphism. Another question would be whether you can do this for something like THH of Z. So there's sort of two approaches to that. One would be to sort of redo, look at the classical THH of Z and try to guess. THHZ and try to guess something like this. And Proach I would be interested in would be to first try to generalize this to extend this to the Broykazin case, and then compute slices of relative, say, THH of ZP mod, or relative to this S-A-Joining uniformizer, and then try to relate that to the absolute THH, which is what Klaus and Nikolaus have done. And of course, the most pressing question is, what on earth does Question is: What on earth does this filtration mean arithmetically? All right, so I will stop there. Questions? Yeah. I mean, like, just in the light of what you started out with, like, sort of cheekifying that kind of situation, like, I guess you also have to understand the Like I guess you also have to understand the case of QRs, P rings. Like, um do you have any I mean like I guess it's related to your broadcism question. Is there a guess what kind of that slice refreshment would go back to that? So I don't have an actor in sort of the I'm going to act there in sort of a different direction, which is so, yeah, so when they study cursed perfect rings, they sort of reduce to the case of studying, so if r is perfectoid, they reduce to studying the ring r adjoint x to the 1 over p to the infinity mod x. So this is semi-perfectly, but not perfectly. And so this we can write as a collimate of r join x to the 1 over p to the n mod x. And this, if we sort of re-index the variable, is equivalent to one of these truncated polynomial algebras that Martin was talking about. So the way Hesselholt-Madsen approached this. Way Hesselholt-Matson approached this classically was: again, you have these M's. I mean, not right out the full formula, but so the way they analyzed them was putting together, fitting them into a co-fiber sequence. And this is so first of all, these are the same representations that showed up in the slice calculation. And I can now understand their ROG graded homotopy sort of multiplicatively using these A classes. So it's, I don't really understand what's going on yet, but it kind of looks like. But it kind of looks like the 2N slice. Let me just say, is related to it's related to the sum end in THH of this. I looked at pH of R join this thing n plus 1. So this is sort of the component of x to the n plus 1. So I don't really know what's going on here exactly yet. This is just sort of some back-of-the-envelope calculations and symbol association. And again, you see that sort of weird factorial divided factorial thing. Formulas similar but not quite exactly like that show up in, say, BMS2 and in Bot Schulze. So if that answers. Other questions? Thank you, Megan. We'll take a short break and then next talk start to. Short break, and the next talk starts at 4:15. So there's two ways you can copy C C F C. So you mean like Marvel's way in this whole thing? No, no, no. So I had a student who copied from Real Sorry. Okay, yeah, I was so when I'm if you re-index Because so when I'm if you re-index and you try to take the like limit over things, do you get an S is it just an H is it just that's a circle, or sorry, a sphere? Yeah, in any case, but let's see, so so that came. Let's see, so so so that gave one is fraction in fractional but then uh in DMS2 that's completely different. Yeah, you can rephrase it because they're face just kind of  And then with PRI to be secured. So they don't exist as R. I mean, it's a very special case here that you can know what the maximum is. If this was just some fake toy guy and then you brought out via suiting, then you can you cannot consider it like this at all. I mean, then the start of that. I mean, then the stars are matching this code because you can't but comparing this calculation and the collier calculation, so now you so you then you have to take the tape mark out of this and without undexter. But you don't know your animal that this is true. Except when the highest one it's it's it's uh not yeah. Yeah, and so for higher. I was wondering if that was related to the university which we could find. Sort of wondering if I could relate what this is to what's going on in their profit. Yeah, one thought of our conversation. So of course when there's one generator, you can cover this fine. Is there an accepted definition of higher long-term? Which is exactly what we're doing. And then here I can cut.
