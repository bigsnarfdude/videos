Thanks for the introduction, and thanks everybody for coming. So, this is joint work with Bo Yan Nohar, Robert Schmal, Karsten Thomason, and David Wood. Some non-empty subset of the authors are here, I believe. Okay. Okay, so let me write. So let me also start my talk with the graph minus structure theorem. So don't worry if you don't know what it is. It won't be necessary for the rest of the talk. But as we've seen, it's a good motivation for this product structure theory. Theory. And I think it's also sort of very illustrative of what a good structure theorem is. So let me just start with it. It's a theorem of Robertson and Seymour that describes every graph without a fixed graph as a minor. And so this is the picture. Those graphs can be described as Graphs can be described as basically graphs on a surface, together with some non-planar parts called vortices, together with some apex vertices, these yellow guys. And you have to clique some this picture. So if you don't know what those words mean, that's fine. For the purposes of this talk, the graph minor structure theorem, it's a procedure that describes Procedure that describes every graph that does not have a KT minor. And it's a weak structure theorem in the sense that every graph that's described by it excludes some Ks minor for S, some S bigger than T. So this class of graphs that it describes is not the class of Is not the class of all graphs. And the smaller this S is compared to T, the nicer the structure theorem is, but we don't really have exact structure theorems, even for, say, T equals five. So this is this second property is sort of, well, what motivates what a good structure theorem is. Motivates what a good structure theorem is. Okay, so the third thing about the graph minus structure theorem is that it doesn't say anything about planar graphs. So for the purposes of the structure theorem, planar graphs are just a basic class. So what we're interested in is, well, okay, what is the structure of planar? What is the structure of planar graphs? And in this talk, we're going to be even more ambitious. We want to know what is the structure of countable planar graphs. So here, countable means that the number of vertices is either finite or countably infinite. Um, so okay, I guess before I go further, I should say that this is my first paper on infinite graphs. And if you're like me, you probably spend most of your time thinking about finite graphs. So let me, I guess, say some propaganda for infinite graphs. So for So, first, I guess there's no reason to just think about finite graphs. Like, infinite graphs are kind of interesting structures to think about, and they're kind of fun to think about. So, just as a pure mathematician, I think they're pretty cool. And even if you don't care about them, they can often kind of illustrate things about finite graphs, new insights about finite graphs even. New insights about finite graphs, even. And for these universality questions, we'll see that thinking in terms of infinite graphs is actually kind of the right framework, in my opinion. So, okay, so that was just some infinite graph propaganda. Please think about them. And so. And so, I guess the beginning of the story is this old question of Ulam. And he asked, Oh, so before I go further, because I've stressed how cool infinite graphs are, every time I write a graph in this talk, it's going to be countable. So it means that it has countable numbers. Has a countable number of vertices. And if I want to talk about finite graphs, I will explicitly write finite. So Ulam's question was, okay, does there exist a countably infinite planar graph that contains every countably infinite planar graph? So I broke my rule for those two instances, but I'm now going to switch to just graphs. Going to switch to just graphs. And so, I mean, if the answer to this question is yes, that would be like the ultimate structure theorem for planar graphs, because all you would have to do is study this one graph, and it contains every planar graph as a subgraph. And it itself is planar, so it's supposed to be. So it's supposed to be one of the graphs that you're supposed to study. I see something in the chat. Make your presentation full screen. It's not full screen? It is. It is. It's all good. It looks full screen to us. Okay. All right. Good. Okay, yeah. So this would be the So this would be the ultimate structure theorem, but unfortunately, the answer to this question is no, right? So this was disproved by Janusz Pak. This is one of Janusz's first papers, actually. And he proved that if you are a graph that contains every planar graph as a subgraph, then you're necessarily not planar. So, right, so that says that, okay, you can't get something that's that nice, but what can you get, right? So that's where the that's what we wanted to think about. So Kuratowski. So, Kuratowski's theorem still holds for, well, infinite planar graphs. So, Janos's theorem can be phrased as: if you're a graph that contains every planar graph, then you either have k5 or k33 as a minor. So our first theorem strengthens Janus's theorem, and it says that if you're a graph that contains If you're a graph that contains every planar graph, then actually you contain an infinite complete graph as a minor. So not only a K5 minor, but this N0 is infinity. So that's even stronger than saying you've got a KT minor for. A k t minor for every finite t. So this is sort of some bad news. And similarly, you contain a subdivision of kt for every finite t so I mean, maybe this is not terribly surprising because since you're asking for everything as a subgraph. As a subgraph, you can't really control what happens when you take minors or when you take subdivisions. But nonetheless, this is sort of some bad news. And now I want to talk about some good news. So these theorems say that every Um, every graph that contains every planar graph is kind of complicated, it contains like these structures. Um, but you know, what is the simplest graph that contains every planar graph? So, of course, this is going to depend on your definition of simplest. So, the first thing that you might thing that you might try is well let's just take a complete graph with an infinite number of vertices that definitely contains every planar graph it's kind of simple but if we go back to what i said about the graph minus structure theorem we want our our description um to not describe too many things right so Many things, right? So everything that it describes should sort of be close to planar. So if we go back to this infinite clique, well, we've described everything, right? Every countable graph is a subgraph of this infinite clique. So this is not the answer. You can do a bit better by the de Brune-Erdish theorem, right? So the de Bruin-Erd≈ës theorem says that an infinite graph is, say, k-colorable if and only if each of its finite subgraphs is k-colorable. So what that means is that since finite planar graphs are four colorable, you could take this complete This complete four-partite infinite graph as your universal graph. So, this is a bit better than just taking an infinite clique. But it's still not really in the spirit of the second bullet point. Because if you look at finite subgraphs of this graph here, Of this graph here, they can be very dense, right? So you've got arbitrarily large complete bipartite graphs sitting inside here, and those things have like quadratically many edges. So graphs that have quadratically many edges are not like good approximations of planar graphs. So this is also not a good answer for our purposes. For our purposes. So, okay, what is a good answer? Well, let's look at the finite case for motivation, right? So we know that every finite planar graph is a subgraph of strong product P, where H has small tree width. Tree width is most. Has small tree width, tree width is most eight, uh, and some path p, right? Um, so I guess the important thing to observe in the finite case is that, um, first of all, this path P is going to be different, right, depending on the planar graph that we start with. Um, so its length is going to be Is going to be longer depending on this graph that we start with. But I want a single graph, just one graph that contains all the planar graphs. But of course, there's an easy way to fix that, I guess, would be to take an infinite path here, right? Either, say, a one-way infinite path, or I don't know, maybe a two-way infinite path. I don't know, maybe a two-way infinite path. That way, length is not a problem. You have all the length that you need. And this graph H, though, also, of course, depends on the planar graph that you start with here. So again, I just want one graph that contains everything. So this H here should be the same. So So, what it should be is some graph that contains every tree width at most eight graph, if that even exists. So let's make those changes. And it turns out that that's a theorem, right? So every planar graph, so remember, this is So remember, this is countable, these grants are infinite, is a subgraph of this T8. So T8 is the universal graph for tree with at most eight. So I will tell you what this is at some point during the talk. And this P infinity is just the one-way infinite path. So we only need this infinite path to branch off in. Path to branch off in one direction. So, this is a positive result. And I guess given all the talks that you've seen this week on graph product structure theory, you know that products do have a lot of nice properties. So, let me just list some of them, right? Why. Some of them, right? Why this is a good theorem. So we know that every finite subgraph of this universal graph has bounded minimum degree. So these graphs, even though this graph is infinite, it is sparse in some sense. It's sparse in the sense that each of its finite subgraphs is sparse. Finite subgraphs is sparse, which is good. That means it's at least sort of close to being planar. Did you mean minimum degree or average degree? I mean minimum. It's I think average is as well, so the same you just need to generate, so it's it's it's It's de-degenerate because, yeah, you're taking like all the finite subgraphs, right? So, so, in particular, you're going to take all the finite subgraphs of a fixed finite graph. Right? So, the degeneracy is bounded. Is that clear? Is that clear? Yeah, I think so. Okay. Okay, sorry. So the second key property is that if you look at finite subgraphs of this universal graph that have n vertices, they have small balance separators. So they have balance separators of size square root n. So in particular, So, in particular, our theorem implies the Lipton-Targen separator theorem, if you like. And the third key property is that this graph has bounded our coloring numbers. So I think these must have come up in some of the talks this week. So this is a key parameter in graph spark. In graph sparsity theory, it's maybe the best measure that your graph is sparse. It implies, for example, bounded degeneracy, but it also implies that many other coloring parameters are bounded. So I won't say what this is, but it's good evidence that your That your graph is sparse. Okay, so let me. Okay, so this property that I wrote is not true. So let's just move on. So, right, so let me start by, I guess, giving some ideas of ideas of this first theorem. So this extension of Pach's result that you must contain an infinite clique minor and also a subdivision of kt for every finite t. So yeah, let me at least give some ideas of, I guess, both of these proofs before Before I finish, so we're starting with a graph that contains all planar graphs as a subgraph. And I want to prove that it's got, say, an infinite clique minor. So I guess the first naive thing that you might try is you might say, well, hey, why can't. Well, hey, why can't I just put each planar graph as a separate connected component? That seems to avoid any large clique minors. That would avoid any K5 minors even. But there's an issue with that. So the issue is, so let's consider triangulation. Consider triangulations of the infinite grid. So this picture goes off into infinity. And let's zoom in on one of these faces. So I'm considering triangulations of this infinite grid. So there's actually two choices for how I can triangulate this face. I can either put in this diagonal, the one with slope one, or I can. Or I can put in the diagonal with slope negative one. So, what this means is that I've got two choices for each one of these faces. So the number of these triangulations is actually uncountable, right? So yeah, so that means that, well, I can't put each one of these triangulations as a separate connection. These triangulations as a separate connective component because I only have countably many vertices. So, okay, that doesn't work. So these triangulations of the grid must sort of overlap. And I guess the other extreme case would be if they kind of overlapped exactly, right? If they all shared the exact same frame. The exact same frame. So, like in this picture here, right? So, this is a graph that definitely contains every triangulation of the infinite grid, because I put both of these both of these diagonals in. But I guess this is the classic example of a one planar graph. One planar graph that contains a large clique minor. So if you've thought about one planar graphs, you've probably proved that this graph has a large clique minor. So the goal of the proof is to find something like this, right? Like this, right? And I'll tell you what that something is soon. Okay, so the way that we find this structure that's going to have the infinite clique is by the notion of limits. So these limits are defined. limits are defined by oops yeah so these limits are defined by you've got your um your graph u here and then you've got an uncountable collection of subgraphs that um satisfy some properties that they're like locally finite um they're connected uh and the important the key property is that there's like uncountably many of these subgraphs Uncountably many of these subgraphs. So given any such collection, you can define a limit as follows. So this limit will also depend on a vertex enumeration. So what you do is you enumerate the vertices of U in some arbitrary order. So V1, V2, and so on. And this is how. This is how the limit is defined. So we start at V1, and remember that each of these graphs in my family is locally finite. So that means that if I look at how each subgraph intersects. Each subgraph intersects the neighborhood of V1, that's going to be a finite set of edges, right? So the key observation is that the number of finite subsets of an uncountable set, or sorry, of a countable set is still countable. So what that means is that there must be a countable set of countries. Is that there must be an uncountable subfamily of G that intersects the neighborhood of V1 in exactly the same way. So maybe this uncountable subfamily all use precisely these four green edges here, right? So I will put those edges into the limit, right? limit right uh and now i just continue uh i continue with v2 and i again um i'm restricting to this uncountable subfamily that i got um after the first step and i again know that there must be some uncountable subfamily of my subfamily um that intersects v2 in exactly this V2 in exactly the same way. So maybe in those four edges there. And then I just continue doing this. So I proceed to V3. There is, again, some uncountable subfamily of the family I got at the second step that intersects the neighborhood of V3 in exactly the same way. And I put those edges into limit. In the limit. And I just keep on doing this until I've exhausted all the vertices in the graph. So the limit is like all the green edges that I get during this process. So any subgraph of U that I can obtain by this procedure is called a G limit. So our strategy will be to apply, to take a G limit of a particularly nice collection of subgraphs. So for example, like triangulations of the infinite grid would work. But something more general works. General works actually. So let me say that a plane graph is F isoparametric if so for every cycle of length n, there's only a small number of vertices inside the cycle. So small will be given by this function f. So for example, For example, these triangulations of the grid are about n squared isoparametric, right? Every cycle of length n has at most around n squared vertices inside. And for us, it won't really matter what this function f is as long as it exists. Okay, so that's f isoparametric. That's F isoparametric. So, yeah, that's just a picture. So, if you've got a cycle with six vertices in your plane graph, then you've got at most like f of six vertices inside this region. Okay, and so it turns out that if you apply this limit, sorry, this limit procedure to a collective To a collection that's NICE. So, NICE just means that each graph in your collection, each subgraph, is for connected F isoparametric for some F and is a planar triangulation. So, this limit lemma says that if you apply that procedure that I described two slides ago, Two slides ago, what you'll end up with is something, this limit, will still be four-connected, it will still be F isoparametric, it will still be a planar triangulation. And the key is that, okay, so there were just too many conclusions. So this goes into the next slide. So the key is that You're going to also have infinitely many pairwise disjoint jumps of this limit. So, let me define what this is. So, remember, this limit is just some four connected F isoparametric plane triangulation. And a jump is just And a jump is just a path in the graph, so it's not in the triangulation at all, whose endpoints are not adjacent. So say these blue vertices are not adjacent in the triangulation. And this jump is just a path that's elsewhere in the graph, all of whose internal vertices are not in the triangulation. So that's what a jump is. What a jump is. And the conclusion is that you've got infinitely many pairwise disjoint jumps. So you've got like this infinite matching of jumps. Okay, so just to, I don't know, go back to this example, jumps can be single edges. So for example, if my If my triangulation was the grid together with all the red edges, then all these blue edges would be jumps. Right. So you probably already know how to find this infinite clique minor, like in this example. But it turns out that the, you know, the bare minimum properties in your, in the Properties in your proof that you probably have in mind is that this triangulation of the grid is for connected and that you've got infinitely many of these jumps. It doesn't really matter that you've got a jump in every phase as long as you have infinitely many. You can make the proof work. So So that's what this lemma says. So it says that once you've got an F isoparametric for connected triangulation together with infinitely many jumps, then you have this infinite cleave minor. So this is just a graph theory lemma. And the proof is not too easy, but Not too easy, but so for example, it uses the two-linkage theorem from Graph Miners to do some routing, but just think of it as a harder version of this proof that you probably know. So I won't say anything more about this proof, and maybe I should speed up. And maybe I should speed up. Okay, so that's all I'm gonna say about our first theorem. Now I wanna talk about these nice descriptions. Okay, yeah, so the same proof will also give you this subdivision of KT for finite t. You have to be a bit careful. Bit careful because you need high-degree vertices. But in the limit lemma, you're free to choose the set G that you apply it to. So you can actually get high degree vertices. Okay, so let me now talk about the positive results. So remember, the theorem is that every The theorem is that every planar graph is a subgraph of this small tree-width graph, the same small tree-width graph, a strong product with a one-way infinite path. So, yeah, so let me at least tell you like what this T8 graph is. And yeah, so as far as we know, this is sort of a new way to think about bounded tree width graphs. So even for finite graphs, we weren't like aware of what I'm about to tell you being known. So I mean, if you recognize this, please tell me. So the construction is So the construction is as follows. So first let's be modest and get a universal graph for tree width at most one. So that's universal graphs for trees. So that's easy. Like what you do is you just take a vertex and you add infinitely many neighbors. And then you just repeat. So there's a dot, dot, dot there. That means that this vertex also has infinite degree. And you do that for like all. And you do that for like all of these vertices as well. And so on, so on. I'm only showing this part of the tree, but all of this infinite branching is happening everywhere. So it's clear that what I've defined is a tree. And moreover, it contains every tree because every countable tree, you can just put in here. There's enough. Can just put in here, right? There's enough room to smoosh that tree in there. So that's the universal graph for tree width at most one. And so how are we going to get the universal graph for tree width at most K? So what we're going to do is we're going to add some edges to this universal graph depending on a coloring of the vertices. So suppose So, suppose I've colored this tree with finitely many colors, and I have a rule about how to add edges. So the rule is that if I look at two vertices and X is an ancestor of Y, then I add the edge XY if and only if. If and only if X is the only vertex on the XY path that has that color, the same color as X. So in this case, the color of X is green, and X is the only green vertex on this XY path. So I add the edge. That's what the rule says. That's what the rule says. If x and y were these two vertices, I would not add the edge because x is blue, but there's another blue vertex on the xy path in the tree. So this edge is not added. So just to be concrete, along this path here, these are the edges that I would add according to the rule. The rule. And then the universal graph for a tree with at most k is now simple to describe. All you need to do is color the universal tree with k plus one colors. And the only condition on the coloring is that each vertex should have infinitely many children of each color. I mean, besides its own color, of course. Own color, of course. So that's the only restriction on the coloring. And then you just add edges to the tree according to the rule. And it turns out that, oops, that when you do that, the resulting graph is universal for tree with the most k. So this means that every graph with tree with the most k. Every graph with tree width at most k is a subgraph of this graph here. And also, this graph itself has tree width at most k. So it is some tree width at most k graph that you're supposed to think about. So yeah, and these colors are actually kind of important for the proofs. So it's sort of important. Sort of important that we have this perspective about what bounded tree width means via these colors. The proof actually uses that. So again, if anyone knows if this was known before, please let me know. Okay. So let me, I guess, also say that the way that the proof is written The proof is written, any improvement that's done in the finite case will automatically carry over to the infinite setting. So for example, the latest and the greatest is that instead of tree width at most eight here, you can actually replace it with something called, well, you can get the bound down to six instead of eight. And you can And you can get it for simple tree width instead of tree width. So, this is true for finite graphs, and that just automatically carries over to the infinite setting the way that the proof is written. Okay, so let me, in my remaining time, let me, I guess, talk about, yeah, so here, of course, you can. Yeah, so here, of course, you can also have just tree width at most three if you want to lower the tree width bound to something that's best possible at the cost of like introducing this extra K3 factor like here. So this is also true in the in the infinite setting. So again, remember, planar graph means countably infinite planar graph. So let's go. So let's go, I guess, beyond, yeah, beyond planar graphs. So again, every improvement carries over to the infinite setting. So by what I guess the Monash Hub did, we get this result for infinite graphs. So we get this tree with three instead of a tree with four here, which holds for. Here, which holds for in the infinite setting as well. And okay, there's lots of other results about, you know, K-planar. Like the paper is very long, but I hope readable. So if you're interested, just check it out on the archive for like many other results. Okay, so let me. Let me just finish by describing a different construction that we have. So here, I guess, are some nice properties, some key properties that we would want universal graphs to have. So three of these, I guess, we saw before: finite subgraphs having bounded min-degree, small balanced separators, the sparsity condition on Sparsity condition on our coloring numbers. And this fourth condition, which would be nice, is that you do not contain a subdivision of an infinite clique. So we have a different construction that almost satisfies all these key properties. So it's actually a different proof, it's a different construction. And I guess by And I guess by almost, I mean that it satisfies all of these guys, except for this balanced separator. So this theorem is for graphs that don't have a KT minor, and we actually get something stronger. So we actually get all of these graphs as induced subgraphs, and we get all We get all these nice properties except for this balanced separator claim. So we actually still get like sublinear separators. So I mean, we would want separators of size square root n, because in a minor closed class, you do have separators of size at most square root n, but we get something like Something like n to the three-quarters log n. So it's still sublinear, but it's not like tight. So again, like I'm not going to say anything about the proof, but except for that it uses this nice tool that David talked about in his talk, chordal partitions. Okay, so let me finish with some open problems. So remember, So remember, the general theme is: okay, like, what is the simplest graph that contains every planar graph? So it would be nice if there was actually one that satisfied all four of those key properties. We don't know if that's true. One of the questions that I listed on co-author is: is there even a minimal one? So, is there a graph that contains every planar graph? Contains every planar graph and is minimal under the subgraph relation. So one of the cute proofs in the paper is we showed that if you're a graph that contains every planar graph, you can actually prune the graph. So you can find a potentially smaller subgraph that still contains every planar graph, but actually has infinite edge connectivity. It actually has infinite edge connectivity. So that would mean that, you know, whatever this minimal graph is, it has infinite edge connectivity. So, okay, let me stop. I think I'm a bit over time. So, thank you.
