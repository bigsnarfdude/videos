This conference and for giving me the opportunity to present my work. So, today I will speak about limit theorems of functions and distribution piece. We'll see what kind of functions and what kind of piece. Let me say that this presentation is based on two joint papers with Ivan Lutin and with Nikolai Lonenko, Ivan Lutan, and Francesca Starart. Okay, let's start with some notation. So, this is our setting and our notation. P will be a stationary Gaussian field on R D. T will be our dimension. And so it's a collection of standard Gaussian variables. And we assume B to be stationary, so B has a covalence function C. C and we fix a function, a class of functions. So we fix a compact set in the Euclidean space, a function phi from R to R, which is not linear. And we consider this function. yt is the integral of phi of b on a growing domain t. So I simply study as t goes to infinity, these kind of functions. This is a quite classical problem. And despite this, there are still many open questions, simple but open questions about this kind of problems. And okay, so we want to study the limit distribution for y tilde, okay? The normalization of y t. So, in particular, we'll focus on this case for simplicity. We'll choose the function phi to be this function continuous. For simplicity, we'll focus on the case in which the function is an indicator function and in particular is an indicator function negative minus mm. So under this assumption, our function has a geometric meaning, which you want to think about in a discrete way is the set of points, okay, it's the volume. Points, okay, is the volume, is the number of points in which the field is between minus n and n. And we consider the continuous version of this equivalent. So we compute the volume of this random set. And let me say that actually I compute the volume, but there are also people studying also topological properties of this kind of random set, like the number of connected components or. Or yeah, like when you take level sets, then things are a bit more complicated. You can study other topological properties. But okay, we'll focus on this function. And so we study the integral of the indicator valuated in a Gaussian field, that's the domain group. And we want some assumption on our Gaussian field. So, and if you think about that, when you sum random variables or you integrate random variables, you want assumptions of a weak redependence usually, okay, to prove CLTs. And in this context, a very classical definition is that of short memory. So, if I have a stationary random field A, that is not necessary Gaussian, and it has covariance function K, then I say that A has a short memory if K is integrable. If k is integrable, it's either one. And I say that A has long memory if K is not integrable. Okay, so in our case, in our particular case, where A is this indicator of the Gaussian field, if C is the coherence function of the Gaussian field, then one can prove that the random field I integrate as short memory if and only if C is in L2. So in our particular case, the condition of short memory corresponds to C being. Memory corresponds to C being in a 2. And these are two classical results for this kind of functionals. The first is due to Brier and Meier, and the second was proved for our example, let's say, by Taku, and that extended and generalized by W Shin and Meyer. So, what do these results say? So, the first one by Brett Miles says that if you are in a short memory situation, so if what you integrate as short memory, if C is in a 2, then you obtain a C L T. And the second one is, let's say, when C is not in L2, you need some, you need more precise assumptions because. Because actually, you don't have a result stating that if C is not in L2, you don't have L C. But if you assume something more precise, that your covariance function has a polynomial decay in the norm, and this decay is 0, so it is like norm of x to the beta with beta smaller than half, strictly less than the or 2. You are in a long memory situation and you don't have spit. Okay, for now, it's a bit. Okay, for now it's a little hand-waving with short, long memory, but the important fact here is that this intuition can be very misleading. Okay, so it's not true that if C is not even 2, you don't have a CFT, and it's not that this falls only special cases or critical cases, but you can construct large classes of gaps. Large classes of Gaussian fields which you have long memory but assumes. So these are our two motivating examples. What we want to show is that for these two examples, but not only for these examples, you have long memory but a CLT. So the first example is an example which is very important also in applications, is Barry's random wave model. So Berry's Model. So Berry's Lon-De-To-Wave model was introduced by Berby to approximate Laplace eigenfunctions, the inbounded domains, in which... So if you have a domain on the plane and you consider the Laplace eigenfunctions, in some domains, they have a counter behavior. So, the counter-behavior means that we have like the non-ad set. The labeled sets, 110, for example, have this very Cautic V and what Berry conjectured was that actually this Gaussian field with this coherence function well approximates this kind of Laplacian information. Functions. And what is important for us here is that if the covariance function is that of the horizontal we model, so it's defined in this way, is the Fourier transform or characteristic function of the unit for the distribution on the sphere. Then you have this kind of decay for the coherence function. So it's a kind of k. So it's for the normal in the norm to evaluate. For the novel in the norm to have exponent that is strictly smaller than the over two, so we would be in a long number situation, if you want to use this definition. But you have this cosine, so still c is not in a 2, but you have oscillations, okay? So the idea here is that we have a slow decay, but with oscillations, so you can find the subsequent. So, you can find a sub-sequence that has long memory and a sub-sequence that has much short memory. So, what happens? We are like in the middle, let's say. And in fact, we can prove that in this case, we have a CLT, even if we are in a long-manual situation, if we follow that situation. And another class of examples is this one. So, when B as a covariance function, C, X1, X2 can be that every C, x1, x2 that can be written as the product C1, X1, C2, X2, and you have long memory in one component and short memory in the second component. Sorry, yeah, in the other component. Okay, so even in this case, C would not be in L2, so this classical definition, yeah, C would not be in L2, so we are in a sh long memory situation, but still, you can prove that it's enough to have. You can prove that it's enough to have short memory in one component only, and you obtain a CIT. So, okay, and since I gave an example for the first case, here a very important example is, for example, when you study the rectangular increments of a fractional Barnett sheet on the plane sample or the D-dimensional version. So, what you have is you have the fractional balance sheet, you want to study, I don't know, for example. You want to study, I don't know, for example, the quadratic variation or the function we considered before. And you consider the rectangular increments, so the double increments in one direction, depth x1 and z2, of a fractional inner sheet with parameters h1 and h2. And this is can be our p with this separable colours. With this separable correlation function. So, regarding the first example, why even if C is not in a 2, we have a C. Well, this is a consequence of this result that I propose with one. So here the assumptions are quite simple because we are restricted to the case of the indicative function, but for general files more people technical. And they are the following. So, if the dimension is greater than 2 and my covariance function is a radial function, and if the covariance function is continuous, so by Bogner's theorem, it has a spectral measure G, is the characteristic function of some probability measure G. And if my probability measure is not too concentrated in zero, and this is mathematically expressed by this condition on the negative moment. By this condition on the negative moment, and I have a C. So, if we take, for example, Veris Langovi model, you have the uniform distribution of the sphere, and so on. It's not concentrated, zero, of course, and you obtain this unity. But you can construct a lot of examples. It's enough to take, for example, a spectral density that is not in L2, but is bounded in zero, and that's enough. So, you can construct a huge class of Gaussian fields where C is not in L2, but Where C is not in L2, but you have a. And regarding the second example, where you have separable co-s functions, what we studied is this class of functionals that we call the p-domain functional, but actually it's not it's a fancy name to mean something very simple. So we simply integrate over a domain. Over a domain that is Cartesian product T1 D1 times TPDP, and T1 and TP can grow possibly at different rates. So the meaning of this object is just spatial, so the most important example is spatiotemporal functional, where your Gaussian field is a random quantity. It could depend on space-time, but it could depend also at the variable's velocity. I don't know. And what you want to study is your function, your geometric function. Your functional, your geometric functional when the space window and the time window, for example, grow possibly create. And okay, so our result says that if the covariance function is separable and you ask minimal decay condi integrability condition on C, for example, if it has polynomial decay or If it has polynomial decay of arbitrary exponent is true. Then it's enough to have short memory for only one CI to obtain a CRT. So if I have the covariance function that I can write as a product C1 times Cp, it's enough to have that Ci is 2 of our Ti to have C it. So, of course, also in this case, we can construct many examples in which your CLT would run the match. Okay, so how much time? Five minutes? So, okay. I think I can give a sketch of the proof, the technique, or the technique. So let's consider the case p equal to two. Consider the case p equal to 2 and I consider my functional y to 1 to 2 is this indicator of the x d x over t 1 e 1 times t. Okay, so what we want to prove Is that if C is C1, tensor, C2, let's say that if C1, for example, is in F2, then Y T1, T2 is the close for Gush. So, the first step is to observe that. Observe that without loss of generality, Ci is a covariance function. Because without the loss of generality, I can assume that Ci of 0 is 1, C2 of 0 is 1. So Ci is a covariance function. And so I can take a Gaussian field Bi on R B I with covariance functions in Amin. And I can define y i di, which is defined as follows. So it's the same function for di. Okay. So if C i is an L two okay if I Okay. If Ci is negative, then we know that this is asymptotic by Brilliant-Mayor theorem. And okay, I don't have a lot of space, but what is important here? What is important here is that so actually when you have a function out of this 4 you can use a counting you can so this is an L2 of omega and we can write it we can write this L2 decomposition In terms of Lmid polynomials, so these are Lmid polynomials, and this is an orthogonal decomposition in L. And so, in this case, we can study different cases, and what is important here is that for this specific sample, when you obtain a Specific example when you have the indicator function. The study of this object is reduced to the study law. Let's say only the second CATIC component or each single Cautic component. But what is really important is that actually you can focus only on the second component. only on the second component. Because in the other case, it's say the other case is easier. And when you are in a fixed Cautic component, you can use fourth moment theorems. So fourth moment theorems will not shall tell you that you don't want to That your y is if it's of this form, once normalized, goes to Daushan if and only if its fourth cumulant goes to zero. So, here the idea is simply to prove that simple my for My fourth term round is bas by the assumption that C is C one tensor C two goes like the product of multiple ones And so if this happens If this happens, then the fault cumulant of y i of y i goes to zero, and also the fault cumulant of y goes to zero. And I am a zero. This is more or less the sketchable proof. And let's say what we would like to do is to pass from this quite easy structure covariance structure. Easy covariance structure to like quasi-separability and maybe try to treat with general expansions or general classes of covariance functions. So I thank you for your attention. Any questions? I have a question so are you able to do like Are you able to do it in other geometric settings? Yes, these kind of functions are studied also in other geometric settings. For example, they are studied on this. They are studied on for example, there is a result by By Marinucci, Rossi, and Didoto that studied the case where, for example, your progression field depends on is on the sphere. On the sphere, or also the world where actually so there is another work where they work on manifolds satisfying some properties, and they study the study the they study the expression volume so so they integrate on the sphere and they study what happens when the time when the time window increase or they integrate on the manifold and they The manuscript. And they study, let's say, yeah, this volume. There are also other works that study topological properties of this kind of random set. I think are very interesting. No, no, I don't think there is another provider of the group, no. Let's turn to the another question. We'll take five minutes, then we'll be six minutes, yeah. Six minutes.
