Group that has been working on this for a while. And as many of you know, when you do this stuff, the first challenge is figuring out a common vocabulary so you can actually understand what each other is saying. It took us a while to do that before we ever got to the Nature Climate Change paper. So these are the papers that Brian already mentioned. So there were three out of this group and a bunch of other ones. So a little bit of background. Brian maybe mentioned some of this. The models of climate change are based mostly. Of climate change are based mostly on physical processes. There's not been much in the way of connections to behavior. I think our nature climate change paper was the first one that really did this, but Tom Verry, who worked with Chris and Moner, came out right around the same time or so. And the standard economic models that are used in these things make some intertemporal rational economic behavior assumptions that are probably not accurate at all if you're interested to talk about any. At all, if you're interested in talking about technology, we can do that. And what we know is that the impacts of climate change are likely to alter human behavior. And the question is, how do we incorporate these things? And throughout our stuff, it's been that we assume that the key driver of changes of behavior are risk perception and that that drives changes in attitudes. So, this is part of the theory of plant behavior, but it's not just that theory. There's bunches of these, those long theories, list of theories that Of theories that Brian mentioned that incorporate something like that. The major questions that we address are: some of these are, you know, they're all in progress, to be honest. What models might be used to analyze how risk perception impacts climate? How might we analyze the feedbacks between climate and human response, and how to do that in the right way? That's one of the real challenges of these integrated socio-physical. Socio-physical, biotic Earth system models. Are there major impacts on climate projections when human behavior feedbacks are included? We've sort of answered that to some extent. We did it. Chris and others have done it too. So there's now a collection of models that say, yes, behavior matters. And what's not clear is the uncertainty is associated with the human behavior components versus the physical components. Components. And how might we incorporate various psychological and social theories to be modeled in here? And there's loads of them, and we haven't done nothing more than scratch the surface. And how consistent are the results that we obtain based upon those different models? So Brian showed a figure from one of our papers in which we tried to identify this. So the theory of planned behavior, just out of curiosity, how many of the folks in here? Yeah. Folks in here. Yeah, so there's actually some of the psych folks know this. It's one of the classic, now classic, it's been around for about 50 years. It considers how attitudes and perceived social norm and what's called perceived behavioral control, whether or not you believe that you actually have any control over the situation, whether your behaviors matter, affect attitudes, and then therefore affect behaviors, which in this case would be chronic. Which in this case would be climate mitigation stuff. Brian already showed this. I just wanted to point out that the cognition piece in this is down in here. It's just in the sensing and perceiving. And that's where I'm going to focus on. This was really, really simple. And we've now sort of key in with a lot of our psych colleagues to say that that's better. And then there's the sort of social norm part of it, which I'm not going to say much about. But just to indicate, this is a Indicate this is a graph through time of incorporating that model. This was the nature of climate change one, and shows that the behavior components can lead to really large changes. This is from a standard, let's call it an RPC run, in which the behavior can make big differences in global temperature by 2100. And it doesn't necessarily, we didn't bias this thing so that it would. didn't bias this thing so that it would always decrease global temperature. You can, everybody can drive an SUV and feedback on each other anything. Okay? And the other thing that we did, and Brian mentioned this as well, is this is a regression tree approach. I don't know how many of you have ever looked at that, but the idea is to be able to partition out along the lower axis here is the ending global temperature at 2100. So in this case, 3.8 degrees versus. Case 3.8 degrees versus up to 5.7 degrees, and to partition out which of the factors which are driving the model's suggested results, the projections from the model, towards one end versus another. In this case, it was social norms and perceived behavioral control. The objective is to do the same thing, to partition out which aspects of behavior drive the changes in one direction versus another, because that then gives you a handle on whether or not it actually matters. It actually matters. And again, Brian showed this. I'm not going to talk about the sort of contagion pieces of this. I'm going to focus only on cognition pieces, which were not very well characterized in either of our previous models. So this is sort of taken from a paper in the Journal of Environmental Psychology that sort of partitions out the factors that affect climate change. Climate change risk perception. And there's the pieces that are down at the bottom here that are basically the social norms and social interaction pieces of it. And then there's the cognition and experiential processing parts up there. Okay? And so I would argue that a really effective model should incorporate both. We've tried to do both in our early ones, but we've realized we did a really crappy job on the Really crappy job on the cognition pieces. And so that's what I'm going to focus on, how we're thinking about that now, which would also apply to EPI sorts of stuff. Okay, so there's a range of social science processes to explain how people react to new information. The initial theory of risk perception assumed that people were rational. And basically, it's And basically, it's now clear from a variety of work that people, the theory is that what's called bounded rationality, which means that there's all kinds of biases that come into play that tie into emotions and experience and so on. And experience really matters. So that people's experiences with changing climate can strengthen your perceptions of climate risk, but it's mediated by how you process information. Okay? How you sense information. Information, okay? How you sense and forget, and that's what cognition is. And this is Daniel Kahneman, who won the Nobel Prize, among other things, and sort of the father of behavioral economics in terms of thinking about how to put together behavior pieces into economic decision-making. So we can sort of think of how to deal with cognition is how likely is something to occur? And this is what Kahneman would call the availability heuristic. Heuristic, okay? That risks may come more quickly to mind if someone has personal experience or has a relative, neighbor, or potentially a media or social influencer who influences you're able to bring that to mind. And then there's the aspect of recency. Sometimes it's what happened most recently that impacts you. And so these are both aspects of how likely it is that a behavior. How likely it is that a behavioral change or an attitude change may occur. And then there's the issue of what's normal, okay? So, how do we specify your baseline of information? And the climate change models are often over 30 years, 50 years, 100 years. And human risk perception doesn't operate on that time scale. The general sort of literature says it might be from two years to 10 years with some sort of Two years to ten years is some sort of average around five or so. Okay, so habituation is the term that's used for whether or not you actually get used to the experience that you have and that there's a shifting baseline. So if you're as old as me, you remember a very different climate from someone from my grandson will be remembering a climate, right? The baseline is shifting. And then there's the question of how scary it is. A question of how scary it is. So, there's what's called the affect heuristic, in which you can basically say that you know risk occurs due to emotional responses to things. And sometimes those emotional responses about dread and fear arise due to because certain events are more salient than others. So, that if your house was completely flooded out, that's a very salient event relative to the others which were much more mild. Which was much more minded. And then there's the issue of: is it due to climate change? So the notion of what's called biased assimilation, sometimes called motivated reasoning, is a process by which, depending upon who you interact with, you have some directional bias associated with whether or not you believe this event or this series of events lead to a change in attitude and behavior. It's kind of Bayesian in the sense that. It's kind of Bayesian in the sense that there's an updating that goes on, and that updating depends upon what social group and so on that you interact with. So the polarization, I think somebody mentioned polarization. We've been thinking about that, although it's not in this module. Second, Chris? Okay, I remember. And so your degree of climate skepticism is altered depending upon your exposure to. Depending upon your exposure to things like cold weather. So, the less skeptical people might likely report lots of cold weather as evidence that climate change is happening, but those who are more skeptical will be saying, oh, no, this means it's not happening. So, how do we model these cognitive processes? There's no one agreed-upon way to do cognition modeling at all. So, the way we think about it is a set of switches to turn. A set of switches to turn on and turn off certain processes. And then it allows us to basically say, okay, if this process is operating relative to this other process, it's more likely or less likely to lead to attitudinal changes. The entire model is a non-stationary, non-markov stochastic process, and I'm not going to go into the details of that. But this is the picture that Brian showed. The key thing I want you to take away from this is that we have sub-models. Is that we have submodules? Okay, here's the event stuff over here. Size of events leads into affecting whether or not there's a salience, meaning that this size event matters for different groups. And recency salience corresponds to these are the recent events and they're kept in memory for some time period. So there's a memory processing thing that goes on there, and that's affected by habituation. Brian showed this reactivity graph. Branch of this reactivity graph, which how extreme events affect risk perception in a variety of qualitative forms. The key thing to take away here is that you see these different colored arrows in there, those different colored arrows correspond to different routes through this model that can be incorporated to include different assumptions about what cognitive processes we're operating. Could include all of them, or you could change it. All of them, or you could change it through different ways. And then there's opinion group modeling, and there's a whole body of theory. Rebecca and others have done these things. And so we just assume three opinion groups throughout this model. You can think of them as opposed, neutral, or basically willing to change and mitigate things. Very quickly, so we keep track of a number of events. It's driven by a simple Poisson process. It's driven by a simple Poisson process driven by temperature, but we have a few scenarios in this in which you let it go up or down. So the Poisson process has a mean number of events per minute time, and then we have a size of events that are chosen from a log normal to some median that gives you a sort of mean size for number of events. And then there's a set of thresholds that might be different for different groups because different size events affect those groups in a different way. Those groups in a different way. So, salience here, whether or not an event matters to your information processing and the change of decisions, are taken into account by both the size of the events. And that differs between groups and recency. And we've got a couple of different ways. You know, memory, there's all kinds of models of memory. And so we chose a couple of them. One with essentially a fixed threshold. So I think Rebecca's idea of a fixed. I think Rebecca's idea of a fixed number of interactions, that length of time. So that's like this is how long in the number, and that's it. It comes in and goes out. And another one, which is basically an exponential waiting through time of the biased assimilation basically operates to increase or decrease the threshold at which you perceive an event or multiply it for different groups. The models implemented in The model is implemented in Stella. It's not a huge model. There's about eight switches in it and about 30 parameters. So it's not outrageous to look at. There hasn't been much talk about evaluation. So, I mean, these models, except for the statistical model, AIC, whether you like it or not. So, you want to make sure that the model is coded to do what you expect it to do. Expect it to do. You want to look at sort of general quality, what could be called qualitative or theoretical corroboration in the model, whether it's sort of doing meeting your expectation that as you increase mean number of events, risk perceptions should go up, those sorts of qualitative things. Then you choose a set of switches for which you have some general guidance from close conversations with our site colleagues and data from various surveys. You've heard a lot about survey data. You've heard a lot about survey data, and then fourth, you carry out an uncertainty analysis and look at the differences there. So, quickly, some take-home lessons: the linkages to economic and policy models are still really limited. And I think this is just as true for the EPI models as it is for the climate change stuff. Political systems, we did a really simple job in our nature paper. Nature paper is not very good. There's not much out there in sort of tying into political systems into this. And I'm not aware of it, but maybe somebody can correct me on the episode of things. Multiple models are good. It's really useful to compare alternative both modeling approaches and assumptions within those models. And so, given the host of different behavioral theories, comparing behavioral processes to identify those. Behavioral processes to identify those with most impact, I think, and building a model that allows you to do that. So, I mean, you could do it through multiple different models, or you could build one with switches that allows you to turn things on and off. And that was our approach. Model evaluation for all types of these behavioral models is relatively rare. It's really, I think, important to tie the evaluation criteria while you're doing the model to a set of criteria up front to think about how you're going to. To think about how you're going to do that in the end. And there really is benefit from collaboration. I've learned a phenomenal amount from my collaboration with the psychology and sociologists that we've been collaborating with. So I will shut up. So thank you very much. That's it. I probably
