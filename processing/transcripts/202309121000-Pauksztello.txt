It's a pleasure to introduce our first speaker this morning, Theodore Cristello. He's going to talk about Silting Theory 2, the return of the G-batter. I wish I thought of that. Thank you very much for the introduction. Yeah, I would have had a proper. Yeah, I would have had a proper title, but you know, this is last part of the last lecture and then history rearranged next lecture. So, where we got to at the end of the last lecture is I define these two mutation formulae. I'm given the categorical formulae, I have an approximation formulae here. The reason will become clear in a moment. And here I had some silting object M, so it's just the additive. So it's just the additive whole of the three objects here, and then I'd mutated at left mutated, which of course moves right at M prime to get the new silting object, which was L M prime M. M prime m so I'm going to tell you in the first part of this lecture why this is an obviously a silting object okay so first just some basic properties so proposition 12 so the mutations are silty The intersections of a silting subcategory in its mutations are equal to the subcategory of the silting subcategory which you've mutated at and finally. And finally, if I do a right mutation followed by a left mutation, I get back to M and vice versa. Left mutation followed by a right mutation. I get M and these all follow quite straightforward. Actually, I think this is proposition 13 because this was example 12. I switched the orders. Switch the orders. Okay. So to explain essentially why these formulas hold, why this is a silting object, I'm going to use a notion defined by Iyama Nyoshino in the seminar at Invencione's paper on mutation. So P. So P in D is rigid, which means that there are no morphisms from P to the shift of P a per X Y, no longer a T strictrum, is a P mutation per. If unsurprisingly P is contained in Y, which is contained in P star the shift of X intersect the left part of sigma P, which I hope you agree looks quite a bit like this formula. And E contained in X contained in this In X containing, let's get this right: negative shift of Y star P intersect the right perp of negative shift of P, which looks like this formula. So, essentially, what is a P mutation per? It's a pair of subcategories which are closed, which are exchanged by P mutations. Yes. As I tell my students, every sentence needs a verb. Thank you. So the main theorem which explains the relationship, in my view, is this theorem of the Yama Yang. Which sort of OS put because it's very similar in a different context. In fact, this paper relates them, but it's a little beyond the scope of this lecture. The theme of the Yami Yang says let P be pre-silting satisfying A and B of proposition six, so i.e. A P covariately finite in oh, let me remember which one sigma less than zero p per controvertly by. Contravantly finite in the left curve of this and B role D in B home E sufficiently large shifts at D is zero and home Um B sufficiently large shifts but P has zero. Where am I after? Set Z to be the left perp of positive shifts of P intercept The right part of negative shifts of P, then the Z in itself is a P mutation power and U equals Z modulo. Module P, the subfactor category has objects scores of Z and morphisms from in Z X Y modulo those morphisms which factor through P So, this subfactor category is a triangulated category with shift functor given by I take an object Z I take Take a left p approximation. This spits out the cone, which I call Z shifted by one, and there's the shift of Z. So the shift of Z is formed by mutating, doing a left mutation of Z with respect to P. With respect to p. And the triangles are given by I take x to y to z triangle in D with x, y and z in capital Z I take. I take the approximation here to produce the shift. And then these orthogonality conditions here tell me that the composition, this, this, two, where are my sigma p. Where am I sigma px? This composition is zero, meaning the whole diagram completes. So this composition here is zero, meaning the whole diagram completes, and my triangle is this. So this is a triangle category with this shift function and these triangles, and this construction is highly reminiscent of how you construct the triangulated structure on a stable category of a Frobenius category. On a stable category of a Frobenius category. So it's the same idea. Moreover, so the nice thing about this is that U is equivalent to D modulo, the fixed subcategory of P. So this is nice. This is the Verdier quotient. Now, Verdier quotient is very nice, but morphisms in here become complicated because the equivalence class is rule. Become complicated because equivalence class is rules. Morphisms in here are much easier to control. So, this is computationally easier than the Berdier quotient. So, this is nice. And there's a bijection between something subcategories M of D such that P is contained in D and oh P contained in M, sorry. Oh, P contained in M sorry and silting subcabies of Z okay so let's have a look at an example I got code chalk let's have a look at an example over here I think I might need a bit more Maybe I need to walk back a little bit. Okay, so if I look at, if I take p, now let's call this m prime equals p, and I compute z here. Let's do this in blue. If I compute z here, so I want nomorphisms, where is z defined? I want nomorphisms from negative shifts of p. Of P. So this is P. Here's a negative shift. So I'm cutting out this. So this is leaving me with this. And you can imagine this pattern continues over here. And nomorphisms to negative two positive shifts. So nomorphisms to things like this. So this is this kind of stuff. And then I have this in the middle. This morphism here. This morphism here is zero because it factors through p. So the subfactor construction kills that morphism. And if I look at the shift here, so let's take the shift of 2, 3. How do I take the shift of 2, 3? I approximate with respect to p and I take the cone. So 1 is the shift of 2, 3. Two of three, and if I take the shift of two, well, it has no morphism to this, so this is the shift of two. And what you see is in the reduction, this is a silting subcategory containing P in the reduction. The other guy here and here is a Here and here is a certain subcategory containing P, and they are the shift of each other. So, this is trivial because this is a shift, it's actually the negative shift of a silting object. If you take a silting object over here, then its shift is a silting object. So this becomes trivial because the shift never intersects itself. Intersects itself. This gives you these formulas. And this is doing shift, inverse shift followed by shift, and shift followed by inverse shift. So these formulas essentially become tautologists from this viewpoint. So the slogan is mutation is shift in the reduction. Right, how far am I in? I can start the second lecture. The second lecture: The return of the G-bit. I somehow want to keep this mutation problem up a little while longer. Sensation for true term setting. Okay, so here again, lambda finite dimensional algebra, and I'm going to take k minus one, zero. Zero Rog lambda to be equal to the category of two-term complexes in degrees minus one is zero in the perfect right pattern. So this category of two two-tone complexes or Two-tone complexes or category of projective presentations. And the first observation is to note that this is add lambda star add shift of lambda. So in particular, for any silting of category M and define. And define Cm equals M star sigma m, which is a two term solving category with respect to M or two term complexes with. Or two-term complexes with respect to m. So there's nothing special about lambda. You can do this with any silting object. And the first observation is these categories have homological dimension one, so they are very nice. So they're very nice. And this niceness is manifested in the fact that any pre-silting object can be completed through a silting object using the classic Bongart completion argument for tilting module for one tilting modules. So suppose he is contained in In M star sigma n is pre-silting then B L P M defined to be equal to P star. P star sigma n intersect left perp sigma p is the left bongat completion and v r p comma sigma m there's a little bit of asymmetry here that's because symmetry here that's because we're completing inside this interval if we were completing inside the interval sigma minus one m star m we would get a formula over there more more directly this is the right one that completes Okay, and again, I put this up for, left this up for a reason. If one looks at this, this is a mutation with respect to a subcategory. This is mutation with respect to something which isn't necessarily a subcategory. The Bongat's completion formula is just mutation, but any arbitrary pre-silting subcategory put in here. And the statement is these are silting subcategories. Degrees. Okay. And the point is they correspond to the images of sigma m and m in the reduction. So they are. So, they are the maximum and minimal elements in your pulsat, if you like. So, the reason why they're sorting subcategories conceptually is they're just the images of sigma m and m. Okay, so I want to say why you might be interested. Ah, quick remark. So, long time open beginning of this year settled. Beginning of this year settled. Not going to give details. P-silting subcategories need not admit complements in general even when your category has a silting object. A silting object. Okay. Since I haven't looked it up for a few weeks yet, the idea is you look at you find a gentle algebra which has a silting object. You cook up the grading so that when you use this theorem, there's some common. There's some combinatorial conditions which tell you when a grading on a gentile algebra doesn't give you when the category doesn't have a silting object. You cook up the grading of your gentile algebra so that when you take this quotient, you end up with one of those gentile algebras having one of those bad gradings. And that's the idea, but a specific example I can't give you. Possible, and maybe I was Sebastian. I could set him up for giving this. So, one of the reasons we're interested in this is the link to support toe tilting. So, a pair XP P in mod lambda cross proj lambda is toll rigid if hom x toe x is zero and hom p x is zero. X is zero and it is support our clipping if it's maximus such. So if the number of non-isomorphic summons of X plus the number of non-isomorphic sum lines of P is equal to the number of indequash projectives of. Of lambda. And it is total tilting finite. Lambda is total tilting finite. If there are only finitely many support. Oh, still. Oh, something okay. So the link is the following theorem, which in this level of generality is due to Iyama, Juergensen, and Yang, but it's heavily based on Heavily based on the finite dimension outer version due to Atachi, Yama, and Wrighten, which says that if M is add M M silting object gamma is its endomorphism algebra. Then there are bijections between the following sets so silting subcategories and intake in the two-term category. Two basic support for tilting paths of mod gamma up to isomorphism and torsion pairs E. P, F, which we saw in Emily Lee's talk yesterday. So torsion parasitom gamma, in which the torsion class and the torsion free class are functorially finite. Okay, so I'm going to say a few comments on this, but not give Comments on this, but not give an explicit statement. So, one way to think about this is that this is how you do cluster-tilting theory when you're outside the hereditary case. So, in the hereditary case, or when more generally, I have a two-collabio cluster-tilted algebra, I can add point four to this and say that these guys are in bi direction with the cluster-tilting objects. Tilting objects. So, this is essentially cluster tilting theory outside the hereditary case. That's kind of the point. So, this is the inspiration for this. Well, that's a very good point. So, the functionality will be finite in mod gamma, but by a result of David Plog and Raquel, mod gamma is functorally finite in the whole category. So that's transitive, so it's Vancouver-Fahnite in the whole category. And this is an important point, actually. Unfortunately, I won't be able to explain why it's important in this set of lectures, but I think this is a crucial structure of reasons. So if anyone wants to chat about it afterwards, please do. Okay, so Okay, so one quick remark, which I think is uh you can which is uh lambda is total tilting finite if and only if all torsion purpose. I think that would be finite. And so you can detect total infiniteness by looking at the torsion theories. And if you have only finitely many torsion purposes, then you're in a total infinite case, all your torsion curves are going to be probably finite. So, I want to give a quick example to illustrate the idea. Again, it's the A3 example. And I apologize for the mischief I've caused by forbidding A3s. They're good examples because everyone knows them, so you don't have to spend ages talking about. You don't have to spend ages talking about the example, you can think about the points you want to illustrate. So, two examples of toe-rigid pairs are the module one, two, and the simple module two, and three, which corresponds to one, two, plus two plus the shift of three as a silting object, and two. three plus one two three which corresponds to to shift of three plus shift of one two three so point is you can detect what's happening in the module category so you find your support tarotility module in here and then you take what you need from the shifted projectives which is why it's got this strong connection with the cluster theory The cluster theory. So, in general, the map works by taking a total tilting per xp that gets sent to, I take the projective presentation, a minimal projective presentation of x and then I add the p and that's my silting complex. And going back, I start with sorry, I start with p minus one. Sorry, I start with p minus one, p zero. I take the zero cohomology, let's call that p, and then there's a unique p which is maximal orthogonal to this cohomology, and you take that. Okay, so this is the important link with the two-term theory. The two-term theory and support telephone theory. Now I want to talk about G vectors and G fans. So the So here I'm going to take C to be the special two-term category, so the one with respect to the algebra itself. And recall that K0 of C is the three remaining group generated by isoplastes. By isoplasses of objects of C modulo the relation x minus y plus z where x y z sigma x is a triangle with the first three terms in C. So Well, this is the natural X triangulated structure on C. Oh, I can't remember this. I think there's some themes of this kind. So I think it's true for gentle altruism. Okay, where is it? So the G vector of P in C is its class. Is its class P in the Groton T group? If you want a basis, take the algebra, but you don't need to choose a basis. This is a reference to a conversation over dinner last night. If I take P in C. In C I equals one to T of Qi, so Qi indecomposable and P is P silting then for classes Q one to Q T The QT are linearly independent Venue independent and they generate A G con C of P equal to non-negative linear combinations of the classes of the sum. Contained in the vector space K0 of C and set of real numbers. The G-fan of Lambda is Sigma G lambda is a set of G cones running over all pre-silting objects in the two-term category. So I want to give an example. Now I'm restricted because I want to draw this thing. So I can't use A3 because this will be three-dimensional. So I go to A1, but A1 tilde. And I'm going to draw the also on the right-hand quiver of the pre-projective components and the pre-injective components. But instead of drawing them as modules, I'm going to draw. Instead of drawing them as modules, I'm going to draw them as projected presentations. So the first one to the two projectives, then the next one is P2 to P1 plus 1. I'm neglecting the map because it's not important. Keep going like this. I skip the regulars because none of them are rigid. And then I come to the projective presentations of the two injectors. Like this. Okay. So here the pre-injectives and here the pre-projectives. The upper wave rhyme, sorry, pre-projectives, pre-injectives. Okay, so what does the G-Fan look like? Right, so let's put so let's put it here, say the class of P1 is here, class of P2 here. Probably you might want to make this a bit lower so I. Probably you might want to make this a bit lower so I can draw it. Okay, so this is C P2 and this is C P1 and this is C P1 plus P2, the standard silting object. Now, if I take this pre-silting object, this is in degree minus one. Um, this is in degree minus one, so that's negative in the Groton D group, and this is in degree zero, so I get two copies of P2, P1, and one copy of P1, so looking something like this. So this is C and I want to give this a name M1 M let's call it M two C M two. Cm2 and continuing, I get something looking like this. And going back up here, I'm going to get something looking like this, looking like this. And I get two infinite sequences converging to a ray going up here, which is not in the fan. Here I have CP, the shifter P1. One that P2 and this must be C should probably shift to P1 plus P2. I might have got that what space is here. I think it's the other way around. Let me look at it. So. So P1 moves, P2 stays the same. That was right. Okay. So the G-fan is due to the silting exchange. Exchange. So, this is one of the reasons why exchange equals mutation. So, if I put a vertex in each chamber, it would look something like the silting exchange with two infinite layers. With two infinite legs going converging on this red ray. So, if you remember, it looks something like this. Okay. I want to make two remarks in the form of a theorem. Freemolets and all the erasers, yeah. So theorem 25 true statements. So again, lambda is a finite dimensional algebra, and I'm going to And I'm going to statement one is Demon Ayam and Hassel, which says if P and Q are pre-silting in C, then C of P intersects, C of Q is non-zero, intersection non-zero has non-zero intersection. There's non-zero intersection if and only if there exists a pre-silting object R which is a common sum and of P and Q. Moreover, if R If R is maximal such, then the intersection of the columns is C of R. So this is crucial in proving, but this really is a fan. And the fan realizes the mutation. And the second statement is due to a psi, which Due to a sine which says lambda is total tilting finite if and only if its G-fan is complete. So we have a look at this one, which is not tile-silting finite because there are infinitely many silting objects between the algebra and its shift. And it's shift and the silting objects correspond to support tail tilting purse. This is not tail tilting finite, infinitely many. This fan is not complete because there's this missing red ray. Okay, so what I want to talk about now is in the last five minutes or so is how to fix this problem. Sorry? R should be non-zero. Sorry, R should be non-zero in part one. Yes. Yes, because everything contains zero as a common sum. Yes. Yes, I mean non-neural. I teach first-year foundations of mathematics course and tell students always that they have to say exactly what they mean, and then I then I don't do it. So here's how to fix this particular problem here. So here I'm going to take H. Here I'm going to take h to be a bounded heart in d. By bounded heart, I mean heart of a bounded t structure, and I'm going to suppose that its quote in D group is three billion of finite rank, and I'm going to define a set E of H to be equal to a To A one H one plus A T H T A I greater than equal to zero P in N greater than equal to one and H I in H call this the effective one. So it's the linear span of any extension of objects in H. So it's the cone generated by H. And I'm going to define CH to be E H. So I should say where this lives. So this lives in the vector space V, which equals K0 to H. And so the real numbers. I'm going to take CH to be the dual of EH, and that's going to be V equals V in the dual space such that V of X is bigger than or equal to zero for all X in EH. And I'm going to call this. And I'm going to call this the dual cone. I need some technical definitions and then I can state the theorem. A case subcategory of H is one of. Is one of the form S V equals H in H such that V of the class of H is zero of some V in the dual space. Such a subcategory is a sur subcategory. So that means it's closed under quotients, sub-objects, and extensions. And we write stir h equal to the set of face subcategories. Equal the set of taste subcategories. H of S consists of a heart. Now I want to assume, I should assume K is the bounded heart as well and H is two term. Is two term with respect to K. So H is two term with respect to K. A base per consists of a heart, H, which is two term with respect to some reference heart, K and Bramley and a SS Academy. Subcategory in H the corresponding geopace of C H corresponding to S is C H CH mod S equal to, we can take this as definition, but it's actually a theorem. Well, dilemma is the cone corresponding to H intersect the parts of the cone which are orthogonal with respect to the condition B of X equals zero on the surf subcategory. On the subcategory S. So the heartban of K is sigma of K, which equals C H mod F such that H S is a face part. Okay, so then the theorem, which I've overrun. So I just state the theorem and then I finish. Is that okay? His joint work with Nathan Broomhead, David Ploek, and John Wolf is that if K If K is a boundary's heart in D, then one the heart fan is a fan in V star in the duality, which does not depend. On D. The point here is that it's controlled by the tilting theory, the torsion pursuing K, which is a property of K, not of D. The second statement is if K is length, then the heart fan is complete. And the third condition is if the set of objects K in K, that's the third result, so that the class in the groting groups is zero, is zero, something trivially true for length categories, then. Then sigma k is finite and complete if and only if put it up here. K is length and has finitely many force and pairs. Okay, so just a couple of remarks. So, in this example, what we've gained is the red line. This corresponds to coherent sheaves on P1, but all the hearts which look like maybe a backwards coherent shoes on one, or the ones which have the tubes on both sides, they all have this cone. And the fan is now complete. So, this red line now goes back into the corn. So, this is what it does. This third statement. This third statement is generalizing. Did I put it? This statement here. So it's detecting the completeness of the G-fan, and the G-fan is a sub-fan of a heart fan. So I shall stop here. Thank you for indulging me. Any questions or comments? Any questions or comments? So, this subcategory of, or this set of the face subcategories of H, I guess it's not all of the SER subcategories of H. I mean, I guess not. No. Do you have any sort of more intrinsic characterization of which SER subcategories arise in this way? Yes. Yeah, right. So I say, so. Yeah, so let's say so. Let's just say if H is length, then it is also subcategories. So, in the algebraic case, it's pretty nice. These phase subcategories correspond to exposed faces of these corns. And then there's a homological characterization of when two of these guys have the same corn in terms of. So, what happens if you have two surf subcategories of two different hearts, H and H prime, and both SIR subcategories generate the same thick subcategory of the triangulated category. And you take the Verdier quotient with respect to that thick subcategory. If both quotients agree, then the cones agree. But actually, if and only if the cones agree, so you have this homological characterization when. Have this homological characterization when the cones are the same. And so you get some pathological behavior in this kind of case because you've got lots of heart, lots of horns which are indistinguishable, but you can detect this exactly. So for example, coherent sheets on P1. This pathology arises when I've restricted to a particularly nice case here. But if, for example, I take something of infinite rank, and then I need to have. Rank and then I need to have some finite rank lattice. So I need to take proportions onto a finite rank lattice. When I do that, I'm going to get some problems here. So I have to keep track of that. So that's the point of this. But does it depend somehow on K? I mean. It depends on K and on this K, yes, and on the lattice you've chosen. Do you have a sense of? Do you have a sense of what happens to sigma k in something wild? How much bigger than the g-back pan is? It might just be the closure. I mean, you could define this without having a g-back. So in the algebraic case, you're getting this kind of thing coming in. But for example, if you took, okay, it's not wild, but take elliptic curves. But you have a completely dense fan in which all none of the None of the cones are full-dimensional, but they actually fill a half space, so it's not complete. You can get this kind of behavior. So I would say in the algebraic case, it's add those limit rays that you're missing. But in geometric cases, you can start doing stuff that you can do in the algebraic case with G-Fans. Okay, cool. Any other questions? Thank you. I guess there you're describing a dual phase for EH, right? Not for CH? Yeah, this is Jew. This is the Jew cone of EH. Yeah, so there it's EH, right? Not CH in the third line. Here. More to the left. Sorry? At the beginning of the line. It's a phase of EH, not of CH, right? It's a phase of EH, not of CH, right? No, no. Okay, this may be an abusive notation, but we're not taking all phases of CH. We're taking only the faces which are due to EH in this way. And so I want to emphasize that I'm taking faces which are due to the effective phone in some sense. No, I think. So it's loaded notation, but yeah, that's something to bear in mind when spelling this out going, we write this up to make sure that we make sure it's clear that this is what we mean. Make sure it's clear that this is what we mean. I see. And in the cluster case, what would be an interpretation of a hard fan? In the cluster case, it would be sort of the completion of this G-fan in this way. So what's really happening, so here's a cluster interpretation, is these are your cones with your C vectors. And these are your cones with your D vectors. And so that's what's happening. So this is the dual cones of the C vectors. Okay. And I should say that these crossing these codimension one boundaries is a simple-minded tilting. So it's tilting as subcategories. So how so how you are to go, yes. So your new fung, how to fung is related to Is related to wall and chamber structure comes from a stability condition. Yes, this is why we ended up thinking about this. So, this is exactly these are walls and chambers in the stability manifold in most cases. And you can put some extra data, which if one of my geometer colleagues were here, they would explain this better. But you can give a kind of tangent space to this, which encodes the stability function. Which encodes the stability functions, and then you can detect whether or not you have a HM property. For example, is it possible to recover water and chamber structure from your autofang? Yes. Oh, yes. Another question. So if, yes, for the case of wild quiver, is it possible to describe completely your heart of fung? Uh wild or the three correct or maybe lunched case, maybe something over PS. Maybe something over PS, perhaps? Short answer: I don't know. We have got a description of the three conical quiver, but we haven't thought about other ones. Yeah, thank you. I think I'm asking the same question. It's both Yama and Matt. But so in the wild case, when you've got a region that's somehow completely missing, are you filling them with like one-dimensional quote, one-dimensional things? Exactly. Or are you, yeah, okay. Exactly. Are you just densely filling them? But it's just densely. Densely filled, but it's just density. So it's about a region which has got a gap in the wild case. Yeah, there's no got gold. Yeah, it's densely filled with water. And we expect it to, and your theorem is complete just because all your T structures are some tilt at some all intermediate ones are tilted. Yes. Any other questions or comments? If not, let's thank. Comments. If not, let's thank the speech again. You assume at 10:30 there's quite the outside.
