Thank you to the organizers for making this possible and for inviting me. I did feel like I've I've drifted a bit from my symbio roots, so I feel like a little bit of motto, but I'm gonna proceed at least with what's been consuming my life for the last 30 years or so. Four years. So with you know, so I'll And this all started with strong collaboration with some of my colleagues at East Cap because everything is context-dependent, including my research direction and research funding. So their work is primarily around bioelectronic sensors, building sensors in actuators, interface with biological systems. And this is a growing field that also serendifically is converging with synthetic biology as well. With synthetic biology as well. And so I was just at a warning conference on bioelectronic devices and their progress in interfacing with synthetic biology as a real live immutable sensor. And so the focus of my current work has been around the field of advancing precision medicine through real-time feedback control. And this is obviously made possible by having real-time sensors on board. Having real-type sensors on board and real-type activities on board. And so, in particular, focusing on the process of wound healing, which consists of four primary stages that are generally defined, but there are no clear definitive boundaries between these four stages. In fact, there's a lot of overlap as wound healing progresses. Breast is. And if you look at the plot to the top to the right, which just shows sort of what are the dominant biological processes and corresponding self-opulations that are at each of those movement stages as we progress from the left to the right, moving forward in time. And so one of the DARPA grand challenges was to reduce blue healing by 50%. And so you can imagine, I went As you can imagine, I went from 3 gene networks and E. coli to thinking about something as complex as healing, where things are not so well defined anymore. But this was fun because I get to think about more broadly the challenge of control biology when you get to more complex systems. And part of that includes defining measurable metrics to monitor progress. Monitor progress because, again, these, for example, early stages are not quantified, right? So, part of the challenge is just quantifying outcomes and quantifying basically qualitative outcomes and predicting system response. And of course, we're all familiar with that challenge in biology. And so, this came down to this hypothesis that we're not going to be able to do this without. Is that we're not going to be able to do this without a multi-layer control strategy with, in this case, kind of deem three tiers here. A decision maker basically tells us when to intervene, a planner tells us how to intervene, and the low-level controller which executes the intervention. It's over twenty five minutes, I didn't really have time to talk about everything, but I'm gonna focus my talk 'cause But I'm going to focus my talk because the most developed part is at the low-level controller and working in parallel with the other two. And so this is the executing interaction. So this is the control algorithms that directly interface with this model at Chronicle device. And so it is a multi-scale system, right? You know, we, again, like at the top, you know, we abstract wound healing into these four stages, and you're progressing through there. Breasting through there, but actually gets complicated. There's a huge difference between being an early inflammation versus late inflammation. And then at the single cell level, that's actually where we hypothesize and theorize how do we act on the single cell level to essentially affect the macroscopic outcome of the system. So, you know, a lot of our host has been around macrophage recruitment, activation. Recruitment, activation, which promotes the transition from inflammatory to proliferation, and innervation. And what we've been using to couple and map that single cell response to these high-level abstractions is really through a combination of machine learning and mechanistic modeling. So in particular, using mechanistic models to train our reinforcement. Reinforcement algorithms. So, some of the control challenges. Saturation is a huge issue. So, it's an issue not only with an issue with biological systems, as we know. System response saturates. And so, really, the domain of the range of input stimuli to which it has a response to is limited, and also the actuator dynamics as well. So, for example, about electronic devices, and I'll say a little bit more later, it's really limited in its operating regime as well. So, again, no predictive models for biological systems or the devices. You would think that at least you would have something for the devices, but the variations just based on fabrication. Also, the device performance can change over time, and so everything varies. And so everything varies across experiments and over time, because also biological systems tend to want to adapt the behavior as well. So this has led me towards resistant machine learning when I've been trying to resist for years. But it's been really, you know, especially when every student is like, oh, I'm doing your laugh, but I want to do machine learning. But it's kind of come back around because Come back around because we don't have models, right? So, I really had to be forced to think about data-driven methods for this real-time learning to overcome these challenges. But these methods are not methods that we can necessarily use out of the box because we don't have the maximum amounts of data that we need. Usually, our data is very sparse in time. And also, the methods cannot be, but yeah, so they cannot be data. But yeah, so they cannot be data. So this presents new challenges even in the world of machine learning. So the approaches we considered to excavate wound healing, and this will tie into some of the in vitro single-cell studies we did towards developing our orange hologen band-aid. One is a delivery of therapeutics, another one Another one is affecting the wound environment, and this can be done by, for example, injecting protons into the wound bed and affecting the pH of the environment. Another well-known treatment strategy is to apply electric fields. So if you do have a wound, an opening in your skin, there's a natural electric field that emerges, and this electric field is thought to Is thought to induce migration of cells, the right types of cells at the right time. And so, in effect, what we're really doing is just aiming to understand the wound healing process and then accelerate those processes by anticipating it and then also just applying the signaling cubes earlier in the process, but not in such a way that you may go to honestly. You may go to honestly. So, the way we delivered the dress is using an ion hub. And so, these use an electrical field to move ions. So, basically, they can move any charged molecule. So, as my coverage says, if it's charged, and if it's small enough, we can deliver it. And so, in this case, I don't want any really any charged molecule, and they move through capillaries by applying differential voltages. And so, what our controller does really is figuring out. Does really is figuring out what that voltage should be in order to regulate the concentration drugs that we apply. And these are kept, sorry, the drug or answer whatever kept in the water and released and removed as needed. And so my work was all on the closing the loop side. My collaborators have done the the brain of the project. The brain of the project. I guess quite literally, in the sense of our experimental setup here. So, you know, we basically implement feedback by coupling the sensors and actuators with an external controller. And so, for I'm going to talk about two feedback control systems that we developed and the experience. And the experiments. So, like that saturation is a problem. So, we did look forward. So, we're looking for basically, I don't know if you could call it like model-free types of controllers that don't require a sample model. And I just saw that, okay. And so, a sliding boat controller only requires partial knowledge of the system model. So, this one was most helpful for the ballottonic device. And we also love it such that it directly enhances saturation. Half the saturation. And so here our system really is, I won't go too much details, x dot equals f of x, and then there's the input, so it's a fine in the input here. But essentially, it's designed such that because we design it given a function, a bounded function phi on the input, that it, and basically design phi, so we design phi such that it contains the boundary. It contains the bounds of our operating machine, of our bioelectronic device. And so I'll show an example. And so, yeah, the idea of this is that it basically drives the system dynamics towards a stable manifold. And so once you're on a stable manifold, you can achieve your reference state. And so here's some in vitro results that we had for delivery of, this is flexatine, so flexatine is one of the drugs. So, flexatine is one of the drugs that in our treatment strategy that we're using. And so, what we figured out is that we can know the pumping efficiency of the device. So, here we characterize it to be 20% and just do that whole experiment. And so that's just the ratio of the moles of flexatine delivered over the moles of the electrons transferred. And the way this is measured is by the current, right? Because, as I said, you're moving ions, and so the current that you're reading out, measuring out, is really... You're reading out, measuring out is really just the transport of ions. And so, if we run the system for a current at 1200 nanograms for about 20 minutes, this gives us a known drug delivery of 1.2 micromolars. And so here we're just showing our ability to track. So all of these lead to about an average of 1.2 micromolars delivered in the course of 20 minutes, but we just kind of do one reference line, a One reference line, you know, a declining reference curve, a downward subcurve, just to show that we actually can achieve feedback control on these devices. And as you can see also, this one, for example, it's the same fit at this 1200 nanoamp at the top, but you can see that actually the voltage applied is steadily increasing, and that basically confirms. And that basically confirms the fact that the device performance is changing over time. And so in fact, the real-time control is needed to sustain that specific current. Marcella, what's the control algorithm you're using here to achieve steady state? Sorry? What's the control algorithm that you're using here to achieve steady state? Oh, that's a zy-month controller. Got it. I don't think they. Sorry? Sorry? No, that's it. Thank you. That's exactly right. Okay. Yeah, there's not a lot. There's a paper the controllers published. I didn't put that many default in my slides. So the next one is controlling cell migration on an electric field. And so a big effect of the electronic electron Big effector of cell migration is, like I said, the naturally occurring electric field. So, we're interested in applying a stronger electric field essentially at an earlier time. And so you can see if there's no electric field, the cells move in a random motion. But if you apply an electric field, then they'll move from directionality either towards the cathode or the aneloid of the system. And what's interesting is there are different cell types that are pro-inflammatory onto the That are pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and they actually move in opposite directions under the same electric field. So, this can be used as an interesting. You can imagine switching the direction of electric field to signal the right cell types at the right time. And so, this is our experimental setup here. We have a macrophage electric field chamber, we have a current source, and so basically the controller is. And so basically, the controller is regulating the current source in this case. So, with a bio-trunk device, we're regulating the voltage on the device. Here, we're regulating the current source on this one setup for Calvino taxes. And so, D change the current, this affects the electric field. And yeah, and then that's fed back, we analyze the images, and so in real time, we control the system. And so, this requires. And so this requires some preliminary step of real-time image processing as well. So we have these phase contrast images. You know, we track the cell motility and then quantify its behavior through some metrics such as directedness of the cell, which is just like essentially it's angled to the direction of the electric field. And also another metric that we call the recruitment index. Another metric that we call the recruitment index, which is essentially like the cells moving to anode minus the cell moving to the cathode divided by the total number of cells. So again, part of the work of just creating metrics that make sense to act on. And so for this one, we do use a, we tried something different because we found that the sliding mode controller was excellent when interfaced with electronic devices, but really failed. But really failed us with the cell systems. So it was not as great in that case. So we had to, you know, we also worked with this neural network-based controller, which essentially learns the control algorithm on the fly. And we had used this before, but we had issues, so we actually adapted it. Again, the issues came because of saturation in the system. And so, you know, this is just a And so, you know, this neural network is just a SQL layer RPF network. And the issue was that when your system saturates, your controller output, essentially what your controller wants to do, wants to keep client, wants to basically be more forceful. So it made it a little like. It made it a little like unboundedly increased the actuation signal because, in fact, before we put it into device, we have to clip the actuator signal because of the saturation issue. So, anyways, this causes the weights on the neural network to grow unboundedly when it's at the saturation point. So, we modified this to have some projection operator, essentially, to Operator, essentially, to control, to basically taper off the unbounded growth of the weight at that saturation regime. So if you look at the very, very bottom one, gamma phi, Zt minus CIE, this is the update law for weights. If you just use a very general gradient descent approach and don't care about saturation. And so what we did is essentially Essentially, did kind of a hybrid sort of update laws where if you're outside of the upper limit or the lower limit, then we adapted the update law with this, with a term that has a projection operator on it. And so I can show quickly what that gives us or achieves. So we have, this is just the antilical simulation for the model, but if we did the machine learning without the But if we do the machine learning without the projection, here you can see it's trying to reach the reference, but it can't. So, what happens is over here on the purple, you can see that the current that it wants to apply continues to grow and grow and grow. And so, what happens is that once I switch the reference, the step changed to a positive value. Positive value, because it spent so much time basically growing away from this domain, it takes time to learn and come back. So then there's a little bit of a delay here in the response. But if we add the projection operator, this reduces the delay in the response because in fact, we don't row further out from where that lower gives. From where that lower limit is, where we can actuate our system. So, this is just an example of one of the experiments. So, here, you know, we have the blue line is the reference curve, and then the red line is the actual measured response of the system over here on the top left. So, see, but we're just basically the number of positive numbers is to the right, and then the negative numbers. To the right, and then the negative numbers is to the left. And the Kubernetes index is somewhat of a measure of kind of their variability. Axel, you have one minute left. Okay, now oh no, I'm not. I'm gonna skip this. I'm just kidding, I forgot about the section. Anyways, we started. We're like we want really wanted to do optimal control because To do optimal control because you know, we're like, oh, electric fields are really bad for if you put the cell in the electric field, so many things can happen. There's so many like unwanted effects of exposing cells to electric fields. So, you know, we did some playing with these controllers, combining slight mill controller with model predictive control because we actually had an LSTM model for a guy, Blamo Takus, that one of my Alamo, Texas, that one of my former master's students had published. So we were able to combine those and essentially show that the peak is ours, and the wax is there, essentially show that we can get a good result with that. And so, yeah, now we're just kind of packaging this into intelligent band-aid, the actual physical band-aid that has been built with the collaborators, and this is applied to. And this is applied to the skin. And so these have wired capabilities. And so we have MVPO experiments in progress with our figs. And those are run at UC Davis. And so obviously this is a massive effort. I mean, I'm the controls person and the modeling person. Modeling person, and then Mark Boch are the hardware, valetronic, building. Michael Minn are the biologists, Rifka is our clinician, and Margus is a recent addition to our team in computer vision. And yeah, it's been a lot of fun, and it's definitely a huge collapse of effort, and this was mostly quite helpful. All right, thank you. Great, thank you. All right, we have time for two questions. We have nine pieces for me. Questions for Marcel? I'll start us off, Marcela. So why are you sliding remote control on your first system? Where are we going to begin? Yeah, over other types of nonlinear control methods. Because it's pretty robust and adaptive to changes in the system. So that was mainly like our main issue. And then also I said we can design the sliding mode control with only partial information model. But we didn't need to have, we could have guarantees with partial information essentially. In what sense? Typically with sliding mode control, you need to compute the light and obscure. The pain delight on our stability towards knowing exactly what the function is? Because the way that the proof came out, there was, you know, only certain things had to be shown, like, you know, the, you know, the gradient of some function with respect to a, or the partial of some function with respect to a parameter is positive, or like, and then if you make this parameter big enough, then you're definitely going to get stability. So it's able to allow us sometimes to be more hand-wavy. More handwritten. Whereas other methods, I think, require way more information about the system and are often used model system response to be tuned and defined. Any other questions for Marcella? Thank you again, Marcela. Our next speaker is Brian Engels from the Department of Applied Mathematics. Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Waterloo. So that's it. Okay, yeah, okay, so I'll be sure to stick to time. We're in the home stretch here. Oh no. I'm not. Why you can send me your email and go with that? I thought I'd fix it. Oh, it's really big. It's got videos. Try one thing or the immersive. So I'm uh So I'm uh going to tell you a couple stories about uh model calibration that we've been working on in the group Okay, um to
