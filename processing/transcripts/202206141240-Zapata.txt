Hello. So, our next speaker is Joseph Antonio Zapata, who will be talking just about parametrized field theory and Blunt. Okay. First thing is that this is not a finished work, it's just work in progress, and I appreciate any feedback that you give me. Harsh feedback is good. It's a good time. So I have the advantage that Juan went before me, and the motivations are quite related. In particular, behind all this, there is a general boundary formulation of quantum field theory that somehow arose as trying to formalize things that happen in spin form models and putting it in a more general background. A more general background and solid logical foundations. And so, first, about the title, we have this parametrized field theory. And then I want to emphasize that everything is going to be reparametrization invariant. And even it's going to have more invariance than reparametrization invariance. So, by adding a parametrization, actually, I'm going to gain a lot of structure without losing. Without losing anything, really. And the goal of this talk can be summarized as trying to give a mathematical structure for gluing pieces of space-time and not doing what people do in TQFTs using the coal vision picture that is very appropriate for topological. For topological system, a theory with no local degrees of freedom fits well with this. But when you are talking about a field theory where things can be happening at definite locations, then this covalent picture may not be the best. Be the best one. And see, observe that we have an n-dimensional picture, but the gluing is essentially one-dimensional only. And this comes from knowing how to do quantum mechanics or just classical mechanics, even, as something that evolves in time. And this has permeated historically appears even here in the Appears even here in the 21st century. We are trying to replace this with something that is more n-dimensional. If space-time is four-dimensional, we want to see things not only with a four-dimensional nature, but these four parameters that we have, parameters that we have, use them. So that's why I use the thing for parameterized field theory. And then the gluing. Theory and then the gluing that we are going to use of little pieces looks to be exact more like this. So, if I have a space-time that I here give a topology that is kind of non-trivial, S2, the sphere, I can see it as gluing little pieces. And I did not put many, many pieces, but I could have. And when we are in elementary school, maybe. Elementary school, maybe they tell us to make a cube that has the topology of the sphere using some folding and paper. We know some rules and everyone recognizes this picture, but this is going to be algebraically manipulated to mean this thing. I am gluing this piece and this piece and this piece and I'm gluing them in direction one and I'm gluing them like this. them like this this piece here and the other one and going gluing them in the other direction direction too and to to actually complete the the picture i need to say things like for example this edge is glued to this edge and i achieve that by gluing a piece that is kind of empty or thin and it's denoted by these things so i have these two things that join lines here things that join lines here and i need even more i need these two other pieces that actually do not have any dimension dimension zero pieces so if if i have a framework for doing that then i can use little squares arrange to to make a any topological space and this thing is already done so i'm going to take advantage of that it's not i'm going to invent that i'm going to take advantage of that um Take advantage of that. So I go back to the usual picture of propagating in time and evolution, for example. In field theory, I say it is tied to the group point structure of time parametrization. And we had a talk about group points and it was actually very good. It's a shame no one asked any questions. So here I can compose this gamma. This gamma and delta, but not gamma and eta, and just because the end points and the beginning points coincide or not coincide. Okay, and also it was put as a part of the postulates that we need to have inverses, a generalized local version of inverses. And okay, I didn't want to do that. Okay, and I want to point out that. And I want to point out that if you have paths in a space, they almost form a group point. You just need to quotient by something because actually this thing that I have here, going somewhere and coming back, has to be equivalent to not doing anything. Once you put that thing into that piece into place, then you end up with a group-wide structure. And so you need to have equivalence classes of things, and you can consider them as. And you can consider them as having pass modulo reparametrization. The parametrization doesn't play any role, and also that retracing move that I mentioned. Okay, so let me go further. Now, a field in one space-time dimension is just like a classical, I mean, I'm thinking classical, but it's just a history evolving with respect to time. With respect to time, say in classical quantum mechanics. And the composition that you do when you have a path and then follow another path then is compatible with the additivity of the action in this way. And in particular, I'm writing this thing that there are more things I could write, but this one is particularly important that the action, then if you That the action, then, if you have the same field but you follow the opposite path, then you need to have the inverse of the action coming at minus sign. So it needs to be following, these are integrals, and you have to follow the rules that they will follow if you have the integral of a one-form in one dimension. Okay, so I'm just I'm just saying here that if I take as many times we do the pad integral interpretation as part of what is going to give us hints to see what the structure is. Then I have to paths I associate propagators and to the boundary of paths I associate boundary, something related to the boundary conditions. Conditions and so we already know it very well. The path integral works well if I consider this thing to be L2 of the boundary conditions, okay. And also I again write this in that the propagator of going back in time being the inverse of the other propagator is very related to this property of the of the action. Okay, so now now we want to. So now we go to higher dimensions, not just evolving in time. Then I want a local compositional picture of field theory, very related and inspired by this group, general boundary field theory, here by Robert. And it could be tied here to To higher-dimensional group point structure of m paths. M-paths, if we are in dimension four, it will be four paths. So instead of paths evolving with respect to a time parameter, these four paths will have be parametrized by four parameters. Okay. The structure is mathematically well defined. Well, that I'm going to use, it was That I'm going to use, it was developed kind of finished in the 80s, from a little before to the 80s. And I'm going to describe it here just a little bit. So you have something called cubical k-paths, and the k is going to be a number that starts in zero and then goes zero, one, two, three, four, for example, in the case of space-time. And so you have this kind of These kinds of paths of different dimensions, and then you have to do a quotient by an equivalence relation very similar to that one that we did in order to have the group point of paths. So you needed to say that going back and forth was equivalent to not doing anything. And here you need a very similar relation that plays that role, but in a more elegant way. I'm not going to talk. More elegant way. I'm not going to talk about it. But if someone wants to talk about it, it's called think homotopy. It's very, it's the same relation that is used in gauge theories when you are doing parallel transport in a path. Then there is a possibility that this path actually in the middle did something like a hair going up and down. And that's equivalent to the this is the same equivalence relation, either by retracing or by thin homotopy, and this is just the higher dimensional version of that. Just the higher dimensional version of that. So I have here my parameter space. Here I have my space-time say, and I put a path here. This is my higher dimensional path. Imagine this is this four, but I only could do a two-dimensional picture. Here is my piece of space-time parametrized by these two parameters, but I'm going to have reparameterization invariance, so I do not care about it. And something very important is. And something very important is that I can only glue things if they are compatible. And compatibility before, when it was 1D, I needed to have the starting of the next path to be the end point of the first path. And here I just need the same conditions, but in one dimension more. So if I had here in the floor, instead of this floor, some tiling, I can only glue neighboring tiles. Neighboring neighboring tiles in the sense that in the one direction they have a part of the boundary that is related to the past boundary in the same direction, past initial or something. So anyway, if I follow these rules, then I can define some algebraic structure in that, like some in different directions. If here the space-time dimension is two, then it would be appropriate to have two dimensions. It to have two dimensions here, and then will be like a plus one and a plus two. And this boundary thing, the topological notion of a boundary is going to be divided into pieces, like the part of the boundary that advances in one direction to having, if this thing is parameterized to zero, one, the one related to one is like the end, and the one related to the zero is like the. And the ones related to the zero is like the beginning in that direction. Oh, I'm sorry. So, anyway, there is also an inverse and all other things here. I'm not going to talk about them, but they are the generalization of a group point to having many directions of composition. And why do I want to do that? Because of that picture that I had before, that I wanted to glue things like this. Okay, so now in dimension D, the additivity of the action, again, if I have a given field, then I evaluate the action in not one region, just gamma, but in the sum of regions, and then I get this condition. And also, if I parameterize the region. The region going in reverse in one of the directions, then I reverse the orientation, and then I get a minus sign over there. So I get this important property. And another thing that I wanted to say is that if I have two equivalent paths, either by they differ by parametrization, reparametrization, like I do a diffimorphism of this space of parameters respecting the boundaries, then I get the same. Then I get the same thing if I have defined everything using forms, differential forms over here to calculate the action. Then I get the same thing. And not only if they're reparametization related, but also if they have this equivalence due like to thin homotopy that is having pieces that go back and forth. Okay, so this is just Okay, so this is just to have it in a more standard field theory way where my fields are sections of a bundle. I can actually see like if I'm pulling the bundle back to here, but anyway, this is probably not the most illustrative thing. One thing that is illustrative here, I will want you to remember is that I want to talk about pieces of space-time. So when I draw something like this, the M. I draw something like this. The M is the whole space-time, but I'm drawing only a little piece, and I want to think about little pieces. Here, I talked, in fact, about a path whose image is inside this U. Okay. Let's see. Here I have a first layer of my proposal. It's going to have two layers, and since it's work in progress, the end is going to need more layers, but I have now only two. I have now only two. So imagine that I have to associate to these pieces of space-time gamma-some propagators or generalized propagators that go from the Hilbert space of the boundary to C. And then I have to first define what is the Hilbert space associated with the boundary. And it will be the space of square integral functions on the boundary conditions with some measure. With some measure, I can't say what measure that that is. And so, one important thing is that my boundary later is going to have pieces. If this is the boundary of something, it doesn't have a boundary itself. But imagine for a minute that I wanted to do this more generally, and I have pieces of the boundary, then this. This thing of the measure has to do probably with what the boundary conditions my pieces of the boundary have. And that's going to be kind of an interesting, important thing later. So let's focus in the 2D case and then I have my little gamma that is a square. They're embedded somewhere maybe. They're embedded somewhere, maybe curved, square, or something, whose boundaries decomposed into these four pieces. And I have to put orientations, that's why these minus signs are there. And then for these songs to be well defined, obviously they need to be related, like I said before. So these are curves and these are like one path of the type that I said before. They need to be. They need to be have this structure for being glued together, and they need to be defined as paths modulosome equivalence. And then I can only glue them if the starting point of the next path is equal to the end point of the initial path. And so, this target thing for here when I'm talking about the curve, the target of this. About the curves, the target of this has to coincide with the source of the other one. But then, when I want to do operations on the Hilbert spaces that I'm assigning to them, I need to define something like this, like a target of a Hilbert space. And I need to add Hilbert spaces that have interpretations of being pieces of the Hilbert space associated to the boundary. So, I should define all this stuff. Should define all this stuff. It should make sense somehow. And here is a lot of the interpretation of how it should make sense. You're talking about the boundary conditions. Okay, so, and then here I flash something that maybe because of this, I can assign to these little pieces some structure like this, where the i and the I and the J are labels related to the two boundaries that these things that I have here are dimension one objects. So their boundary has two separated components and these labels are related to them. Anyway, and I wrote this thing like this, but maybe you can imagine it from this other point of view as it were some infinite sum, but whatever. Later we can. Whatever. Later, we can talk more about that. So, objections to this first proposal, there are many, but one very important one is that I like to have that if I have two independent regions, co-dimension one regions, this R and S, independent somehow, like they are not connected at all, for example. Then I want to say to them, this tensor product, this will be one. Product. This will be one of the things I need to have. And it doesn't seem to be natural from what I just said. There is no nice story to arrive to it. But then I remember that in the way in which I learned this thing, there was something very similar to a tensor product. And that's what is going to be the start of the second layer of my proposal. And then I'm going to say to you what is the Say to you what is the context in which I learned this subject. And this thing is called the group point associated to a topological space. And this little asterisk here means that I have not only the topological space, but this structure extra to that x. So if you want, x could be like space-time, but it comes with this collection of. But it comes with this collection of subsets that are ordered like this. Okay. And the parameter space that I'm using also has a natural filtration, another set of subsets that are ordered like this. That is, if I had the square, for example, I have the 2D part and I have its one-dimensional skeleton in the boundary, and then a zero-dimensional skeleton that are the vertical. The skeleton that are the vertices in the corners. Okay, so this is natural. Then I have maps from a space that has its filtration to another space that has the filtration. Then it's natural to say I want the filtration to be preserved and this is going to be the path that I consider should be respecting of that thing. Let me see what else I'm missing. Just terminology, the elements of this thing. The elements of this thing, they should be with some equivalence class of paths, but that is the only place in the whole presentation in which I wrote this equivalence class. Later, I drop this because I will be writing it everywhere. But one should think about these things. And there are these things that preserve the filtrations. And I consider these things up to. Things, the optical homotopy that preserves the filtrations. Like, for example, in the one-dimensional case, I had to do optical reparametrizations that fix the boundaries. And then in the square, I will fix the one-dimensional edges and the vertices, but up to homotopy that preserves the thing. So the edges are actually not preserved exactly, but only up to things that move things there approach. Move things there appropriately. And the vertices are really preserved. They are, since they are dimension zero, they are the only things that are really completely preserved there. And the other things are only almost preserved, but not. But notice that then the square itself, the image, remains the same. It just kind of has a diffeomorphism acting in it. Okay, so these are very important. Are this a very important distinction here when this filtration here is just let me first say the lower thing when this is just a collection of subsets where this one is a proper subset of the rest and the rest are all equal to the total space that that is very natural in topology. I'm talking about homotopy classes relative homotopy class Homotopic classes, relative homotopy classes relative to what only relative to this discrete subset of I call it discrete, but any this original subset x0 that is for example in our case it will be the vertices of the of the square. All the rest of the things are up to homotopy they can move everywhere. Like this is not what happens in gauge theories. In gauge theories, In engaged theories, I have a path with a fixed initial and final position, and all the paths that connect these two things may lead to very different parallel transports. Okay, because if I move them away from that. But if I do this other thing where the x, the x i's are related to the i skeleton of the filtration, this i of the skeleton has a fixed dimension. Has a fixed dimension, dimension i, then I end up talking about something called thin homotopy, that is the one that is relative to gauge theories, for example. So the paths will have to be along these skeletons, one-dimensional skeletons, and they could not live somewhere else, but then I can have these other things like reparametrization in the skeleton, all moving up and down, but coming down in the same. Coming down in the same thing. So these are two important distinctions of the cases of the filtration that are going to be relevant later. So I describe what is this thing and what does it do? And what it does is that it lets you understand for mathematicians that do homotopy, the homotopy properties of a topological space in terms of their pieces. Space in terms of their pieces. I'm sure everyone has heard here about the fundamental group of space, and this is a space of curves, the base, the curves. And then there is higher dimensional versions of that, where you have a base point and then you don't throw circles, but spheres of different dimensions. And it looks like very strange. I mean, it doesn't compose nicely as it does for. Compose nicely as it does for dimension one. But people discovered between the 60s and the 80s that you could use instead of groups, group points and have much nicer setup. So here is spaces2 and you can have this filtration or this other filtration, the dots that are solid are in the front and the other ones are in the back of the sphere. The back of the sphere, and this other one has only one dot and not other structure. This is the one used for the pi n pi 2, for example, of the sphere. And so I said about talking about the space in the homotopical properties of the space starting from its pieces. So this again is true, and I have a cover. Have a cover, open cover of S2. This U is the letter usually used for open covers, and I want to give some particular example. And so there is this open set here covering the top cover of the cube. Then I also drew one for the bottom cover, but there should be other open sets covering each of the faces. Each of the faces, okay. And that's a way to picture this open cover that I have here. And other important thing about the open covers is that they do have intersections. And here I am drawing one particular intersection. This thing that I drew here is supposed to be located here. Okay, the intersection of this thing with what will cover this face. This thing with what will cover this face field over here. Okay, so this notation is just important. Just try to see what it means over here for the next transparency. And when I have a little I over here, it's that I'm intersecting these open sets with the filtration. So the new pieces of X, my X is a sphere, the pieces are the open sets, they inherit the filtration from that thing. The filtration from that thing. Okay, so all these things topology, and this here is the very nice result of these people. The theorem was proved by Ronald Brown and some collaborators. I forgot their name because actually he has many collaborations that led to this theorem. The last one with a person, but the previous ones that were all this chain of development. Chain of developments were geared for proving this theorem. And it has this name, Higher Homotopy Cipher-Pan-Kampen theorem. Anyway, if someone knows about the Cipher-Park-Kampen theorem, then this generalizes it. But if not, I'm just going to explain it. And so here I have a disjoint union of these things, disjoint union, and plays the same role as tensor product. As tensor product, okay, so that means should be that's why I here underlined it. There is a way to have some things like tensor products, and I have here pieces of space-time. The use are pieces of space-time with their filtration. And this is the lambda is just one of the labels of the open cover. And this other one, and here you see there is a pair. pairs of pairs of um so this new is belongs to the lambda square so there are two labels of and corresponds to the intersection i actually put it in the previous transparency the intersection of two two sets so i here i have all the things related to the pieces i have the pieces of space-time with their homotopical With their homotopical properties related to the filtration tool. And here I have everything that happens in the intersections. And what happens here is that if I have an intersection between two things, I can always have inclusion maps that go from each of the two from the intersection to each of the individual pieces. Pieces there, say if I have nu and mu, then the intersection of nu and mu, and there is a map that includes into u nu and a map that includes into u mu. And these are the A and B here. And these things, I consider all the intersections, and I go from here to here using that map. And from these pieces, I should be able to go to the total space. So I go from No, so I go from here to here in this way, or from here to here in this way, and they should be compatible in a way. But the question is whether I can actually know what is this space from the previous, what is the total right-hand side in terms of the pieces, whether yes or no. And the question is, the answer is this theorem that says that yes, you just have to have a good filtration that is good in the pieces. If the filtration is good in the pieces, Filtration is good in the pieces, then it becomes good in the total space. And the second thing is that this other thing, the C and the, can be calculated as something called the co-equalizer. That means that anything that commutes to another thing that is not this one will actually be calculable from this one. This kind of soft product of that. A soft product of that. So, this is the minimal thing that makes sense. Juan can explain that better later. But anyway, this is what it means: that you can actually have this thing as a minimal piece. Any other thing in the right that exists here could be constructed from this one, from a map that goes from one to the other. That's the essence of this thing. Of this thing. And so, in particular, before I change transparency, if I use the filtration that comes from the skeleton of a cellular decomposition of a space, so if this is a manifold and it has a cellular decomposition and I use this filtration, if I use also a cover that is tailored to that cellular decomposition, everything works. So the The condition of the theorem actually is satisfied, and then the theorem applies. Okay, so now it comes to the second proposal. Because I saw this algebraic structure that looks like what I want to do, then I want to say that I do that. So I start with M, a manifold, a topological manifold, a smooth manifold, C, a cellular decomposition. This one is a filtration. This one is a filtration, but not any filtration, ones that come from the cellular decomposition, and an open cover that is, you can think about it as just inflating the highest dimensional cells. So they become an open set instead of closed, for example, and that they have intersections like this, and they are compatible with the skeleton. And these sigmas that I'm going to write here, they belong. Right here, they belong to this n minus one skeleton. They cannot be anywhere. I already have the cellular decomposition. Or if I let's say that I start with a sigma, then I put the cellular decomposition such that it has its one skeleton covering sigma. And then I want to talk not much about what I will do with the propagators. What I will do with the propagators, that and probably is something I should do for the third layer of these things. I'm going to talk about what I would do with the Hilbert spaces. Okay, so what I will do with the Hilbert spaces here is that I want to calculate this thing from its pieces, from its elementary piece. And I want to just emulate the previous theorem of Brown to have it here. What do I need to do for that? I need to associate Hilbert spaces. Need to associate Hilbert spaces not to paths like I was doing before, but to the whole groupoid of paths. So this becomes more like the Hilbert spaces are going to give me a representation of the path group point of to think homotopy. So if I do that, not associate the key spaces to one particular parametrized path, but with all the collection of them and modular equivalences, then I have all the algebraic structures that I want. Then I have all the algebraic structures that I want. And then I think I will be able to say that this thing holds, and I can calculate this thing from its little pieces. And the interpretation of the pieces is that these are like the main pieces, and these other ones are compatibility conditions. And this is in any dimension. It looks nicer in dimension two, but in other dimensions, also works. And then you can. Also works, and then you can consider like these elementary pieces that are come from the double intersections, and you could understand them again in terms of their elementary pieces going like that. So, this gives a complete description of how to talk about getting a Hilbert space associated to a co-dimension one region in terms of piece. Region in terms of pieces that are compatible. And this is just up to here, that's where the proposal kind of finishes. I would like to have this propagator part being compatible with this view of the hybrid spaces. It's something that is not done here. It should be done. And I think an important part of this thing for the interpretation is that all of these things could also Of these things could also be done in a kind of dual language where I, instead of thinking about spaces, I prefer to think about local algebras of observables and their compatibility conditions. And the same thing should follow from here, but I have not done that. So that's where it finishes. And I guess I have time to answer plenty of questions. Answer plenty of questions because I'm sure that you didn't understand everything and it's a work in progress, so I can clarify things and you can actually criticize or say where I can. And the thing was really developed for Robert and Juan because they were talking about these things and I wrote them an email and they didn't answer what's happening with these guys. And so, anyway, so it's really for them. So it's really for them to try to address the same issues that one was talking about. Well, we already have a question in the yeah, I'm sorry. Uh maybe I'm Sorry, yeah, Rafael, please go ahead with your question. Yeah. I didn't. I had to miss a little part of the talk, but hold on a second. Sorry, there was an echo in the other room. But this was very interesting to me because it reminded me a little bit of something in quantum measure theory, which I referred to briefly, very briefly in my talk, which is that you start from something, a generalized path integral, and you end up with Hilbert spaces. Spaces. It looked to me like this might have some application to that situation and it might even therefore turn out to be relevant to some of the causality questions that I was raising in my talk. However, what I didn't notice in the part of the talk that I was able to watch was any reference to causal structure. I saw a lot of homotopy theory and higher homotopy. And higher homotopy theory, and so on. It looked topological very much so, but was there any notion of causality or temporal ordering that entered into your framework? Okay. So the short answer is that doing this with a quantum gravity, quantum gravity Gravity motivation is not done only for quantum gravity, but maybe for quantum gravity, leads me to just treat the case in which there is no metric or anything predefined in the space. So it has my spaces, original spaces, have no signal, no metric, nothing. They are just topological. And in the case of gravity, if I want to Of gravity, if I want to consider that case where the metric or some or a tetrad or something is the field, then in the classical theory, that will give me a Causal structure there. And maybe fields propagating in that space-time, then will follow some Causal structure rules. But this thing is geared towards just analyzing the most fundamental. Fundamental level of things, obviously not as radical as Causal sets. Here I assume that I have a topological manifold playing the role of space-time. And there the dynamical field is going to include, for example, the metric. And there, they are going to be causal relations only when I have already a field maybe. A field, maybe at the quantum level, but definitely at the classical level. Once I have a field, then I can have that. So, no more than that. I don't know if you see something in satisfactory for that. You mentioned that generalized path integral. At the end, yes, I need to generalize the path integral because I need to study that propagator and becomes more like a collection. Like a collection of pad integrals that I can think about as the pad integral associated to the bulk or several versions of the bulk that are compatible and little degenerate pieces of the pad integral associated to this structure that I have in my boundary conditions that are kind of degenerate and associated to other possibilities and the And the other possibilities of the boundary that play the role of compatibility conditions. So it's just, I guess, a systematization of trying to glue pieces of the pad integral with these algebraic rules. And I cannot say any more than that up to now. Thanks. Yeah, what I had in mind was that in this framework that I didn't discuss. This framework that I didn't describe, this quantum measure theory, you have, say, you have a fixed space-time with a metric on which everything is being done, and you're doing, say, quantum field theory or particle motion. Then you associate elements of the Hilbert space not necessarily, not in general to the boundary, but you associate to any event a vector in the Hilbert space. In the Hilbert space. But questions of causality, so it can be a localized event, right? But questions of causality seem to have to do with the relations of the Hilbert spaces associated with different regions. So to each region, there's a bunch of events that can happen in that region. That's a subspace of the Hilbert space, and so on. So because you were getting sort of paid. We're getting sort of, if I understood, patching together Hilbert spaces, it reminded me of this situation that it might give us some framework for formulating how the Hilbert spaces associated with sub-regions of space-time relate, or filtration, as you said, relate to Hilbert spaces formed from larger regions and how they fit together, how the former fit together into the latter. How the former fit together into the latter. That was the motivation for my question. Yeah, thank you. And the only thing that I can say on top of that is that what I ended up associating Hebrew space to was not actually the pieces of space time that were parametrized, pieces of space-time module equivalence, but the whole collection that I could associate to a region. To a region. It needed to have all the pieces also, including like these conditions that I needed to have to say like the path, the boundary in direction one of something lead me to some path of one lower dimension and I had another thing. All these algebraic pieces, they needed to be considered together to form. Together to form what is this group point or something, and only that was good enough for me to later have tensor products. If I had only the little pieces, I couldn't have tensor products of that. So maybe that thing already helps you with something. You needed to have some algebraic structure on the pieces, so the whole representation of that thing had the Have the categorical properties necessary to do tensor products, but I'm not an expert on that, and I want to stop talking about that part. Here, there are some experts that can clarify that further. Okay, any other questions? So I think that this parametrized quantum field theory you are using for studying the space-time. So I think with this, the brown theorem, you are studying as how you have the intersection of two options. So in the you So, you need a triangulation of your space-time. So, my question is: you are using a cubical sim like simplicial set when you are using all the direction of your path. So, how they mix? Yeah. So, the answer to that is that the cubes can be singular and have like one of the Like one of the borders, one of the boundaries to be collapsed to a point or a line or something. So, they are just, for example, you can invent yourself a way to have a map from the square to the triangle. And yeah, you just have to make it singular. And these are allowed things. I don't know if you want me to say more, but also I. Say more, but also, I don't necessarily consider only a topological space with a triangulation. That's my favorite example, but I could also have, for example, another cellular decomposition that has other shapes. Like, for example, if I have the torus, I can just tessellate it by squares or something. And that will also work for my purposes. Purposes okay, and the open cover has to be tailored to that, too. So, another was it good enough, or if not, we continue talking later. It depends on the two intersections and it. Two intersections, and it doesn't depend on the n intersection. For example, if you just the cover of the space-time, then this gives you a triangulation of the manifold. But if you just depends on the two intersections, this is just you, this depends only on the lines, the lines. And well, I don't know how this doesn't know the Know how this doesn't not depend on the check complex. Like when you have the check complex, you have the whole intersections. In the topological part, we can talk separately, I guess, later, but here when I appeal to the further intersections, I was talking about About being able to talk about the pieces themselves, I had then two kinds of pieces where they were the if I was talking in codimension one, so n minus one, and I had pieces of that dimension, and then they had to be compatible. You can imagine that the intersections had to do with the n minus two skeleton. And then if I they were the compatibility conditions. So if I have two n minus one pieces intersecting. n minus one pieces intersecting something, then they are compatible there. And for each pair of compatible things, and then these pieces themselves will have to be compatible and that's where check complex will arise. So if I want to understand how is that these intersectional pieces are made, then I need to do the same process again. And I guess that's how the whole check complex. The whole check complex will arise, but I prefer to talk about it later. So I wanted to apply this thing to this Hilbert space construction, but actually my previous work that motivated this thing is on HTOs where, yes, I know I have these check things and they do appear naturally. This talk about some particular, I mean, there is a construction that leads to this check. Construction that leads to this check thing of the homotopies and things like this, but we can talk about it later. So, another question? So, yeah, maybe we can close the session or so. Let's then close Antonio again.
