     These fibronectin strips. They start migrating. Initially, each cell sort of has a random direction right to left. Eventually, they will start colliding with each other, and every time they collide with each other, there's essentially two outcomes that are being observed. So either the cells sort of undergo contact inhibition of locomotion, so think they bounce off each other. So, think they bounce off each other, or they entrain themselves. So, in other words, they choose a common migration direction. And this eventually leads to these cell trains that migrate collectively in one direction. And so, the question at a fundamental level is the following. Consider this collision of two cells here. So, time here is on the x-axis. And so, you can see these two cells approach each other, they interact with each other here in this. They interact with each other here in this center region, and then they decide to move apart from each other. And so, what I'm interested in answering is the following questions: What happens at this cell-cell collision site? What are the signals that are being produced? And how are the signals being transduced into the intracellular polarization mechanisms that control the cytoskeleton? Okay. So, this is the Okay, so this is the same thing written out in a sentence. And so, what I want to do today is I want to walk through our little model setup that we're using to collectively build this complexity. I will show you very briefly some sort of single-cell behaviors to just prime you a little bit to see what this model does and what it doesn't do. And then we'll start talking about repolarization, which really is the question of what happens at these collision sites. And at the end, I'll show you sort of teasers of where this work is. Sort of tease us of where this work is going in the future. Okay, so up here, what you see is: so, this is a cell from the top, so imagine that you're looking down at the cell. What I will do in this model is I will consider cross-sections of these cells, so indicated here by this black dashed line. And so, in this cross-section here, I will place two things. So, going back to our little collision picture. So going back to our little collision picture here, I effectively take a cross-section here from the top to the bottom. I indicate the locations of the back and the front of the cells by x1 and x2 of t. I will connect these two endpoints by some viscoelastic element that represents the viscoelasticity of these one-dimensional cells now. And then, crucially, in between these two cell endpoints, I will place a polarity model which will determine how the cytoskeleton How the cytoskeleton behaves. So let's just go through these two model components and let me just show you some of the decisions that we've made here. So let's have a first look at the polarity models. So right, so I guess to this audience, these pictures might be very familiar, but right, so in general, these biochemical reaction networks that control the cellular skeleton are very complicated. And so, for the mathematical modeling purposes, I will focus on I will focus on key players that control these, that control this hydroskeleton. So, in this case, I will look at these small GTPAs, this rack row. So, rack, as we've seen before, induces actin polymerization. So, I will think about a rack as something that in this work causes actin polymerization at the front, so it forces the cell membrane outward. Whereas I will imagine that rho causes contraction, so it will cause. Contraction and so it will cause my cell edges to move inward. Next, I want to, effectively, I want one of the simplest models that I can find so I can model the dynamics of these single GTPases in my little one-dimensional cell. So in this case, I choose the wave pinning model. So let me just tell you quickly what the wave pinning model does. So we have two chemical species here. Chemical species here. We have the active GDPS, which is effectively the on version of this biological switch. We have the inactive version of this, and they're cycled in between these two by gaps and gaps. We've seen examples of this in the previous talk already. The key ingredients that you need to get a system here that forms a pattern is that I need a diffusion rate difference, which I obtain due to the fact that the active GDPAs is attethered to the cellular membrane, whereas the To the cellular membrane, whereas the inactive GTPA species can freely diffuse in this filterocytosol. The third thing I need is I need a positive feedback. And so here the positive feedback is that active GTPase will positively feed back on its own activation. Right, so for those who like equations in this room, you can write down a standard direction diffusion system for this. And this indeed will form a pattern, which I will show you. This indeed will form a pattern, which I will show you in just a second. And the only caveat here is that I'm on these deforming domains now. So I need to modify these equations ever so slightly and add the appropriate terms. So here this is a dilution term and the appropriate time dependence on my diffusion coefficient to account for the deforming domains here. Right, and my video has gone missing because on this computer it doesn't work, so I will show you the solutions to this look in just a minute. The solutions to this look in just a second, after I tell you what the mechanical interactions look like. So, mechanically, I'm going down the simplest route that I possibly can. So, I chose here a Kelvin-Voig element to describe the viscoelasticity of the cell. And so, once again, for those who like equations, I just wrote down the equations of motions here for the two endpoints here. These last two terms are the spring element here, and this is the The spring element here, and this is basically the dashboard inside the cell. And the only additional components here that are key here is that the internal GDPS concentration in the cell will now apply forces on the cell endpoints. So for instance, in the case where we're modeling rack inside the cell, if rack is high at this endpoint, we will now apply an outward force to that endpoint. Whereas if you were to model a cell that contains rho, for instance, you would apply an inward force on that endpoint if the GTPS is high. Point if the GTPS is high at that point. And this is just indicated by these two functions over there. Okay, so, right. I have a question. So you're modeling your cells kind of a strip, right? Yes. Okay, so when you stretch your strip, if I got it right, you're diluting things, and when you squeeze them, you're concentrating things. But a real cell, well, I mean, I don't know, if there was some sort of volume. I mean, if there was some sort of volume constraint, then you're not changing anything. You're just changing the shape. So are you getting the geometric aspects correct here? So in the one-dimensional case, yes. And then if you do the, you can actually amend this model to account for the volume. Like if you will say you have volume conservation and you get, it just becomes slightly more complicated. Then you don't have dilution. Yes, but I'm thinking here about dilution in terms of on the membrane along. Terms of on the membrane along my long axis of the cell. So I'm asking the question. Maybe I'm not getting my geometry right in this case. Well, I don't know. Am I supposed to think of the cell as like you can buy different toys, right? You can buy a balloon, which is stretchy, or you could just use like a plastic bag and just fill it with fluid, right? And the balloon, you can stretch it and change the. The balloon, you can stretch it and change the concentration, but the plastic bag model, you can't stretch it, but you can still deform it. Yeah, think about it as a balloon. Because then your thing works, correct? But the bag thing, you can get it to work, but it's slightly more complicated. Okay. You have to play a little bit of it so that you can get it to work. I think I have it in an appendix of one of these papers. Right. So, right, so I still owe you an explanation of what the wave pinning model looks like, what the solutions to this look like. So, suppose I have, so I will show you a whole bunch of these chimerographs here. So, I have time on the x-axis, I have position on the y-axis. And so, a pinned wave looks effectively something like this, right? So, you have a high concentration here at the front and a low concentration here at the back. And so, effectively, what this pattern forming system does is it identifies It identifies or it gives you information what is my cell front versus what is my cell back, right? It gives you that symmetry value. And so, in this top row here, I show you examples of a cell that contains a model of rho. You can see that if rho is high at this cell edge here, your cell moves downward. So, you effectively have contraction at the end here. Whereas down here, I show you a cell that contains red, and so you can see that as the conservation is high, So you can see that as the conservation is high at the front here, you have an output force upwards until you get this cell that moves upwards. Finally, right, you have to be a little bit careful here. You have this mass conservation in the system. And so due to the dilution and due to the fact that the total amount of GDPAs per unit length in the system is a bifurcation parameter, you can run into these situations where your cell becomes either too large or too small to be able to support pattern formation. So you just have to. So yeah, I just have to be a little bit careful. So most of in this talk I will focus on stiff cells that don't deform too much in some sense. I gotta speed up a little bit. So okay, so for the single cell migration, the upshot is essentially that you give your system initial condition, you form a polarized state, and then the model will just do its thing. So you polarize your cell upwards, and you get these cells that just migrate upwards for the rest of time. Of Woods for the rest of time. And so the question really is that if you want to now consider cells and interactions, the question is: how do these polarity models respond to external stimuli? So one of the really nice ways you can start studying how these models respond to stimuli is due to optogenetic experiments. So the idea is essentially the following. So here you see a chimograph. It's not showing up too great on this. It's not showing up too great on this. So the cell actually extends all the way up to here, and the edge of the cell is down here. And what you effectively do is in this experiment is that you have a cell that is prepped with a particular row gap that responds to a light stimuli. So it turns on if you shine a light on, let's say, this lower 20% of this cell here. And as soon as you do this, you of course polarize your cell and your cell starts to migrate. And your cell starts to migrate upward. As you switch the position of your stimuli, you can reverse the polarity of your cell, and you get these cells that start migrating downwards. So in a cartoon version of this, what you're doing effectively is the following, right? You have these different stimuli of light, you have different gaps and gaps that you could prep your system with. And effectively what you're doing in your mathematical model is now you're locally perturbing the reaction rates. The reaction rates of either activating your GDPS or deactivating the GDPS. And so the question is: how does, can we somehow mathematically predict how large the stimulus has to be, how much percentage of the cell needs to be covered by these stimuli, and so on? Right, and so the question effectively actually what you asked: so suppose you have this polarized cell to the right, you apply a You apply your stimuli on external perturbation to it. The question is: do you not perturb the polarized state or do you flip the polarized state around? Right, and you can answer this, and you can run some, you can do this via bifurcation analysis. And effectively, let me just tell you what you get here. So, I have my nonlinear function up here, and I have three plots here. So, these three plots here, they have the reaction rates down here. So, the first one here. Down here. So the first one here would be the alter feedback parameter of RAC here. This would be the basal activation rate of RAC here on the x-axis, and here is the deactivation rate of RAC. And on the y-axis here, I have the perturbation strength, which I will define you how I perturb my systems in a second. But effectively, this tells you how strong your optogenetic perturbation is. And so what you can see is that there's essentially three types of behaviors that these models exhibit. Models exhibit. So, in this region that is labeled by one, you don't get any response. So, you don't see repolarization occurring. So, you're perturbing your system, but you're not getting a flip in polarity. And region two is exactly the region where you see repolarization. So, you see a flip from right polarized to left polarized. Whereas then, in this third region, you see your polarized state being destructed. So, you get a transition from polarized state to a Transition from a polarized state to a uniform state. Right, and so the nice thing about this is that there's a few things that we can learn from here. So depending on where your cell sits, it becomes either less or more sensitive to external stimuli that lead to repolarization. And you can also see that it depends on which parameter you choose to perturb, or in other words, which Choose to perturb, or in other words, with which gap or gap you're targeting in your system, whether you have large regions of repolarization or whether you have small regions of repolarization. And let me just sort of in a mathematical interlude quickly show you how I do this. Oh, actually, never mind. Let me just show you what happens when you actually put this back into the physical system. So up here, we have the same experiment. So, up here we have the same experimental setup again. You see these top-view pictures of a cell, you perturb them in these regions that are indicated by these white rectangles. And so you can really nicely recapitulate experiments like this. And you can very precisely determine now how strong you need to perturb your system to be able to observe these flips in polarity. And similarly, right? In polarity. And similarly, right, you can also ask now the same question: like instead of asking for the strength, you can ask questions about how much area of the cell do you need to apply this perturbation to lead to a repolarization. And generally speaking, the wider the area that you perturb, the more likely it becomes that you repolarize. Seems somewhat obvious. Right now, to my mathematical interlude. So, how do I do this? So, this is one of the cases where a lot of these sort of shortcuts that have been developed. A lot of these sort of shortcuts that have been developed for reaction diffusion systems, things, things like LPA analysis, simply fail because the spatial nature in these systems becomes important now. And so what I did, I essentially computed fully spatial bifurcation diagrams for the expression diffusion equations. So I have two examples here. So this is on the left here. Again, I have the bifurcation parameter, or in this case, the positive feedback of my GPAs on the x-axis. And I plot some norm on the y-axis, which effectively gives you. Norm on the y-axis, which effectively gives you a measure of how large your solutions are. Generally, what you see is something like this. So you have these two features in these diagrams that you have. Your uniform solutions here, they are indicated by these orange lines. And your heterogeneous solutions, which correspond to your polarized states, would correspond to this blue solution curve here. The interesting, well, the nice thing here to observe is that these two Polaroid states, if you have a level Polarized states, if you have a left polarized state, you must have a right polarized state. And so this sort of gives you a hint why you need these spatial perturbations, because you need to break that symmetry somehow in this system. Right, and just to be able to separate these two polarized states, I really like to use this projection here on the right, which is just simply a different method of measuring the sizes of my solution. And so then your repolarization question. And so then your repolarization question essentially becomes: suppose I'm sitting at this red solution up here, what do I need to do to this bifurcation diagram so that I remove this red steady state while I retain this green steady state in my system? Right, and so the perturbations that I apply here, so these are perturbations that I apply to the reaction rates of my system. They're spatially dependent here, and I effectively model them as moit. As motivated from the optogenetic experiments, right? So I model these perturbations as these step functions here. And then the parameter h that I had previously is simply the height here. Right, and just to show you what happens to one such bifurcation diagram as you apply these perturbations, so you start with this unperturbed bifurcation diagram up here. Again, I want to flip or I want to move my system from this green state to this state indicated by a red dot. State indicated by a red dot. As I apply my perturbation, you can see that the polarized state that is above the x-axis sort of retreats in some sense in parameter space. So if it travels to the left, and you can see at some point it has retreated so far that at my initial state that I'm sitting in, there's no longer a steady state present, and hence my dynamical system will transition me to this red state complement. And so, since these diagrams are a little bit tricky to read, the two parameter bifurcation diagrams that I showed you earlier. Diagrams that I showed you earlier give you a really nice summary of this. Okay, so just a few conclusions on this, right? So the bifurcation analysis here really identifies regions in which you are repolarizable. And so this is really key here, right? So if you were to try to do this in a different method, right? So the other method you could do, you could just simulate a lot of these systems. There are so many parameters in these systems that you need to get right that it becomes very tricky to identify these regions of repolarizability. The other thing that the bifurcation analysis would allow you to do is might allow you to match those to biological perturbation experiments. So suppose that really if I have a bifurcation diagram, this effectively tells me how the dynamics of my systems change as I vary some reaction rate in my system. That could correspond to a That could correspond to an up-regulation or a down-regulation study in an experiment. I just showed you a single polarization model here, but this is general. You can repeat this with your favorite model, and hopefully it spits out something similar or something not so similar, and then maybe you observe some other types of behaviors that I didn't observe in this case. Numerical implementation of this was not as straightforward as I hoped initially. Hoped initially. So, due to the spatial dependence in these reaction parameters, you have to be a little bit careful. And at the end of the day, I used a Geeken-Paule collocation method combined with a Newton-Gauss continuation method, which theoretically is on a much more sounder basis than the standard pseudo-R-time continuation that people employ. Okay, and then the last sort of five minutes, let me just show you where this will go. Just show you where this will go. So now, so far I showed you a single cell. The second thing I showed you, I showed you a single cell and asked the question: what inputs do I need so that that cell flips its polarity direction. And so now I want to add back a second cell into the system and ask what kind of interactions between these two cells lead to contact inhibition of locomotion or entrainment. So in other words, contact inhibition of locomotion would correspond to repolaration. Would correspond to repolarization occurring in both cells, whereas in Trayman, you only see repolarization in a single cell. And there's some really nice experiments that are being done here. This is by Ben Lin, for instance, who looked at cells in microfluidic devices, and then you can see that he looked at what happens to various. So I think this is PI3K here, and over here you have RAC. So what happens to these proteins when cells run into other cells? Run into other samples. Right, and so the corresponding cartoon to this situation is very similar to my optogenetic cartoon that I had earlier, except now I don't have a light stimulus, and now the stimulus is provided by the whatever protein interactions we have at the cell-cell collision interface. Whether that be adhesion molecules, efference, merlin, right? There's so many options that you could play with. But similar to the optogenetic experiments, these interactions lead to spatially localized perturbations. To spatially localized perturbations to my underlying polarization models that eventually determine what the cytoskeleton will do. So you have the corresponding cartoon here. So suppose you have these two cells that have polarities that essentially it's like two trains that are on their way to collide. They collide, there's some perturbation being applied, and the question is: do you get outcome one or do you get outcome two? Whereas outcome two would be content inhibition of locomotion and outcome one. Be content inhibition of locomotion, and outcome one would be cell entrainment. Let me just show you some numerical examples and then conclude. So, here I have a system, so I have this keyword symmetry here. So, these two cells are sitting in the same space, sitting at the same location in parameter space. And so, what happens here, right? So, if you look at this collision up here, the cells, they're polarized, they're moving towards each other, they collide, and they respond in the exact And they respond in the exact same fashion when they collide. And so in this case, it shows parameters that would allow for repolarization from modification diagrams. And so you can really nicely see here that after some time here, you see repolarization in both cells. It happens at the same time. And hence, you observe this really nice contact inhibition of locomotion event. Next, you can ask the question: okay, if I now change the parameters between the two, Change the parameters between the two cells, do you observe cell entrainment? So, effectively, imagine that, going back to my original bifurcation diagram, I pick one cell to have a parameter region that fits with the repolarization region identified, and another cell that is either in the region where nothing happens or in the region where you collapse to uniform steady states. So, here in this top picture, I have an example of a cell where one sits in the repolarization region and one sits in the non-response region. Sits in the non-response region, and you see that one cell repolarizes whereas the other doesn't, and so you get this really nice cell retrainment event. Down here, I have an example of a cell where one cell repolarizes, whereas the other cell doesn't, where the polarity collapses to a uniform steady state. And then, in some cases, you can ask questions like, okay, since I have no cells interacting, what could the role for adhesion be? There's a paper from four or five years ago that argues for the fact that if Argues for the fact that if you have strongly adherent cells, that contact inhibition of locomotion becomes more frequent. And here I have the, this is the same setup as up here. So you have one cell, right? So here you can see that both cells sort of start repolarizing, but due to the fact that they're stuck together, it sort of gives the slower cell more time to repolarize as well. Finally, more recently, Finally, more recently, saw by Jane in 2020. So they effectively repeated the experiment that I had on my motivating slide. However, they made the one modification that they put them on sort of fibernecting rings now. So you have small cell groups on these effectively on a periodic domain. And again, what they observe is that the cell cell collisions eventually lead to the emergence of collective cell migration. Or collectiveness here really means that you have one common uh rotation direction of your cells. Rotation direction of your cells. And so, in our framework, we can actually simulate this now, right? There's no difference of two cells to n cells. And you can get simulation results that look like this. And I mean, you can compute an audit parameter in this case, but I think even the untrained, just looking at this for a little bit, you can see that there's no emergence of connectiveness here. There's absolutely nothing happening here. And the reason is that. Here, right, and the reason is that all the cells in this case are equal again, so they sit in the same location in parameter space, which means upon collision they will react the exact same way. And so, really, right? And so really, I guess the question is at some point, so since these experiments rely on this sort of, so in these experiments, what you essentially observe is that the same cell types undergo different types of The same cell types undergo different types of behavior. So, for instance, DESIRE reported 80% CIL and 20% entrainment, and they showed really nicely in a very simple model that this is required for cell entrainment to, or for the emergence of collectiveness, then the question is how do you deal with effectively cell variations in these models? So, I've just shown you that in the case I pick cells that have the exact same parameter configurations, I do not Configurations, I do not observe the convergence of collectiveness because the cells react in the exact same way. So there's something that is required in these systems that breaks this symmetry, whether that's noise or whether this is some additional mechanisms, I'm not sure. But I think this is the big sort of question that I at least have at this point. So just to recapitulate a little bit, I showed you a simple sort of one-dimensional model. Simple sort of one-dimensional model. I showed you that you get these, you can recapitulate basic single-cell behaviors. I showed you how you can use verification analysis to identify regions in which repolarization is possible, in which repolarization is not possible. Using these pieces of information, you can slowly build now complexity in the sense that you can sort of predict what cell, what parameter configuration gives you cells that can react either by repolarizing or not repolarizing. Either by repolarizing or not repolarizing. And now the question is, how do you use these pieces of information to build a theory or build towards a theory of how collectiveness emerges in these one-dimensional cell traits? I think that's it. Right, so free references. So, if you want to read more, go to these free papers, and I'm happy to take any of your questions. All right, well, we'll go ahead. Alright, we'll go ahead and start with questions from the room and then go to the online participants as well. Can the monitor change over the mics, please? Let's go ahead and start with any questions. It had one example of cells that do form a train in an earlier talk. So what happened? What happened there that was different? Were the cells slightly different parameters or did you start them off initially differently? Yeah, so there's many ways that you can break the symmetry in these models, right? So I think in that particular example I used slightly softer cells so that they deformed ever so slightly. And since the total amount per unit length is a bifurcation parameter for these, that gives you cells that effectively, in these two parameter bifurcation diagrams, are in slightly different regions. Now if you choose Regions. Now, if you choose a perturbation where you have a vibration diagram that has these batches for the repolarization region, so you can easily move across these boundaries. And then you start seeing something interesting. Maybe? Yeah, thanks for a nice talk. I'm just wondering about this last piece here with trying to match these experiments from Jane and Alan. I don't know this paper, but I'm just wondering. And Alan, I don't know this paper, but I'm just wondering, like, how frequently did they observe this kind of collective motion together? Was it just like a rare event that they happened to observe? Is that a robust result? I understand, yes. So they even showed that, you know, they did some, what's the word I'm trying to find? They even identified some requirements for this. So for instance, they depleted the system of calcium, and then as soon as you didn't have adhesions, you wouldn't see this event. As you didn't have adhesions, you wouldn't see this event happening anymore. So, they very robustly analyzed that is. I'm guessing it once it gets to confluence, then everything kind of stops. No, it actually keeps on rotating. So it just keeps on going, right? So, you need adhesion to establish. And you can also show that it's really the cell cell context. So, there's repolarization events. So, they imaged that cell cell context and they could really nicely see that it's red polarity that switches at these collision sites. So, you have individual cell collisions. So you have individual cell collisions that effectively drive the emergence of collectiveness in this case. So they showed some other really cute little results, right? So they had sort of, they looked at cell trains of different lengths when they collided. So they had like two cells collide with a train of five cells, six cells, seven cells. And in general, the train that had more cells tended to win out of a small train. And so in that sense, it's quite robust. In that sense, it's quite robust. And it also really nicely matches the original or the earlier results by design. Of course, you didn't have them on a circular disk, but so there's a sort of a time limit of how long they observe these experiments, but at least those two pieces seem to agree really nicely in this. But is that something your model can ever capture, or is it out of the realm of possibility? I mean, you would hope so, right? But I think the key question is: so, design really nicely show that. The key question is: so, design really nicely show that it's the probabilities to what collision outcome you, right? So, whether you get CIL or entrainment, and if you balance those probabilities in the right way, you see this emergence of collectiveness. And so now the question is in these models, is how do you tune or how do you get the interactions between these polarization models in such a way that you get those probabilities of outcome? And as soon as you get that, you should see those emergence of collective. see those notions of collectiveness. A few slides back you had one of your graphs with the cells coming together and you commented that two of them ended up in nodes after that I think. Yeah the polarity collapse one. So one of those cells is polarized and one is not. No no so initial I need to separate them a little bit further at the beginning to make this clear. So both are polarized at the beginning so it's the same So, both are polarized at the beginning, so it's the same setup. There are two polarized cells that run towards each other. It's just one of those cells, if you remember one of the earlier bifurcation diagrams, had a region where repolarization was possible, and they had a region where effectively a polarized state would collapse to a uniform state. And then in the model, the uniform one is just kind of being shunted by the other one? Exactly, right? So then, as a result of this, right, so this cell essentially, since there's sufficiently much adhesion between the two, it essentially just drags that water. Which essentially just drags that one. Do we have any other questions, either in person or virtual? Trains form or how the rank of adding noise to the Yes, but the question is how and in what way? That's what I'm struggling with, right? So of course, right, you could add noise in a whole bunch of different ways, right? You could say, take a parameter cloud, like, you know, take effectively distributions of parameters and put them in your model. You could add noise in the sense by let my cells deform sufficiently much, start them off in different places. You could, of course, also add actual white noise to your reaction diffusion system in places. So there's so many. Right. Um so there's so many options that I'm simply not completely sure which one is the best one to take. Well, I don't see virtual questions and we're at uh coffee time so um thanks to the first two speakers. Um so for the in-person we're having a coffee break until 1040. We're gonna make that 1040 really sharp because the next session is a virtual session. The next session is a virtual session.
