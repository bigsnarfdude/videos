I'm going to talk about describing the symplectic leaves of the certain Poisson brackets, which is induced from the deformation introduced by Fedian Oldesky by elliptical algebras and independently by Polishczak. Let me start with the introduction. So thank you on the desk. So speaking on Odyssey, I introduced a family of algebras in 1989, which is called elliptic algebra and denoted by Q and K e Î·. I won't give you the precise definition because it's kind of complicated and I don't need it in this talk. Needed in this talk. But just for the reminder, let me explain about these parameters. What are these? N and K are integers, co-prime integers, positive integers, which are co-prime. And E is an elliptic curve. And era is a point in E. In this circle, a point always means a closed point. And as I said, I won't give you the precise definition, but let me just say the number of generators and relations. The generators are indexed by z over n z, but just simply 0 to n minus 1. 0 to n minus 1. And it has temporal relations. Let's say R ij. I and J belongs to Z. And we regard this as a graded algebra by putting the degree 1, 1, or 1, and each degree of the relation. Degree of each relation is two. Of each relation is two. So, this is a quadratic algebras. So, this family of algebras has a significant properties from the viewpoint of non-commutative algebraic geometry, namely part of them are already mentioned, maybe, but most of the claim is written in the Feynman Odyssey paper, and the three-dimensional case is covered by Arsenite Founder. Is covered by our synthetic and berg and then Berke and some of the four-dimensional case is Deuteronomy Stafford and for general end case one case is Kate Vandenberg and some of them are due to our And some of them are due to ours. Anyway, first property is that this family is a deformation of the usual polynomial ring, namely the Q and K of E zero when error is zero with respect to the fixed addition structure. Then this is precisely equal to the usual polynomial ring with n variables. Oh, yes. Actually, the real notation should be E is replaced by some tau, and we define E to be the P divided by Z plus V tau. So we are fixing that. Could you say that? Could you say that again? Eta is in neutral element, otherwise, data doesn't give you all. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So we picked a group structure only. We need to exclude, but zero is a torsion point. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. For other in the torsion points, these are a twist of polynomial rings. And actually, it's a good point because we have to slightly define the algebra in a different way when eta is a total point. When area is a torsion point. Thank you. And the second property is that it has the same Hilbert series as the usual polynomial ring in most cases. So the Hilbert series of QNKE Ada is the same as Is the same as the Hubert series of the polynomial in with any variable. But this is not confirmed for all cases, but most cases, namely when page one but for all eta For all eta or k is arbitrary, but for restricted eta, eta is not a potion point. Let's call this condition star. And also, it has nice homological properties as well, namely Qn1 or QnKE8 is a causal algebra and a global dimension n for the same for the same condition. Condition and finite these are AS irregular. You see, Q and K E eta are n-dimensional AS regular. But again, for most cases, in this case. In this case, either k is one and arbitrary eta, or or arbitrary k but all but fine, all but countably many era, so very general era. Indeed, there are countably many torsion points. So in this case, this area is also all but countably many points. But the difference is that in this case, we don't know which points are bad. So that this is a kind of weaker result than this Kazu thing and Hubert series thing. And here by servicing. Oh, sorry, I forgot to mention that. This is based on the joint work with Alex Girl Basito and Paul Smith. So, okay, these familiar algebras are very nice and Very nice, and we have almost a flat deformation, so we can consider the induced possible structure. In a rough language, we have a family of algebras, and we fix E and N and K and let eta vary. And this is again deformation. Or the moto-fractional formation of the polynomial ring. Therefore, it induces a Poisson bracket on Q and K E zero. And now, this is, of course, the polynomial ring has a Has a Poisson structure because it's a Poisson algebra. Namely, it has a bracket. And everything here is graded, I mean homogeneous. So it induces a Poisson structure to the projective space corresponding to the Q and K0 approach. And this is, of course, since it is just a polynomial ring, this is just usual Pn minus one. And this becomes a Poisson manifold. And as many of you know, the Poisson manifold is a generalization of a simplexic manifold. And every Poisson manifold has a canonical decomposition into simplexic manifold, which is called simplexic poliation. And each of the components will be called simplexic leaf. Timplectric leaks. So the now in this case, Pn minus one with the induced portal structure has a decomposition into something called symplectic leaks. And each of them are simple electric manifold and And almost by definition, it is of even dimension. And the aim of our project is to describe these simplex leaves in a completely or explicitly. But now we have to assume that let's Let's k is equal to one. That's the case we have completed. And in this case, the Poisson bracket induced by the family of elliptic algebras coincides with other Poisson brackets introduced by Polishczak in 1998. So this is here the remark. Here's a remark so that oh, I didn't mention what is that notation. Oh, okay. This is a Poisson manifold. And let's write the Poisson structure as a big pi or Q N Ke. Now it's independent from eta. And this Q N Ke, namely Fey Giant Modesky, possible. namely Feyking Odesky Poisson bracket is equal to other Poisson bracket defined by Polishak in 1998 and surprising thing is that his definition does not use the complicated relations of the Feykmodescu algebras so that's our So that's a remarkable result. And this equality was shown by Puan Polshak quite recently in 2018. Okay, good one. Yes, yes. I'm sorry. Yeah, I they could. I'm sorry. Yeah, I declared here, but uh it's always explicit. Yes. So now let me write down the aim of this talk again. Well, they describe the symplectically. Simplexical leaf or this QN1E and how to describe it in terms of secant varieties. Okay, this is the aim of my talk. And this conference gathers many people from various fields. So some of you are not quite familiar with the notion of symplectic geometry. And actually, I am one of those people. And but don't worry about it. There's a way to interpret these homologs as simplectric leaves into a very elementary lung. Into a very elementary language of extensions of modules, which is not a very new idea. It's already in the Pedium Odyssey's paper. And just to distinguish them from the usual simple critical leaves, I want to denote it by homological leaves. Oh, that's it. Again, n not again, but now n is same n as before, essentially, but now we assume that it's at least free. And let E be an elliptic curve, and I always work over C as before. As a V4 and L the degree, let L be the degree N invertible shift, namely line but no on E and And that's basically the all data we need. We can even take the main theorem with only from this data. But later, for convenience, we will fix the group structure 1E. But anyway. All right. Then now this invertible sheaf has a degree at least three. So this is a very ample divisor. Sorry, very ample line bundle. So we can embed this elliptic curve into the projective space as usual. So this is the H0, EL, the set of global sections, and take the dual, vector space dual, and take the projectivization of it. This is a quite well-known construction. And in this case, the dimension of the space of global section is exactly. Space of global section is exactly n. So this will be p n minus one. And now I want to use self-eleg here. Then this becomes the P of X one of L O O is OE, the structure shift. And the And by the projectivization, I just mean that the x to one group subtracted, just remove the origin and divide it by this usual project validation. And let me give show you our small proposition. Show your small proposition, very small observation. The set Px1 of LO is equal to, as you know, the X1 consists of equivalence classes of extensions, but now this corresponds to non-split because we have removed the zero. Non-split exact sequences of the form zero to O to some E to To some e to L to O as zero. If we divide it by equivalence, then it is the usual x to one except no split. But now we have to divide it by the scalar multiplication two, but it turns out this is just an isomorphism isomorphic of the extensions. Here, two extensions are called isomorphic. This is one extension, and we have another extension. It might be different. And we say that these two extensions are isomorphic if there are isomorphism here, which makes this diagram commute. And why is this the case? Very short proof. It's quite a simple thing. Proof. It's quite a simple thing. It's because the endomorphism is very small. Endomorphism L is equal to C, and endomorphism ring of the structure shift is also C, because both are line bundles. Therefore, this isomorphism and this isomorphism are just scalar multiplication. So it can be absorbed into this scalar multiplication. And therefore, multiplication and therefore we can up to sorry up to scalar multiplication we can assume that this is the equality this is equality which is the usual definition of equivalence of extensions therefore this result Now let me define the homological leaves. Construct GX1 from LO and take an element of it, which is represented by a short exact sequence. And let's consider what if just take this isomorphism class of E and forget other morphisms, forget the data of other morphisms, then you can define it defines a map from the PX1 to the set of bundles, certain bundles, which is by definition. Certain bundles, which is by definition rank two locally three shields such that the determinant E is isomorphic to the given line bundle L. It's not difficult. It's not difficult to see that this Jamiro term always satisfies this condition. And let's write this map at small m. Now for each For each isomorphism classes of bundles to E to L and define L of E, L stands for leaf, to be the fiber of the map we constructed at the given isomorphism class. So namely, this is a set of This is a set of extensions again. But the difference is now we fix E, so we can choose some morphism, but the middle term is always fixed. Then, an obvious thing is that Ex1 of L. Of L O is a disjoint union, set theoretic disjoint union of L E is where E belongs to all bundles. Oh, sorry, E is a bundle. And as I said, Pxy is just Pn minus one. So this gives the decomposition of the projective space. And it turns out this is equal to the This is equal to the syncretic leaves for taking out the C brackets. So the theorem. This is already claimed by Afeg and Loditsky, but now use essential use of the result by four and the police structure. And we gave a precise proof for that. So the simple act leaves for more Q and one E is equal to the set of L E's. The set of LE's. If we fix the line bundle L appropriately with respect to the definition of Peggy-O-Descal algebra, and I want to call this part anthropomologically. Oh, that's a good point. Actually, for most E, L is not empty. Only the case L E is not empty. Sorry, it's empty is if and only. Is empty is if and only if L is a direct sum of two line bundles, but let's say degree D1 or D1 degree D2 and maybe I should write it in this way for degree one just a moment let's Just moment less than zero or degree L2 less than zero. So for all indecomposable bundle, LE is not empty. And for decomposable bundles, if both degrees are at least one, then LE is not empty. Thank you. Now, okay, the next section is the main theorem description. Oh, yes, sorry, sorry about that. The terminal is yellow. Yes. Description of leap. Description of the by secant varieties. Now I want to fix a group structure on E, but just it's just for simplicity. We can even state the main theorem without a group structure, but we do this anyway, for simplicity. For simplicity, we fix a group structure, namely addition on E. We can choose it arbitrarily, but for simplicity, we assume that the line bundle L is isomorphic to the line bundle corresponding to the dividers. Zero is the origin with respect to the group structure, and take n times of that. It's always possible, but anyway, we will fix one of them. Now, let's recall the definition of pickant varieties or higher secant varieties and the partial higher secant varieties. And first, use your secant varieties. Speaking no, higher secant. Anyway, let x1 to xd be close points of E. Then denote by x1 to xd overline to be the smallest linear subspace L inside. L inside P n minus one, and such that the scheme theoretical intersection with E is equal to the given points x1 to xt counted with multiplicity. This one this is the structure shape OE. OE E is a scheme, so it has a structure shape. Structure ship, yes, structure sheep. Ruxia shift, yes, production sheet. E is an elliptic curve. Sorry, static lay. Now, just a moment. Yeah, we did that. Yes, yes. We embedded E into the projective space by using the fixed line bundle L. Yes. It's in the setup. Oh, they might coincide. Yes, thank you. Actually, I will give you the picture of that case soon. And anyway, this space, HubSpace, is called the D secant. called the desiccant desiccant 2e it's embedded let me write a picture so if so this is e inside p n minus one and if we take different points then it is just usual line and if Line, and if two points are the same, then it will be the embedded tangent line. Oh, yeah. You know, I mean, the scheme theoretic intersection is this one counted with multiplicity. But yeah, as you said, yes. And this is the case of D is equal to 2, and this is perhaps the usual secant. And if we take, for example, three points, three different points, three general points from E, then it will be secant plane. We have to take a word, but actually. But actually, this definition, I think this definition is precise. So some plane tangent to the yeah, I don't know how to describe in the short term.  Perhaps I can't answer properly right now, so let me skip and let's discuss maybe later. And the definition of a secant variety is a union of these things. So the E is a union of all DCX to E, which is, of course, inside the TN minus one. And it is And it is known that it is already closed. We don't have need to take the closure of it. And this is called the secant variety or higher secant variety. And its dimension is well known. Dimension is the minimum of 2d minus. map of 2d minus 1 oh sorry 2d minus 1 and n minus 1 and but this is not actually enough to describe the simplexical homological leaves we need partial secant varieties so for x in e we define sec d x to e To E to be the union of again all these sequence, but of the form x1 to xd where using the addition of E, consider the x1 plus the sum of x1 to xd, and it is equal to the given point. To the given point of E. This is also a closed variety inside sorry, closed variety inside t n minus one. Now let me state the main result. Oh, before that, one short notation. Denote by all I forgot one thing. Yes, a dimension. Dimension of the partial sequential variety is a minimum of 2d minus 2 and n minus 1. By the way, n minus 1 is the dimension of the ambient space, so it should be. Dimension of the ambient space, so it should the dimension should not exceed n minus one. So here's a short notation. So let omega be the set of two torsion points on E. Omega in E, such that simply two omega is zero. And on the elliptic curve, such point, there are precisely four points inside omega. Points inside omega. Now, here's the main use theorem. First case, when n is odd, in this case, first let r be the n minus one divided by the n minus 1. Be the n minus one divided by two. Then the homological leaves we wanted to classify are as follows. There are two kinds of leaves. The first type is a partial secant variety, but divided by. Oh, usually I write E here, but I have to repeat many times, so I want to omit this E. And partial secant variety, but the lowest secant it removed. D minus one. It removed the minus one secant variety is removed from the issue. And this is where D is from 1 to L, sorry, 1 to R, and X is an arbitrary point. In this case, this dimension is 2d minus 2. Oh, yes, this minus the intersection of these two. Oh, just a moment. Oh, no. Given the minus one point, if we take the last point appropriately, the sum becomes x. So this is inside here. And there's one other one. It's the Pn minus one minus peak R, where R is fixed, so there's no parameters. And in this case, the dimension is equal to, of course, n minus one, and n minus one is equal to two r. is equal to 2r something wrong oh yeah it's 2r this is the odd case and the even case is a little a little more complicated when n is even then let r to be the n divided by 2 and the homologically with r. First, same time, same type as before, sig d comma x minus sig d minus one. And this is when d is When d is from one to r minus one, and x is an arbitrary point, or d is equal to r, but now x is not contained in omega, namely it's not two torsion points. And in this case, the dimension is again 2d minus 2d. And there are two other ones. The second one is the singular locus of sig r omega, which is excluded in the first case. And sorry, omega is an element of large omega. And we are omega. Where omega is new omega, and actually, we can describe it in an elementary way. Oh, omega is a two-total point, just four points. And this actually consists of the point C inside the sig r omega minus sig r minus one, such that the Such that that lies on uh infinitely many R secants. Yes, so of course, by definition of the partial secant variety, disk C is on at least one R secant, but now requiring that. But now requiring that there are infinitely many R secants. And this point lies on them. First in yeah in the old case oh yes. Oh, yes, yes. Now I'm talking about the even case. And okay, so this is the third one. And one other thing. And it's complemented, namely smooth locus. Of sick R omega, same thing. equal omega same thing minus uh oh sorry a singular locus of i have to exclude i'm sorry minus big r minus one and this is a smooth locust and again omega is in omega and it has a nice description Xi in sick R omega minus sig r minus one and the obvious thing is that it's a complement of this set so it should lies only on finitely many r secants but it turns out there are unique such secant that lies on a unique r secant And the dimension dimension is the dimension of this is n minus 4 and this is n minus 2. So this is the biggest, this has maximum dependence. So let's see some examples. By example, I just mean just put some, I call just some numbers in, just some small numbers in. An example, the case n is three. In this case, The case n is three, in this case, r is one, and the concept the elliptic curve is embedded into the projectable plane. And this is all the case, so there are only two kinds of leaves. The first one is a sig 1x minus sig 0, but now sick 1x is the one secant, which is just a point. This is just a point x. point x and the sig zero is just empty set so this is just a point um yes point where x is an arbitrary closed point this is a zero-dimensional leaf and the second one is a complement to that p2 minus e so the picture is like this we have a projective plane p2 we have an elliptic curve here We have an elliptic curve here, and the symplectric leaves are points on the elliptic curve and all other areas. Let's see the case NIS4, which is the most most, which is a very interesting case. When n is a When n is a whole, it is the even case. So R is the two. And now E is embedded into P3 as a complete intersection. And now we have to consider zero secant, one secant, and two secant. And zero secant is empty set. One second is just a point. And what is two secant here? I mean, partial two secant. Take two x. Take two x in E is precisely the quadratics containing E. But different X might define the same quadric, might define the same subset. So seek. So sig to x is equal to sig2y if and only if y is equal to minus x with respect to the addition in the elliptic curve. And these quadrics are mostly non-singular, but sig 2x is singular if and only if x belongs to e, sorry, x belongs to. x belongs to omega. So there are four singular quadrics, and each singular quadric has just one singular point. Each sig to omega has a unique singular point. Then we can define the leaves. So we can describe the leaves. Molecular leaves are. First, zero-dimensional is just a point on E. It is zero-dimensional. And the second one is to take two x minus e, where x is now not all points, but Not all points, but points minus omega. And as I said, there are different points that define the same sequence variety. So we can divide it by plus minus. And the third, by the way, this is two-dimensional. And the third, finger-a-point. And the third, finger points of sig to omega. And there are four such things. This is again zero-dimensional. And finally, sick to omega minus E minus the singular point, namely the smooth locus. The smooth locus, therefore, any singular point, just one singular point, and this is the remaining two-dimensional leaf. And this picture is. This picture, especially the zero-dimensional leaves, remind us of the point module structure, point modules over elliptic algebras. So let's recall the theorem. The point scheme for Qn1 over E eta for genetic eta. Is equal to basically E, but there's one exception in four-dimensional. First, this it becomes E when n is three or n is at least five, namely n is not equal to four, and if n is four, we have four additional points outside E. Outside E. And the first one is due to Smith. I mean, Paul Smith. And the second one is the reversal Smith in 1993. And actually, they already described these points, four points are, and it's exactly the same. And it's exactly the same as our four points appeared as a singular point. So the observation here is that this point scheme is precisely the zero-dimensional simple activities. For Q and My Q and Y E Oh no, I defined the point scheme as the set of point modules. Sorry about that. Yes, thank you for commenting. And this is actually This is actually perhaps widely expected by the experts, I guess. Whenever we have a nice, whatever nice means, but nice deformation, it is expected that the induced personal structure, consider the induced personal structure, and their zero-dimensional symplectic leaves give point modules. And our result is one of the confirmations of that. That's all. Thank you very much. That's all. Thank you very much.
