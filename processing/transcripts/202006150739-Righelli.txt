Focused on offering a software structure for analyzing this kind of data. So we started from the single cell experiment class, which is part of the Bioconductor project. For the ones who don't know the Bioconductor project, it is based on our statistical language and offers the main idea is to offer many. To offer main infrastructure for analyzing biological data, so offering data structures, softwares, and databases, and other kind of stuff. The single-cell experiment has attributes and methods for any kind of single-cell data. It's taught in this way. And it is organized in three main parts. So the assays collect the counts of our experiments. So where on the rows there are the features such as the genes, while on the columns we have the cells. And with the row data, we can access some additional metadata of the features, while with call data, While with cold data, there are some other metadata associated to the cells. Through the reduced DIMS methods, we can access to some reduced DIM dimension reductions representation of our data. So starting from this class, we specialize the spatial experiment class, which generates all the All the attributes and the methods of the single-cell experiments, and specifying some attributes for the spatial coordinates and the methods for getting and setting these attributes mostly. We are working on some other methodologies, such as the C bind and some other visualization methods. So, first of all, So, first of all, to show how to use this class, we made a workflow by using the Zetfish data. So this data set provided by this workshop, which, as you know, has a part based on the SAFICH and another part based on single-cell RNA-seq. So we show how to install the package, load the data inside the single-cell RNA-seq, and then how to load the data, the Z fish inside the spatial experiment class. But this was the first part. Now we improved this part by collaborating with some other labs, and I'll show you later with a live demo some improvements that we made about this. Improvements that we made about this. Not part of this workshop, but we specialize the special experiment class with the Vesium experiment class in order to store and handle the 10x genomics Vesium spatial gene expression data. And where because the vision experiment experiment has some other attributes. Attributes related to this particular kind of data. And also, in this case, we developed some other methods for these other attributes. So then we started this collaboration with the Baldron's lab, where Marcel Ramos was developing this ExperimentAub package, which name is single-cell multimodal. Single cell multimodal. So Marcel made a very good work by already providing the single cell NMTC data provided by the hackathon of this workshop. And I collaborated by uploading and providing the sex fish data set inside this experimental package. The main idea is. The main idea is to provide one function for each technology. So, for example, for downloading the single-cell NMT-seq data, you use the SCNMT function. And with the data type argument, you can select the specific data set that you want to download. So, for example, with the secfish, we can use the mouse visual cortex data type argument. Text data type argument. And each of these functions gives us output a multi-assay experiment object, which is organized as the figure here on the left part. So this particular class collects multiple experiments inside the assays part and provides some. And provide some other functionalities to access common information about the experiments. So, this is an open project, so anyone can collaborate to this project. And there are several functions and also the guidelines that Marcel wrote to make this process very easy to do. So then I prepared So then I prepared a demo. I try to show you the demo by running the. Can you see the RStudio instead of okay, perfect? So first of all, you need to install these two packages. So the first one is the spatial experiment, and the second one is the single-celled multi-model. I will not install it because it's time-demanding, but I just go on the load part of the classes. Of the classes. Of course, you need to load also the multi-assay experiment. And then to access the secfish data, you just run the secfish by specifying the data type argument. So by specifying the dry run equal true, you just asking for the, of course, why not? Okay. You just ask. Okay, you're just asking for the data that are present for this particular data type. So you can specify with the asterisk you download the entire data set. Otherwise, you can specify one single mode for the dataset. So when you want to download the data, you just dry run equal faults here and obtain this as output to the multi-assay experiment. As output to the multi-assay experiment. So it's downloading, of course, the data. It's not so doesn't require too much time. So in the end, we obtain this multi-assay experiment object of two elements. So the set fish and the single cell RNA-seq, and also the operation that can be executed on this particular class. By using the By using the experiments function, you can see the list of the experiments available. So we have the SEC fish and the single-cell RNA-seq. And by using the row names, you obtain the row names for both the data sets, the sample names gives you an overview of the View of the columns, so the cells that are present in the sec fish and in the single-cell RNA-seq data. So we don't have particular call names in this case, so we have just the indexes here. Then we can access each of the object. As you can see, even the single-cell experiment and the spatial experiment are very easily Designed for working with the multi-assay experiment. So I just collected both the single-cell experiment and the secfish, the special experiment inside the multi-assay experiment. So we still have all the functionalities of these two classes when working with the multi-assay experiment. If we want to reach the assays, so the count matrix, we can The count matrix, we can use also the assay on the multi-assay experiment here. Or the same, we can do it on the sec fish. Or we can, and then by using, by working on the spatial experiment, we can access the spatial coordinates here. Here is just a getter of the spatial coordinates, or we can. Of the spatial coordinates, or we can set it with some other spatial coordinates in this other way. Here, I just specified just some fake coordinates by copying and pasting the x column on the y column just to illustrate the functionality. And here is just to have the names of the column names here. We have this irrelevant column because I didn't underst what's this column about. So, maybe we can someone. About, so maybe we can someone can answer this question for me. And finally, I want to close my presentation just to say that we started this Journa Club with the device lab, leaded by Kelly Eckenrood. We meet every Monday on Zoom. We just selected some articles. Selected some articles on single-cell multimodal technologies or methodologies in general. But anyone can access to the journal club by commenting any kind of article he wants. And any communication is given on the Bioconductor Slack in the Education and Training channel. And here is a link with some other. And here is a link with some other information. So, when I will share the presentation later somewhere, so you can access the links. And from this journal club, we are working on this review for the single-cell multimodal. And it wants to be a review on the data sets, methodologies, data structure, packages, or Packages or tools in general for this kind of data analysis. Also, in this case, leaded by Kelly Eckenrut. And some acknowledgements to David L Devi and Marcel for the package and the help he gave me for working with this package and Kelly for the Juno Club and For the journal club and the review, and all of you for your attention. So if you have any questions. Wonderful. Thank you so much. That was great. Yeah, Kiman expressed, and I agree, it's exciting to see the data sets for the hackathon really helping to inform some new packages. So that's great. So, Ruben drives. So, Ruben Dreis asked: Would it be possible to create a generic spatial object that are applicable to all types of spatial data sets? I'm sorry. What? Can you repeat? Sorry. Is it possible to create a generic spatial object that's applicable to all types of spatial data? Oh, I think that it can be possible, of course. But maybe specializing is better because, of course, when you have some specific technologies, you can access. So if you have a main class, you can inherit some specific methods or attributes for that class by maintaining the previous methods and attributes of the main class. So I think. Class. So I think that it's better to specialize when you have multiple technologies because each technology can have different issues to account for. And Ambriet wanted to know, does this package work on R 4.0? Yeah, for now, yes. Are there other questions? Adine wants to know: is the package working with delayed array? Delayed array? Yeah, it can work with delayed array. We just addressed this a few days ago because we had some issues, but it can work with them. Great. Other questions? Sheila asked, at the moment, are the coordinates just single points, or are you thinking about incorporating polygon vertices? Yeah, yeah, we were. Yeah, yeah, we we were uh we were uh w we talk uh a lot about it because there are s several uh ways of uh uh of doing this. For now, we just we there are just single points, but sure we want to to put some polygons or centroids or some other ways for doing this, so we can also do both. But by the way, we But by the way, we are just at the starting point of this. So, yeah, of course, it's a good thinking. Yeah, Sheila said you should reach out to her. So I'll put you guys in touch or reach out on Slack. Okay, sure, sure. So Alexis asks, Alex says, does it integrate methods to run exploratory data analysis, their basic analyses in your software or in your infrastructure? For now, the methods are just. For now the methods are just exploratory, but of course the idea is to provide a tool for anyone to develop his own methods or methodologies or analysis by starting from this. So we developed the tool, anyone can use it, such as for the single-cell experiment, and by providing novel methodologies by using it. Using it and extending this specific loss. Great. Sounds good. Any further questions? Okay, if not, we have a 20-minute break now, but please, everyone, keep this conversation going on Slack.
