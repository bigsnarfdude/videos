So this this doesn't give me a number, but it shows that their theorem applies, it's just notable. Yeah, but another theorem applies that it can't just, but it still shows that this gives us no. Okay, so let's start again. The next speaker is Nick Grady from University of California of Latin Cruz, who talks about sofas and other machines outfaces. Great, thanks for the invitation. And yeah, so we'll be talking about this. And so, you know, kind of the last part of the talk, we're going to be considering some really specific groups, but I kind of want to contextualize it in the bigger questions I'm interested in, which is kind of just understanding linear groups, maybe understanding subgroups of linear groups. And so I'm going to just start with a big question that I have that's kind of directing my research lately. Lately. And so we'll start with K, a number field, and then G, a simple algebraic group defined over K. And so basically, I know of exactly three ways you can construct subgroups of G of K. And so we'll call a subgroup algebraic. Basically, if it's not Zriski death, there's some Q polynomials that the group satisfies. Satisfies. Okay, and so what I'm saying is that we'll restrict scalars to Q, and then if there's a proper algebraic subgroup H, so that you're contained in H, we'll call that algebraic. And then we'll call this subgroup geometric. Basically, if we can put some metric on that number field K and take a completion Kv so that they're discrete with respect to that metric. And then the third place. And then the third flavor is the arithmetic subgroups. And so that just means they're commensurable to G of A, where A is some subring of K. And so then my conjecture is that every subgroup of G of K comes in one of these forms. Yeah. And so, okay, we're going to see what this means in this particular case. In this particular case, where our algebraic group is PGL2. So just 2 by 2 matrices with rational entries. And so what does it mean to be an algebraic subgroup? And I just kind of want to mention that all of these are pretty well understood. You can have strictly upper triangular matrices, and that's just a copy of Q with addition. You can get these diagonal matrices, which projectively, we can always make. Projectively, we can always make this one a one, and then we just have a copy of q star. Yeah, and then we get sort of a Borel subgroup, which is going to be some solvable group. It's just of that form. Or we have like orthogonal type groups. And yeah, I mean, so the point is these are all pretty well understood in the case of 2x2 matrices. So then let's look at this next flavor. Let's look at this next flavor of the geometric subgroups. And so we really have two different types of completions of the rational numbers: the real numbers and then piadic numbers. And well, once we complete either the real numbers or the piadic numbers, there's some natural space that this group PGL2 of that field acts on. And in the Archimedean case, for the real numbers, that's just a hyperbolic plane. Hyperbolic plane, and for a pi-odic place, you get some commentarial object, a tree in this case. And so, well, if you're discrete in PGL2R, then you're virtually free or virtually a surface group. Well, if you're discrete in PGL2QP, that means you act properly on a locally finite tree, even. And so you're going to be virtually free. And hey, so these are the geometric. Okay, so these are the geometric ones. And so arithmetic subgroups. Well, we need to look at what are the subrings of the rational numbers. And these are all just, you know, sort of principle, right? They're just z-adjoint 1 over n, where n is some natural number, which we can take to be square free. And now this group, sort of geometrically, is a lattice in a product of a hyperbolic plane, and then a bunch of trees corresponding to it. And then a bunch of trees corresponding to the primes which get inverted at this ring. And so, well, you know, this conjecture says that, well, that would be all of the subgroups of PGL2Q. And so, I mean, let's kind of see in more detail what that means. For one, it's saying, well, if we have just an abstract surface group in QGL2Q. Group than PGL2Q, then, well, it's automatically going to be a Fouxian group, right? Because we don't have surface groups in the first or third cases. And, well, the second case says you have to be discrete in the completion, and there's only that one completion when we don't have any sort of Gala options around. And so, I mean, this is to emphasize that you can construct dense surface groups in PSL2R, but I don't know of a way to do it with just rational matrices. Rational matrices, and I'm conjecturing that you can't. And then maybe a stronger kind of conclusion that we can look from that list of groups we just listed is that every finitely generated Zariski-dense subgroup is finitely presented. And, well, in particular, since if we just have one prime inverted, we don't have any non-violent. Have any non-finally presented finally generated groups. And so it would say that this group is coherent, which is a question of scare. And so, yeah, while we're dreaming, I'll say that basically modulo one other kind of, you know, possibly very hard question concerning whether there's a discreteness algorithm in PSL2C when. PSL2C, when all your matrices are algebraic. It's known that there is no discreteness algorithm for PSL2C in general, but there's some hope that if you're restricted to algebraic matrices, we can check whether something generates a discrete, you know, a Kleinian. And if we can answer that, then the conjecture says that there is an algorithm that can input just a finite set of 2x2 matrices with. A finite set of 2x2 matrices with algebraic entries and output a presentation for your group. And yeah, it kind of uses the conjecture several times in doing this, but this is a kind of longer story that we're not going to focus on today. So we'll move to sort of non-positive character. And so this is actually something Talia mentioned this morning, which is that if you Morning, which is that if you have a finitely generated subgroup of PGLNQ bar, then you have a sort of canonical action on some finite dimensional Katzgar space. And so I'll go through sort of some of the details there. And so, yeah, I'm going to, this is kind of a non-standard terminology. I'll say that a number ring is a finitely generated subring of Q-bar. So a number field is a finitely generated. Bar, right? So a number field is a finitely generated subfield. And yeah, I'll point out that finally generated subrings of Q are principal and subfields of Q bar are principal. But these may not be. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna skip this. Okay, I mean, the idea is that we get we get actions on cats and spaces. We get actions on cat zero spaces. I started at 2.15, right? Yeah, yeah, I'm starting. Cool. Okay, so now I want to briefly talk about how we get these trees. So we start with Z adjoin 1 over T modulo Z, which we can think of this as all happening in the unit interval. We're just going to fit a little dot at all the 1 over T 0. At all the one over third, one over power of three kind of points. And I want to point out that we have a p to one map from this modulo z to this modulo one-third z, for example, which just truncates one term earlier. So we get this nice sort of picture of these p to one maps going up and up and up. And while when we have a system of sort of sets with p to one maps, we can just draw sort of the graph. We can just draw sort of the graph of all those maps. And we'll have these p mapping to that. And well, you get the structure of a p plus one regular tree. And so then you can put these coordinates on it, and you'll get an action by linear fractional transformations that really resembles that action of PSL2R on the upper half-space model of the hyperbolic tank. And so, okay. We can understand all this geometrically. And I want to be sure to get here. So, yeah, for right now, I'm going to take a surface group to mean anything that can be realized as a cool compact lattice in PSL2R. And so, you know, I'm going to allow some torsion. And let's look at this. And let's look at this particular orbifold here. And so its fundamental group is generated by A and B, and the commutator has ordered 2. And so that's this group here. And I want to observe that an element has order 2 in PSL2, if and only if it has trace 0. And so, well, we can think of these two generators, A and B, as, you know, we're going to. As you know, we're going to record their traces and then look at the trace of their product. And we're going to get this Markov type equation that tells you, that governs exactly whether the commutator of A and B has order 2 and trace D at all. And so, you know, using that sort of, yeah, using this, we can drew. We can prove that there's never a faithful representation of that group into TSL2 of the two addict integers. And in particular, we never have a map into TSL2z adjoin one over n when n is odd. Basically, we always need to invert two to get our representation of that group. And so basically, the proof is just a little observation about looking at what these things. About looking at what these things have to be mod2. So when we reduce mod2, which we can do as long as we're two integral, we get a PSL2F2, which is, well, it's an S3. It's a copy of the symmetric group on three things. And the only thing with order dividing 2 in that group is the identity. Wait, sorry. It's A3. PGL2F2s. PGL2F2 is Dusty. And so we know that the image of the commutator is the identity mod2, and then that implies that the trace has to be 2 mod 4, and in particular, not 0. And so, okay, I mean, what it's, yeah, what this motivates is this next question, which is that let's fix some positive integer g and take a surface of genus g, and we'll ask for which. G. And we'll ask for which primes p can we find a surface group of genus G inside that group. And so my guess is that this is always some finite set. And for example, for this first group we looked at, it's only two. We can only get a copy of this group in here when p is two. And my guess is a genus two surface will only fit in, can find it in two, three. And I can find it in 2, 3, 5, and 7, and that's all. The surfaces are orbitals because here, this question is just surfaces, but the guess is that, I mean, for orbit folds, you should still have finite size. And it's easier to kind of rule things out when you have torsion along these types of lines. And yeah, that's all I say. And yeah, that's all I said. Okay, and so now what I want to do first is show that these groups always have surface subgroups, and then we'll kind of speculate on how we can find lower bounds on genus. Okay, so what we're going to do is look at the gamma naught of 2p is going to be It's going to be two by two matrices in KSL2C, where the bottom left entry is divisible by 2p. Okay, so this is our gamma dot of 2p. And so it turns out that considering the action on F2 and Fp, the projective lines over those two things, we can calculate that the corresponding orbifold has four cusps. Has four cusps. So we get this four cusps orbo fold. And once we know how many cusps there are, we can also analyze how many code points there are, and then we can figure out the genus from there. And in fact, we can find particular representatives for the cusps so that when we take the product in the right order, and it took me probably 200 tries to find the right order and the right representatives of these tests so that I Representatives of these cusps so that I can do the next step. But once you find that, what we can do is cut these cusps like that and miraculously find this matrix that conjugates this one to that one. And now we glue these two boundary pieces together and we get some closed orbifold. And that's. So did you just find the matrix by Mathematica and And I don't know how to brute force it, but just a lot of tries. I mean, yeah, I mean, I was trying a lot of different types of things. I mean, yeah. Whittling down. Yeah, okay. So, um but there it is. But there it is. And yeah, so we can calculate the genus of that surface. And it's 4 of p plus 1 over 4. So I can find genus growing linearly with p. And I kind of suspect these are almost optimal. But, you know, are they? So. So let's think about this. So, okay. I mean, we're going to start by just looking at sort of this two-congruent subgroup here, which is a free group of one, two. And then we're going to take some odd prime and look at this matrix here. We'll observe that this T sub P conjugates this sort of upper triangular mod P. upper triangular mod T subgroup to this lower triangular mod P subgroup. And so this group gamma P is an H and I extension of this rank 2 free group by this rank P plus 2 free group that you find there. And so what this means is this cover of the modular surface, and no, I'm retracting onto a graph, it's covered by It's covered by this upper triangular and lower triangular subgroup in sort of two different ways. And this element T conjugates one subgroup to the other. So we get these two covers here that glue up onto this in those two different ways. And while we can find this sort of presentation complex for this group and And so, okay, here's here's kind of a a surface group in PSL2Z adjoin the third. And so if I take this element and this element, take the commutator and cube it, I get something that using these two relations, like this 3001 element conjugates this 2132 to the 2312. To the 2, 3, 1, 2. It's going to multiply the top right by 3 and divide the bottom left by 3. And well, this element has a word of 3. And so we have those two little tiles that we can use to fill this in and get this sort of surface here. And so, well, the idea is that if we have a surface group in TSL2Z joint a third, then we try to represent it by We try to represent it by an immersion to the surface, and then we pull back the cell complex, the cellulation, onto the surface. And then you want to try to show that the average vertex length has to be pretty large. Each vertex should have, on average, a lot of tiles around it, and then you can use a combinatorial Gaussian to get a lower bound for the surface. And so, I mean, the problem is that we have this. So, I mean, the problem is that we have this one-action out a cat zero space, which has non-positive curvature, but it's sort of not a combinatorial sort of space. And then, okay, we have this problem over there, and I'll end up with that. Are there fish jets? Could you say quickly, so you have this very nice surface, you cut you blue. Is there a reason why is that mapped then piled on the injected point? So you have this extra, you've got the amount of map in the HMX. Yeah, so it's actually Fuchsian at the real place. And so you actually are doing this very nicely, geometrically. More questions? Any questions? So, if your input is a finite set of matrices, how would you get the relations in the beginning about this? Yeah, so I mean, it's complicated. I use a lot of these algorithms. Okay, so you need to use an algorithm for computing sort of speech closures, which John Dahl, Dirksen, and one other home, I can't remember. And then a lot of the things from the Singapore conference, like you have to use. Conference, like you have to use every one of those algorithms. But it's a complicated algorithm with a lot of people's work. But yeah, we can talk. More questions? Let's think our speaker again. Start in four minutes.
