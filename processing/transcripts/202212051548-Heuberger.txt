I'm Diana, not Erana. Don't get confused, please. Um I'm gonna talk about well this is a very general sort of title. Uh its purpose is to so this is based on joint work with Tom Coates and Al Kaskrichik. An article that came out this year. And it's sort of an overarching article of various other papers. So I'm going to have to talk a little bit about results in other papers in order to talk about results in this article. So let's start with some sort of a menta statement, which is conjectural. Which is conjectural, which is the funnel under Gilbert correspondence, which goes like this. There is a correspondence between, let's say, yeah, I'm going to talk about threefolds, so I'm going to say that x is a dimension 3. Three terminal or before funo already. So fano means minus k x is ample. And these are just conditions to not make x, not let x be too singular. Be too singular. Okay? And in particular, I'm going to allow such an x to have at most cyclical quotient singularities of type 1 over r, one a minus a, where g c d so r and a are cofront. So R and A are co. Okay? So you guys, which is very unusual to me, know a lot of toric geometry. So you've encountered these kinds of cycling quotient similarities a lot. They're isolated points. It's not too bad. Okay? So these kind of varieties up to deformation. And I'm going to say that this is Hugh-Ornstein deformation. Q-Cornstein deformation, but I'm not going to give it precise Q-Gornstein. I'm not going to be too precise about what Q-Gornstein means, but again, since it's a formation, you expect a flat family, the recurrent statement of today. I want this family to have a terminal flat family. Have terminal fibers. Okay? So the correspondence is with, let me put an inverted comma special. There are polynomials three variables from this is the exit. This is X and this is N up to mutation. Okay. And yeah, this meta statement exists in general. And actually, so you can just replace this 3 with an N and it's more or less the same. I'm telling you this because I'm going to mostly give surfaces as examples. Mostly give surfaces and examples, even though I'm working for threefolds, so you know, don't get too surprised. What else did I want to say? Oh, yeah, there's a geometrical way to, so I'm going to say what special is in a minute, but there's a geometrical way to see this. So if you have f in a mutation crossing here, part of this special means that when you make the Newton polytope of F, Everybody knows what the Newton polytope of a Laurent polynomial is, hopefully. Okay. If you don't, just say so. It's like a one-line thing. Okay, so the Newton polytope of F is a final polytope, which for me means, gonna get very disorganized, but sorry. So, this means that. This means that 0 is in its strict interior, whoever this polyto is, and P has primitive vertices. Okay, then from this mutant polytope, what you do is create its space span. So unite every of its vertices with the origin, create a fan that way, and then we'll have the torque variety x. So this is not the torque variety that Sandra built. It's somehow dual to that. So I'm going to put, I'm not going to put xp here, but I'm going to put xp up here, just to hopefully get you less confused. I don't know. I don't know. So, this is X, capital B. Of course, all the notation in my notes is with lower P, so if I mess up, then please correct me. So, right, so we're still in this sort of area, and so this correspondence is in particular realized via a partial smoothing of xp into x. So, xp can be quite singular, definitely, it doesn't have to be. Definitely, it doesn't have to be terminal or overfold. It can have worse singularities, not necessarily isolated or anything like that. And the goal is somehow to smooth XP as much as possible onto X. Or conversely, to degenerate X until we get a toric degeneration into this toric object, X P. Okay. Yeah. Well, do I understand correctly that you have some sort of a conjectural algorithm? Some sort of a conjectural algorithm to go from left to right. That's what I'm going to discuss in this talk. So, what I wanted to say is that also is that this fact here implies that the Hilbert series is constant. So, in this family, so between x, p, and x, we have some sort of control on who these people are. Minus, sorry. R minus, sorry, multiples. So how many sections you have in multiples of this anti-canonical bundle? And this is constant in this family. So the goal is to exploit this correspondence in order to create as many x's as possible, in order to find as many final varieties that are as smooth as possible. Okay? Just to be. Okay? Just to be clear, the the k isn't on the it's on both sides somehow because it's constant for x x p and x. It's the same for x p and x throughout the family. But it may not be the anti-canonical or the canonical. Yeah, yeah, it's got to be the canonical. This is why she's requiring Q lore inside of deformations. So somehow they're they're deformations that preserve the property of the anti-canonical cyclinear multiples, the anti-canonical ring, basically. The anti-canonical ring, basically. Okay? The whole key. Okay. Where was I? Sure. So our goal is to find as many x's as possible, but before we need to discuss a bit the context and see what kind of our strategy should be here. Okay, so first let's say what the special means. So what does this mean? In addition to In addition to imposing this. So the answer to this is a bit of a mouthful. So it's a certain class of Laurent polynomials which is called rigid maximal immutable polynomials. Okay. Okay. So the very precise definit. So we have a series of articles that try to sort of exploit this in order to classify finite varieties. And we've done quite a bit of waltzing around what special should be. But the precise definition of what we want in order to obtain terminal orbifold appears in a recent article by Codes. Codes has it and P from 2021. I have to say also Alessio and I think Mate and Andrea have a sort of competing version of what this should mean, but only in for a fine Gordon Stein code. Colon. But okay, so let me motivate what we're trying to do. We're not fighting, we're still talking. Okay, so first, a bit about mutations. You guys probably know a lot about mutations, but let me say what I want in this context. So, okay, we're fixing a lattice. And I'm going to say that this is set to the n and it's dual. And it's dual, which I denote by M. So come, come, N, just said, this is the M in which the polytopes of Sandras talk lived in. Okay? Then you have to choose a W inside of this N person and H inside of H a polynomial, a Laurent polynomial. A polynomial, a Laurent polynomial, inside of this space, so omega-orthogonal intersection with n. Okay? So this omega-orthogonal intersection with n is a lattice. Again, you guys probably know a lot about this. So C of this lattice means that we simply identify monomials in this lattice with Laurent monomials. And this is where this lives. You put coefficients and you get. You put coefficients and you get h. Okay, so let's say that we have a running example for this. Okay, it's going to be a two-dimensional example because I'm very lazy. So you always have to see monomials in in N as Laurent monomials somehow. So and we're going to be thinking about things that sort of live here. Sort of live here, or we're going to be looking for polynomials that live here. So let's say, I think I'm going to leave this here for a while. So I'm going to draw up some points of this lattice. This x is its origin. And I'm going to choose w to be 0, 1. If I choose w to be 0, 1, this means that h is a polynomial. Is a polynomial in what n is a Laurent polynomial in x. Okay, x and x is a x. Okay, let's say I choose h to be 1 plus x to the 4. You'll see a bit later why. Okay, so w and h. So W and H defines an automorphism of this guy, which is rational fractions that look like that, which I dub this mu argumentation. Again, you've probably seen this going here. Here, and all I have to do is say what it does on a monomial. So mu of w h of x to the a y to the b, where a and b can be negative, is simply, so the same monomial times h to the power, sorry, h to the power h to the power omega coupled with ab okay I just gave it in two dimensions but of course it's easily it's easily generalizable so for our example here this is just x to the a y to the b 1 plus x to the 4 okay sorry Sorry. So again, 1 plus x to the 4b can a priori have so 4b can a priori be negative. So if you apply it to random things, you could get a rational function. And so that motivates the following definition. So Definition. So the Lorentz polynomial F is mutable with respect to WH if mu WHF is a Laurent polynomial as well. Okay? So An example here is f of xy equals 1 plus x to the 4 over x squared times y plus 1 over. Okay, if you expand this parenthesis, this is still a Laurent polynomial. This has only monomials as at This has only monomials as denominators. And if you want to see it in this lattice, all you have to do is say, okay, what are its coefficients? Because the points in this lattice represent its monomials. So all I have to do is write some numbers here. So the numbers are as follows. 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. 1, 4, 6, 4, 1. Okay? For one. Okay? So in particular, what I wrote here is a corresponds to a final polygon. Because if you remember, the two conditions that I gave for this to be a final polygon was: okay, the Newton polytope, which is this, contains the origin in its strict interior, and also has. Origin in its strict and clear and also has primitive vertices in the lattice. And this does have primitive vertices. Okay? So, right, what did I want to say? So, yeah, so Newton of F is this. And now, if I want to mutate it with respect to the W and H that we chose there. Well, okay. The mutation that I wrote, so remember, in case you didn't see it, it's this. y to the b times r plus x to the 4b. Okay? So this is nothing to monomials that just contain x. So it will just leave this as is. And now it will simply leave y and multiply it with 1 plus x to the 4b. But b here for y is 1, so it's just 4. And then you have 1 over y times 1 plus x to the 4 times minus 1 here. Minus one here. So we'll get this a priori. Okay? And so the question is: is f mutable with respect to this w and f? Well, the answer is yes, because this, once you expand, is simply 1 plus x to the 4 over x squared times y. Sorry, to the 8 here. And then plus, and this. And then plus, and this to the 4 goes away with this one. So you just have 1 over x squared y. Okay? And this is a Laurent polynomial. This factor just disappeared. Okay. You can draw the political what you've obtained. It's going to look like it's going to be like this long triangle with eight points here. Points here. Okay. And still you can track down the coefficients, which are these 17, 36, 18, 8, 1. Okay. Last time I'm computing that by hand. That way, and that's maybe I computed it wrong. I mean, A choose two is not AT. What is it? It doesn't. It doesn't really matter. Fine. Exactly, you got it. It's binomial. Sorry, can I ask if you can say variety is X P? Variety is XPE, X over is like a 20, yeah. It's like it. It's 28.70 or something. It would not be 36 because that's not smooth. 46 is by too large. I mean, it's 35. So that's too much. Oh, the embarrassment. Sometimes it's like D rubbing prime. But then, okay, fine. I don't care. So, to respond to Sandra's question, this is a singular dopetosurface of degree 2. In particular, because this mutation, so remember the guy we started from, which was this? This is a singular dope surface of degree 2. And by, I guess, what I'm going to say later, Going to say later, if these are mutation equivalent, you maintain the properties of my CK again. So, okay. So, first remark, I probably got the coefficients wrong, but okay. Second remark. The choice of W induces a stratification. A stratification on N. And then what we do here: so mutation translates to a deducibility condition. With respect to this stratification like a fan? No. So it's a weight stratification. So if you think about this, here, W was it 1, 0, 0, 1? I forget, 0, 1. So it induces a stratification sort of orthogonal to change. Orthogonal to 0, 1. So remember, here we are in N, so the dual lattice of where this lives. So this basically stratifies N into sort of orthogonal slices to that. So you can refer to this somehow as level 0, level 1, and level minus 1. And that's, first of all, that's all that concerns are up here. And then the only, when we mutated, the only sort of problematic level that appeared was Level that appeared was here. This is the only place where we could have gotten something that was not a Laurent polynomial. So somehow your only problem is check out what happens at the negative levels. Okay. And also that there is a sort of weaker way to formulate mutation. Purely in terms of the supporting polytopes. So of Newton of F, sorry, yeah, F and Newton of its mutations. Let's say that this is P and this is P prime. Okay, and then Nathan and 2012 showed that this has geometric meaning, so mutation I mean. At least just thinking about this at the political level. at the polytope level. So that there is a so Kew Gornstein pencil actually okay maybe Nason didn't say that it's Kugernstein but he definitely talked about the pencil. So over P1 such that Over zero, you have xp, and over infinity, you have xp prime. And Hugerstein is important for us in our interpretation, because again, you really need to control what happens to the anti-canonical even between these these two. Okay, so now everybody have more or less a picture in mind of what's going on. By Q corresponding fancy, you mean the vexes of Q Gorenstein. That's what it is, right? The dotted space is. Yeah, yeah. No, wait, I mean this is a Q-Gornstein deformation between Xp and XP prime, so there's a flat family, etc. Such that the such that minus k is the same. I don't know what to say about if the total family is Q-Bernstein. Is it? Do you know? Kubernetes thing. Is it? Do you know? It is. What is next? You actually showed that. No, Andrea did. There you go. But I knew it was true. I just didn't know it was important. Okay, Andrew's not watching this, so he can't really retaliate. No, he's not. He went to sleep. He's sick. He went to sleep. He's sick. So, again, if we're trying to think of what the deformation space of an X that we are looking for looks like, so one of those smoother funnels, it could have many irreducible components of various dimensions and it could look really weird and we don't know anything about it. And we don't know anything about it. But somehow it's good to vis I mean, it's good. You can visualize sort of the toric elements appearing, the toric varieties appearing sort of here at the intersection of various components. And these P1, these pencils sort of being a way to move between them. Okay. You really want a sub-index now? Oh, sorry. No, of course not. Thanks for that. Okay. Maybe there is another guy here. But not a ring car. Whatever. So you can see these mutations as a way to move between these sort of two singular guys. And your goal is to somehow hit something that is in the middle of one of these components. So hit this, which should be some sort of. So, hit this, which should be some sort of a general fiber in a way. And in a way, the general element will be less singular than the toric ones. So, that's the gist of what we're going to do. So, the idea is that you should fix a P, because this is like combinatorial data. You basically have access to various databases containing polytopes. Some of them are finite, so. Polytopes, some of them are finite, so you're happy. All of them are finite, they're databases. So you fix you fix a a polytope, and then the goal is to find F supported on E such that so supported means unpleasant overfit, such that F mutates as much as possible. Mutates as much as possible. Which is technically in the name, maximal immunable, but I erased it. So what you're doing is casting the widest net possible in one of these deformation components, so that you hope that you get X. But again, this is very handy. It doesn't really mean anything. Okay, so minimal requirement for So a minimal requirement for F to mutate as much as possible, is to have binomial edge coefficients. So binomial coefficients on the edges. If you can compute what binomial is, that's even better. But a computer can do it for you if you're lazy. Or maybe try. Maybe strong. Sorry? I got one of those coefficients from on top. Oh, well, you know. Then you understand me. Well, the final coefficients are only to visit it. Okay, so remember we had this guide which I shouldn't have erased. And what I just said means that in order for this to make sense, you fix, so this was our polynomial. I think a little bit. You fix these guys here and then also point these shorter. Okay. And then you have basically two coefficients that you still have to think about a little bit. And it turns out that if you choose random C1 and C2, C2. This polygon here admits A mutations roughly. Or like maximum ones, if you want to think about that. Okay. If you get a random C1, but you fix C2 to B8, you get 9 mutations. Which included these 8. If you fix C1 and C2 to be equal to 8, you get 10 mutations, which include these 9. So this is what I mean by maximally mutable. The polynomial that you have to choose now is this one. Okay? So in order to choose the one that mutates the most, you have to fix these equal to 0. So there's no coefficient corresponding to the concentration? No, because this is never going to interfere. So the origin is always going to be at level zero with respect to W. So it's never going to really you can put whatever you want there. We usually normalize it to zero, but you don't even have to do that. Okay. So there's a bunch of things that can happen. There's a bunch of things that can happen here. The first one is that there might be, so you're supposed to make sort of this mutation tree, and you're supposed to take the maximal people that are here. So first thing is there might be more than one maximum. And in this case, you have to consider all of them. Intuitively, each of these maxima would correspond to one separate irreducible component of this deformation space. So, if you want to sort of describe varieties of two deformation, but again, I remind you that I am posting. But again, I remind you that I imposed here that the... When you talk about X, that is, there are deformation equivalent, you impose that the fibers are terminal. These guys are usually not terminal. If they're terminal, they wouldn't be at the intersection of two components. So what I wanted to say is that necessarily if you have two different F's, you have or or three different F's or even ten, you have different components and you want to they are all mirrored to different polynomials, so you want to consider all of them. So, you want to consider all of them. Right? So, imposing these, this, imposing these conditions might not fix all coefficients. Oh, before I say this, maybe I'm going to say that this is kind of a I'm going to say that this is kind of a misleading example because for surfaces, there always is just one component. But for threefolds, this definitely doesn't work. Okay, imposing this might not fix all coefficients. Just like in the example that we actually worked out together, there was 0, 0, 0 here, and we could still sort of maximally mutate the lower segment out. And there was nothing that C1 or C2 could have done to prevent us from doing that. Okay? So you can imagine. Okay, so you could imagine a priori that it could happen that you just look for maximum people, but this doesn't impose you any conditions on C1 or C2. But you don't want that. So who don't want that? Yeah. These are not good. So we only so we call we call And such that all coefficients are fixed, rigid, hence the name. Okay. Um, this is not necessarily uh a deal breaker if you. A deal breaker if you relax the condition of how singular you want x to be. So there's a way to formulate this for like KLT varieties and whatever. But if you want to obtain terminal orbitals, then you have to do that. Okay, and I guess the third remark is that there exists such objects, so such polynomials on almost On almost every historic canonical panel variety. And this is upcoming work by Colts Whoops. I mean the same way it's from there. Passporting at the time. Is this in a specific dimension or in dimension? In dim in dimension three, sorry. In dim in dimension three, sorry. I'm I'm only talking uh I don't know three books. I think they're working on higher dimension as well, but this one, I mean, I think it's it just doesn't work on a couple of hundred cases, I guess. And there's like many, many toric canonical. It's like 600,000, so really almost there. Okay. So they have a code that for some reason just doesn't stop for certain cases and I think they're working on fixing it. Yeah, exactly. That's why they've been postponing putting up prevalent, yeah. Okay, so the goal again is to find So the goal again is to find x um but what happens so there's an algorithm going back to Alex's question from before to construct f from x in a specific format. So, the idea is now start from F and get to something that is sort of in that specific format. Let's see how we can do it. So let's see how we try to go about that. So if x is inside of another surgery variety y of higher dimension and And this inclusion is as a complete intersection. Plus conditions. There is the given televary buffer algorithm. For building hash. Okay, so let's see how we do that. So let's say that y is given by a quotient of c to the sixth by c star squared. So why is it ordinary? I'm just gonna give it as a Why is it originally? I'm just going to give it as a GIT quotient. So I just have to give you a matrix of the weight of the action of T squared on T6. With weight, let's say 0.001010010. This is just y, so the ambient space. I want x to be a complete intersection, so I need to specify line bundles. So x is a general section of C star squared linearized line models L1, homogeneity type 2, 0, and L2, of homogeneity type. And I'll do a homogeneous type of one. So if I'm in this context, this is called convex partition with basis. Let me explain. So this is a basis of Z2, obviously. And then I partitioned the rest of the And then I partitioned the rest of the columns of the C star square action into two blocks such that the sum of the weights on the blocks are going to be the homogeneity types of the line bundles that I take. Okay? It's fairly algorithm. Oh, by the way, we all know what this variety is. I just had to move around the columns so that I would get this specific format. But if you shift them back, But if you shift them back and you notice that these two C-star actions are completely independent with respect to one another, you get that y is just stability position, not y is stability. So now we can get two. So y is simply p3 cross p1. Okay, so nothing too fancy here. I'm just taking an intersection of two sections in here. Let me say Well, let me say who this is. Let me just give some names to these. So x0, x1, x2, and x3, and then y0, and I have 15 more minutes. A little bit more. Okay, if you have a five-five minutes. Okay, does everyone understand how I got this? Okay. Sorry, because I feel like I wanted it last for some reason. Okay, so in particular, since I'm cutting this down into two sections and this is a fourfold, x is again going to be a surface. This is all my examples are surfaces. But it's so that we can later see who it is. Okay. So a mirror to X is given by the following diagram. So see to the sorry, see star. C to the sorry C star to the sixth with I'm going to abuse notation here because this is the this is the torus that lives inside there so I'm going to abuse notation and say that the variables are here here are still excellent y so I'm going to give two maps here the first map is going to go to c star square and is simply going to be given by the weight matrix By the weight matrix. So a point here is going to go into a point in C star square given by the first action. So here I'm just going to have the product of everyone here. So x0, x1, x2, and x3. And as the second component, I'm going to second row of that weight matrix. So y. That weight matrix, so y0, y1. Okay, if I had any other positive number here, I wouldn't just put like a square or a cube or whatever. Okay, and then I get this w function, which is also called a superpotential by physicists, that takes this point, whatever it is, into just the sum of everybody, so sum of x. Sum of xi's plus the sum of the yj's. So, so far if you so now we're going to want to look at the fiber of this y person. The fiber over one one of pi is the merit of y. To y in order to compute the merit to x, we solve for so in order to compute the merit to x, you have to use l1 and l2. So, when I say the fiber over 1, 1, this means that you have to impose Over 1, 1, this means that you have to impose that x0, x1, x2, x3 equals 1, y0, y1 equal to 1. But also you need to use the blocks that you separated things in. So you need x1 plus x2 equal to 1. And y1 plus x3 equal to 1. So you look at this locus inside of C star. You look at this locus inside of C star to the sixth, you compute its image by W, you substitute a bunch of things, and then you obtain a change of variable, you substitute, and then you obtain N W to get a polynomial in two variables. Yeah. Two variables. Okay. Uh do I want to say how? I do not necessarily want to say how. I'm going to just tell you what the polynomial is. It's going to be, so you make a change of variables to whatever a and b and you're going to get that this is 2 plus 1 plus 2 plus 1 plus b plus 1 plus a squared times 1 plus b over a. So this guy is going to be our Laura polynomial. And if you do its Newton polytope in the letters, you In the letters given by NB, and this is the origin, you get this person. Okay, so this 2 is just a constant. 1 plus v is going to give you this segment. And then that product over there is going to give you this big rectangle. And then summing things up just means. And then summing things up just means taking the convex hull. So this is the person that you get. Okay, so what are we getting? No, it's just one plus b. Oh, sorry. Maybe I shouldn't have. Why is it going from the origin to 0, negative 1 then? The 1 plus b on the right gives you. The one plus B on the right gives you. Yeah, you're right, it's the nice. Right. Okay. So who is this person? But now this is not a bad thing. You mean you mean one plus? I'm sorry, sorry. Then I don't mean b to the negative one. Unplus B to the negative one. That would give you what you said. Um Have to try to do it or not. It's okay, if you believe it's almost correct. Sorry? We believe it's almost correct. Yeah, well. Yeah, but it's not very satisfactory. Anyway. Okay. So there is an algorithm that spits this out. And so the idea is to reverse it.  And produce a very complete intersection of reversing is called a round reversal. This way of reversing is called a run version. And it's a line of paper by coach Kaspachiki Prince 2015. And so the whole point is to try to do this deformation as an embedded deformation inside of the An embedded deformation inside of a larger torque variety. So that's the P3 cross P1 that we had in our example. So, okay, so you take F, you have this toric variety, you embed it into a larger toric variety, Y. This is, I mean, this is itself, so it's still very singular. Singular. And then using the coordinates in the Cox coordinates in y, again, like the x's and the y's that you had there. So use you build X as smooth as possible in this embedding. In this embedding. So this means that here you have an element that is simply given by a bunch of binomial equations because it's historic. And you simply add more monomials to those equations that are in the correct homogeneity type, so in the correct weights for L1 and L2. And you hope that what you get as the general sections of L1 and L2. As the general sections of L1 and L2 are terminal of the font. So this uses an auxiliary toric variety, smooth toric variety Z, which is usually of the same dimension as X for lower. So up to like 2015. Up to like 2015, this was very, very ambiguous. I mean, the choice of Z, for example, here it's clear once you already have the decomposition. The Z here should be P1 plus P1. So the variety whose normal plan will give you one of these blocks. It's kind of, I don't know, when I saw Sandra's talk, I kind of thought about the R's. But here, for example, you have a polynomial that represents just a NEF divisor on P1 plus P1 and not nef. On P1Quest P1 and not necessarily an animal one. But okay. So maybe I should have said here that this set of equations inside of C star 6 is called, this is the gibental Foreboff focus. And in the paper that we And in the paper that we just have with Al and Tom, we show that this is actually, this does have geometric meaning. So this is the fiber, so the general fiber in a partial convexification of Of the GHV focus. So we managed to interpret it somehow and to see it in, to see Z in this plane over there. Yeah, maybe something else I'd like to comment on is that this method, which I totally accept that I did not really describe here necessarily, I described it to Congress, but this has been used. But this has been used in two articles by Thomas Prince to construct a smooth funnel funnel with three volts. And I think his goal was to sort of try to generalize this to find smooth final four phones. But I guess what I wanted to say is that an efficient way to use this to its full potential to create as many varieties as possible is to new. is to mutate f as much as you can, which will give you different possible y's, which will give you different possible sortings. The difficulty in applying this is that you find an embedding, but you may not be able to smooth x as much as you want inside of this embedding. So the more possibilities for y that you have, the the better it is. So you basically need to know how to use a computer quite well. How to use a computer quite well. Okay, so this has also been used by me in 2022 again used to construct examples of the final three. The fan of three folds. So, like relaxing the smoothness condition and for the first time doing something in a singular setting. But still avoiding like orbital points, I guess. Uh right. I think yeah, I think that's all I have to say. I don't think I wanna go into like more detail.
