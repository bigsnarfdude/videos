Thank you for the introduction and thank you for inviting me and giving me the chance to talk. So I'm going to give a talk which is more on the physics side. So if you have any things, I can, any questions, please, please ask them while I go. And the content I'm presenting is from a series of papers, which I wrote in collaboration with Laksha Badvash. Sakura and Simon Right. I will not go too much into the details, and rather I will try to give an overarching idea of what this research is about and where it wants to go and where it's currently. And where it's currently at. And in the theme of this workshop, the objects that we're going to be interested in are some punctured remain surface, some go determined by genus G and punctures. So in this talk, I will mostly do what's called class S of type A. So I will fix some Lie algebra, which is SUN. My Higgs field is phi and we're interested in physics associated to solutions to some Hitchin system. So, as we already had in the discussion session, I think yesterday, Antoine very clearly explained that in physics you only start with some sort of energy functional. You want to minimize it and find the moduli space or the vacuum which organizes the moduli space. And at each point in the moduli space, you can talk about the theory at that point and physics. And physics, and we're now interested in certain physical properties of this theory. The geometric object which will be the most the key player is going to be the spectral curve. And so the the comic is a very good idea. The comic is, of course, something like this. We have our UV curve or the Coyote curve down here. We have some n-sheeted cover, which is the spectral curve or the cyber-Witten curve. And there can be punctures where the sheets of the cover. Diverge. So using M-theory or other methods, one can associate to this piece of data a four-dimensional n equals to supersymmetric quantum field theory. And we've had Coulomb branches, Nix branches. And in this case, so the Coulomb branches are parameterized by the Casimirs. Characterized by the Cozimiers of the Higgs field. So the physical question that we address is to ask, all right, I also want to say, so this year, maybe we would say NM5 brains. So the question that we want to ask is, so this is this is quantum field theory, it has certain symmetries, and the symmetries which are currently being heavily researched in the physics literature are generalized global symmetries. And for these, certain things called definition. And for these, certain things called defects and symmetry operators are relevant. And I will try to characterize them in terms of geometry and spectral covers in a bit. But for now, just let me write down the question. We want to know about the defect and symmetry operations of the quantum field theory and how we can derive them from. them from the static written curve. So this question for field theorists is interesting for multiple reasons. Let me motivate why this might be worth studying. The first reason is that if we were to If we were to determine these objects from the spectral curve, purely from the spectral curve, we would have some non-Lagrangian characterization. So, as we heard, oh, sorry, that's just that was not supposed to be. So, as we've heard multiple times, we can to narrowed multiple times we can to to queries for example you would associate some 3dn equals four theory and those are lagrangian but the the point here is that these uh these pieces of data include physical theories which are not lagrangian and the these ideas which emerge from from field theory would then kind of be struggled to apply and so you need a non-Lagrangian method to answer these questions in this in these kind of settings a second A second reason why physicists might be interested in this is that these class S setups admit very tractable deformations to less supersymmetry. So this is n equals two, and then we can go to n equals one or even n equals zero. And as we will see, these things are topological structures. And so one would hope that one can track them more easily through such deformations. And then n equals one physics in four dimensions has interesting phenomena such as confinement or other things. And these are precisely captured by these kinds of objects. And so on could get together. And so on could get together non-Lagrangian criteria for confinement. And then the n equals zero part is also very interesting because string theorists normally struggle to say a lot about compactifications which preserve no supersymmetry. A lot of things, well, most things are unprotected and there are lots of corrections and it's very hard to make concrete statements. And so the hope here would be that because these are very, let's say, low-lying structures, the top Let's say low-lying structures, the topological, that one could understand them during these deformations. But I'm not talking, I won't be talking too much about the physics side of this, but I just wanted to motivate it. And I also want to briefly motivate why it's a good time to ask this question now. And the reason that it's a good time is because. That's a good time because so the defect part, which is the part I'm going to review and then characterize via geometry and the spectral curve, that is fairly well understood. So one half of the coin is well developed, let's say. And then last summer, FIS understood how to do this. Do this for purely geometric settings. And so, this is then relevant because many FODN equals to super SQFTs, they admit a geometric dual picture where one could potentially apply these methods. One needs to understand things a bit better, but you can pull back the understanding. And so, it's also a very timely problem. Okay, so the outline. Okay, so the outline is, I want to, as I said, review the defect part. And this will involve some geometry. And this geometry is what I will say is called the type to be dual. And this then lines up some discussion for the symmetry operators, whatever these may be. And I will talk about them in the setting of geometric engineering. Okay. So we will keep the comic here. So this this this this this uh This pitration is something that physicists might understand as wrapping in firebrains. And so, the first thing I want to do is tell you what these defect operators are before one does the wrapping. Go in flat space. So let's put some physics words to it. Physics words to it. So we're going to be in something called M-theory, and all that we're going to mean is that M-theory has certain objects, M5 brains and M2 brains. And what we want to consider is a stack of M5s, and they're just on flat space. So here is my stack. So here is my stack And now there also exist M2 brains and M2 brains have the property that they can end on M5 brains. So this comic we could have an M2 brain which Come back, we could have an M2 brain which stretches between these two sheets here. And the alternative is that we could also have an M2 grain which attaches to one and then stretches off in the transverse direction to infinity. So, this is our M5 stack. These here are M2s. And on the six-dimensional volume of the M5s, we are sensitive to the M2 brains via their boundary on the M5 brains. Boundary on the five pairs. And so this will give us strings on this flat space. And if it's a finite interval, then we're going to get a dynamical string. And here we're going to get a non-dynamical string because the mass of these or the tension of these strings is proportional to the area. Is proportionate to the area that I've shaded here. And these objects here, the non-dynamical strings, are exactly the defects that we're interested in. A string sweeps out a surface, and so these are six-dimensional, they live in the six-dimensional plane. We live in the six-dimensional plane, six-dimensional surface defects. So, this is the situation in flat space. And the whole Hitchin system is understood as wrapping this system on some Riemann surface. And so, the goal is that we want to track Want to track the defects through the compactification. And we will take this step by step. And the first few steps will be very simple. But maybe I will wait, I will stop for questions in one second. So at this point, it's also useful to maybe give a different characterization of what I actually mean with this defect. So far, I've given you a very loose one. So far, I've given you a very loose one, right? I've told you there's some special plane in R11, and then there is, well, some semi-infinite sheet, and the boundary of that sheet is what I call the defect. But there is a dual description, by which I mean that it's supposed to produce the same physics and would then, and it's also then expected to have these same objects. So, let me tell you what the dual. So let me tell you what the dual description is. So it's not purely geometric. We put type 2B on this ADE singularity. And back to B string theory has different objects. It doesn't have M2 and M5 sprains, it has D-brains. An adverse print has d brains dp with p odd. And the relevant thing here is now that let's draw the picture. So we have the, let's say this is the ADE singularity. These are our vanishing curves. We can now have D3 brains wrapping the curves. So two directions will, so it's a D3 is a four-dimensional object. For everyone a curve, two dimensions remain over. For our blown a curve, two dimensions remain over, so it will give me something again, give me a string down in R1, five. If the D3 wraps the vanishing curves, it's going to correspond to the, it's going to give me a dynamical string, similar to the M2s here. And there's also a non-compact curve in here, which can be characterized by very simply by this homology class. Which is equal to Zn. And wrapping a D3 brain in there is going to correspond to this semi-infinite M2 brain. So in this geometric picture is fairly nice. We see some very basic features. We see that n copies of that cycle trivializes. And so And so, this is a little harder to see on the M2M5 frame picture. That means that if you take n copies of the semi-infinite one, it can detach and it's gone. So, defects at this coarse characterization, they form a group, Zn. This can be a patch. In the M2M5? Yeah. So, if you can ask the same question in other brain systems. You can ask the same question in other brain systems where you'd have like a fundamental string, and then you'd say there's some sort of baryon thing which forms. Okay, I'm not quite sure what to say about this in the M2M5 setup, but yeah. Yeah, so this is like one of the things. So geometrizing makes certain properties a lot more apparent. And also, clearly, here I could change to other kinds of ADE singularities. And well, I would need to. Well, I would need to do something up here too, which makes it more complicated. And for the E-types, for example, there really isn't an M-theory description. So in this sense, geometry is better. Okay, so let me briefly stop for questions here. Okay, Okay, so now we're going to put this onto a remote surface. And we're going to the simplest kind first. The simplest kind first. We're going to do a compactification without punctures. So we just put our M5s on this curve, CG, and right, on the M5 world volume we had strings as defects. As defects, and these strings can now wrap around cycles of the Riemann surface. And they're two-dimensional strings, so they will, they will, and what remains in space-time is then going to be just a line. So from this characterization, We see that we have now four-dimensional line defects. So, this gives me some 4DN equals to. And this has lines, which is the same as the case. Which will simply organize into this group. And so let me briefly say what these lines are in some simple settings. So if we have a four-dimensional Lagrangian theory, which you might have come across, it's a gauge theory. Then these lines will be Wolfson and the Twoft lines, as you might have seen them before. So, some holonomies of the gauge field and some holonomies of the dual gauge field. And here is a very simple, concrete example. If I take my surface just to be T2, then what I'm actually building is Vaudian equals 4. Four superangles and the lines are just two copies of Zn one associated with the A cycle of the T2 one with the B cycle and right you can you see the picture and if I were to replace the singularity by some other ADE group then well here we ADE group, then well, here we would simply feature the center of the simply connected, well, some sort of some different algebra. Then, there we would feature simply the centers of the different simply connected Lie groups. Yeah, can you have M2 that cannot point in the Riemann surface? So that would have the two that the surface would be all in four L? I don't think so. So what's the is it just because you don't want to do it or It or um so my argument would be something along the following lines. Um, imagine you actually have it first on a loop, and now you try to shrink the loop to a point. In some sense, what you're doing is you're going to be hitting points which are like oppositely oriented, and so that will cancel. So, that's that means you should be able to detach so like a point seems yeah, um, what I mean needs to. What I mean needs to, yeah. So you took that setup with the Z and O before you put the world vibrant view on the GSG curve. Yeah, the two groups are they come from sorry, here yeah, from the one cycles four and the three. The four and left A the four and the A. Oh, sorry, A and B. A and B, cycle A cycle and B cycle. That's all I want to say. So you would you would go into an S D L T frame where the A cycle is very short, then this becomes the Wilson line. And in a frame where the other cycle is very picky, it's the heavy thing. Defect is attached? No, the torsion part comes from. So, this is a little harder to see in the M5, but remember in the geometric picture, we saw that this guy is mapped to a D3 brain which wraps a torsion class. And it's this. Oh, so it's at infinity and looking back. Yeah, exactly. So, I mean, I can, the type to B geometry is here simply T2 times this guy. And the non-compact cycles in this geometry are. Non-compact cycles in this geometry are a compact by Kuinith, a compact cycle here and the non-compact cycle there. So for every compact cycle in the Riemann surface, I get a non-compact cycle in the full space, and putting a V3 brain on that is going to give me a defect. And because there's only one non-compact cycle in here, I can specify the non-compact cycle in here by cycles in there. So that's it corresponds to the thing you. Does it correspond to the thing you drew? Is it a homomorphic curve in the C21CN that passes through a sphere like you drew? Or is it something like the spheric? I didn't know. No, this is this would be some, this could be like a, yeah, it's a curve which passes through the origin and it's yeah. Okay, so you have one that can pass through each one of the P1s, right? That's why you have the origin group. I have okay. I have, okay. So the defects, right? I mean, so just here, I will have an I have a non-compact sheet. I could add a compact sheet to it. Right. So there's, that would be like passing. Exactly. That's why theory, it's equivalent to specifying on which M5 it terminates. No. No. Well, yeah, because if you have the thing at a compact sheet, now it terminates on the next. Compact sheet now, it terminates on the next in file. Um, so if I if I resolve the singularity, then my characterization would have been like this. So I'm actually modding out by the compact. So I didn't need to do that because I wasn't resolving. But if I were to resolve, then this would be the correct characterization of the cycles that are relevant for the defect group. And so I'm just saying that I'm modding out by complex titles. So I don't think that the okay. Sorry, that we get into it. Just purely in the text. Yeah. You have different classes of data biodiversity, one that can pass through each P1, right? They're an equivalent, but we are taking that into consideration. I am not taking their own equivalence into consideration. Ah, you consider them all. They give me the same singular homology group in the singular space, for example. It's simply a fact that the so okay, so the ADE singularity is a colon over its link. And I can get a non-compact cycle in the ADE singularity by taking a one cycle in the boundary and fibering it radially. Boundary fibering it radially inwards. And all I'm doing here is I'm taking the torsion of one cycle in the length space and fibring that radially inwards. The torsion nature gets preserved. And so that's why I get a Zn group there. I'm just saying there's a boundary. All I'm saying is there's a boundary for n copies of that cycle. Right. Like this part, the defect group for 60 SCFTs that Group for 60 SCFTs, that's something that Jonathan Michele did in 2015. If you like, that's the original reference, but this is how it goes. So just, yeah, we're not distinguishing real divisors, it's singular homology. I'm slightly confused, but because it has two different variables. And sometimes, like when you say defect, you want to be. You say defect, you want to be agnostic to dynamical stuff. That's why, in this, here I'm quotienting out by all complex curves because those are modulo all dynamical fields in a sense. And the difference that you're saying is there, I'm saying it's not relevant for defect considerations at this point. Okay, so over there we've put it very trivially on a curve without punctures, and now let's take the first example with punctures. So, very loosely, the Higgs field now is like this with some new potent object n. It has simple poles, it's like this and And what you can do is you can look at variants, so there's large tables of which regular punctures engineer which gauge theory. And then from like a gauge theory point of view, you can determine what your defects are. And you learn that, see, like on your curve and you've wrapped a line. On it, you can deform it across a puncture at no cost. So, this is Lagrangian examples. Regular punctures are transparent for defects. Effects. And in a moment, we will consider not regular punctures. And the upshot will be that the topological property of the spectral curve that we're actually interested in when we view how these lines interact with these punctures is how the sheets of the spectral cover braid as we approach the puncture. And because there are no branch cuts here, I have a simple post. Are no branch cuts here? I have a simple pull. There is, that's going to be the takeaway from later. There's no braiding, and so the line is not sensitive to regular punctures. Let's keep this. Okay. So the list of irregular punctures is well very complicated, but I want to motivate certain classes of irregular punctures. Certain classes of irregular punctures from string constructions, which you might have seen for various quivers, right? Quiver gauge theories can be engineered via deep brain systems. And so I'm going to explain another link between a brain system and a situation like there. So I'm going to motivate particular irregular. Particular irregular puncture. It's going to be the running example. And we're going to be in what's called type 2a. And the situation that we want to consider are D4 brains suspended between two NS5 brains. At the end of the day, what the streets are. What the string theorist does here is he will give you a prescription for how to map from this brain system to a spectral curve. Okay, so this is how the so the brains are, we will draw a comic in a second. Again, these are objects which have one dimension more than the number, and so that's why they extend and five respectively six. And the picture that one draws is. And the picture that one draws is the following. So we have the one NS5 brain here, the left one. Here's the right one. And then here are ND4 brains, which stretch between them. And characterizations like this are fairly nice because the methods of mapping these to some sort of spectral curve are Spectral curve are they generalize. So I can do some things like in this system, I can start rotating the NS5 brains against each other. This will break some supersymmetry, but I will get a more complicated sort of Kazanova-Hitchen system. But this brain setup is a nice way to parameterize these situations. Now, to map this brain setup to a Brain set up to a spectral curve, one lifts it to M-theory. And so this is some, there is a prescription for doing this. And I will not be too precise about it, but one adds a circle, which we're going to parametrize by a 10th coordinate. So we're now in 11 dimensions overall. We're going to introduce a new coordinate. Introduce a new coordinate t will be the exponential. I'm going to give this complex combination a name. And then this whole brain system is going to live to a single M5. So, in this sense, we're back to. So, in this sense, we're back to the M-theory setter that we started times some object sigma and this sigma is the Steyberg-Witten curve. And for this example here, modulo some constants, it takes this form where these are like the Causimirs parametrized by them and because at the very beginning we fixed the At the very beginning, we fixed the Lie outer by SU. We don't have the n minus one term, the trace is gone. And the claim is that this thing derives some from the spectral curve of some Higgs field. Now the point is that to recast it into this picture back here. What we have is that t is a coordinate on some p1. And the sheets, which are so we can hear the sheets are going to they diverge at t equals zero and t equals infinity. So we have punctures. Affinity. So we have punctures. And so the accurate coming from over there is that we now have this situation. We have a two-punctured sphere. So this sprain setup specifies HIP which has which is like this. And then if you look at this more closely, Look at this more closely, you'll see that we can characterize the Higgs field as follows. So, this is now giving the dominant part as one approaches one of the punctures, and this is the puncture t equals zero. Omega is a root of unity, so that's not too important. But the interesting thing is that, well, this is not some sort of regular puncture. We don't have just a simple pole, we have something which is a bit more complicated, not too complicated. Bit more complicated, not too complicated, and um, and right. And this is like one example: one can take lots of different brain systems over here and generate a full class of irregular punctures where one understands the physics quite well from that system. So, here we would have said the physicist associates to this a Fodenicus to superannuate theory with Lie algebra SUN. With Lie algebra SUN. And from these field theory considerations, we get these lines. There's a Wilson line and there's a Tuft line. We have two copies of Zn. So, what we learn now is that if we remember, we're trying to understand. Remember, we're trying to understand what happens with these defects. Is that there are two defects in this situation? And if the lines were again transparent to being deformed across punctures, there would be none on the sphere. And the situation which result which resolves it is that we actually have now these lines can go between punctures and they are sensitive to being deformed across them. So we are. Being deformed across them, so we also have a line going around here. Sorry, that was intact away. So there's the what you would do is, again, this is the same thing that we were discussing before. In brain constructions, this multiplicity is a bit harder to see, but I can tell you what the object is. Harder to see, but I can tell you what the objects are. So you would have a, you can have a semi-infinite fundamental string that's going to give you the Wilson line. And you can have a D2, which kind of stretches across and is going to be right, it's going to be a plane, and that's going to leave me one dimension down in four dimensions. That's going to be the Tuft line. Right. Right, right. This is the point, right? It's a bit we're doing this the generic class asterisk where we have something which is far more general than some Lagrangian formalism, but we can bootstrap the rules from Lagrangian examples. And one of the rules that I'm bootstrapping here is that these surface defects, which were surfaces on the M5s, I can. M5s, I can, if I wrap them on the punctured sphere, I can wrap them running between punctures and I can wrap them linking punctures if these punctures are irregular. Okay, let me explain this maybe a bit from a different perspective. So there's also a type 2b dual situation to this where I can ah, sorry, Andy, yeah. Couldn't you say that the line, the classification line details is zm plus z? Classification of line because it's zm plus zm. Yeah. Do you mean that like that's the classification of like the one-form symmetry charges of line? Yes. Okay. Yeah. Or in some geometric, I'm just counting cycles. I'm not doing something super highbrow. I will tell you in a moment what these cycles are in a type to be collabial geometry. But yes, that's all that's happening. Right. And then, okay, generally speaking, right, one can mess around and one can put any kind of wild pole that one wants to study. And there are some extra interesting things that can happen. And we will get there in a second. Okay, so at the very beginning, I took a little bit of a little bit of a little At the very beginning, I told you basically an M5 brain is dual to an ADE singularity. Now, when we've wrapped the M5 brains on here, they kind of spread out. They give us, right, there's a single M5 brain, which is an end-to-one cover of this curve. And I can now apply this duality again. So the type to be dual geometry that I end up with. Up with is going to be an ALE file with colour BL3. So I have some resolution. Roughly, right, the like distance between sheets is going to Is going to be mapped to like one of the curves in here. This is my colour beyond, and it's fibered over the cover is over this thing. So in this concrete example, I'm going to have a P1 with these two points removed. Now, right, as we were discussing over here, so As we were discussing over here, so in this purely geometric picture, what you want to do is you want to find some non-compact cycle and you want to wrap a brain on it because then that brain is going to give an object of infinite mass or tension, and that thing is going to be a defect. So what one wants to do is one wants to find non-compact cycles in this setup and and so and And so, and again, we will characterize them by here, this trick with the cross-section. So, if I'm at some sort of boundary and I find a cycle there, which then trivializes when I include into the bulk, in this process of trivialization, I'll be sweeping out a cycle in one-dimensional higher, which is the relevant for this construction. I'm saying all of this simply because I want to look at this boundary. And it's And it's, we kind of can see that where things run off to infinity are at punctures. It's not completely straightforward to model that. But one simple boundary model is, I can just, let's just look at the ALE vibration restricted to a circle which just goes around the puncture. So I'm not just the puncher, I'm making it a bit bigger, and then I'm looking at the boundary. Only and the point is that the monogramy of the Higgs field is not going to give me a monogramy on. If I go around, the curves in here are going to be interchanged. And so to every puncture, I can associate a monodromy map. I can associate a monogramy map, which is the, well, it goes from back to itself. And in particular, in terms of the some V algebra data, I have a monotony on the root system. In the class S picture, I have a little bit more because More because due to what the representations I've chosen, I can label the sheets of the spectra cover locally by weights, fundamental weights of the SUN algebra I picked in the beginning. So this in some sense is descends from this, anotomy on the weights, the weight lattice. So is it the threefold sequence of dualities that get into this threefold? All I'm saying is an M5 brain, right, a stack of M5 brains dualizes to C2 mod Z M. C2 mod ZM. One and five brain dualizes to TaupeNot. It's the C2 mod Z1, but with the non-trivial metric. Yeah, that would probably work, yeah. Yeah, all I want to say, so in a sense, right, so the you can, where these P1s intersect, roughly speaking, where the M5 brain used to be. And so all I'm doing is I'm replacing the covering by the, well, so I think this is correct. If I take the three zero. The three zero form and I integrate it over the P1, I'm going to get a local one form, and this is going to be the eigenvalue of the Hitcher system. And so this is in some sense, right? So stuff on here would be like an MNM2 brain running between the sheets is the same thing as a D3 brain wrapping one of the P1s. The different options is the threefold mirror that the whole C-Star vibration spectrum. Yeah, I'm not sure. So, yeah. So, for the consideration we're doing here, I really only care about the topological structure. So, I mean, it's great that it collapsed beyond it. I mean, it's great that it collaborates and that it preserves supersymmetry and everything, but for everything I'm going to compute, that's not necessary today. But yeah, I mean, there's also complaints that Bobby and others have raised about how rigorous this duel is. But I say, I'm doing nothing which relates. Look at nothing which relies on the things that people are unsure about. Okay. Okay. So I will tell you now I can construct my defect as follows. I can take the D3 brains and I can wrap them on non-complex three cycles whose boundary is in Y5. So, this is then going to be a two-cycle. And so, what I want to do is I want to compute the two cycles and this is given by the core kernel of this monodroma. And so, if I actually evaluate this for this example that we were just discussing, then I indeed get back Vn. So, I learned that there is, in some sense, there is one torsional two cycle that as I approach the puncture, one monotromy class of two cycles that as I approach the puncture that blows up. And using this class, I can. This class, I can construct a defect, and then this would be like the guy running across. And maybe here is a computational note. So generally speaking, what I will do is I will have some spectral polynomial that will depend on my variables t and v, t on the Riemann surface and v in the fiber. And I want to understand how the roots of this polynomial. Understand how the roots of this polynomial are permuted as I go around the puncture, whatever that puncture may be. And these things can be not straightforward looking at the polynomial, what the monogramy group on its roots is. But in all examples, and this were quite a few that we were interested in, you can just open up Mathematica, you put in the polynomial. You put in the polynomial, you n solve numerically, and there's a very nice manipulate environment where you can take the value t and you can literally drag it around your puncture. You get this nice comic of the roots permuting themselves. And this is completely sufficient to solve this problem for any given example. And this included terrible irregular punctures for E6 type. For E6 type theories, which that's a 56-degree, I think, polynomial. And so that all there works fine. And you can find long lists in the paper about what these matrices are. They look at these monograph matrices. They look quite arbitrary, but it always works out in the end. And it was a very satisfying computation. And then one thing that we also learned from looking at these Looking at these more complicated functions, is that we could get extra things here. There needn't only be one factor, there could be more. And I've labeled a T for both torsion and tract. And the point is that, okay, so there will be, there's normally one factor associated with lines that can run between irregular punctures. Lines that can run between irregular punctures, and these additional factors there, we understand them. Okay, first of all, they were Lagrangian examples where you can replicate it, so they are definitely a thing. And second of, and the interpretation is that there are lines in four dimension whose 6D support is purely at the puncture. So these are lines trapped at the puncture. And so this is something which is completely non-obvious from any kind of comic that. Kind of comic that one could draw like this. And then, okay, let me write this down. So, well, first of all, you can do the same thing for regular punctures. And you learn NP is one. Okay, so that recovers the old result. And then from the geometric approach, you learn that there's something like trapped lines at irregular punctures. Like trapped lines at irregular punctures. How many minutes do you say that? Five minutes. Okay. Let me briefly mention a different geometric cross-check. So, yeah, the line of punctures is wild. So, there are some interesting punctures which I will call isolated hypersurface type functions. These are labeled by Twitter. To integers b and k. And the interesting thing is that if you take these kinds of punctures and you put them on a CR, then this is going to engineer an S CFT for you. And there are certain scaling limits that one can take. And one also needs to do some cool branch tuning. So, right. So, right, so in all of these pictures, I've been focusing on the punctures, but they're also like branch cuts. And physically interesting things happen if you move branch cuts on top of each other, because at those points, some cycles shrink, and it can happen that physicists would say mutually non-local particles become massless. And this just leads to some very interesting dynamics. Okay, what I want to say. Okay, what I want to say is that, and right, so to reach these points of interest in the limits, you need to tune the branch points on top of each other, loosely speaking. So this is what I mean with these Coulomb branch tunings. And okay, so there's this class of punctures where if I do these two operations, then the same physics is engineered by some isolated hypersurface singularity. Uh right so I don't know we can this deleting part I can I can this works for a bunch of ADE singular ADE type Lie algebras and the matrix that I need to write here is depends on whatever I do and for example I can get some adherous Douglas type theories which would be denoted Douglas type theories, which would be denoted like this. This would be in dn and then punctures are mapped to objects like this. And I'm running out of time a bit, but what I was let me briefly sketch what I was planning to tell you if I had had enough time. So the point is that here again, we're in a very completely geometric setup. So the picture now is that I have some geometry. In some sense, because I'm In some sense, because I've scaled on the interesting physics, this is where the branch points meet. I've scaled the puncture to infinity, so the puncture is like in the boundary data of this Calabio three-fold core. And I play the same game. I try to find non-compact cycles in my Calabio core, and I can put my brains on there, it will give me the defects. And I do computations very similar to this to recover the. This is to recover the full set of defects. And the research that was done this summer, which I was referring to at the beginning, was so far I've only really told you one half of the story. I've told you what these heavy objects are, how I might want to characterize these in some class S setup, on some curve. How I might like to compute some very basic properties that they have. But so these objects are acted on by something called generalized global symmetries, and they fill representations for these symmetries. And an interesting question, generally speaking, is that Generally speaking, is that whenever I have some sort of string theory construction for a quantum field theory which has these defects in these symmetries operators, I would of course want to know to what objects do they lift, what's the string theory lift of a defect in a symmetry operator. And in these conical geometries with smooth boundaries, this was understood. Understood. And so, what one does here is one has an interesting prescription, which is you can find a cycle which purely lives in the boundary at asymptotic infinity of your geometry, and you can wrap a brain there. And this will engineer what's going to be a topological symmetry operator, which is the, let's say, the other half of this defect story. And the one open problem in this whole setup is that, okay, so when I have these conical geometries, I know exactly what to do. But even in this, it's gone now, this ALE fibrid space, the rules are not clear at all. But generally speaking, there should be a map from the solution to the Hitchin system, which specifies the vacuum or field theory, to To the symmetries of that field theory. And for the general class S considerations, this map isn't known. And okay, I think I will end here.
