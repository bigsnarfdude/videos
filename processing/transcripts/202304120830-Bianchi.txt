So, this talk I will fix F from C2 to C2 be a hen on map. I will not define it. And I will denote by fn just the composition of the functionself n times. Now, Now, we are going to see to study this system from a ergonomic point of view. So, as it was already introduced, this system admits a mu, which is a unique measure of maximum entropy. This is due to bed for unit. My, I will come back to the description of this measure later. So, the proposal we want to now is that we want to think of mu as just the support, the place where points are most. And in particular, we will fix a function g from six to para, or for what it will be enough, actually, from the support of mu to para, which is we will call it an. Which is, we will call it an observable. And so the goal is to understand the sequence S n of G, which is the sum G plus G compose F G compose F M minus one. Okay? Because this sums, the local sum. Now I made an Now I made a note, for example, this by G1 or the middle by GJ, which is G, now we want to see this sequence here, the sequence GJ, as a sequence of random variables, in particular with respect to this measure here. Now, the fact that mu is invariant is a Is essentially equivalent to the fact that each j have the same distribution. Now, on the other hand, since they come from a deterministic system, they are not independent. So, the first question is: what is that outclos for a geo-again regularity? This random variable here. These random variables here are close to be essential to them. Now, at the level zero, step zero, let's say, since mu is ergodic, we know that, so it is the theorem by the, this comes from the Birkhoff ergodic theorem, that if the g is in L1 of mu, then Sn of the U. Then Sn of G divided by N converges towards G, mu. And we made the note in this talk sometimes with mu against G. That's for the notation. This one, so for, let's say the point fix, for mu almost eight. Okay, so we want to think of this theorem as an analogous dynamical system of the law of large numbers. And a question that one can ask of is for geo-aggain regularity, can we understand better the rate of this convergence? For a sequence of independent random variables, the central limit tells the rate of this convergence. In particular, it says that if I take this uh this here, at the first order is equal to n times this integral, and then there is a next order of the order x square root of n. Of the order x square root of n, and we can decide this. So, in this case, I take f mu as the resistant here, the norm map and the measured here. We say that g in l1 of mu satisfies the central limit here, I will write here with variance. Sigma square at least zero. So if now I take this one here, which was Sn of G, I remove n the integral, and now I divide only by square root of n. If this tends towards the Gaussian, 0 sigma square is ill. Now this is equivalent if you don't like the convergence i law. If you don't like the convergence of lower probability, this is equivalent to say that the limit for n goes to infinity of the measure of the set, well, this Sn of G minus n integral, let's go to n, is in a given integral, in an interval. This is equal to, let's say, is equal to 1 if sigma is 0 and the interval is minus delta delta. And this is just a degenerate case. Sigma is equal to 0. Sigma is equal to zero, the limit distribution is a delta, but we will not care that much for this. But the important point is that if sigma is positive, this goes, 1 over 2 pi sigma square, e minus e square 2 sigma squared. So this is the integral of the Gaussian on this interval. So in the limit, the probability to fall from this random variable here in the given interval. What are we here in the given interval is the integral of the Gaussian degree. Okay, so this is theorem in this context of the narcissist. So the first question we want to address is, for example, for older maps, if it's worth that for all older observables, for this natural maximum entropy, is it better satisfied this entry? Okay, so let's say this is the question one that we want to address is this one, let's say for G input. Okay, now let me say maybe a few words here. I will have the material here, but there are kind of classical criteria to establish the central Ethereum. For example, the core in the method, but this method works very well for expanding systems. The main point is that if you have an expanding system, there are methods which do nothing. Essentially, So you do not think essentially just the catalog that it's quickly just like this. Here we cannot apply this because the system is not explicit. So I don't spend time on discussing about it. The second point that, so this is the first motivation. Now, I want... So of course this property is a statistical property of this measure. And this is related to other ergodic properties of this measure. For example, the beats. Now, if I go back to this theorem here, it is known still by this theorem. It is known still by this theorem of bet for the u, which is violent, 93, that mu is Bermoulli. Now, what does it mean Bermoulli? Bermoulli means that the system is conjugated, okay, into a shift on some set of sequence. Now, the regularity of this conjugation is not clear, especially if the system is not equal to. But the point is that this implies, this wasn't, is that the system is mixing. That this system is mixing. Mixing here, what I want to say is that if you have two observables, for example, continuous, if you have G and H, you take this correlation here, these converge to mu G H. Again, for example, for continuous G add H. Okay? This is the mixing. It's implied by the actually, it also implies what is called the mixing. What is called the mixing of all of that, which is that here I could take mu g0, g1, fn1, gk, fnk. This goes to the product of mu. Okay? Now, the fact that the major is pernully, let's say perbolic, so it's not clear on the other hand how if this convergence can be And how if this convergence we have to be quantified? Okay, I believe that's important for the problem. Now, so the question is: this was the question, the question is, can we quantify this convergence here? As we will see in a moment, these two questions are related. And so, in order to paint this, this is a result of in 06. That is exponentially mixing in the sense here, let's say order one, the one here. And so this gives the rate of this one here as exponential. And so I would like to mention here, oh, this is a result by Dolgopjat. Uh can you go and uh Rodriguez Herzegovina it's in the setting of a diffeomorphism of uh substances of subtle irregularity with an invariant smooth measure. But I would be surprised if it doesn't translate so can extract this. But they see in in they The theorem is that under certain assumptions, exponential mixing, let's call it exponential mixing of k equals 1, so into 2, just into functions, g equals 1, implies that the system is better. Okay, now let's move on. So, on the other hand, it is a question, general question. question general question if exponential mixing equals one it implies exponential mixing it's a general question I don't think there are cases where this is a specialty simplification can be undergone on the other hand it is uh to admit I didn't know I have to admit, I didn't know this when I what the theorem I will discuss, but the point is that exponential mixing of all order against underscore assumptions, here I will cite Biotium Toradnik. This implies the CLT for all their maps. Now, just to make sure the CLT on the other side, the cell phone. Just to make sure the CLT on the other hand does not imply, for example, mixing or other forms. So it's not a really stronger one. Some say the stronger property is this one, okay? It's the exponential mixing of an order, which in general is not clear how to get out of the uniform per velocity. And so the theorem I would like to describe in the following. First, let me give the definition again, as I did for the central theorem. So I take f minus. So I take F mu as it is before. I fix E. Let me say yes, I take a norm this way. I take a norm that bounds the norm infinity, if I, for example, the older norm, we say that mu is exponentially mixing of all orders for. For observable in E, so let's say that this defines a space, just a normal space of all functions which are bounded in this norm. If let's say for every k in n there exists a constant positive and another constant between 0 and 1 such that for every g0, g k in E, k in E and for every n1 and k in n then let me also put n0 defined by 0 simplicity this one so if we have that the integral u against g 0 f n 1 g k f n k minus the product of the integral Product of the integral, let's take a modulus, is smaller than up to this constant, the product of the norms times theta k, some exponent, and this is the minimum of nj plus 1 minus nj. Okay, so now I get the precise definition of what I mean here by the rate is explicit, is that you want the rate to go to zero, okay, exponentially, and the rate should be the minimum between the gaps. Should be the minimum between the gaps amount of mm-hmm. Okay? This is the condition. Now, the theorem, the theorem we would like to discuss here, but yes, you can stay. So, it can be our guessed is that F mu is exponentially mixing of all orders. For all, let's say for the norms gamma between actually until two actually, but we can focus on just one. Now, here also with the beta k is it, as we will see things by what has been before. This by what I said before, in particular, as corollary, implies that G equal there satisfies the central unit. Okay, I would like to stress here I don't put any assumption on the interpolation of the system of H. For any anomal maps, complex annum map, the measure of maximal entropy is exponentially mixed in overall for this or the other. For this order, for the old numbers. Okay, so now I would like to say, before giving the idea of why this is true, the same result is true for a regular dimension, also for automotive colour manpods, once one can, once they have what is called simple action composition. But since the proof in a Hennon case is Kickler, I will just give an idea of a proof that works in a Henon case and I will say when it doesn't work for the KL in a KL setting, we'll not focus behind the KL setting. But in that case, the proof that I will give as a normal. Now we'll just talk about KNOMAT. Okay, so the idea of this proof, or the proof, in order to describe the main idea, I want to go back to go to the dimension one. To go to the dimension one, let's talk about polynomials for a moment. And I want to take another classic now idea of the fact that information on the equidistribution of pre-images of points actually implies the mixing. And more, if you have the equidistribution of pre-image of points with some speed, this gives the mixing with some speed. This is with the first ingredient that we want to of course, we will have to modify because We will have to modify because the images of points for economics are not belong to points. But this is the first step. So the idea, let's start from instead from dimension one, the polynomial. So the general idea is that equidistribution of pre-images implies the mixing. It goes at least button, you know, what we can understand. Because at least back in Waterfront evaluation, I guess the argument itself is for this. And if this is exponential, this one is exponential. Let me give the ideas. So, equal distribution of pre-images, I mean that if I take the direct mass at the point, okay, I will not focus too much here at the point of generating points, and if I take this operator here, which means that I replace Which means that I replace the Dirac mass at the point with all the Dirac masses at the brain. This is our, if the polynomial is dvt, this now is, I have d power n points, I come to the multiplicity. I can define the d power n. This is the probability measure. Now, this one goes to mu, measured entropy. This should equivalent to say that regularity, but let's say that we do it here. If I take Here, if I take this other operator here, where I define f star at the point is the sum of all the play images. By duality, instead of calling back measure, I can put forward function. I take these operator functions, and this one converges to a constant, which is the integral. So, if I pull back measures, and I don't integrate the measure, by Measure of the measure of like one I think that is one against the function g this is nothing more than let's say so this convergent mu g and this is also by quality this is delta A against A against the fm star G here. Okay? Now, so if now I want to put the mixing, what I have to take is to take mu g, let's say h composed f n. This one here, I can use the total variance of this measure, which satisfies the pullback of itself. The n is equal to itself. Now here I have a pullback, here I have. Now, here I pull back. Here, I pull back. This is equal to, let's say, u fn stub g n times h and now if I know that this one converges to g nu, this integral here converges to the product of the integral g mu times the integral mu h, okay, which is a mixing. If I know that this one here is exponential, now I should fix more precisely which one. Now, I should fix more precisely on which class of functions. Exponential, this gives them exponential speed here and so we have. Okay? So this is the general strategy. Now, if we want to apply this idea for Hennon maps, the problem is at first we have no points. It's one point at the rotation. On the other hand, what you want to use is something at the 20 EBU space, is that there are other objects, just a green current, and these objects satisfy something. These objects satisfy something. So the step would be to translate the problem in a problem of equidistribution toward recovery, maybe with some sufficiency strong speed here, especially with not only one n, but a lot of n, and then say, okay, once I get a mixing, and that propriet is a strong vector distribution towards the solution, towards the C. Okay, so for Renon, let me go back to Renon now. So now I take again F was situated to NR As it was already introduced new producing another property. This is the wedge product. Property: This is the wedge product of two carrots. It has a green carrot. Okay, in this case, they are unique. I could define them as the DDC of a suitable function, but here we don't need them too much if you don't ask me why the intersections were. And the point here is that this one is true and the unique one one, let's say, odd lost currents satisfying this property. Satisfying this property that f star of t plus is equal to t plus, up to the constant. So if I pull back t plus, it's a fixed point up to the constant. And I push forward t minus, this is equal to d times t minus. d here is the let's say that if I have the simple expression of uh of the kind of map it will be the the algebraic I of them if I put it's like a polynomial or a plus some terms to make it. To make it. But so this is the first dynamical bit. So I have this one, and the point here is that since this one is the unique point, if I have S now, another current sufficiently regular, I won't now go into these points here, but if S is a essentially it means a form, but with a sufficient regularity, takes two. If I take f n star of this and I divide by the n, this converts to two. By the end, this converts to two bits. Up to a constant, which is essentially this is the mass of the constant is. Of course, if I do the push forward, I do have to use. So these are, this and the quantified version of this is what I want to use to do this. Now, the idea of how to make the step from this one to kind of get an easy was what we did. I'm not sure. I'm not sure we get to talk about precisely the end, but at least I want to make the idea understandable to people who probably don't want to learn about it. So I will give it a bit known to experts. But the main idea here, going back to Dino Six, is the following. Now I define this system, okay? It is on the on C4, which is C2 times C2. On the first two coordinates I give myself. On the first two coordinates, I use my Henon map. On the second coordinate, I use the inverse of the system. This may be the main point number. Now, this map here, I can look at it as a Henon map, such as CC4. Now, instead of having one attracting in one regular direction, I have two attracting in two regular direction. Okay? More precisely, now this system also admits some green currents, but instead of being one more current, there will be two currents. So, and more precisely they are explicit. So, and more precisely they are explicit. I can define this current here, T plus, to be, let me write for now in this way: on the first two coordinates I can take T plus, the green current of the first system, on the second coordinate I will take T minus, okay, the green current of the second one. Now, what does this mean? If I was talking about measures, this will just be the Crecatizer product of measures, okay? I define the measure on the rectangle and then I descend them. This can be done on currents, instead of speeds. This is a very standard how to define it. Billy's standard how to define it. But the point is that this one is the daggering currents of the system, and in particular, it satisfies that if I take f n star of t plus, this is equal to t plus, and now the coefficient is d true. Because I have two magnets, I have t from the first coordinates, and the second coordinate now I apply this one, which now I use the second environment and give the adaptable d2. Now, if I take t minus, which is t minus times t plus, Which is t minus times t plus is as the other invariance. So fn star of t minus is equal to t star of t minus. Okay, so these are the currents, okay? Now we want to see that, okay, in this system, we will have something similar to this. If I have other currents, other tutorial currents in this case, they will converge toward this shoe for the same reason as the funny mention. Now, more precisely, so More precisely, so let's take that S is a choo choocurrents on uh P four smooth enough, okay? Text issuing case, smooth enough, and for example with no mass at infinity, but let's take it small, it's as if it for this. The first convergence that in some sense replies replaces and precisely what I want to do there is that if I take fm. There is that if I take f n star like this and I divide by 2n of s, this goes towards s t minus, okay? If there is a constant due to the linearity, this is less than a constant depending on s and phi. Here I should be some differences. I test again phi, against phi, which is the two currents of the complementary degree. Again, sufficiently small. Again, sufficient is motor. And this is less than Cs phi minus n. So I have a loss here of one half, just that. And the point is that this one here depends on both n and phi. Okay? Depends on both of them. What I want to say is that there is some norm, okay, such that if s and phi are bounded in this norm, this one goes to zero exponentially, and this one I have to put a normal. And this one, I have to put the norm of the objects. I don't want to enter in the detail of what an object is. But this is the point. Now, the claim here, let me say that in this set, at least in this generality, as I say, this is already q by d C boni. This is not numerical. This is at least in this level of generality. The claim now, the main part is the following. If I take g0, g k, let's say older. Let's say older. But for simplicity, I will move to C2 very easily. Very, very, okay, very quickly. I will just consider the C2K, so it's simple. And now I consider this current here. I define theta to be G0W. Let's say that here I use coordinate ZW per second. Then I put G1 of Z, GK, Fnk minus 1 of Z. Okay? So here I put G0 on the second coordinate. Here, I put G0 on the second coordinate. And then I put all the rest of the object for which I would like to prove the mix, the rest. So all my other tests. But I put minus n of each of them. I removed n and one. I put n, so this one would be n minus one minus n one. So this is the first coordinate. And then I multiply by t plus. Okay, this is a true coverance again. So it's again in the same cover. Uh is a choice current, but I multiply by this one. We only don't have control over what happens in this. And now, delta is the diagonal of C2 times C2. Okay? Now, the claim is if I have the condition two, which is more or less this one, but with delta, if I have this one, minus one, f and one other two star delta. delta minus t minus minus against theta goes to zero exponentially d minus one half mean g minus let's do it theta Okay? If I have this one that goes to zero exponentially, this is the mixing. Okay? So, the exponential mixing over the k can be deduced from this formula here. If I can do it with L instead of S. If I can do it with delta instead of s, singular, okay, and with this specific paper here. Instead of phi, I want to take this specific object here, t plus, multiply the result. My claim is, if I can get this convergence here, instead of this multifarance or whatever, if I can get this one, if I can make this go to zero exponentially, okay, then I have the mixed coordinate. Okay, I say right away that the point here, the main point here and the main distance. Here, the main point here and the main difference with respect to doing this for k is that here I have the n1 here in the estimate, but I don't have any of the other. So the estimate that I do here has to be uniform in all the other n. This is the main point of the construction. If you take only two functions, there is, in particular, there is no other n here. You don't have to wait to do any uniform. So the main difference here from doing k equal one to all the k is to be able to do all these estimates here independent in particular. Here, independent in particular of N2 and K. And notice that they, in some sense, play a bad role, because if you compose by FN here, the irregular, whatever regularity you put here becomes worse. In some sense, it's playing against you, these compositions. So, this is the main point. I don't think I will get to explain the independence, but at least I want to explain the idea of what this one side is. Sorry? Theta is a current. Yes, theta is a current. It's T plus multiple. No, this is theta is not a current. Ah, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. This would be theta. So no. Okay. Yes, actually, it will be explicit. It will be this one over two and the k over two, gamma over two is the regularity and k over one over two. It's explicit. Yes, it it in particular if you take gamma which is c2, one disappears and it's the one of the two. No, sorry. The statement was a constant, yes. So, yes, this is a current. This is let's go into it. This is a constant less than one, yes. This is one. No, sorry, yes. And okay, so now the so I would like to. I don't know if I can let me try at least perfectly the idea of why the one is the mix, even if it's not maybe the most. Even if it's not maybe the most new part, I guess an idea is interesting. So should take care, or we should prove this claim here, why this one implies the mixing, and then why say why we can get this formula. Okay. Let's do that. Why this implies the mixing system? The why this implies the mixing system of the entire DI even for not people in a potential DI, because that's the truly we use potential to the H. So, to do the claim, let's say proof of the claim, let me define H, which is G1, G2 composed FN2 minus N1, GK, FnK minus N1. Okay, so this is the temperature, okay? This is H? Okay, it's what I put on the first quote. Now, what I want to do in practice is to do this one. I would like to estimate this and one. Okay? And say that it goes to the product of the integral times the integral in hf with an exponential error. Now, and then my reaction would like to do it in a way that all the estimated To do it in a way that all the estimates that I do will not see how you uniform me a way to be able to do it. But let's just give the idea of why this one can become important. The main point here is that this one, I can write in this way, mu g0 plus f minus m1 dot two, h f okay, I move m1 tanton. Again, this was already in the paper in 2006. Now, this one here now, I can write as tp, the plus tantane. Now I cannot steal the plastic market. That's more than that. And now, now I use the diagonal. I could say, okay, this is this object. Sorry, yes, this one. I can say, okay, I intersect with the diagonal. I move to C2, to C4 now. This, I say, okay, I take both of them. And this one, I say, okay, this one I read it in the second chord, and I take this one, I repeat it in the first chord. Because if I work on the diagonal, w is equal to zinc, so this one is equal to g, z and this one becomes the metric. Okay? And just saying I have a system of situation, I put everything here in the diagonal, where the variable is. Now, the point here is that now, this one here, this is the function which is G0 in the first coordinate, the second coordinate in the one. And this is f m1 star of this one. One star of this one. Because now I apply this one in the first coordinate and I apply f minus n in the first coordinate. Okay? Which is this one? Remember that f equals f minus one in the second coordinate. So this is a pullback by m1 under two, m1 is even of this product here. Okay. Now another thing that I can do is that now this one was the whiskey plus. Okay? Now, N T plus, again, you can buy it there. So this is equal to F n star, let's do n over 2. Start T plus over T1. Here I have N over 2 here, 1 because here I will develop. Okay, now, as I did before, erase the intimation 1. Here I have the football function. Here I have the football of the curve. Function here, I have the back of the car at this time. So I can move everything to push forward this object here. So now this one becomes equal to a push forward of delta divided by this TN1 against G0 of that volume, H of C plus. Okay? Now this one is data. This is theta, theta. This theta, theta. And this is theta. This one, if I have the condition 2, I know that against theta, this one converges to T minus exponentially fast with the rate, which is N1. And N1 is the difference between N0 and N. Now, if this is true, so if I have the condition true, in particular, independent to hold N, now then I can go back. Okay? Because now this one is. Okay, just now this one is this one this one, so this one gets to limit exponential T plus G 0 W H of Z T plus T minus plus here I move again now to the product this is T minus plus this is G0W HOZ this is T This is T plus, and so T minus. Now, in the first coordinate, what I have, I have now X T plus, X T minus, and we have H. And T minus T plus now gives the measure, so this becomes mu H times mu, G 0. The error is exponentially N one. So now if I continue by induction and estimate again this term here, I will get error that I will be a gap between N two and a one and then a two and so on. And the one and the two, and so on. Okay, so in the limit, I will get something which the error that I have is the minimum between the graphs. Okay, in some sense, the worst possible. Okay, so one minute. We have two minutes. Two minutes. Okay, okay, so let me say what's the point of doing the estimate shoe. The point of the estimate shook is the following. So, you may have noticed that all the potential theory is heat and is estimated. That's why it's only high. But the point is that if this is the point, if DDC, let's say, let's work with condition one, okay? I have s and phi which are positive, and I have this condition here. If ddc of phi is positive. If the ddc of phi is positive, if it was a function, which is not the case, if it was supermonic, we are working with courage, it's something else. But if I could put an assumption subharmonic on this left quarantine, then I could improve, improve, change the first one, put this one, g minus n, f n star, s minus s e minus, against five. Again, it's five. This is less and constant. And we've got five even on the standard. Okay, why I say improvement and why I say the point here is that I say improvement because now if I get this condition, this one does not depend on it. Okay? This improvement. This one does not depend on it. Okay, this is the improvement. It's one that doesn't depend on this. Second, on the other hand, I lose the modules. Okay, the idea to get this one is that when you work with supermonic functions, when you want to do something point-wise, since you have the mean inequality, you can say, okay, I regularize around my probability motor. So if I can make the estimate in this case, I can get one inequality, just one inequality, the central computation. Okay? Just the upper one. So this is, it means that if I can regularize. It means that if I can regularize this one, I can get rid of S, because I just work around with some CS here, and I get the rid of S. On the left hand, I just only get the other one. So once from here, so what's left? So suppose that we get this one, okay? Suppose that we have this one, what is left that I will not do? First, the main point is now you have data, which is not. The main point is now you have data, which is not the DC positive. You have to decompose data in a way in its number of terms. All of them dissipositive. And not only data, but now you have to decompose data in minus theta. You also have a result of minus data at some point. Theta and minus data are the number of terms, each DC positive. And each of them bounded in some norm, which is the normal in the right. And the main point, one of the main points is to put all these estimates independent of the individual. The point here is to use them in the component. Use that in the homology level, in this case of ChuChu, once you move EDDC, you move to homology level to the three columns, okay? And now there you have some estimated exponential. And this is, on the other hand, this part doesn't work for the K-Ler because you don't have, for example, supermic function. So one has to use another proof, but the point of getting rid of the n, that one is the symmetry. Stop here.
