about a model of London Gen type for spectacular gay liquid crystals that we've been working on and also its discretization and then some simulations that we've been doing with it. So this work has been joined with Tim who's just arrived. Good timing and stopped and also my PhD student Jing Min who really did the the bulk of this work. Jing Min has actually joined us for this conference but she's in China so she watches all the videos for the rest so you may know. So, you may not interact with it very much. Okay, so let me just briefly recap some different models for smectics and how we came to the model that we wanted to discretize. Okay, so, and we saw some of this in Jonathan's talk yesterday. So let me just write down the energies. So, in 1972, Dejen proposed using a complex value ordered parameter psi to represent the density performation, as Jonathan described yesterday. As Jonathan described yesterday, and here was the energy functional that we proposed. And so let me just highlight this term here, relating the gradient of this order parameter to the director. So this is what encourages the symptomic layers to align with the director, as in a symptic A. And then, but you know, this model has had some success, but there's also some flaws with it. So, first of all, the imaginary part of this order parameter. The order parameter is not physical, right? It's really there to sort of make the arithmetic or the algebra work out, but this gives you a lot of headaches at times. And in particular, around index one-half defects, you can choose this ordering parameter to be a single value. And another description that Nanta and Sullivan described that maybe I don't understand as well as some of you might be that this is based on coarse grain length, so you can't model dislocations in symptomic layers themselves. themselves. So in 2014, as Jonathan described yesterday, Pavni, Selju, and Slugin decided to fix some of these problems by formulating a theory based on a real value or a parameter. So what I'm calling u, we call delta rho, but it's the same thing as the perturbation in the density field. Okay, and this is the energy functional that they write down. So they've got some kind of spectral bulk energy density. They've got an alignment term that aligns. Alignment term that aligns the Hessian of this density perturbation with the directive field somehow. You make a tensor out of the directive field. So, this, as we see from the finite element tutorial this morning, this means that we're going to have a lot of smoothness requirements on you, which is going to make this tricky to discretize. That's why I was asking the question yesterday. And we have a constraint, of course, on the directive field. Now, we would like to have simulations like this, where we've got Like this, where we've got integer one-half defects along with some spectral layers, but hang on a second, we can't represent such configurations with the unit vector field, right? It's not orientable. And so these authors have pictures like this in the paper. And so when we came to try to solve this model, try to reproduce some of their results, we were like, hang on a second, how do they get pictures like this with a directive field of unit norm? Unit norm. And so we emailed them. And I can't remember, did we email anything? So they told us that instead they solve for n out of n. So instead of solving for the specifically, they do a Monte Carlo optimization in n. But the point is they never care about this. Magically, the sign of n never arises, so it's truly headless, isn't it? Physically. Okay. And so this. And so, this is what allows them to achieve these simulations that represent half-charge defects. But if we want to do maybe a route one attack with the optimization problem, not doing Monte Carlo, but taking optimality conditions and solving those, then we would need to somehow enforce this ansatz for our tensor-valued order parameter. Whatever tensor-valued order parameter we have at every point, it is the outer product of some unit normal. Is the outer product of some unit normal vector with itself, right? Which is a tricky constraint to enforce. So, for example, Sean has a very nice paper with Riccardo and Chetto about enforcing such a constraint in a gradient flow, right? Where I think you keep projecting onto this manifold at every time step. Is that right? Yeah, but actually sort of enforcing it directly if you're not doing a gradient flow is true. So, another sort of strand in the story is the model of. Story is the model of John Ball and his PhD student, Bedford, who now I believe I've heard I've never met him, but I believe he now works making computer games in Oxford, which is pretty cool. If you know the Sniper Elite series. Anyway, so they decided to write down a model like this, but using a Q tensor instead, right? Because we know that in the X-L case, the Q-tensor you could write down as S times N outer N, which is the guy we want, and our energy, plus a scaled identity. Plus a scaled identity. And so, you know, this sort of makes a natural suggestion that we could replace the n outer n in the expression from the previous slide with q over s minus identity over d. But there were no numerical implementations. So John Ball was doing theory. And we thought about this, and I think maybe even tried to solve this, but we got into sort of a lot of numerical difficulties when S was approaching zero. So then we decided to. So, then we decided to modify this energy functional for purely pragmatic reasons. This may not be the right thing to do. In fact, if you tell us that this is totally the wrong model to be solving, you're wasting your time. I'll say great, because I love discretizing UNESCO, so please, don't be shy. So what we're going to do is we're going to drop the S out of this ansat, and we're going to add a pneumatic buck tone to weakly influence with this S, this one. Okay, and then this will sort of allow us to ignore the S and sort of a lie to use. And sort of elide these, avoid these numerical. Okay, so when you put it all together, this is the energy that we've been solving. Okay, so we have a mixed problem. We're solving for a Q-tensor, which is a symmetric traceless matrix field, and a scalar parameter, order parameter U. And so we've got a bunch of different contributions to the energy, which I'll now highlight. So I write down the energy in 3D, it's very slightly different than 2D, but we write down the analysis. Okay, so we have a smectic. Okay, so we have a smectic bulk energy density. We have this term, the B term, that encourages the alignment between the layer normals and the director, right? So relating somehow the Hessian, which is this is what's going to give us all the headaches in the numerical analysis and the Q tensor. We've got a pneumatic elastic energy density with a one-constant approximation, but you can do something more sophisticated if you wanted to, but we already have enough. Wanted to, but we already have enough parameters that we don't know, so we probably go for the simplest thing. And then this is the extra term that Jingme decided to add: the pneumatic bulk energy density to sort of weakly enforce weakness was one. Okay, so that's the energy density. Patrick, can I answer a couple of night questions? Go for it, please. I might give you very naive answers. Does anybody care about that B term, the cubic term? Like, somebody wanted to know about what model. Somebody wanted to know about what models should be or shouldn't be there. If you wrote that down. We said B to zero. You did set B to zero. Yeah, we said B to zero. I think because we decided to take, you know, in the absence of any inverse problems or experimental data or concise, we decided that the most reviewer defensible thing to do was to take the same practice as Jonathan's back here. Jonathan and Tim do. Jonathan and Tim do. I think they also said B equals zero. Yeah, that's right. I suppose. Doesn't it bother you that S is sitting in there with the component? A little. The Meyer subway order parameter is sitting in there, so it's in a big cube. So doesn't it bother you that that the the wavelength depends on S? Um it bothers me, but maybe it doesn't bother me. Me, but maybe it doesn't bother me. Yeah, maybe it hasn't bothered us explicitly. Maybe it should bother us. That means that, right? Because that's saying that the density wave cares about how strongly one of the pneumatic is, not just the orientation. Which could be possible. Possible, but the symectic to pneumatic transition isn't second order, so the pinch doesn't go to infinity smoothly. Because I thought about this too. If you divide by S, then it's a nightmare. Yes. So you can put the Q in and have it clear with Q, but if you divide by S, then you don't know what to do. Yeah. That's a totally fair point. I don't have a good answer. What was the value you use for L? Do you remember? I'll put the numbers. Yeah, yeah, we'll see them. Because I think what we ended up doing is, I think, L, if I remember right. Doing is I think, if I remember rightly, we rather strongly push the last, the sort of the fake land now expansion at the end, we do lock S, that could hold S. Well, it's holding S right, exactly. And so that's sort of the dodgy, that's sort of the dodgy, we take our processes. Let me say something, I understand. Yeah. Because it's fine, unless you want to study the transition. Yeah, yeah. Transition. Yeah, yeah. That was one of the reasons why I said, oh, I'd love to understand models that support phase transitions. Right, so if you're deep in the pneumatic phase where S is nice, almost constant, but it shouldn't. No, I don't think this is the final word in sympathetic model. You're deep into the symectic phase and the pneumatic phase. Okay. And the pneumatic phase, but so that, right, because the last stuff is controlling the pneumatic order. Just so that not only is the microscopic order parameter fixed, or it has a minimum is non-zero, but that the well, the radical well is also quite narrow. That's what you want to do. You want to set things up so that S has a peak minimum at some places in these Americas. Yeah, but so if you're coming from human S is saturated against right, but this theory in principle allows you to tunnel out doesn't block us. No, we don't enforce it as a constraint. We just weakly, I mean, it goes back to what you said about, you know, if you have constraints, can you just weakly formalize them here? I I said, oh, you shouldn't do that. So yeah. And why do you need the cross I over three with the Q 3 with the Q? Oh, that's to get the N out of N, out of the Q tensor. So that S is implicitly assumed we want. Yeah, that's right. And then this is added to encourage the truth of that by coming to the test in there also. You and I are not going to have the same units. Yeah, because so so if we just go back. See th this so n n out of n is the thing in the energy that we want, right? thing in the energy that we want. So if we did the obvious, did the appropriate thing, you should just take n out of n to be this expression here. But we don't want the s and the denominator. I get that as a sort of historical path of why couldn't one just start with q in the sort of grad squared minus q roughly. Because then then you're if you just have q, right, then the minimum would be something where the where the Hessian Something where the Hessian headlines trace zero. Because the trace of Q is zero by constructions. V squared U, the trace of B squared E would have to be zero. Because the trace of, at the minimum, if you try to take that second term, it gets zero everywhere. Q is traceless, and Q is traceless. I mean, you know, the I D J it would also have to be traceless. Have to be traceless. In other words, that would restrict you to be a harmonic function. And make it easy to solve. Probably not a lowest bit. Okay, anyway, maybe we can carry on. I don't think this is the final energy density that's going to go down in the book of that. But it'll be useful, as we'll see momentarily. So, with this sort of pragmatic, So, with this sort of pragmatic bodge that we've made for numerical reasons, so now the energy functional is very conveniently amenable to numerical simulation, we've got these difficulties, as we said, these technical difficulties associated with the regularity of U, but you can deal with them. And we have an unconstrained optimization problem, and we're able to represent integer half defects, and we're able to take root one for the optimization, right? We can just take the optimal conditions and solve them as if we, right? We don't need to take gradient flows, we don't need to take do Monte Carlo, we can just go ahead and solve them. Low, we can just draw it up. Okay, so how do we discretize this? So, as I alluded, the discretization is hard because of the regularity of the network of H mu, it's a H2R. And so, for the first go around, we decided that we would just take a non-conforming discretization. So, we could do a conforming discretization. Our software has the Argyros element in two D. We we did that first. But we wanted to really solve problems in three dimensions and that wasn't going to work. Dimensions and that wasn't going to work, so we needed to do something extra. And so the basic idea, as I alluded to this morning, is that we're going to look for solutions in a space that's bigger, that isn't contained within the true real solution space. And then in order to make that work, we need to modify the energy functional in order to penalize non-conformity. So we're going to add some extra term here that depends in this case on sort of 1 over h. In this case, on sort of 1 over h cubed, the penalizes jumps across cells in the gradient. So, in order to make this term in the numerical energy zero, you want to make sure that the jump in the gradient is zero so that the gradient is continuous. This is the jump across cells. This symbol here, these funny brackets. So, that's the value on one side minus the value on the other. Okay, and so once you take this numerical energy with this sort of extra mesh-dependent term that's going to weakly enforce the conformity, then we can just use CGK elements for degree k, so I use p area, and cgk minus 1 for the q tensor. We do this because of this non-conforming discretization, we lose one order here. So this sort of balances the accuracy of the u and the q. And so this is relatively high. And so this is relatively high order. You know, you've got CG3 and above. But what we see in the numerical experiments is that the solutions are smooth. So you are getting sort of for benefit of doing so. So going high order is probably the right thing to do in this case. Okay, and so then we can prove existence of minimizers to this problem, and we can also prove optimal convergence rates in various papers, there's a whole string of them, by Jing Min and separately by Abdullah Zixamde that have discussed these two students. Okay, so now that we've got the energy, so I'm sure that you're all dying to know what we can simulate with it. But before I do an introlive, if that's okay, so about computing multiple solutions, because the energy functions that we face are non-convex. So what that means is that for most parameters, the typical situation is that we're going to have multiple stable and unstable equilibrium joining. Unstable equivalently joining us. And we'd like to compute these, right? And the scary consequence of this non-convexity of the existence of these multiple minimizers is that your simulations, your computations, may be entirely correct. You might have the perfect model, you might have the best discretization, you might have resolved everything, you solve the problem, and you get the wrong minimizer. So the experiment is something different. So, the sort of the cartoon of this is that. The sort of cartoon of this is that imagine that we have a problem with two minimizers, and we start our nonlinear solver, however you want to solve it, we're doing Newton's method, but it doesn't really matter, from this initial guess, and we drive our solver to convergence to this guy here, it's green solution, but nature chooses that one. So all of our calculations, all of our simulations, all of our theory is correct, but our predictions are wrong. So what can we do? Well, so what I'd like to try to do is So, what I'd like to try to do is to compute multiple solutions of the optimality conditions associated with these optimization problems. So, we write down the PDE that we want to solve. So, we take the optimality conditions, that gives us the Euler-Lagrange equations. We take all the terms over to the left-hand side, and what I'd like to do is I'd like to try to map out the multiple solutions of this equation, this PVE, as a function of some parameter that I'm going to vary. So, and the purpose of the function. So, and the function, the purpose of this parameter is to be able to go from some sort of easy case to harder cases. So, I can use, I can solve things in the easy case and then use that knowledge to crack open the harder things. So, we'll see some simulations later on in the next section. So, we're going to simulate some oily streaks. And in that case, the lambda will be the aspect ratio of the domain. We're not solving things on a free surface. We confine it, which maybe is a bit contrived. But the lambda will be the aspect ratio. And we'll also do some simulations. Ratio, and we'll also do some simulations of focal connect domains, and we're going to do some angle of deviation from homeotronic. But lambda is just some real-value parameter that goes from easy to hard. Okay, and so here's the core idea of how we're going to calculate multiple solutions. So, let's just fix the parameter lambda for a moment. So, now I've just got one nonlinear problem for a given parameter. So, I've got a residual that's for shaded. That's for shade differentiable. If you don't know what that means, it doesn't matter. And I've got one solution that I already know. Okay, so I found one solution somehow by Newton's method or whatever. So I've got a solution R, so this is the top of QUE. So it satisfies the PDE, so it is a root of this residual, and also it satisfies some rather mild regularity conditions. So what this says is that the root is isolated, so that you can put a ball at the root and there's no other root within that ball. If this isn't true, At all. If this isn't true, it also works. It's just a bit of a publication. So this is just sort of for the convenience of exposition. It's not essential. Okay, and so we've got a problem and one solution. So we're going to construct a new nonlinear problem G with the properties that if you find an R tilde that's a root of G, then it's also, if and only if, a solution of F. So you're not going to gain any new roots by going from F to G, and you're not going to lose any roots. Roots. So I can look for roots of G, and that'll tell me things about the roots of F. And the other property in words is that if I apply Newton's method to G, it will never converge to the solution I already know. So this is what I'm calling deflation. So I have a nonlinear problem, it has lots of solutions. I know one, I'm going to get rid of it somehow from the nonlinear problem, and then I can construct a new nonlinear problem with four solutions, and then with three solutions, and then with two solutions. Okay, and so if I can do this, Okay, and so if I can do this, then what this means is that starting from the same stuff that you need in order to run your numerical solver, you can find more solutions. So, just a cartoon again, just to make sure that everybody follows. So, now we have a problem with three solutions, three minimizers, saddle points, and stationary points. And then we have an initial guess here. And so, I drive my non-linear solver to convergence, convergence to the solution, and then I can deflate this away, and then I can start from. And then I can start from the same initial guess, and if it converges, it will converge to something new. Not guaranteed to converge, but if it converges, it will converge to something new. And then I can repeat the process. I can deflate that, start again, converge to there. And then, well, typically I don't know how many solutions there are. So I have to keep looking. And so I'll say, okay, I'm willing to do 30 Newton iterations before I give up. And so I do my 30 Newton iterations. I haven't found anything, so I declare victory. You go home. Of it, we go home. And because this is still doing Newton's method, this is still a local process, it's not a guarantee to find all solutions. So, we're both able to find lots of solutions of problems, but we're not able to find all of them. So, there could be other solutions far away that this process doesn't find. But let me. Okay, so how do you construct this deflated problem? So, what we're going to do is we're going to construct the deflated residual by means of a non-linear transformation of the original residual. Of the original residual. And this is the most mathematical bit in the slides. The intuition here is that we want to hide the existence of the root from Newton's method. So it's not multiplication, right? Well, this is application of a non-linear transformation. It's actually just going to be multiplication by scalar. But it didn't have to be. It didn't have to be, yeah, but in the end it will be. But in principle, it could be something more complicated, but there's no. In principle, it could be something more complicated, but there's no need for it to be. So, what we're going to do is: so, Newton is trying to give us sequences in function space where the residual is going to zero. That's what Newton wants to do. So, we're going to hide the existence of this root by making sure that if you take a sequence that goes to the root you already know, the norm of the deflated residual is bounded away from zero. So, this somehow hides the existence of the root. From Newton's methods, we can won't preverse theory. More converts there. And in practice, here's what we do: it's just a multiplication by a scalar. And it's got two terms in it, so I'll take them both in turn. So this term is the one that does the deflation. So this is 1 over the distance between my current guess and the root I already know to some power p, which we'll fix equal to. Okay, so this is what's blowing up as u approaches r. So you're introducing a pole, and that's because this is greater than or equal to 1, that's what gives you the deflation property, right? That's what gives you the deflation property, right? So, this is what hides the root that you already know. The plus one is for the other limit. So, now if you think about the case when u is very far away from r, so that you're operating in a different part of function space, then this distance is very large, one over something large is very small, and so you want this whole thing to go to one. So this is somehow, you can think of it as like local surgery in function space, modifying the problem so that it hides the existence of the two. Okay, and then. Okay, and then here's how we can use this to sort of robustly find multiple solutions. So I'm going to organize things in these bifurcation diagrams. So I've got my parameter on the x-axis, so I'm going from sort of easy to hard. And then on the y-axis, I've got my solutions of my PDE. And of course, I can't draw an infinite-dimensional function, so I'm just going to compute some functional object. So maybe it's the L2 norm, or maybe it's the value at a point or whatever. And so what this diagram says, which I don't know yet, I want to compute. Diagram says, which I don't know yet, I want to compute, is that here there's one solution, and then we have a bit of bifurcation, and then it goes into two solutions. Okay, and that's what we want to discover. So what we want to do is we can solve the problem at an easy value, and then we use that as initial guess for the next parameter value along. So this sort of red line is the nonlinear problem we're solving. And then we can keep going. We can use this as initial guess for this guy. And then let's zoom into this continuation step. So what I've done is I've used this solution. So, what I've done is I've used this solution as initial guess for this problem, and I found this solution. So, now I can deflate that solution, and then I can start again from the same place. If I converge it, I'll converge to a different solution of the problem. And then I can deflate it again, I can look again, and then there's a search step that fails because there are no more solutions to find in this case, and then I can carry on. And so this has in the diagram has found solutions on all of these branches, and so now I've won. On all of these branches, and so now I've one. I have data on each of the branches in the problem. And importantly, this works even if you break the symmetry. So this kind of bifurcation structure is associated with the Z2 symmetry of the problem. Left and right are the same, or up and down is the same, whatever. But, you know, we live on Earth where there's gravity, so down is not the same as up. And so if you do an experiment in such a situation, these are the bifurcation arguments that you get. Generically, these pitchforks disconnect. Pitchforks disconnect, and you get a fold bifurcation here, and an isolated branch with no bifurcations. And you can still find these solutions. So it allows you to compute disconnected bifurcation diagrams, which is really sort of the mathematical novelty of it. There are other algorithms for computing connected bifurcation diagrams, but disconnected ones are much harder. Okay, and so before we dive into the semectics, I just, so someone said, who was it? It was you, Nisa, that said, it's not smectics, it's new. I said, it's not smectics, it's layered fluids, right? So, colosterics and fair game. And so, here is some work that I did with Tim and Scott on colosterics. Okay, so in the absence of boundaries, right, so we know that the cholesteric adopts this helical structure with a preferred pitch. And what we're going to do is, Tim is really cruel, right? He likes forcing colosterics to do things that they don't want to do. So he says, ah, rather than solve it on a disk where I can sort of adopt this. On a disk where it can sort of adopt this structure uniformly, we'll solve it on an ellipse so that it can't do what it wants to do, and then it's going to be geometrically frustrated and it has to resolve this frustration, either by deforming the cholesterol layers or introducing defects, and there's going to be lots of different ways of resolving this tension. I have to give you lots of different local minimizers. So, having said in my fighting talk this morning that I'm going to minimize Osine Frank, I'm going to minimize Osine Frank with the cholesterolic term in the ellipse with sort of Term in an ellipse with sort of a uniform Dirichlet condition on the boundary. So the director field is pointing up. So here I'm solving in a 2D domain, but I'm solving for a three-dimensional director field. We've got some Frank constants, and these Frank constants you chose carefully to be weird by Tim. Yeah, and there's no electric field. I forget how they're weird, but Tim is. I'm glad that Tim is here because he answers these guys' questions. Why did you make K2 so big? We wanted to make it internally frustrating. To make it internally frustrating, as in it's forced to twist, but it really doesn't want to. So it's really fake. But yeah. So it's a crazy material. But we were more interested in finding a problem that would have a really dense solution set. So this kind of fit the middle. And it succeeded. Yeah, so here's a part of the bifurcation diagram that we Part of the bifurcation diagram that we compute. So here we're changing this cholesteric pitch from 5 to 9. And so each point on this diagram is a distinct solution of the Austin-Frank PDEs. And I color it, I shade it rather, by its stability. So the stable ones are thick black. And sort of the lighter the gray, the higher the more syntax, the more unstable it becomes. And in particular, this sort of this critical pitch for the aspect rate, I think this. For the aspect ratio, I think this was an aspect ratio in this 1.5, but it's been a few years. This diagram is funny. Where sort of there's some kind of funny interaction between the cholesterol pitch that the cholesterol wants and the geometry. So you get really this sort of crazy solution set. So if you zoom into this square, then you get something like this. You get tons and tons of stationary points, over using a frame, minimizer, including a bunch of stable solutions. And so I was worried how this would come out in the particular. I was worried how well this will come out on the projector. I'm not sure it comes out super well. But anyway, so we render diagrams like this, where sort of on the x-axis you've got the colosteric pitch, and here we're showing the pictures of the solutions, right? So this is a rendering of the mirror field. Although maybe you need to sort of stand here in order to see what these pictures are, and then we show where the energetic trade-offs arise. So these weird smiles and poses. Just tell me what I'm looking at. Just tell me what I'm looking at. Yeah, so these are rendering. So each pixel here, which you can't, you probably can't see. I can barely see it. I'm standing here. Is rendered as a tube that shows the orientation of the director. So when I see something dark, all we see here is dark and white. Those are regions, probably where the lines overlap. Right, so it's dark in the plane. You're seeing, you're basically seeing the colors are going to end up. The the colours are going to end up giving you contours of constant orientation. So when it's dark, that's their line and it's seeing it rotating and you're getting like a number of periods of rotation. One of them looks like a Batman actually, but I yeah it's worth it's worth the Batman. Spot the Batman? You know you had trouble. Yeah, exactly. Francesca had surprised. She spotted the Batman. Great job, Francesca. No, this is too narrow, too. It looked better on a poster. I'm not going to lie. I'll zoom in. I'll zoom in. I'll try. Okay, but anyway, so this is just a really isn't a tech demo to show that you can extract a lot of different solutions. Automatic. Well, there was a Well, there was a fair amount of work from the two men, but you know, from our perspective. It was automatic for you. From our perspective, it was like, yeah. Good. Okay, so anyway, so with that mathematical interlude over, now I've kept you in suspense. Let's see some spectrum simulations. So we have three cases that we considered, so I'll take them in turn. So first of all, we take a rectangular channel and then we impose boundary conditions on the Q tensors so that the director field Tensors so that the director field sort of is, you'll see it in the movie, it'll be clear, but we're going to vary sort of the angle of the director field relative to the boundary. And then, so this forces a bend, deformation of this magnetic, and so it can either bend the layers or it can introduce disclinations. And which one of these it wants to do is governed by the energetic competition, cost, the energetic cost of doing these different things. And so here are the parameters, and as I thought, yeah, B is equal to Z. But I think we took all of these parameters except for L. Took all of these parameters except for L, which is the new parameter that we introduced from Jonathan's pick, if I remember correctly, or maybe like small modifications thereof. We started there and then fussed around it in a parameters. Okay, and so we ended up making a diagram like this. Okay, so let me navigate you through this. I hope this is at least a little bit clearer, I think. So here's the angle of the director from boundary. Each one of these. Each one of these is a solution to the optimality conditions. The stable ones, the ones that you might hope to see perhaps in an experiment, are marked with this small asterisk here in the corner. We organize them by energy. So this is the ground state that we found. We don't know that we compute all of the minimizers, so there might be other solutions that are better than these ones, but we looked quite hard. So this is probably the right way to go. And so you see, for example, so when theta is equal And so you see, for example, so when theta is equal to zero, you've just got this sort of extended bookshelf geometry, and you know, for small angles, it starts deforming the layers, right? And then at a certain critical angle, okay, project is. It starts bending the layers and then it starts introducing this connection. And then, in sort of the other minimizers, you can see that, well, for example, I really like this one where it For example, I really like this one, where it it starts off straight and it ends up straight, but it sort of goes to sort of the next the next guy along, right? That's also a minimizer, not a good one, not energetically favoured, but you could do it. And so, and up at the top, if I remember correctly, these are the ones with melting tone, right? So, so these are also solutions of the PDEs, but maybe that's interesting. So, that's just everyone else has movies. What is on the names? What does that mean? I want it to be reverses. Okay, so here we're just going to render. So these are quite the spectral layers, I should say. We're just going to render the ground state that we found for each. And we were helpful in now you can see it. Is this with the deflation method or just straight minimization? So all of those solutions we found with deflation and then we picked the best one energetically and then we made the movie out of that. But may I question? So this is the lowest energy, so we can but uh when you you increase the angle uh The angle, don't you think that you may try to find a solution with another because you have several minimizer and then you can think that one may be the lowest energy solution for some anchor, so also one may be the lowest. Yeah, exactly. So, I mean, you see the trade-offs, right? So, what you're saying is that sort of, you know, the So, what you're saying is that sort of, you know, the one branch might be the minimizer for some angle, and then it might lose. Yes. And you see this exactly. So, here, this is the pure bend solution. And then, at this value, here's a pure bend solution, but it's no longer energetic context. But now, the solution that introduced disclinations is energetic context. Okay, so the film that you have is the bottom row. It's only the bottom row. So, it's not the lowest energy solution as a function of the As a function of the variation of angle. Yeah, it's at every angle, what was the lowest energy solution we found? Ah, this is that. Independent of what the ground is. Maybe, maybe not. Do I Tim will be next to you? Covering me in these situations. Okay, so having seen this, we thought, well, maybe there's something to this model, so then we carried on. So then we thought that we would try to simulate some. We thought that we would try to simulate some focal conic domains. So, we've heard a lot about focal conic domains, so I probably don't need to tell anybody here. You probably know a lot more about SDs than me. To the best of my knowledge, but maybe please do tell me, if I'm wrong, I don't know this. I don't think they've ever been discovered numerically by minimization of a general energy functional before. That may be a bulbic type energy that's key to the top. So, let's look at the movie. Movie? I never get along with Max, so apologies if I'm moving. Okay, so let me just briefly explain what we're going to see, first of all. Okay, so I actually forget about boundary conditions being posted, but I think it's the same boundary conditions that we had earlier, of sort of planar on the bottom and predictor on the top, but maybe I'm wrong. We can write much right than text. Okay, so visualizing these tweaks. So visualizing these 3D structures is really hard, as we've seen several times today. So the way that I'm going to do it, it may not be the best way, but the way that we're going to do it, is we're going to look at the zero isosurfaces of the density variation. So we're going to take all the surfaces where the density variation is zero, and we're going to plot those. And now, in order to sort of show the internal structure of those isosurfaces, I'm going to add an artificial time. There's no time in the simulation, it's just a pure minimization. The simulation was just a pure minimization of a static equilibrium, but I'm going to sort of cut, so you can see sort of the bottom, and then I'm just going to raise the plane up to the top. And then I'm going to color the surfaces just by their depth, just for visualization purposes. So this is, we're not showing anything about the Q tensor or the directory, which of course we're also computing. This is purely just to see the structure of the layers. And what interested us is that, so we found a focal colonic domain solution, which is going to be the one here. Which is going to be the one here. But we also found two other very closely related solutions, which we call the single screen or the double screen, for reasons that will become clear. So I'll play this movie a few times because it'll actually tick in. Okay, so those are the solutions that we got for the F C D in the X and Y directions? I think it was natural boundary conditions in the X and Y directions, yeah. So So, um, so you would we would have called it talk-free. We wouldn't call it talk-free unless liquid questions because it's mostly about to have one secret but control. The boundary is free. The orientation is free if you can. Exactly. Yeah, we're not imposing any constraints, it's just whatever whatever boundary condition minimizes the energy overall, whatever solution of the battery minimizes the energy. And you don't make you don't have a transverse olivity condition? If you don't have a transverse element, so I mean, we were super happy to find one solution, and then I see Mohammed's pictures, and I'm like, oh man, how are we going to get 500 of these? Future work. So I would love to know, does anybody have any thoughts about the single screw and double screw solution? So numerically, at least, you can check these things and they're local minimizes on the energy. Of the energy. So, but are these ever observed? Has anyone ever seen structures like this before? Are they experimentally distinguishable? I have no idea. So it could be an artifact of our theory, right? That's a possibility, you know, because we have this weird dodgy numerical spectrum theory. So this could be kind of something that emerges from that, or they could be something. Yeah. Yeah, so that's sort of the question is there. So this is a consideration which is just a rambling on my part. So experimentally, the focal chronic domain happens if you have like there's a minimum amount of volume that you need to create a photonic. So you wouldn't see a focal chronic domain in a very thin layer of material, but you would need to get above the surfacing. So how does that? Because this to me looks like a few layers, but I don't know how scalable it is with the number of layers because I guess with a few layers it's very difficult to get for one experiment on it. So maybe the question is about the size and the dimensions. Yeah, if I remember correctly, it's just a unit cube. Is that right, Tim? Do you remember the. So the aspect ratio here is the same in all directions? Relative to the layer spacing, right? Yeah. I mean, you can sort of get a sense of what the Q parameter is from these. Here, you see, we don't have very good solvers for this model, right? So, sort of numerically, we're constrained in how much resolution we can throw at it. So, we would love to do finite resolution simulations with high IQ, but that's gonna work work in progress. So, there's maths to be done to make that possible. But don't you think the second one, the third one, The second one, the third one, the second one, especially, the middle one. That's great. There's only one surface there. So, from the point of view of nuclear weapon growth, that's much easier to do. So, if you had something and you were trying to grow a thing with sample, that should be much easier to do. So, if you had, for instance, you had the right boundary conditions and you had a gradient, so it was matic here and symmetric below, you could imagine. Here in symmetric below. You can imagine that one growing in very easily. So I'm not sure that in an experiment, I don't think we could distinguish those two, right? But you know. Well, maybe we could like freeze fracture TM kind of thing, you know, if you were really lucky. You were really lucky and you got just the right angles. But the thing about it is that the middle one, the middle one, I mean, that's like a Frank Reed sort. The middle one, I mean, that's like a Frank Reed source. That's how real crystals grow. So, if you were growing the smectic from the surface, and the smectic always starts at the surface, because the surface enhances smectic orbital. So, you may not be surprised that the word middle one or the one to the right. That's why continuous, right? So, if you told me, dude, will you keep going? No, no, this is exactly the discussion I wanted to provoke, so please go. The discussion I wanted to provoke, so please. Do you want to Claymont do something on this? I feel like Claymont gave talks about focal connectomies that also had dislocations in them. Oh, the little turtle ones? Yes, exactly. Okay. That was it? It was not the same. It was not the same. But it could have been. We're over time, so I think I'm going to encourage Patrick to wrap up. Sure. Well, I've just got one place. Well I've got one more. So here we impose a tilt, which I now gather is experimentally very difficult. And you can also find multiple solutions. But whatever. Okay, and so the very last. Just to go back to the common experimental biotrophy, I think they are biotic and microscopic and difficult to distinguish, but they are all again either made by you have cited them, Gru and Bar, that And bar that are really pretty symmetric, and they are really looking at the surface, the top surface. So, but it may depend on the but it's on silicon substrate or very flat or like that, I guess. But here, it could happen like this. It could be that the middle is how it grows. And then when you wait, it becomes the thing on the left, which is lower energy. Ah, yes, I would be able to do that. So that could be a growth mechanism. Cool. Anyway, Scott's. Okay. Stitch them together? Good question, also. So that's another thing that we would love to try. This was as far as we got, and then Jingmin finished a PhD, and then I did. Yeah, because possibly when they are feather, they will favor one of the solutions. So we want to start doing things. We want to start doing things like packing them together to see if you can. Doing things like packing them together to see if you can get multiple SCDs and maybe different kinds. Anyway, so we've seen these pictures already. So now we're going to try to solve these great tin filters to simulate these oddly streak textures. Okay, and you all know that it's tricky to figure out what's going on at the interface, so let's see what happens. So we consider a box of aspect ratio lambda, which we're going to vary, right, that's our deflation parameter. And then here again are some solutions. Here again are some solutions. So we find this absolute ticket of solutions. It's a diagnaric numerically, it's completely. But so again, so sort of these are the solutions. Here it's on top for some reason. These are the best ones that we have. And I'll end with the movie Size Cloud. Okay, so here again, the same game. We plot the lowest energy solution we find as a function of the aspect function. And so you see, we find these minimizers that do look, could applause, I don't know, to my eye, plausibly like the structures that Jean Didieux and Emmanuel were discussing earlier. Okay, and so we've already had a lot of discussion, so Okay, so what do we do? We have this new model of respect to gay liquid crystals. Discretization is hard. We compute multiple analyzers. And here's the paper. But we have some questions. So on the physics side, is this the right model? Can we do experiments to identify these model parameters whether picking the nine of our hats? To actually get quantitative agreement? Is that too much to ask? What simulations can we do that with neural insight that would be useful for With neural insect that would be useful for crystal scientists. And on the math side, there's a bunch of questions. How should we formulate and discretize this model? So Dozi's will present a better discretization tomorrow. And how do we solve this model efficiently so we can really do higher resolutions? And with that, I'll end 15 minutes left. Thanks very much.
