And for the second talk this in the morning session, we are very happy to have Darong Cheng from University of Miami. And he is going to tell us about a variational characterization of calibrated subman. Thank you. And I'd like to thank the organizers for the invitation. It's great to be back in Canada, especially to visit this beautiful part of it. And very happy that both my collaborators Very happy that both my collaborators are here. So maybe they can help me out a bit with some of the questions. I'll start by reminding you what a calibration is. It's a concept that involves a Riemannian metric and a form. If you take a k-form and you feed a collection of orthonormal vectors into it, you always get something between minus one and one. Actually, one of the Actually, one of these inequalities probably, but anyway, then we call it a calibration. And when you restrict it to a k-dimensional sub-manifold, you get, of course, a function times the volume form of the induced metric. And that function is going to take values between minus one and one. And if it's identically one, we say the sub-manifold is calibrated. And the calibrated condition involves a metric. A metric, a form, and a sub-manifold, and I should say that the characterization we have in the title is not so much a characterization of calibrated sub-manifolds, but more a characterization of the calibrated condition. So, when that condition is met, so you have metric form, sub-manifold related in some way, you feed them. You feed them into a functional, and you ask what happens to that. Well, in our case, it's the volume. And you ask what happens to that functional when you move one of these. Anyway, so the inspiration behind the result that motivated this project is this classical theorem in calibrated geometry that says. In calibrated geometry, that says if the form is closed, then calibrated sub-manifolds are volume-minimizing. So they have less volume than any other submanifold, which are homologous to them. Oh, and throughout this talk, when you see M, that means the ambient manifold. When you see sigma, it either means summation or a a compact submanifold. A compact submanifold. And compact means compact without boundary. So if I forget to say what it is, it's compact without boundary. And embedded, just for simplicity. The proof is rather simple. So you think of two functionals. One is the volume of the sub-manifold. The other is integrating alpha over it. One always lies above the other because alpha is a calibration. And integrating alpha. And integrating alpha is actually a constant on a homology class, that's slope theorem. And because alpha is closed. And the two functionals coincide at sigma because it's calibrated. Now if you read the inequality, it's like this, you go here, and then it's out, this is that, and then that flow that. You see that if you have any. That if you have any sigma prime that's homologous to sigma, then the volume is larger. In particular, just take some contacts with supported vector field on your ambient space and look at the flow it generates, that's Vt. You move your submanifold around by it, then for small t you're gonna get something homologous. And so the volume stays above the volume of the original stuff. The volume of the original stuff. So that thing as a function of t as a local minimum at t equals zero. So the first derivative is zero, second derivative is non-negative. This being true for all x means your sub-manifold has a vanity mean curvature, so it's a minimal sub-manifold. This being non-negative for all x means that it's stable. So starting from the calibrated condition, we figured something out about the derivative of the volume. Figured something out about the derivative of the volume with respect to variations of the submanifold. They're stable and minimal. Sometimes the converse is true. That's a separate story. It'll take me another hour to do it full justice, so I won't comment further on that. But in those cases, you have characterizations of the calibrated conditions in terms of conditions you can formulate in terms of. Conditions you can formulate in terms of derivatives of the volume. What we want to do is something similar, but instead of moving the sub-manifold, we move the metric on the ambient space. The next two slides are going to be, or three, I forgot. The next two slides are going to be just Riemannian geometry. We forget about the calibration for a second. I just want to get out of what I mean by varying the metric. So you fix your sub-manifold. Closed means compact without boundary. I forgot to change that. And you compute its volume with respect to different ambient metrics. That defines a functional on the space of metrics. You vary your metric through a path. And for convenience, instead of considering these varying volume forms, you can also write them in terms. Volume forms, you can also write them in terms of a varying function times a fixed volume form, where by this I mean these are k-forms on a k-manifold, so they're multiples of each other. This quotient is that modifier. Real value function. And standard exercise in Riemannian geometry, you can compute this time derivative at t equals zero, which I'm going to call the first derivative of script v at g in the direction of. In the direction of h, where h is the time derivative of this path at t equals zero. And compute that it is just one half, and you integrate the trace of h along sigma using the volume form. So the trace is just a half. So Where you want to use any orthonormal basis of the tangent space to signify the point of interest. Now, what we want to do is I say two slides. Let me just one slide. I have two or three. Okay. So what we want to do is the question we want to ask is, just take some calibration and some compact submanifold. When the calibration condition is satisfied, what can we say about this first variation of This first variation of script V. And if you look at the previous formula, you'll see that it doesn't make sense. I mean, asking it to vanish for all H is too strong because you can just take H to be G itself. And the right-hand side would be a module of the volume of sigma, which wouldn't be zero unless sigma is in there. So we should restrict the space of an again. Space of variations appropriately. Anyway, and the second question is: whatever condition we derive from the calibrated condition on the first variation, do they, so does the converse hold, do they imply calibratedness? In all the situations, we care about We care about. The calibration can be varied in such a way that it still determines metric, that it still determines a metric with respect to which it is a calibration. So we'll restrict to those kinds of metric variations. And also some terminology. A theorem that provides an answer to the first question, I'll call it a theorem A. A theorem that provides an answer to the second question, I'll call a theorem B. Question: I'll call a theorem B. You'll see four each: one in the UN case, two in the G2 case, one in the spin seven case. And oops, so here's the result that motivated our project, studiozal and certain. They actually have two papers, one in 2015 where they considered decay state equals one, and then this one from 2016. So, suppose you have a UN package. Package. So some even dimensional manifolds with a Riemannian metric, j is an orthogonal, almost complex structure, and you define your Taylor form in the usual way. Omega xy is g of jxy. And you assume omega is closed. And it takes some even-dimensional sub-manifold, compact embedded, almost complex. That is calibrated by omega. Now, here's how we vary the metric: take some compactly supported one form. I'm not assuming that m is compact. Take some compactly supported one form, d it, and take its 1,1 part. We're fixing this j. We're not fiddling around with j, we're just moving omega and then using omega to define different j's. So that this decomposition forms into 0, 1, 1. formed into so 011 uh 02 that stays same take d alpha take its one one form now for small t this thing is still going to be a positive one one form so do this or use my hands quite better um if you do this you'll still get a Riemannian metric with respect to which j is orthogonal and the result is that if you start from almost complex submanifold and for all such variants Complex submanifold, and for all such variations of the metric, first derivative of square b is zero. I'll not present the proof of this theorem A. I'll say that for one of our theorem A's, because I think the G2 case is actually simpler. Also, I've seen about the second delivery. I don't think it's nice. Um they Uh they it's non-negative. It's not negative, yeah. Now so in in the paper they do they have a theorem for the first derivative and they have a theorem for the second derivative. We only generalize the parts about the volume is determined logically for far away. Well, I know we just got to improve it. Okay. Um I didn't mean to I didn't mean to cut you cut you off. I have no table, sorry. All right, so these new omega t's right here. That's a plus. That's a key. There's no calibration. So if you raise them to that power and divide by the correct factorial, the calibrations. With respect to this new metrics. So, same story as in the proof of the Harvey-Lausan theorem. You think of two functionals. One is the script V, the other is integrating the form over the submanifold. One always lies above the other because the form is a calibration. At t cap zero, the calibration condition is met, so we have equality. Quality. I lied about the second derivative, but let's first settle the thing about the first derivative. So they have, okay, so you have two functions. One always lies about the other, and they touch at t equals zero, so they have the same derivative there. And when you differentiate this, And when you differentiate this, that's what you get. We're assuming that sigma is J holomorphic, so when you read this line, it should go from right to left. And you take this form, and you integrate it over sigma. Because sigma is almost complex, it's only going to see the kk part of this. But this is k minus 1, k minus 1. So only the 11 part can. So, only the one-lone part contributes. So, that goes that. Now, because omega is closed, that's exact. And then the Stokes theorem tells you it's zero. I think we didn't lie about the second view of it because if you look at the first slide, you can add an equality and put it at t equal to zero because they are in the same chromology class. I put it in t, but what I want to do is generate it. When k equals one, I think the second derivative is non-negative. Because when k equals one, that second function is constant. That's the kind of conversation that the three of us have been having throughout this project. We were confused by these results and so anyway. All right, so now there's a converse. Same assumption about ambient structures. And now you just sort of reverse the roles of the Reverse the roles of the assumption and the conclusion. So we just take some compact embedded even-dimensional sub-manifold. Same class of variations of the metric. We assume that the derivative at zero always vanishes for all such variations. Conclusion is that sigma is calibrated. Either sigma is calibrated, or it with the opposite orientation is calibrated. I'll actually go through the proof of, well, I went through the proof of the previous one here, but I will not go through the proof of our theorem B's in detail because the calculations were brutal to X zero. Let's just understand what the assumption is saying. Your metric is going like that. So when you differentiate it, I want to and if you plug these horizons in, you see that it's just I get that. The assumption says that if you trace this thing over sub-manifold and integrate over the sub-manifold, you get zero. For any choice of compact, it supported one form on the NBN space. So the game is to make the right choice. And here. It's quite disappointing that we haven't. I mean, we were able to understand the calculation and we managed to find the right generalization to the G2 and spin-7 cases, but we don't have a very good geometric application. There's no beautiful picture I can draw to tell you what actually is happening when we deform the ambient structures with the choice of alpha. But anyway, this is the choice. Anyway, this is the choice. So, and this is where we use the embeddedness. Take the distance to the sub-manifold as well. Okay. On a trivial neighborhood, you do that, and then you cut it off outside. Okay, so, but basically, you can think of f as just one-half the squared distance. Okay, now, on sigma, on sigma, you have that the gradient is zero and it has. You have that the gradient is zero and the hashing just picks out inner product of the volume at the vertical at the normal parts. Another standard exercise in Riemannian geometry. Okay, that's just on sigma. Off sigma you get other terms. Now alpha is this. The one form is just that. So that's basically hooking. So that's basically hooking gradient F into omega. And you can just compute directly what d alpha is. And it turns out it looks something like that. So now you plug in, so now you plug this in here. Then only the first term here counts because over here you'll have that's EI and that's j squared of EI which is minus EI, but you're taking normal parts and EIs are tangents. So this term will drop out when you do that calculation. You're just looking at that term, but that gives you some of squares of the normal parts. Our assumption tells you that x integrates to zero on sigma. It's a non-negative thing, so it vanishes everywhere. But that tells you that Is everywhere, but that tells you that J sends a tangent vector to a tangent vector. So tangent states are preserved by J, your sub-manifold is J Hallmarker. This seems to say you don't mean so just any one problem, right? It seems like you don't need any every one problem, just think these Johnian functions, DCX. That's right. So the theorem can be made stronger by just saying actually you only need to check the DCX. To check the DCS rather than having to check for every alpha. That's right, yeah. In fact, then, yeah, then as I was construction, it would have got the other way. He would have just said it's D alpha 1, 1 would not be anyway. Yeah. You're absolutely right, but the reason we write it this way, because I reason with some voted than what you're saying. We write it this way because when you do the G chance been set in case you can't take it. Okay, we'll move on. Now, so we saw those results and got excited, well Jesse got excited first and decided to try to generalize that to the Try to generalize that to the G2. So of course, I'm not the one to tell you what the G2 structure is, but one has to, for the sake of building a narrative, one has to say something about it. So you can think of a G2 structure as a three form that determines a Riemannian metric. 37 Avenue linear. And it determines a metric with respect to which it is a calibration. And its Hodge dual is also a calibration. Their calibrated submamples are the associatives and the co-associative. There are formulations of the calibrated condition in terms of these. Condition in terms of these vector-value things. I'm mentioning these because their normal parts, the norms squared of their normal parts, are going to appear in the proofs, which is sort of the analog of this. So using the metric, using the three form and the metric it induces, you can find a cross product like that, using that relation. And it's called a cross product because it has. Because it has these properties that it's orthogonal to both factors and its length is equal to the length of the two vector x wedge y and there's similar construction you can do with There's a similar construction you can do with the full form, but you don't get a cross product in that sense. It's still orthogonal, so it's two to three factors, but I don't think you get the second one. But despite that, you can still formulate the associative and co-associative conditions in terms of what these tangent vectors. Tangent vectors. Plus minuses means up to changing orientation. Okay, so if the cross product of two tangent vectors is still tangent, then you can conclude that your second angle is associative up to real. Similarly for co-associatives. Okay, so here's our theorem A. Remember, it's theorem A addresses the question of assuming calibratedness, what can you say about the derivative of script V? That's a V, yeah, that's a V. So you start from a standard manifold with a G2 structure. And you take a compact tree manifold, which is associated. True manifold, which is associated. Here's how we deform the metric. Just take some compactly supportive two-form, and for small t, this is still going to be a G2 structure. And as such, it determines a metric with respect to which it's a calibration. And the conclusion is that for all such variations of the metric, that derivative is zero. And the proof is actually simpler than. The proof is actually simpler than in the U1 case. We don't have this transaction in business. Yeah, okay, so again, you think of two functionals. Script V and integrating the form over the submanifold. I think there's a one lies above the other because Vt is a calibration. And at T pro zero, the calibration. And at trolle zero, the calibrate condition is met, so you have equality. And so the two functions have the same derivative, but the derivative of this guy is just integrating d beta, net zero, because we're going to be able to do it. Okay, so that's lots of variations to consider. Now, the converse is also true. So now you start from some compact embedded three-manifold. You don't assume it's associated. You assume that for all such variations of the metric, that derivative is zero. I'd try to write equals zero. Then Then then it's a manifold associated. The proof follows the same structure of the theorem B in the UM case, that the Arzos-Swan theorem B. So let's again first understand what the assumption is saying. Contrary to the UN case where one-line derivation of what the derivation of the metric looks like, now it becomes a very complicated formula. Becomes a very complicated formula. So just in general, if you vary your three-form like this, again for small t, it's a it's still a g2 structure, so it determines a metric gt, and if you compute the time derivative of those metrics at zero, then you can think of that as an assignment that gives you a symmetric two-tensor from a three-form. And it turns out that the formula of H in terms of eta is this, where eta has In terms of eta is this, where eta hat is that thing. Here's a summation going on. I and j both go from 1 up to 7, and e1 up to e7 is just any choice of the normal basis for the tangent space of the men may unfold. Okay, uh I'm yeah. So the assumpt uh the assumption of our theorem The assumption of our theorem means that if you trace this along the sub-manifold, and if eta is any compactly supported beta, you take eta to be d beta. The assumption says that h of d beta, when you trace that along a sub-manifold and integrate it over it, you get zero. So now it's about making the right choice of beta. And the choice that worked is arrived at after multiple trial and errors. We comment on that process in the paper, I think. So I'm not going to go through the story again here. It's still based on the distance function. So again, we need to embed. Function. So again, we need the embeddedness. Okay, so once again, here are these properties on sigma. So if you take an analogy with the complex case, right here, our choice of alpha was something like that. You might want to try something like, and that's really just putting red F into omega. You might want to try something like this for beta, but that didn't work. And it occurred. It occurred to us that maybe instead of just using one vector field, we should try to build a two-form using a three-form and two-vector fields. So, in addition to grad F, we just take some tangent vector field on sigma and just extend it arbitrarily to the ambient space to be compactly supported. And we take Bay O'Shea. Then we take Bay as V d and I'm identifying two vectors with forms using the metric and yeah the rest is just calculation we just compute d beta, fit that into those formulas. That's some kind of projection of file. Projection of files, some kind of projection of V wrote, some components of that because you're putting V in the second slot and then you're merging with V so that it's killing some of the components dropping the rule of projection stuff. So it came out to be that, and we derived that, I think, using two methods with coordinates and with frames, and we got the same answer. So I think that's okay. But anyway, but the assumption says that this interverse The assumption says that uh this integrates to zero on sigma, so uh that tells you that this vanishes everywhere, but from that you get that the cross product of any two tangent vectors is still tangent. So the submanifold is associated. Again, I wish I could tell you what I what exactly these metrics are doing when beta is down. Are you doing when beta is death, but you haven't quite figured out a geometric application explanation? And let me just say that we have an almost identical pair of theorems for co-associatives. So you don't have to read this. This slide is just there just to say, just to tell you that we have almost identical theorems for co-associatives. Of co-associatives. Now we move to the spin 7 case. The situation in the spin 7 case is actually quite different from the G2 case. Again, I'm not the one to tell you what a spin 7 factor is, but for the sake of storytelling, one has to do with takes you to read distance function and then you use that chi. Yeah, you use the chi, yeah. So it's it's gonna be uh I can. I can some buttons now. We want to reform. So we use that objection. Could you say it's more inverted? say I take a space of two points and some paper that's going to take space on components and you throw away the normal A standard standard structure can be thought of as a full form that determines every minimum metric in some even more nonlinear way. Anyway, and they are calibrations with respect to the metrics they induce, and the calibrated submanifolds are called KLEs. And also with respect to the ball uh the metric it induces itself the wall. Metric it induces itself to more. And again, the calibrated condition in this case has a formulation in terms of cross product. So here we have a threefold cross product defined in terms of this relation. And that is a cross product in a sense that's similar to the twofold cross product in the P2 case. So if this threefold cross product sends Threefold cross product sends a triple of tangent vectors to a tangent vector, then your submacco is Kaylee. I guess I should put plus minus. Okay, now here's a major difference from the G2 case. It's that not all four forms generate variations of the spin seven structure through spin seven structures. Seven structures? Actually, the tangent space non-degenerate four forms consists of just these three are the four pieces into which the four forms decompose with respect to capital V. And as such, we decided to start from theorem B. If you If you want to draw a complete analogy with the G2 case, you would think of variations of phi so that the time derivative at zero is just d gamma. But from the previous slide, you can't do that. So first thing I'll provide my marker again. So first thing you might want to try is First thing you might want to try is you project away the 27 parts and just look at the path of spin 7 structures like this. That's the first thing we tried. It didn't work. It didn't work. And then we realized that we have to drop the one part as well. And then it worked out. So if we look at, if we suppose that for any compact we support three form, if theta is a path of spin seven structures, that's tangent to that at t equals zero, and g zero and gt is family of metrics they reduce and if the derivative of mu of script v is zero for all such variation of the metric then sigma is k up to changing orientation why you have to try It's very dramatic reason why you have to drop the one part of the the one part is uh so it's like this so uh forget about the forget about metrics for a while for general fourth one you can define a symmetric two tensor through this formula now um I'll use good and uh if you're And uh if your uh spin standard structure is varying like this, then the metric would be varying yeah. Yeah, uh the the twenty seven part doesn't doesn't The 27 part doesn't, H does not see the 27 part. And but the one part, the one part contributes to the pure trace part of this symmetric two cancer. And that's like conformal deformations. And actually, the seven part doesn't contribute any of it at all. Plus, that is the third part. That contributes to the trace screen parts. No, but that's as geometric. Maybe just we don't know why we had to throw away the pipe. Because if you do that in the associated or co-associated case, it doesn't work. The one part has to be there in the G2 case, and it has to not be there in this fit sense. So just so I get the terminology as a noob, sigma Kaylee means omega-calibranded. Omega calibrated. Sigma Kaylee means omega calibrated. It's capital 5. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Klee means capital 5. So yes. Alright, so I want to sit over there. I want to set over there. If you consider a path of student seven structures generated by that, then this would be how the metric is changing. You put d gamma instead of eta. So the assumption says that this is zero for all complex and supported gammas. But you take the trace-free chart, you basically just change this from one over one twelve. It just changes from one over one twelve to one over nine six and but that worked anyway um the final part of the notion of the volume of the individual is the thing that you are trying to obtain the volume in the frequency value and then looking at the value. And you and then looking at the reading possible. I mean the total volume of the ambient manifold. But we're also not assuming the ambient manifold is compact. All right, I mean, you can read this. We made those a little bit. Once we figure out how Gordon is making the G2Ks, it's sort of not too surprising that similar choices work. The surprise was that we have to drop the one part. And here's what would happen if we didn't drop. Happen if we didn't drop the one part. So if we instead of using the trace-free part, we just use the full symmetric two tensor H of d gamma, we get this extra term over there. So if we drop the one part, we get that this integrates to zero. That's great because that tells us that triple cross product of three tangent vectors gives you another tangent vector. So it's calibrated up. It's calibrated up to reorienting. Whereas here, you can always look up tangent vector fields so that this thing integrates to something positive. Requiring that that integrate to zero for all choice of for all such gammas becomes too strong energy. So that's theorem P in the spin salon case. And now you think, alright, we just try to prove the converse. Well, it turns out that there's another twist here. We have to require something extra on the form. And what's rather dissatisfactory is that this condition depends on the submatter. This condition depends on the sub-manifold. Something similar is there in the UM case, but there the condition is sort of global. It would just require omega to be closed. And why should that condition be there? Because if you try to go through the proof of theorem A, okay, so it starts out similar. And so you take So you looked at these metrics as a capital fee determined by your path of spin 7 structures. And there are calibrations with respect to the metric they induce. So you still have that strip V lies above this functional, then get by integrating capital V of T over sigma. And they still have equality at T equals zero. Still have equality at t equals zero. So we can still say that they have the same derivative at zero. So far, so good. So now the derivative of this is, of course, that. And it's a fact that if you integrate a 74 form over a K4 manifold, you get zero. And when you restrict it to a K4 form, you get it zero. So before you get any. So you're just left with that. Now You're just left with that. Now, out of those four pieces that the four forms split into, I don't really need to migrate to you. These three are the self-remole port ones and the sorry, turn turn. So these are SNE, these are self-dual ones. So the 35 part is just the anti-self-dual part, and you get that by doing one half of the four. One half of the form minus its star. So that's how you get from the second to last line to the last line. And the first term is zero because sigma is compact. Second term is zero by assumption. The security of this term that is kill this term that explains why we have to make that assumption here and now you ask does this break the relationship between theorem a and theorem b it doesn't because it just so happens that this choice of gamma if you d it take its star and restrict it to sigma you just get zero so this particular gamma satisfies that condition that Convention that the integral. So we could modify theorem B to say that for all compactly supported three forms satisfying in addition that condition, which you vary the spin-seven structure like this, blah, blah, blah, blah. Structure like this, blah blah blah, then again you get that Ethereum A and E 1 B are conversant of each other. And again, I wish I had nice explanations of why we choose those variations, but we haven't come up with those. So I want to thank the organizers again for having me here, and I'll end that. I need that.
