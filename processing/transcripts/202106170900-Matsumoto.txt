All right. Well, I want to thank the organizers. This has been such an incredibly interesting workshop. I really loved all of the different perspectives that people have. I'm going to take a slight step away from the bio-inspired structures and think a little bit about what we call engineering-inspired structures. So, my group is Structures. So, my group is really interested in textiles. And so, I'm going to be telling you a bit about some of the not theoretic questions we're interested in studying when it comes to knitted textiles. This is a little bit different than the sort of tangles and weaves that NIF has because there's a certain set of rules that you have to follow. Rules that you have to follow. And I should point out that this story is joint work with my former PhD student, Shoshank Markande, who's now a postdoc at UCAT. And so what we're interested is is knitted structures. So this is a picture of a wall that I made back in grad school when I. Back in grad school when I had time to knit and have hobbies and things like that. And this is a close-up of it. And what you can see, this is the actual knitted object. And then this is basically the coat or the pattern that was used or that I followed to make it. And this particular pattern is called the Dragon of Happiness, and it was designed by Sharon Winzauer. Designed by Sharon Windsauer. And so, what you can see is that there's all of these little kind of ASCII symbols in here. Some of them are one pixel wide, some of them, there's one set down here. This is four pixels wide, some of them are two pixels wide. And so these are all topological manipulations that are, well, the vast majority of the world. Well, the vast majority of them are topologically distinct from one another that you can do with your needles as you're creating the structure. And so it's a little bit different than weaving in some of the other structures where everything really is this sort of binary one pixel, one bit kind of code. Bit kind of code. Here we're kind of playing around with these rectangular blocks. And I'm going to talk you through a little bit about how we think about this, how we construct, how we've sort of made a construction for capturing everything that can be hand-knitted is a subset of all possible configurations in this construction. And I'll, that's, and I'm going to tell you a couple properties we've proved about that construction. So, first, let me show you what knitting is. So, knitting, you have two needles. So, one in your left hand and one in your right hand. I'm going to be talking about hand knitting. Machine knitting is all of the topological manipulations are Manipulations are the same, but it's a more restricted subset of them. And obviously, you don't have the ability to have two hands manual dexterity. So there's basically a few restricted types of motions you can have there. And the thing that's a bit interesting about knitting is that everything happens in the middle of a piece of yarn. So you can imagine I have an infinite curve and An infinite curve, and one end goes off to infinity over here, and one end goes off to infinity over here. And I just have grabbed the middle section of it, and everything I knit can happen in that middle chunk. I don't need to deal with ends and things like that. So in this middle chunk, I have a bunch of loops on each of my needles. And you can, if you were thinking of this as a planar diagram, you can basically think of the needles. Think of the needles as being temporary punctures in the plane that are holding loops, so you can't sort of unravel them. But what happens in a knit is I take the needle in my right hand and I stick it through the loop on my left needle. Then I wrap the free yarn around that needle and I pull it through the loop on my left needle. I pull it through the loop on my left needle, and then lastly, slide it to my right needle. So basically, knitting is just a process of pulling loops through loops. And the way it's constructed, here is some more not theoretic diagrams of it. You have a coordinate system that's basically imposed. You have what's called the course direction. Called the coarse direction. So that's the direction along which you're knitting. So each piece of yarn in the coarse direction is actually next to that piece of yarn on your whole infinite curve. The whale direction, on the other hand, is when you turn around and go back the other way. So this is sort of going vertically up. So neighboring pieces of yarn in the whale direction come from. Yarn in the whale direction comes from very distinctly different parts of the yarn itself. And I'll tell you a little bit why we're interested in the topology and sort of relate this back to material science before turning to the math side. What we're going to be considering here today, by the way, are all, are only two periodic structures. So basically, they're just like the structures. They're just like the structures Nif was showing at the very beginning of her talk, where we're basically going to be considering, you know, these sides are glued up and these sides are glued up, but we've got some thickness to them. And the reason we're interested in this, I'm just going to make this illustration using what are called knit stitches and pearl stitches. What are called knit stitches and pearl stitches, which are basically just rotations of each other. So this is fabric that's called stockinette. It's also called jersey. This is just t-shirt material. It's common if you have anything that is stretchy that you're wearing, at least most likely it will be made out of this. This is all of the knit side's face. This is all of the knit sides facing you. If I were to rotate it this way, basically, just 180-degree rotation about the whale direction, I get what are called pearl stitches. So one is pulling the loop from the back of the yarn to the front, and the other is pulling a loop from the front of the fabric through to the back. And this, the idea that we were interested in studying initially is why different combinations. Different combinations of knits and pearls give you radically different fabric behaviors. So, this is actually a relatively stiff fabric. It's stretchy, but it's not very stretchy. Garter stitches alternating rows of knits and pearls. That's what I have here. And it's really stretchy in this direction and not so stretchy. It's pretty stretchy in this direction. It's actually stretchy. Pretty stretchy in this direction. It's actually stretchier than stocking up, but it's not as stretchy as it is in this direction. Then we get what's called one-by-one rib, and this is alternating columns of knits and curls, and this is just incredibly stretchy in this direction. The sort of elastic modulus is about an order of magnitude lower than it is for stock and net stitch. Stitch. And then lastly, we have a seed stitch, which is a checkerboard lattice of knits and pearls. And this one is, it's pretty stretchy, but it's pretty comparable to garter. So this is what we were originally interested in studying, and part of my group is working on this. But because we have these sort of subtle topological changes in the structure, we were also interested. The structure, we were also interested in thinking about what is even possible to knit. I mean, there's certain things I can knit with my hands that I can't knit on a machine. And that dragon is one of those things that I saw a stitch I'd never seen before. And that really got me interested in this question. So these are our knots, these are two periodic. These are two periodic knots, and we were naive physicists when we first did this. So we basically looked at this structure with periodic boundary conditions and then tried to glue it up. And so the first time I'm going to glue the top and the bottom around in front and then the left and the right side around behind. And the right side around behind. And then this is the structure I get. And you can convince yourself: I can sort of undo these loops here, and I end up with something that looks like an unknot. And on the other hand, if I were to glue the top and the bottom around behind and then the left and the right around. And then the left and the right around behind that, I end up with this other structure here. And what this looks like is now the connect sum of two trefoil knots of opposite-handedness. So this was our naive physicist thing. And it turns out that we had forgotten a little bit about the fact that we're really in T2 cross I. T2 cross I. So what we end up doing is these are both the same thing if you were to put them inside this manifold T2 cross I. And so this is also work done by Grishinov, Meshkov, and Vasilyev studied a lot of these textile knots, particularly in T2 cross I in great detail. Cross I in great detail. Another thing about these is that it seems like my choice of periodic boundary condition will affect what structures I can have. If I were to glue this up, even into 2 cross I, it appears to be a very different knot than if I were to glue this up. And it turns out that. It turns out that we do understand this, and I will, I'll try to remember to get back to it at the end if I have time. And if I don't, please ask me. But we do understand how to go back and forth between these two. And so one of the things that these three Grishinov et al. pointed out is that we can, instead of thinking about not strictly not strictly in this three-manifold T2 cross I. We can think about knots from the standard knot theory point of view in S3, but by removing a hopping from it. So basically what I'm going to be doing in this talk is we're going to be doing everything in S3. S3 or in T2 cross I, and I'm going to show you how those two constructions are related to one another. So basically what we do is we consider this is my knot again, and this is just my basic knit stitch. And I want to glue the green sides together and the red sides together. But now I want to do it in It in T2 cross pi. So I'm going to put that in my S3, where I've removed a tubular neighborhood of my hoplink. And now I'm going to wrap the green sides around the green curve here, like this. I'm going to wrap the red sides around the red curve. So first I'm going to kind of pull them up so you can see what's going on, and then I'm going to wrap them around. And I'm going to wrap them around. So, my top and bottom pieces have now been glued together, and they form this green annulus here. And the left and right are now this red annulus. And this here is my textile knot. And I'm going to sort of show that in maybe a more standard projection. Projection point. So basically, what's going on is we've got the Hopflink here. This is the bit in my T2 cross I picture. And then everything else is this sort of gadget that is showing how these must be interlinked in order for me to embed it in S3 appropriately. And so we're curious about. And so we're curious about what can possibly go in here. And so Shashank was wondering, he hadn't had, we have these stitch dictionaries of tons and tons of different stitches, and he'd been going through them and sort of had noticed that every single one of the examples, when viewed in S3, has this property that it's called ribbon. It's called ribbon. And he thought perhaps this was a counterexample of everything that's ribbon being knittable. And so he sent me this and I was like, since I have tons of experience knitting, I was like, I think we actually can knit this by hand. You definitely can't do it on a machine, but I think we can do it by hand. So bring some yarn and some needles. Yarn and some needles on Monday, and we'll check it out. Oh, I forgot to mention. So, ribbon, I'll show you a little bit more in detail what ribbon means, but basically, what you want to think about is taking your knot and then spanning it with a disk where the knot is the boundary of the disk. And then, if a knot is ribbon, you are only allowed a certain number of Number of a certain type of singularity, and basically that means that the whole ribbon band has to pass entirely through another ribbon band. So you can't have this sort of like X-shaped crossing. So you kind of want to think about it that way. And so we did actually knit this stitch. This is what it looks like. There are these sort of little dollops here. We've named it the cow hitch stitch. Stitch. And so from this came this conjecture that all knittable stitches must be ribbon. And then also we were wondering about the converse. Are all ribbon knots knittable? And so we've proved this first conjecture and proved that the converse is false. So basically, we've done this using what we call the swatch construct. Using what we call the swatch construction, and so this is, I'm showing it right now in this little t2 representation, or where, or in that gadget picture where I've sort of just cut out the dashed line boundary. But really, we want to think about this in this particular one. We really want to think about it in D2 cross I for right now. And so this is what we call. This is what we call the unknit, or this is the m by n unknit. So there's m contractible loops. So here I've kind of slid them over this, the place where I've sort of cut open my t2. And I'm in this gray region here, I'm just going to glue them down. So I can't touch them for now. They're just there. I get no choices. I get no choices, but everything else I'm allowed to ambiently isotope. And then we have N of these longitudes. And we're allowed to do any Rudomeister moves we like on these. So these are examples where we've got some Rhodemeister one moves here. Here, Ritemeister two moves here and here, and then Riddameister three moves in here. And you're basically allowed to do whatever you like. And then at the very end, we do this particular type of surgery. This is called bound surgery. And for those of you who don't know, it's basically here. I'm going to Here, I'm going to just illustrate it on this guy over here. So, I've got these two knots, and then I'm going to isolate a little rectangular region where two sides of the rectangle are contained in my original knot and two sides aren't. And then basically the surgery swaps those two edges so that the parts that were part of my knot are not, and the parts that weren't become part of the knot. And then this is. Knot, and then this is what happens. So, what I'm allowed to do is, I'm allowed to do band surgery connecting one of my longitudes or actually possibly multiple of my longitudes to these contractible loops up top. And so, this is the procedure, and this is what we call a swatch. And so, everything that's hand-knit is a Everything that's hand-knit is a subset of this. Although, what can be hand-knit is not a well-defined idea. That's why we're thinking about this, because there's the upper bound of complexity that I can do might be different than the upper bound of complexity that someone else can do, because it's the configuration space of things you can do with your hands is too high-dimensional for me to comprehend. So, this is a construction that contains everything that is. Construction that contains everything that is knittable. And so we've proved that all swatches are ribbon links. And so a ribbon link for us is, so we call an end component link in S3 a ribbon link if all of the components are ribbon. So that's different to say that than. say that then the if you span each component with a disk you have all singularities are allowable under these ribbon constraints everywhere between all pairs of disks. So this is only considering each individual component on its own. So basically it's you can You can be ribbon. And these are the different types of motifs, basically, that you're allowed to have if something is ribbon. So you're allowed to have sort of junctions like this. You can have cups and caps. You can have bands that may or may not have twists in them. You can have band crossings where one band crosses in front. Crosses in front or behind another, and you can have what are called ribbon singularities. And this is where an entire band passes through another entire band. And that's all you're allowed to have. And so first off, we needed to show that all of the Rittermeister moves do not introduce non-ribbon singularity. So this here is. So, this here is an example of a non-ribbon singularity, but you'll notice that Rhoda Meister 3, if it exists in one, it's going to exist in the other. So this can't introduce a non-ribbon singularity. So as long as we start out with something that's ribbon, all Rotomeister moves we do will maintain the fact that it is ribbon. And then Um, and then so this is what basically our construction is. So, um, this is again that's T2 cross I picture. Um, and here, this is a two by two unknit. And so basically, here's one ribbon disc, here's another ribbon disc, and then this is right now a ribbon annual. This is right now a ribbon annulus, and I'll get to turning it into a disc in just a moment. And so here we're allowed to do any ridden mister moves we like. So this is turning it into just a single knit stitch. And then we have to worry about the fact that this was an annulus and not an actual disc. And so what we do for this is to move it into S3, we need Into S3, we need to dainfill each of the hoplink components. And so whether or not these remain ribbon actually would depend on my choice of day and filling. But what I'm going to argue is that we have no choice. So when I originally cut out this piece, I respected the fact that Out this piece, I respected the fact that there was a course direction and a whale direction. Um, so the course direction has to be the longitude, so that the course direction is the direction where like the whole strand is connected. That's this. That has to be the longitude of my torus. I don't get a choice. And so I have to dain fill with a disk that goes along the longitude of my torus. The longitude of my torus. So I don't get a choice there. And actually, this is, I'm going to connect back to that idea at the beginning with those shears. So it turns out that each of my different choices of fundamental domain are related in this T2 cross I picture by different Dane fillings. So based on the generators of my fundamental domain, if I Dane fill according to those. According to those, I end up with the different knots, or conversely, I can undo it. I can undo my strange choice of shared fundamental domain by an appropriate choice of dain filling. So what we're thinking about now is trying to come up with a way of gluing these different swatch units together. So we basically have these. So we basically have the idea of, we call it an irreducible swatch is basically a swatch that can't be made by gluing two swatches together. And we're still working a little bit on formalizing the gluing process. So I didn't include that here, but we kind of understand what the combinatorics should be. So if I have these different m by n rectangles. M by n rectangles, we can look at all possible knitted fabrics by basically looking at some larger rectangle, a P by Q rectangle, and then filling those with all combinations of, you know, one by one, one by two, two by one possible swatches. So that turns into a combinatoric. A combinatorics problem. And I guess the other thing that we're interested in studying is what happens when you break the idea of periodicity. So when things are approximately too periodic, but then you have this place where your two periodic nature is broken. So what happens here is that we don't have any singularities. Have any singularities in the knits or the yarn themselves, but we do have singularities in my T2 cross I, or I'd have to take some much, much, much larger domain. Like the domain would be like the entire sweater or the entire sock for me to look at the topology of that. And so that's not so interesting. So we're sort of interested in. interesting. So we're sort of interested in how do we sort of reduce the area to sort of looking at. So this would be like a cone singularity. So looking at the point of that cone singularity and what knits are possible there. And the other thing we're interested in is lace. So this is something that I guess topologically is it still is too periodic, but from the mechanical But from the mechanical points of view, you have a lot of ability to control both the way you are embedded. This two-dimensional sheet is embedded in 3D. So I can create like this bunny head. And even if it is planar, I have now these sort of curves and shears and things inside the fabric. So that's sort of what. So that's sort of what we're thinking about in the future. Okay, so thank you so much, and I'd be more than happy to take any questions. Thank you. Thank you. That was really interesting. Any questions? And please raise your hand and we'll see you at the top or just on mute.
