Sometimes we can kind of cheat for various reasons, either because the screening is sort of strong or because we just consider cases where the spanishes. So, well, I talked about that situation in the liquid crystals. And for solids, you can also sometimes quote-unquote sheet by assuming that your polarization direction is, say, along the z-axis, and variations in it are only along the transverse directions, and you have no variations. Directions, and you have no variation in that orientation along the direction of the polarization. So if you have simply z-hat-oriented P with just an X and Y dependence, then you don't have to worry about these divergences and the bound charges and so on. So we'll kind of cheat mostly throughout this talk, but we'll mention a little bit about what happens when you have these long-range interactions as well. And so, if you have more than one stable orientation, you of course have domain walls. So, for a liquid crystal, the p-orientation can continuously vary, but as we'll see for the solids, it can't. It's locked to the crystallographic symmetries of your material, and so the polarization direction only has certain fixed values it can have, certain orientations. And as soon as you have at least one stable orientation, whether Least one stable orientation, whether it's through the crystal or through anchoring conditions, as Oleg discussed, you'll get a domain wall. So that's the topic we have. So just to compare, kind of, you know, bird's eye view of solids versus pneumatic ferroelectric materials for the solids, of course, they are present in some kind of crystalline material. And the polarization direction is intimately related to. Direction is intimately related to the arrangement of atoms in your crystalline lattice. And so, the kinds of samples you get, you just get a chunk of hard material, right, that you typically, you can't probe optically too well, so you use an AFM tip, as I'll show. And that's how you typically probe these domains here. So, this is a uniaxial ferroelectric. Ferroelectric uniaxial, meaning the polarization varies sort of in and out of the plane here. And you can see that if this is one of those situations where we might be able to cheat, where if it's a thin enough sample, you basically just have polarization sticking out and not sticking in. And the domain wall is just a reorientation of the polarization. And as you go from the red region to the blue region. And I'll talk about how these things are imaged and so on. And so on. The soft ones, which will comprise the second half of my talk, are these materials that Oleg mentioned already. One of the differences is the magnitude of the polarization vector is typically smaller in these soft materials. Parroelectrics have typically about an order of magnitude larger polarization. And the other important thing, of course, is the structure of domain walls is quite different. The switches between polarization orientations are quite different. Here you see a very narrow boundary. You can see the scale here is one micron. So these are sort of sub-micron variations. The domain walls are typically on the order of the lattice spacing of the crystal. So nano or sub-nanometric. Whereas in the soft materials, because you have a slowly varying. You have a slowly varying orientation of the molecules, your domain walls are typically quite large, so certainly larger than a microns. So, those are some of the differences. We'll see how that comes into play. As you can kind of imagine, because these are more sort of nanoscopic, noise and little bits of dirt in there with crystal defects and so on play a bigger role in what happens to these domains. What happens to these domain walls, as you say, switch from one orientation of the polarization to another orientation. So we'll see that as well. Okay, so how do you probe these things? Well, so we collaborate with a group at Oak Ridge that has these nice setups with an AFM tip that you drive in various ways. So, one thing you can do is you can So, one thing you can do is you can apply a potential between the AFM tip and the substrate where you place your solid ferroelectric. And you can induce via this kind of AC excitation reorientations of the polarization direction. At the same time, as that happens, you monitor the position of this AFM tip above the surface. And I'll explain why that is in a moment. That actually tells you what the polar. That actually tells you what the polarization direction is inside this material on that surface. And a lot of these probes involve switching. Basically, what you want to do is apply a sufficiently large electric field near the AFM tip that it produces a localized domain of switched polarization. So you might have one polarization orientation here, and then you switch to another one, and then that domain grows and expands over time. Main grows and expands over time, and you can sort of probe the response of the solid material to these kinds of local switches. So, the switches are largely going to be driven by both the nucleation process of the preferred polarization orientation that's induced by the electric field and the motion of those domain walls as they expand up. So, for the pneumatics. The pneumatics, the material is probed optically typically. Oleg talked extensively about the experimental techniques involved in analyzing these kinds of samples. But the thing that they share, I guess, is that to really understand which way the polarization is going, you do need to apply some electric field to see how the polarization direction reorients under an applied field. So, in both cases, In both cases, I have this idea that you need to apply a field to either reorient the p-direction or to move a domain wall, as we'll see for the hard materials. So yeah, the probing techniques are pretty different, although my understanding is you could probably do something similar to this AFM technique for softer materials. So it'd be interesting to see if there's any connection on the experimental side between probing the material. Probing the material in the sort of standard liquid crystalline way versus what the hard matter people do, which sort of involves surface perturbations. So what are these transition regions? Sorry. You mean like doing wet AFM or something? Yeah, like wet AFM. I don't know if that would be interesting, but it seems an interesting possibility anyway. Exclusively. Exclusively done for the hard materials. So, what are these transition regions? How does the polarization direction actually reorient? Well, I also talked about this a little bit, but just again for review. I'm going to focus on what are called 180 degree domain walls or pi walls. So it's orientations that change by 180 degrees from sort of up to down. Now, the hardness. Now, the hard materials have all kinds of crazy domain walls. They have 90-degree turns. And it all depends on the crystallographic symmetry. So depending on the unit cell and how the atoms move around in it, you can have switches between all kinds of different directions. So the main types of walls, you have the Ising wall, which is actually more or less the most common one in solid ferroelectrics, and I'll explain why. Ferroelectrics, and I'll explain why. If it's not Ising, then it's sometimes like a mix of these different types. So you can have an Ising-Nail type of wall. And the difference here is that for an Ising wall, what happens is that your polarization actually vanishes between the two domains. You can see if you've imagined a scalar order parameter describing the magnitude of this vector, it actually goes through zero as you pass from one domain to another one. From one domain to another one. And that's more or less what happens in ferroelectrics, at least the solid ones at a sufficiently coarse-grained sort of level. The soft materials, they have continuous reorientations of the polarization direction, and those can be either these kinds of twisted configurations, these are the block reorientations where your polarization direction turns sort of. Turns sort of out of the plane, right? You're going from this orientation to 180 degrees. If you turn out that way, you'll create this kind of twisted structure and reorient that way. Now, in the pneumatics, as we'll see, because of the anchoring conditions, it's not always favorable for things to turn out of the plane because anchoring might keep it sort of within the plane, and you get. Keep it sort of within the plane, and you get domain walls that turn in the same plane of the polarization vector. So you go from up to down, it simply continuously just turns like that. That's a little bit similar to what happens in the pneumatics, as we'll see. And you can get combinations. You can, of course, the polarization vector sort of continuously goes to zero while also reorienting. You can get a mix of all these things. So these are just kind of the And so these are just kind of the, I don't know, canonical types or something, but in reality, it's just a somewhat oversimplified view of how these things actually reorient. Okay, and of course the type of domain law is set by the crystal structure for solids. It literally has to do with how the little atoms in itself can move relative to each other, and for the And for the pneumatics, it's set by the boundary conditions for the presence of certain defects and so on. The surface of the material, the shape of it, that's really what sets the orientation forin that, as we'll sort of discuss. So the importance of the domain walls is that they kind of organize the switching behavior. So what are these spheroelectrics used for? So, what are these parroelectrics used for? They're used for their switching properties. They actuate something. As we'll see, the solid ones are, since they're coupled so strongly, the polarization is coupled so strongly to the motion of the atoms, they're typically piezoelectric. So once you reorient the polarization direction, you also typically change the geometry of the material. And so that could be a mechanical kind of actuator and so on. So let's talk about switching a little bit in an oversimplified way, I would say, although these kinds of dynamics were kind of the first attempts at understanding what happens when you switch from one orientation to another under an applied field. So what do we know? We'll do a simplified kind of situation where we just have a uniform polarization, right? No domain walls. We just assume it's in the Z-hat direction. In the Z-hat direction, we apply a field in that same direction. It could be positive or negative. And what happens? Well, the polarization, roughly speaking, tries to maintain its stable orientation, either we're going to assume there's two stable orientations, either it points up or it points down. And that's what it wants to do when there's no applied field. Once you apply a field, the polarization tends to align with the electric field. And so you can drive the whole system. And so you can drive the whole system by applying a time-dependent electric field and observing how the polarization changes in time. Where the response of the polarization, it has some kinetics, so the kinetic coefficient out front here describes how quickly the P will change under the perturbation. And this is, of course, very simplified. There's no domain wall in here. It's simply dynamics of a single number, P, which you assume. Number p, which you assume sort of covers the whole sample, but it does like a reasonable job of describing certain features, at least of the solid ferroelectrics. And it's called the Landau electrical dynamics. If you stare at it, this is really just the same as the dynamics of an over-damped motion of a particle in one dimension. Imagine a green particle representing the sample polarization. It lives in this potential, has zero field, it has It has zero field. It has two places where the particle is happy, just the two different orientations. And then when you oscillate the field up and down, you're basically taking this potential and yanking it this way and that way. And the ball slides down this potential and tries to move towards the bottom. So it's over-damp dynamics towards the minimum of these, effectively, this potential, which is the potential that's due to the material itself that sets the two differences. Material itself that sets the two different stable orientations, and then the electric field basically just tilts the potential back and forth. And we can think of these motions in one dimension. Here, if we just think about p varying in time, say from negative to positive, this is imagine the ball rolling in time from this region to this one under an applied field. That's switching, it's just reorientation of the polarization. The polarization in time. But also, if we sort of abstract even a little bit more, this kind of transition is also what happens in space at a domain wall. You have a region where P is positive, you have another region where P is negative, and in between, you transition somehow. Now it's a transition in space, so P depends on X. And we'll see the equation's a little bit different, but morally it's similar. The ball just tries to go from one minimum to another. To go from one minimum to another, whether it's being driven by an electric field or whether they're simply due to boundary conditions, just it has to go from one stable orientation to the other one in space. So that's kind of the difference, sort of the switching versus domain law is a little, it's like similar to a difference between people talk about solitons and instantons. So transitions either in time or in space between. Transitions either in time or in space between two different stable configurations. So there's a connection there. And the reason I like to talk about switching is because really when I talk to the hard matter folks that do these measurements, they really, that's what they look at. They look at the switching properties. They take this AFM tip, they probe the polarization, and they just see what happens as I oscillate the electric field back and forth. How does the polarization change? Worth, how does the polarization change? And the signature of a ferroelectric of this kind of response is just the formation of a hysteresis loop. What happens is that when you are negative polarization in your sample, right, spontaneously pointing down, you apply a field in the other direction. It takes some energy for it to flip back. So the system gets stuck in this stable well. And then once the electric field gets sufficiently large, Field gets sufficiently large, which is sort of the coercive field, if you wish, the polarization jumps to the other stable well. And again, you can just imagine kind of the two stable wells sort of bouncing back and forth as we change the electric field. And as soon as you develop this hysteresis, that's sort of the signature of the ferroelectric material. Otherwise, if the electric field is zero and you're at zero polarization, You're at zero polarization. You see, if you're, in this case, if the polarization simply follows the field, maybe in some nonlinear fashion, then it's a paraelectric. A dielectric would just have a straight line. But in terms of the ball rolling around in the potential, it's as if you have a sort of flat bottom potential, the ball rolling around kind of freely side to side, and one where there's a potential barrier. So what exactly happens at those changes? So, what exactly happens at those transitions? What do the domain walls do as the material switches? That's sort of what we'll discuss, especially for the solid parolectrics. And we'll look at the two cases separately. Okay, so I wanted to start sort of, that's sort of a very long-winded intro, but I wanted to, in the middle here, put some acknowledgments. This is work done in collaboration with UT and Oak Ridge. I have collaborators that. We have collaborators that both synthesize the solid parolectric materials and then analyze them with the AFM tups and so on. And Nora is a graduate student at UT that helped me with the theoretical work. And then the stuff I'll mention about the solitons and pneumatic is work done with Olig's group at Kent State. And Priyanka will talk more also about these nice materials, hoping that these three talks look painful. So, these three talks will paint a kind of comprehensive picture of these materials. So, for solids, again, the polarization direction is kind of glued to the motion of the atoms. That's why it's very difficult for P to reorient slowly. It happens rapidly over a distance of just a couple of unit cells. And you measure which way the pores. You measure which way the polarization is going by actually observing how the material expands or compresses when you probe it with this AFM tip, because it'll expand and compress differently depending on which kind of polarization you have. If you're looking to either compress or expand depending on the direction of the field that you're applying. So, the piezoelectric response is really the kind of way in which these materials are. Way in which these materials are measured, how the polarization is determined. And the switching that kind of occurs as you probe this thing or apply a DC field or anything like that at these tips is that you nucleate the domain and then it expands. So the potential landscape is generally very complicated because of the crystallographic directions. Of the crystallographic directions. These materials are typically, you know, have many different kinds of atoms in them. They have complicated sort of symmetries. And in general, the potential, there are many different stable orientations of this p-direction. And when you switch, of course, you apply an electric field along one direction, so you're typically switching between two different wells, two different stable orientations of peak. Even if the overall landscape. The overall landscape is complicated looking. So, for an example, here you can have different stable configurations of your polarization, say in the XY plane, you have four different stable orientations. You apply a field. You typically will switch between these two different wells. Now, of particular interest to the hard matter folks are these new, well, I'm not entirely sure how new they are, but in any case, But in any case, one of the exciting things they found is that there are certain materials where the potential wells happen to align up along a certain direction. And those are called sort of uniaxial multi-well materials. They're interesting because they allow for different sorts of transitions, not just between two different kinds of polarization direction, but between three different states, say. And then you might wonder what is the presence of this intervening well due to the domain wall. Well, due to the domain wall structure and so on. So that's something that mention. Are they symmetric? What is happening in the middle one? Is it zero? Yeah, it's zero. For the things we'll look at, it's zero. But it could be other things in principle. Yeah. For the things we'll look at, these will be just two different 180 degree sort of flips, and then the middle is a paraelectric base where the polarization direction vanishes. Branches. As Oleg sort of showed, you actually saw this in the pneumatics also. This kind of thing was set up basically by the anchor, where instead of the middle well being zero, you'll see the middle well is like one of the orientations, right, that's set by the rubbing direction. And so then this one is maybe the downward orientation. And these two are identical, but it's still meaningful to talk about transitions between, you know, this and that, and that and this. And that and this, and so on, and the order in which that happens. So, that's mention that as well. So, yeah, when you have the multi-wells, things, it's more interesting from the point of view of what happens when you apply an electric field, because you can lock into these different states. So, how do you model this? It's just a slight extension of the ball in the potential well, except now instead of a simple Except now, instead of a simple sort of uniform scalar, you promote it to a spatially dependent field that describes the orientation, place-to-place in your sample. And for the solids, it actually is pretty well described by simple gradient descent and some potential now that is now a functional of this field, but morally it's quite similar. It has a potential that has, you know, two wells, three wells have. Two wells, three wells, however many you want. You can add more terms, look at more complicated things. And the only other new feature is the spatial dependence. And we're going to have a very simple-minded kind of view of it where we're just genomizing basically any kind of variation. So we're genomizing any gradient in P. Now, the more sophisticated models in the sort of solid matter literature will have this term be quite complex because of the crystallographic direction. Crystallographic direction. So this gradient term is typically very anisotropic. You have very different costs for variations along, say, X versus Y and so on. But this is a simplified form, which does a pretty good job of describing things. And I also like it because it's quite close to the typical friendly sort of potentials we look at in soft matter physics. This is just the Ising model with just a slightly more complicated. With just a slightly more complicated potential. You just, this is sort of the surface tension between two different Ising domains, and that's it. And then the other cool thing is, of course, we can drive this thing. This kind of makes it particularly interesting. It's not really an equilibrium problem in that sense because we are actually driving it, the polarization. So that introduced the tilt in the potential. Yes, P is a scalar field. It's just an Ising scalar order parameter. And the key is that we can look at situations where this potential has three different minima, one at, say, at zero and one at plus or minus some non-zero value. And that describes this uniaxial triple well-feroelectric. There's an intervening paraelectric phase where it can get stuck. And that actually impacts the switching. Actually, it impacts the switching behavior as we see. So here is the switching behavior for this uniaxial triple paraelectric. It's actually, the domain law here is interesting because it's actually, it does have a thickness, and it has a thickness because of this intervening paraelectric phase with zero polarization. That's why it's sort of extra bright here. And so you can actually probe this material and see: can we catch? Material and see can we catch the zero polarization state by doing the local switching. So you're applying electric field or a voltage across the sample in this fashion. You start with small amplitude and you grow bigger and bigger and you see, you know, when does it start switching. And what happens, if you observe the polarization over time, it'll get stuck sometimes locally in the zero state. And you'll pick up these very sharp kind of regions in the hysteresis loop. The hysteresis loop, little kinks in it that correspond to the material getting stuck in that third wall. So that makes it kind of different from a ferroelectric. And a simple-minded theory actually does a good job of predicting that, because basically all that happens is you tilt the potential back and forth, and the ball just rolls around and sometimes gets stuck in that middle one. And by the time you tilt the potential back the other way, it doesn't have enough time to sort of. It doesn't have enough time to sort of go to the third well. So it just gets stuck and falls back down. So here it's happy in this negative well. It goes, it goes, tries to switch, but up, it gets stuck in that middle well, and the electric field basically isn't slow enough. It doesn't have a large enough magnitude, combo the two, and then the thing just falls back. So it gets stuck in that middle place. So the nice thing about the EAFM probe is you can probe this behavior at different points in your sample. This behavior at different points in your sample. This is like frozen. You can take this from place to place, and they'll always sort of maintain this structure. And you can take the AFM tip and prone the switching in these different areas and see what happens. So that's also kind of of interest, of course, to model this. You have to be a little bit more faithful to what actually happens with the switching. So, as I mentioned, the simple model, of course, can just have going back and forth. Going back and forth in this triple well potential, but to get things a little more right, you really do have to worry about the Z dependence because how it actually works: the AFM tip comes down and nucleates a little domain corresponding to the ball sort of rolling to the next well. And then that domain, of course, means that there's this variation in the vertical direction of the polarization direction. And as soon as you have that, unfortunately, you do develop a divergence. You do develop a divergence, so you do need to worry about the Coulomb stuff. So, you typically, in order to solve it, you not only have to solve this equation, just the gradient descent of the scalar order parameter, you also have to simultaneously solve the electrostatics basically at each time step. So that makes it kind of computationally tricky or just more expensive. But that's sort of the price you pay because of these bound charts. Bound charges. Okay, so just briefly here, in the case where we have a, so what actually happens at these regions? So moving away from switching, how do you actually describe the stationary wall here between P plus and P minus? That's actually relatively easy to do. So at zero field, you have basically this situation where you have three different states. Situation where you have three different stable points in your potential, and you can look at basically transitions in space between these different walls. And those are the sort of solitons, and you can think of them as pairs of sort of half-solitons. There's a soliton that describes the transition between the negative p and zero, and then from zero to positive p. And then basically in these materials, this In these materials, this well is actually slightly higher than these ones. It's hard to see here, but in the material, the plus and minus P configurations are slightly more stable. And so what happens is that actually it's energetically costly to create this zero region. And so then, depending on the sort of position of this middle well relative to these guys, you can tune the kind of potential difference between them. Difference between them, you'll get a varying size for this middle region. As the wells sort of become the same level, what happens is this middle region expands. And eventually, when they're exactly even, these two things decouple and they're free to kind of move around at will. So that's kind of interesting. It's a kind of unbinding of these pairs of half-solitons. It's what happens as you kind of approach the transition, if you will, where a The transition, if you will, where all three states are equally energetically costly. So, of course, in the real sample, you have noise. Noise is really interesting because you imagine sort of shaking everything. The reason the noise is important in these solid ferroelectrics is because, of course, the reorientations occur in these unit cells. And they're atomic things, and you have crystalline vibrations and so on, and a lot of sort of thermal energy that's able to. Sort of thermal energy that's able to kind of click these little unit cells randomly, especially near the domain wall. And so you need to take that into account. And then we do it by adding a sort of spatio-temporal random noise to the dynamics. And what you find is for a double well, the domain well broadens. And for the triple well, where you have three different states with approximately the same energy, what happens is you get sort of thermally induced. You get sort of thermally induced unbinding of these half-solitone pairs. Because if you add enough noise, these small differences between the potential levels become more or less negligible from the point of view of what happens with the domain low, and so they can kind of move apart. But they can't move too far because eventually even a small difference in those potential wells will create enough cost for this middle region that will remain fixed. They'll remain fixed. They're like two particles loosely attached by a string. That's where it gets too long, they pulled back together. So that's kind of interesting aspect. And we're hoping to see this kind of noise-stabilized metastable state in experiments, but that's sort of ongoing, you don't know. Of course, you can't. I mean, you can of course tune the temperature, but the problem with tuning a temperature is you also change your potential wells as you vary the temperature. Potential wells as you vary the temperature. So you need some way of controlling just the random noise. So that's kind of hard, but it might be possible by driving the system with something, a random noise generator. So that would be kind of cool to see. All right, so I don't want to, I'll skip the part about spatial disorder, but just Just to give you a flavor of what happens if you add spatially dependent sort of random field to your potential, to your relaxation time, rather, or say at each unit cell of your lattice, maybe the relaxation time is slightly different because there might be a defect nearby or something. What happens is you can actually pin these domain walls so that they no longer move when you apply an electric field. And then you need a sufficiently strong field to get the domain wall to move. To get the domain wall to move. So these kinds of pinning dynamics also modify the shape of the systolesis loop. So that's the kind of things you have to worry about for the solid ferroelectrics. Okay, so just as a summary for the solids, you have Ising-like domain walls that rapidly switch and nanometer length scales. The dynamics are described by this over-damped motion and potential. Motion and a potential that sort of gets tilted back and forth by the electric field. You can add noise, thermal fluctuations, and pinning noise due to sort of crystal defects, and that pins these domain walls and changes the shape of your switching behavior. All right, so since Oli gave us a nice introduction to these spheroelectric pneumatics, I'll just briefly say what Briefly say what they are here. For the soft materials, you have a continuous variation of the polarization direction. No more crystallographic axes to worry about. You just have the one thing to set your preferred orientation is just the sample boundaries. So we'll look at thin cells that are rubbed in a certain direction, and the rubbing is polar in the sense that it actually, when you rub it, say in this direction, the polarization vector actually prefers. The polarization vector actually prefers to orient opposite that rubbing direction. And so it creates an energetic penalty for orientations that are 180 degrees away. So that makes it kind of interesting. This polar nature you can describe with an anchoring potential, as I'll mention in a bit. But I did want to say, unlike the ferroelectrics, the solid ones, when you reorient the polarization direction with an applied electric, Direction with an applied electric field for these guys, the domains are the things that move. So you have the Fredericks transition and so on. It's the thing, it's the bulk that reorients, which is pretty different from the ferroelectrics where it's really these domain walls moving that kind of is responsible for the switching behavior. So that makes them quite different, I think. In fact, when you apply an electric field, I was sort of surprised that the domain walls don't seem to move at all. I kind of thought maybe they would move a little. But they don't. So you apply an electric field, you try to reorient this polarization, that's unhappy. Basically, it reorients inside this domain, and the domain will sort of stay pretty different. Is that because you're rendering the wrong polarization absolutely unstable, as opposed to metastable? No, it should still be metastable because there's still a pneumatic anchoring. It's still a double out. I'll show you. I'll show you. I'll show you. I'll show you. And I talked about these nice focal comics. That's when you don't have any anchoring conditions and you let the thing do what it does freely at the free surface. But I don't quite understand that. So we'll focus on just the rubbing. So what happens, of course, the version of your elastic term I had of gradient before. Now it's, of course, we can be a little more faithful to the material and actually introduce the different kinds of elastic deformations. Elastic deformations. And now slow deformations are preferred, so we expect non-izing walls. And we still have this idea that the polarization divergence induces charge, so splay is generally penalized. And you can, instead of doing the whole counter thing, you can instead imagine that the k1 coefficient is renormalized. We'll discuss that a little bit by the debi screening length, essentially. And so the effect of And so the effect of K1 is just much larger in these materials. And there's also this interesting property that because this polarization is so free to rotate, it often decides to twist by itself. And you should watch Priyanka's talk on that. So I just wanted to show you, just visually, kind of this should look quite familiar. This is the triple well for the Is the triple well for the polarization direction due to this rubbing? So you have the zero degree orientation. That's sort of the stable one. That's the one that's anti-parallel to the rubbing direction. And then you have the metastable 180-degree oriented state. But this is really just the same as the triple L. You have this stable state here that's equivalent, so 0 and 2 pi n. Equivalence of 0 and 2 pi, and then you can have transitions between this state and the 180-degree turn. And that thing that I called sort of the distance between the half-kinks, you can actually see it optically in the textures. That's just the difference between that's the distance between these two dark bars. That's just what we call here L sub pi. It's pretty just the size between the distance between the hats. The distance between the half kings. Half kings kind of occur here. This is a transition between up and down, and then down and up. And okay, so it's quite similar to the ferroelectric triple law. You can work out the behavior, and I just flash you some equations, but it's really the same idea of a ball rolling around in the potential, except now instead of over-damped motion, you have undamped motion, you just have a kinetic energy. You just have the kinetic energy, which is due to the penalty for having spatial variations, due to sort of the elastic cost. And you have the potential, which is just this triple wall. So you have a ball rolling around in a multi-wall potential. It's periodic, of course, describes an angle, describes the orientation. But morally, it's just quite similar. You're just thinking of an undamped wall rolling around in the potential. And so you can solve for these different kinds of domain walls. These different kinds of domain walls, whether it's in the case where the three walls are equal height, that's when the rubbing is sort of apolar and doesn't have that polar contribution. Then you can have these pi solitons. Those are just three orientations like this, half kinks. And then when you introduce a penalty and you make that, make this pi state to metastable, you need to pair the two half kinks in half kinks. You need to pair the two half-kinks, and you can have different kinds in that case. You can have ones that go from 0 to pi back to 0, and you can have ones that go from 0 to pi to 2 pi. And those are topologically protected because you wind all the way around in that case with a polarization version. So that's what they look like. You can do this sort of simple-minded ball in a potential theory to kind of understand how. Kind of understand how the polarization angle switches from, say, zero to pi to two pi. You can compare that to the textures you get. And again, these black bars, that's the places where, so the light regions are where you have these kinds of reorientations. And when it goes to 90 degrees, sort of in the middle of the half kinks, this is like sort of pi over 2, that's where you get. Sort of pi over 2, that's where you get the black bar from the cross polars. And so you can just measure the distance between these and get a sense of the distance between the hatchkings. And you can, of course, vary the anisotropy of that polar direction. And as you make it more and more, the wells more of the same height, you'll get an L pi region that extends and does the same kind of unbinding of these half-solitons, half half-tank solitons. So quite some more as before. As before. Now, because of this Coulomb interaction and penalty regarding splay deformations, you do have to worry about the fact that you have a slightly different, you can't, so I've sort of flipped through this, but this assumed kind of a, this actually assumes that there's a single, actually, no, it's not quite true. So actually, this kappa is the ratio between Kappa is the ratio between K1 and K3, which is going to be larger than 1. And so, actually, morally, it's still the ball and the potential is just somewhat more complicated. I should have mentioned that. So, what happens is that this potential has a very complex shape for the reason that K1 is not equal to K3. But still, you can solve it numerically. You could do a kind of particle dynamics in this potential with just the kinetic energy, and you can sort of watch the ball move from one wall to the other. Move from one wall to the other, and those are your solitons. So that's kind of a nice, I just want to give you a sketch of how the numerics are done to find these solutions. So you can do that, and what happens is that as you make k1 over k3 larger, it basically tries to make these half-kinks very, very narrow. And that's because if k1 is really big, of course it doesn't want to splay. And the splay mostly. want to split and display mostly occurs here in the metastable part of the metastable well part and the it would prefer to expand that so lowering its elastic deformation cost and concentrating all the elastic deformation in these bend regions at the half chance where it goes from zero to five quickly and so it goes faster and faster the higher this chappa is and also And also, it also separates the distance between this half kink and that one. So you can figure that out just by doing the ball and a potential. Of course, if your sample is thick enough, then you'll have reorientations that you can tilt out of the plane, basically. So we had a rubbing, right, that enforced the polarization to stay in the XY plane. But if your sample is thick enough, that's really all. But if your sample is thick enough, that's really only true at the top and bottom. In between, you can start tilting. And then, once that happens, things get a little more complicated. You can no longer assume your director is in the plane. It starts tilting out, and you have to do something else. So I know just how flashy it can be done. You can do it numerically because you can just substitute this onsats into the sort of frank free energy. You can. Free energy, you can add the anchoring potential. You can still do the minimization. It's not as nice as a ball rolling around anymore. You just have to minimize the free energy as like a functional that depends on the tilt angle and the angle of the polarization in the plane. So you can do that, and you get this nice result that the tilts occur kind of in the half-kink regions. So, whenever you have a half-kink, that's going to be costly. That's going to be costly if it remains in the plane, so it just tilts out of the plane in order to accommodate the very sharp bend that occurs there. So, some outstanding questions. What happens with the Coulomb interaction, really? It's not really just the renormalization of K1. I mean, we really should include it as a sort of long-range kind of force. There's also ions in there, typically, they might screen any kind of bound charges you have. So, you should probably, you know, treat that a little more faithfully than simply assuming a large K1. Faithfully, than simply assuming a large K1 as we have here. It's a little bit of a cheat. And what happens to the twists as you make the sample really big? Brianka will talk about how the polarization spontaneously twists, and what are the domain walls there? I'm not sure. Different things must happen because you'll now have domains with twisting polarizations as you go out through the Z directions. So I'll just flash conclusions. I know I've Slash conclusions. I know I'm like really pushing it here out of the time, but thank you for your attention. I started four minutes late, so that was perfect. But yeah, let's take time for a couple of questions. Do you have one? Yes. Oh, that was really, very nice. Very exciting. When you compare solid with the liquid crystal phenomenon, say, Crystal phenomena, say. Could you say that what people in solids do with the Lie Galdo and Shire energy here we do with the coupling of the liquid crystal energy with the polarization energy? Would that be accurate? Yes, because really the polarization couples to the pneumatic orientation and you have the thermodynamic potential for the Q tensor, say. So, yes, it's sort of similar for the. It's sort of similar. For the solids, you have a thermodynamic potential for it's actually probably usually more complex than just the scalar marker parameter that I showed because it has to do with. You have the elasticity, you have the elasticity, right? And then do you have to worry about the growth of this potential as you approach certain polarization? Because is there a maximum of polarization that we That beyond that, the system cannot achieve, in which case your potential curves would be pretty steep? That's a great question. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Thank you. Can you go back to your equation for the solid? Yeah. Is there an AFM in there somewhere or not? Yes, so the AFM would be here, and I should have made this a spatially dependent thing. So it's yeah, so the AFM is the part where you, you know, I said you couldn't cheat. What you actually have to do is you have to introduce another field, which is the electric potential, and then you specify boundary conditions. And then you specify boundary conditions due to the FM tip. And then you have to solve the electrostatic problem inside your sample. So that, I don't know what you mean. At each time step of your evolution for these dynamics, at every time you solve for the E field using the Poisson equation. So you step through and you resolve for E inside the sample because all you know is what you specified and the boundaries. And that's what stepping is. This is the main. Yeah. This is domain. Yeah, the nucleated domain. One last question for Topario? Ms. McKissima, I was very intrigued by your highlighting differences and analogy between soft and hard parallels. Now in the solid graphics, one could presumably affect the size of the domain. The size of the table. I wonder what it would be I'm sure there is. I'm sure you could strain your sample much like you would for these piezoelectric materials, because that's what you do. You sort of it's the reverse effect, right? You just mechanically deform in your polarization. Form in your polarization. I think it would have to be more of a sort of hydrodynamic thing, and we can introduce some shear to the sample boundaries or something like that. I don't, you can't do this with, in the crystals you can do it with sort of sound because you have the phonons inside the material that can couple to these, well, that are these unit cell motions, right? Motions, right, in the liquid crystal, it's more complicated. You have these pneumato hydrodynamics, right? So I don't know if it's quite the same. Well, let's continue the discussion over the lunch, and let's thanks again. I'm very sorry about that.
