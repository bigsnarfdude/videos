Whereas the geometric condition on quasi-periodic shading operators, it is somehow there is some link between my talks and Jiangong's talks. Here is a definition for one-dimensional sonial operators: epsilon x mu t. Epsilon X is a ergodic system. X is a smooth compact manifold. And the mu is the invariant measure. The map is T. We call a real function on X potential. Then we define discrete shading operators for one-dimensional analytics as the following self-adjoint operators on L2, Z1. On L2Z1. H Vx U and n component of it is equals to u n plus 1 plus u n minus 1 plus v of 10 t n x times u x, where x is on the manifold and n is the integer. If the base base is x mu t X, we call it a base space. If it is a rotation on a torus, here and the manifold is n-dimensional torus, and t is tx equals x plus 2 pi times omega. Here, omega is a rational independent frequency, and then we call this operator as a quasi-periodological shading. Is a quasi-periodical shading operator. In this talk, we focus on the case that the dimension of the torus is one. That is the manifold is the circle. Then we know that the eigen equation of the operate, the shading operator is equivalent to a dynamic system called Schrading occupy as follows. Shading of cycle as follows. The two-dimensional vector Un plus 1Un equals to the transfer matrix times the Un minus 1 and then equals to the product of a series of matrix times U0 U minus 1. Well, A of X is S O two R matrix with With a parameter E inside. We denote this dynamic system by T and A. And since A of X is S L to R, so a shading of cocycle is belongs to S L to R cocycles. Then the central problems on showing Problems on Shenyah operators and Shenyuco cycles is as follows. To find absolutely continuous or singular continuous or pure point components of the spectrum to study the topological structure of the spectrum and to estimate the bigger measure of the spectrums. The spectrums. And there is an important concept in shading of cycles as follows. We denote a superscript n of x is a product of this series of metrics. And we define A minus N. find a minus n of x in a similar way equals to the product of the inverse of series of matrix. Then we define the Lyapunov exponent L of A for the Schadeno cosyagus as the limit of this integral. And for almost every x it is equals to the It is equals to the limiter for one over n times log of the norm of the n of x. Then we found that Nyap exponents play a very important role in the in this in shown operators. It can be shown in the following two results. Johnson proved that Johnson proved that the relevant set of the shading operators is equivalent to the set of E such that the corresponding cycles is uniformly hyperbolic. And the issue based on Cotani proves that the absolutely continuous spectrum of the operators is equivalent to the Is equivalent to the essential closure of the set of E, such that the Laplauf exponent there is zero. And one of the essential problems about shading of cycles is to study the regularity of the Lyapuno respondents. As a function of the cycle A or as a function of the energy parameter E? This question is important because the regularity of Leap correspondent can provide information on the regularity of IDS by SOLIS formula. Also, we know that this problem is This problem is always important in a dynamic system since the regularity of Lyapunov exponents is always a very difficult problem. Here is some results on some properties on analytic quasi-periodic shoulder operators in the regime. Operators in the regime of positive Lyapunov components. Goldstein and Schlage prove that for analytic potential in the region of positive Lyapunov exponent, if omega is strong defending, and then the Lyapunov exponent is order continuous. use and later you and zang han and zhang improve that for the potential lambda times v x in the region of positive Lyapunov exponent. The Lyapunov exponent as a function of E and lambda is seaford continuous for all defounding and some weaker Lewinian frequency. Leuvenian frequencies where the C is a uniformly positive constant. That is, it is independent on lambda. And then Gonstein proved that for almost all frequencies and small analytic perturbations. Analytic perturbation of trigonometric polynomials of order k in the regime of positive Lyapunov supponant. And the Lyapunov supponant is one over two k holder continuous. Okay, this three result is about the regularity of the depth component. And Goldstein and Schillag obtained that for an analytic between For an analytic potential in the regime of positive Lyapunov exponent and almost all frequencies, the spectrum is a counter set. This result is about the topological structure of the spectrum. Here, now here is stronger, stronger, and also. Stronger and also earlier results on the almost material operators. The almost material operators AMO correspond to the potential when V of X is cosine 2 pi times X. But again, Avila and Jizmukaya obtain that for different That for defending frequencies and non-zero couplings, L of E and N of E, it is IDS, both are one over two holder continuous. And here it is worthy to note that in all known results on the regularity of Lyapunov exponents. Lyapunov exponents, the regularity is not better than one over two or continuous. Here, all known result is about analytic situation. And then Avila and Josmukaya obtained that for all irregional frequencies and non-zero couplings, the spectrum is a contour set. Is a contour set. And then puke, I will just obtain that if lambda is not equals to zero one or minus one, and the frequency is a defining number, then a dry version of counter spectrum holds true for almost later operators. Operators. Here we also list only list results on the regularity of Lyapunov exponent and the topological structure of the spectrum. The dry version of control spectrum is defined as follows. Johnson and Moses and Labeling theorem tell us that. Theorem tells us that for each spectral gap, there is some integra such that the rotation number row of E on this gap equals to a constant k times omega over 2 mod 1. In addition, it is well known that the rotation number is continuous at the mode. Is continuous and monotonic. And thus, the shape of this function rho of E is of ever step in the case of contour spectrum. We call K the label of the corresponding gap and we denote this gap by GK and we denote We denote the set of E such that the rotation number equals to K times omega over to model 1 by SK. If the measure of SK is zero or is positive, we see the gap GK collapses or GK is open. Or GK is open. If GK is open for each K, we see the operator produces a derivation of contour spectrum. It directly implies a contour spectrum, but the inverse is not true. So a driver of contour spectrum is stronger than contour spectrum. Than control spectrum. So, in conclusion, we found that in a known result, the properties for MO is stronger than general analytic operators. We want to know: can general analytic operators be as good as AMO? As AMO. I mean that maybe the reason for the result of journal analytic operators is only because techniques. But Kongsinyi and Johnson, Avila and Sumkaya show that the dry version of contour spectrum does not hold true. Spectron does not hold true for general analytic potentials. Moreover, very recently, Wang and Shu and Yu obtained the following results. For any positive delta, we can find an analytical potential V such that delta holder continues. Delta how the continuity of Lyapunov exponent does not hold true for this V. This results obviously imply that one over two holder continuity is not true for general analytical potentials. And furthermore, it indicated that the results on the one over Results on the 1 over 2K order continuity of Lyapunovs obtained by Gottstein, Schlanken, GoNU may be optimal. So we conclude that not all general analytic potentials can be as good as AMO. So we shall study the reason. That is the reason makes AMO special. We found some similarity between cosine type potentials and cosine potential. Cosine type potential is some C2 function on the circle satisfies the Satisfies the following geometric conditions. That is, the derivative of v equals zero at exactly two points. And these two extremes are non-degenerate. And obviously, cosine is inside. So we call this function and so we call this class of function as cosine time. As cosine type. Cosine time potential was first studied by Sinai, who pointed out, among other results, the mechanism for the appearance of spectral gaps and contour spectrums for such potentials with large couplings. Wang Zhang Liang Wang Yu Shi Gu Wang obtained that with fixed defunding frequencies omega and cosine type V, if the coupling lambda is sufficiently large, then the Liberal exponent is one over two order continuous and over epsilon. And absolutely continuous. And on the other hand, one zone should go and one obtain that with the same conditions as above the sonium operators, but this is a dry version of contour spectrum. Virgin of contour spectrum. So we conclude that cosine type is as strong as cosine in some things. So we can compare the two conditions. One is cosine type conditions which is belong to geometric conditions. Another is analytic Another is analytic conditions, which is belong to regularity conditions on the potentials. We can conclude that cosine time conditions is strictly stronger than analytic conditions in the regularity of Laplace exponent and the structure of the spectrum for quasi-periodical Schotten operators and cycles. We can also say that one of the main reasons that the cosine potentials is so special in comparison with general analytic potentials. That's in the fact that cosine belongs to a cosine type. Moreover, we found We found at least technically cosine type and non-cosine type are quite different. So it is reasonable to suggest the following problem. Whether cosine type condition is necessary for 1012 holder continuity of Holder continuity of Lyapunov supponant and dry region of counter selection. And our works on cosine type depends on a modification of binetics cursing Young's dynamic assistance method. In the study of dynamic system generalized by the logistical map f of x equals to r times x times 1 minus x on the interval from 0 to 1. Benetics and Carlson show that there exist subsets for the parameter R. For the parameter R between 0 to 4 with a positive measure such that the limited inf for 1 over n times the log of the absolute value of d f n at 1 is positive. Here d of d f n x is defined as Is defined as the product of series of directives of effort by the chain rule. Okay. And on the other hand, Lysen Yang later considered a family of C1 Sl2R cosine. Cosycles on the circle with a Brundeau frequency and the transfer matrix as follows: A t of x. It is the product of two matrix. One is a diagonal matrix, another is a rotation matrix. Well, lambda of x has a large lower bound, and the phi of phi at the angle. Uh, phi uh the angle phi satisfies some chance transversal condition, and then uh she obtained that for some for for for some t from a positive measure set, the cycle is not uniformly hybrid and the Lyapunov exponent is larger than y minus epsilon. then y minus epsilon times log lambda zero with epsilon is small bcy's method deals with competition between increasing fact and decreasing fact for example in the logic map the increasing factor is is a derivative between one and four with a high With a higher possibility since most X satisfies the derivative there is larger than one. Well, the decreasing factor is those between zero and one with a lower possibility, but obviously with a Obviously, with a strong effect, since lower bound for derivative can be zero. And here is a baby model for Young's work. Let lambda n1 and lambda n2 be two large numbers. We consider the norm of the matrix A n plus one. A n plus one, which is a product of three metrics. The left and the right one are diagonal, and the middle one is a rotation matrix. The norm obviously heavily depends on the distance for the angle phi n from two pi over two. For them. For example, if the angle phi n is zero, then the norm of the matrix A n plus one equals to the product of the norm for the left and the right matrix. But if the angle is equals to pi over two, then the norm of the matrix equals to lambda n. Lambda n one over lambda n two or equals to lambda n two over lambda n one and to um to obtain a positive Lyapunov exponents we we expect We expect that the norm of the product of the matrix is much larger than lambda n1 or lambda n2. And obviously, the increasing factor in the norm is the product of lambda n1 and lambda n2. Lambda n1 and lambda n2, where the decreasing factor is the angle phi n. Since the norm, we have seen that the norm depends sensitively on the angle. In particular, when the angle is close to pi over 2, we call x is a critical point at the step n. critical point at the step n if the angle equals to pi over 2. And say resonance occurs if x is in some small neighbor of the collection points. And Young succeeded to prove that the increasing factor surplus is the decreasing factor with the point in the base space does not come back to the critical intervals too far. Back to the critical intervals too fast, which can be ensured by the Bruno condition. However, there are some reasons that Young's method cannot be applied to Schöning alcohol cycles. The first one is Scherding alcohol cycles are formally. Formerly excluded by Young's cycles. Fortunately, they can be transferred into Yansk cycle by Zenhuizang, which made BCYS method available for Shenyuk cycles. Another place we have to make some modification is that the energy. That the energy parameter E corresponding to the resonance will exclude by Yang to avoid the growth of the number of cricket points and keep some transversality. To consider the continuity of the upper sponge, however, all E have to be considered. We should We show that in cosine type case, the number of click points will not increase when resonance occurs. Furthermore, although the original transversality is variated when resonance occurs, some higher order transversality still has true. So Young's method. Young's method after some modification can be applied in Shenyu cycles. So here is a remark on resonance, on the role played by the resonance. Resonance for cosine type case with a large coupling, resonance is not only Resonance is not only responsible for the appearance of spectral gaps, but also is a reason why the regularity of Laplace bonus cannot be better than one over two holder continuity. In fact, we can prove that those energies far from gaps in some things. Gaps in some things or equivalently far from resonance, the up-nov exponent is strictly better than one over two holder continuity. It's locally strictly better than one over two holder continuities. Here is the details for our result on the And for our result on the one or two continuity and absolute continuity results. For the same omega, same V and the same coupling, we obtain that as a function of E, Lymph exponent is one over two holder continuities and continuous and absolutely continuous. Continuous. And the second conclusion is that the set of all endpoints of gaps is dense in the spectrum. And for any endpoints E, Lyapun respondent is exactly 1 over 2 for the continuous at E. Here exactly means that globally, the upload exponent cannot be better than one over 2 or the continuous. Or the continuous. And then the third conclusion is that there exists some subsets of the spectrum which is a full measure such that Laplace Bundle is Lipschitz zero. And the last conclusion is that for any beta between one over two. beta between one over two and one we can find some ye such that and the holder exponent for the regularity of the lab component there is actually close to beta we remark that the absolute continuities of the apocalypse bond is new even Laplace Bond is new even for AMO. And the endpoints are dense in the spectrum is proved by one and another. Here is some here is the idea for why one over two holder is not true for general. True for general analytic potentials. We have found that from the second conclusion in this theorem, the Diaplus pony cannot be better than one over two or it is sourced from the fact that the angle phi n The angle phi n in the baby model is strictly second order non-degenerate. Here, strictly means that ED is both second order non-degenerate and first order degenerate, like the parabolic function near zero. If it saw from that the angle of phi n is strictly second order non-degenerator for all n at the end points of gaps. And which is due to the fact that the maximum or the minimum of a cosine type function is strictly Is strictly second order, non-degenerate. Similarly, if the angle phi n in the baby model is strictly m plus one order non-degenerate for all n at the maximum, then we can prove that the Lyapunov exponent. The upload exponent cannot be better than one over two times m holder continuities. And in fact, we can find that at this time and the logarithm is similar as a function of the interval log e minus x. two k interval in some in some in some integral in some intervals like like the regularity of this function so uh so uh for this for this purpose uh we shall uh consider a analytic function v and such that um The directive of it is equal to zero at exactly two points. That is the maximum and the minimum. And assume that these two extremes are strictly m plus one order non-degenerate. Okay. Then we can say the maximum Consider E near the maximum of V. However, such a V only implies that the original angle phi zero is strictly m plus one order non-degenerate. Since phi zero is phi zero is a high order degenerate and phi n when n is larger than zero larger than larger or equal to one is a perturbation of phi zero due to the iteration in young's method so usually phi n of x is no longer strictly m plus one non-degenerate So, for our purpose, we need to modify V in the iteration such that phi n is strictly n plus 1 order non-degenerate for all n. This technique of modification has been used by Wang and Yu in constructing examples such that the Lyapunov exponent L. LA can be discontinuous in infinity differential topology. But the method used by Wand Yang, Wand Yu cannot be applied directly in our case. In Wang Yu case, the modification can be made locally because the function is not. Function is not analytic. Well, in our case, the modification is analytic. So it is global. Fortunately, we found the fact that the modification is ignorable outside some neighbor of the critical points, which is sufficient for. Is sufficient for our purpose. Okay. Finally, is the idea for the absolute continuous of the upload exponents. We know that the main difficulty comes from the bad regularity near the endpoints of gaps because. Because at endpoints, the Laplace one is locally one over two holder continuous. But for most phase, regularity is strictly better than wild to hold. In fact, for a measure of, sorry, for a for uh sorry uh for um for uh for most e in fact for um for major uh e in the spectrum and the lyrical exponent is uh lipis so uh the main difficulty uh means come from the end points uh the this bad situation in at the end points um in the proof of In the proof of conclusion two, that is one or two holder canals at end points. We found that near endpoints EN of the nth gap, we have such estimate L E the difference between L E and L E N is less than C n times C n times the square of the difference E and E n. Very important is that Cn tends to zero such that the summation for Cn square is infinite is finite. Thus, we can obtain the absolute continuous. Obtained the absolute continuous of Nyapunov exponent by Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities. That is, to estimate such a sum, it is less than the sum of SN2 square root of sum of SN2. CN2 times square root of the sum of some of the sum of some lengths of some intervals, some intervals, square root of it. So when the when the second term is the same, The second term is small. When the second term on the right-hand side is small, and then the term on the left-hand side is also small because sum of CN2 is finite. And this is the idea for the And this is the idea for the absolute continuous of Leafspones. Okay, and I stop here. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Are there questions online or presents audio? Yes, I would. Yes, can you hear me? Yeah. Yes, Pelix, speak a little slowly because my English is bad. No worries, no worries. Thanks for this beautiful talk. I was just thinking about the dry version. You suggested that what was it that Cosmo? What was it that cosine-type trigonometric potentials? You had this dry version, so all gaps are open. Do you have any example of closed gaps in the supercritical regime for cosine type or non-cosign type? Or can you give us your impressions? Thank you. Thank you. Exempts for what? Closed gaps so that you do not have the dry version in you mean an example for that the dry version does not help true. You mean that? Yes. I I have no uh concrete example uh um I but um the but um yeah but uh concern Johnson and the average Makaya's paper point out that the geology of conduct spectrum does not hold true for general analytic potentials I have seen I have seen the papers of Consene and Johnson, but I cannot understand the details. And the conclusion of this paper is like this. I have no concrete. But since I have suggested the problems whether the Suggest the problems whether cosine type condition is necessary for a giver of counter examples. So, I think if we want to find the counter examples, we have to consider the function that does not satisfy cosine type. Yeah. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Are there more questions? So I would like to ask on the regularity of the Yaponov exponent you always have the Diaphantine assumption, right? But it seems like you can relax that for view number assumption, at least in the previous one. Can you say something to that? Yeah. Can you say something to that? Yeah. For example, you and Zan has improved the result of Gauten and Slager here. Yuan Zen and Hanzhen has obtained such a result for some weeks. Such a result for some weaker Louvre frequency. And for cosine type potentials here, Liang, Wang, and Yu. In fact, in this result, we obtained this same conclusion for For Lewin frequencies, if the beta is less than infinity. And that is for a fixed beta, we can find a sufficiently large lambda zero. If lambda is larger than this. Is larger than this lambda zero, we have the same results. Okay, thank you. Yeah, I want to comment in regard to Joachim's question. So this Avaloshutomarskaya result that you mentioned, it's not a result actually, it's we mentioned in our paper. We mentioned in our paper it's regarding subcritical potentials. So we say that, in fact, whenever the dual operator has conciting eigenvalues, and this is basically goes back to Joachim's argument, that there is a closed gap. And presumably, those are not so difficult to construct. So difficult to construct, but I don't know of any explicit examples. But this would provide some closed gaps in the sub-critical regime. I am not aware of any results on closed gaps in the supercritical regime. That's what Joachim asked. Although, presumably they do exist. So, you mean Johnson's paper is about the subcritical regime? Yes, Johnson's paper is also about subcritical regime. So, and our remark is also about subcritical regime. Okay, okay, thank you. Are there further questions? If not, then let's thank the speaker again for the next one. Thank you.
