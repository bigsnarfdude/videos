With the speaker of this morning's session, Eduardo Dercia Joales, and we will talk about recent results for the pesky problem. So, please, Eduardo. Thank you for the introduction, and thank you for the invitation. I would also like to acknowledge the funding from the Mariko reactions, and I will talk about some results about the pesking product, which is also kind of far from the topics here because it will be, as we will see, a parabolic problem, but coming from Problem, but coming from fluids. I will first introduce the physics and the equation that describes this problem, then the formulation that I will use to get the results. I will go over some related and previous works, and finally I will try to explain briefly one particular result. So the PESCIM problem uh comes from a very simple model of uh cells or vesicles moving in Cells or vesicles moving in blood. In particular, or more concretely, we will have a filament, which is assumed to be elastic, immersed in a fluid. In 3D, we will have a membrane, like a sphere, with fluids inside and outside. We will assume that the fluids are incompressible, we are modeling liquids, and in general, the fluid inside and outside can be different. Can be different. The dynamics will be given by a stock, so we are neglecting inertia. And then we have the coupling of the elasticity with the fluid mechanics effects. Basically, when we stretch the filament, this will create an elastic force, which will push the fluids, and then that motion will again stretch the filament, and so on. That capping is modeled by the boundary conditions, where the stress balance. Where the stress balance is given by an elastic law. And in the simplest case, the one that I will consider here, this law is linear, the one that the spring satisfies, like the Hook's law. Here I haven't said yet, capital X will be the parametrization of the filament. And in general, one can consider a more general elastic law with some conditions for this capital tau. For this capital tau. Many of the results I will mention works also in that case, but I will not show them. And two more boundary conditions that we need: because we are assuming that we have stokes, the velocity needs to be continuous at the interface. And finally, the dynamic boundary condition, the the filament is moving with the flow, with the velocity U. So this is the classical formulation, the Eulerian formulation. Formulation, the Eulerian formulation, and from here one can look at it in weak form. And this is usually the so-called immersed boundary formulation. I just put it here because the name of the problem, Peskin problem, comes from Charles Peskin, who introduced this idea in the numerical literature. Basically what we are doing is that the boundary conditions are now introduced as forces in our equation. Forces in our equation. I'm not interested in this formulation, I will not use it, but from here, if so, here Î¼ is an indicator function. It would be one value inside and what value outside, indicating the jumping viscosities. But if for a moment we forget that and we think that we have the same fluid inside and outside, then this is just one, and here we have the Laplace. And then we can invert the Stokes, we can solve the Stokes equation here. This stock equation here, and by doing so, we obtain a close equation for the interface X. And here, capital G is Kerner given by the fundamental solution of the stops. So, in summary, what we have, the contour formulation, the one that I will use, and all this, assuming that there is no viscosity junk, so we have the same fluids outside and inside, then this is our RPD. We have, in fact, these are two equations for both. In fact, these are two equations for both components of x, and we see that it's uh non-linear and non-local. And well, now the question is: uh what can we say about uh this PDE? In particular, I will be interested in studying classical solutions. What are the regularity of those solutions? How do they behave for large times? And I would like to get the results for the lowest uh regularity for the minimum regularity m for the initial date. Relative for the initial data, as long as I can. So, to understand this equation, we can, like a typical approach, is to study the symbol of the equation or the leading part or in the applied literature, the small scale decomposition. Basically, we are looking at the kernel and we check what remains when eta is very close to the. So, when we do that, after an iteration by parts, we obtain this. By parts, we obtain these two terms, and for smaller scales, we see that this behaves more or less like one divided by thermodynamic zeta. So, what we have is here a kernel like the Hilbert transfer one applied to one derivative. In other words, we are writing the equation in this form. So, we have the lambda operator, the square root of the Laplacian, which I just said is the Hilbert transfer of one derivative, plus Plus, some other terms which I would like to consider them as remainder, and that we will need to check that. And from here, we see that in principle, if it is true that these are remainder, then we would have a parabolic equation, a fractional heat equation. So we expect that there is a dissipation in the system. And in fact, this structure is the one that was used in the first two papers that showed the local. That shows the local closeness for the pest skin colour. In these two papers, which they appear almost at the same time, three years ago, they show local velposeness and also the convergence to the steady state. The difference between them are some most mostly technical points. Uh I should mention that the problem has a natural scaling and and because of that we can we can talk about critical spaces. we can talk about critical spaces, also critical spaces. Uh here uh this is the one to um to think uh C one. So we want the tangent vector to be bounded and this is the scaling invariant space for any dimension. So in this first work they work in various critical spaces, H5 halves and then in this uh second work uh they go all the way up to almost critical. No, here gamma is any positivity number. Here, gamma is any positive number. And also, in this second word, they show that the solution, which initially is only in this held C1 gamma, for all positive time, it's smooth. So the solution gets in the filament gets regularized. I will try to describe how this result, what's the proof of these results, because that gives an idea of what is the best employment and what happens with it. And after that, I will review. And after that, I will review some other results and then I will talk about uh my results. So these uh ones here are all for two dimensions, so a filament and same viscosities inside and outside. So the starting point is the decomposition that I mentioned before. Since we have something like a fractional equation, this is a semi-linear parabolic equation. The traditional, the natural way to proceed is to study The natural way to proceed is to study mild solutions, so use DuHamel, write it in this form. And now let's try to close a fixed point argument here for a small time, using the smallness of that parameter. In principle, one can expect to close a fixed point argument and show a system in certain spaces. The next thing or the reason why this argument works so well here is that first R, we will show it's a lower order, and that's related with the equation being. Related for with the equation being semi-linear, and also that the semi-group here is completely explicit both in Fourier and in physical variables. So one can do estimates directly. And by smoother or remainder, I mean this, like the leading term was the lambda operator. So this is operator of order one. It's taking one derivative. And the remainder, we see that it's slightly smoother than that. Slightly smoother than that. And that is true if we work in subcritical spaces. So, this is true only for gamma strictly positive. If we are working with a critical space, then I don't know if this works. And in fact, this approach is not expected to work, at least not in this same form. Another thing that is usually important in this fluid interface problem is we want to avoid the filament of the interface to touch itself. So we need to have a condition. So we need to have the control of this quantity, the so-called R quantity. And in this approach, this is just done by including that condition in the spaces where we close the fixed point. And yeah, and finally, the smooth thing is shown by bootstrapping the regularity here. Since this is lower order, one can start to bootstrap that and show that for any positive time, the interface becomes synthetic. Yeah, just before I move on, I would like to mention that now this we, in collaboration with my collaborators Ekuo, Mori and Strain, we have extended these results for 3D. And some of the main differences in that case, apart from the obvious complication of the geometry that we need to localize in charts, the equation is. Charts. The equation is not semi-linear anymore. It 3D becomes quasi-linear. And then one needs to do more localizations in that sense. And that is a result that will appear in a few weeks. I mentioned that in those papers, they also studied the steady states. This is the typical behavior that one expects. One starts with some closed filament and it evolves to a sign. I will. I will my result, the one I want to mention, will deal with global in-time regularity, so I will explain more about that later. Okay, so just to finish the introduction, let me mention two problems that are very closely related to this model. The first one is now much more classical, is when we have two fluids and in at the interface between them we have only Face between them, we have only surface tension. So there is no material filament in between. That problem has been studied much more in the last 50 years by many authors. And the other one that I want to mention is the Muscat problem, which comes from completely different settings, where you have a porous media like sand, and you have a fluid uh on the bottom and a fluid on top, and the interface in between uh you can consider that it's given by a graph, which would be this F here. Graph, which would be this F here. And the thing is that the equation that is satisfied by that interface, at least for small slopes, if we forget about this term here, at the linear level, we obtain the same equation that's for the Phase King problem, a fractional heat equation. And there are some other similarities between those two problems. And well, for the Muscat problem, in the last 10 years, there are many, many results, many different techniques. And many of those techniques now. Now people are trying to use them to study this fluid structure problems, like the Pescin one. And one important difference between those two problems and fluid interaction problems is that here only the shape of the interface matters. For example, for the surface tension, one only cares about the curvature. Where we have a an elastic interface, a ma a material, um Material, the parametrization of the interface is what tells you what's the stretching of that fiddle net. And because of that, instead of having a scalar equation for the Peskim problem, we will have one equation for each component of the curve. So yeah, these are the latest results. The latest results for the pesking problem. And basically, in the last year, always in the case with same viscosities, several results with critical regularity have appeared. Let me mention these two in the middle, the one by Shena and Eugene. They are able to show local well-posedness in a very large space for the linear elasticity law, and then a camera straight. And then the Cameron Strain use this slightly smaller space, so, in particular, this one has bounded and continuous slopes, but for the more general non-linear log. And then there are some other works, like this one by Vancedo, Gerard, Melicon, and Escorogia, and this by Ton, where they don't really study the peskin problem, but the models of them, considering only the effects or the. Only the effects or the movement in the normal or in the tangential direction. So they use scalar models of the best temporary. And the result I want to mention is this one here in collaboration with Julia Mori and Robert String, where we obtain the global regularity and the convergence to the steady states in the case when the fluids are different inside and outside, and for interfaces with physical regularity. So, since I want to study the global tribality issue, the first thing is: okay, what are the steady states? And it happens that it's easier to study, determine the steady states from the Augurian equations than from the Ponto formulation. It's not too hard to check that this energy law is satisfied for the system. So, at the steady state, we have that the So at the steady state, we have that the gradient of the velocity is zero, and plugging that back into this equation, one can solve very simple ODEs and check that the unique steady states and unique only I'm this is for two-dimensional problem, the unique steady states are spanned by these four elements. So we have a four-dimensional vector space that characterizes uh completely what are the the steady states. And I wrote here that the steady states are uniformly parametrized signals because Uniformly parametrized circles, because, as I mentioned before, the parametrization is important. A circle parametrized in a different way might not be steady state, might start to move. Here, well, just to mention that these two elements represent the center of the sitcom, and here these coefficients, A and B, each the radius of hopposit. Okay, so this is the contour formulation in our. The contour formulation in our case with viscosity jump. We see that the equation is basically what we had before, but instead of the elastic force, we have this virtual force. So we need to solve first this non-local equation with this capital S given in this form. And once we solve this integral equation, we obtain F and we come back to our equation. I will not really show much about this, just mentioning that this is the difference. Mentioning that this is the difference when we have different viscosities. And let me fix some notation. So I will consider initial interfaces living in this capital F11 space. So this is the tangent vector is in the Viner algebra and the Viner algebra, I will mention it later, but in particular the initial the tangent the initial tangent vector is bounded and is continuous. Vector is bounded and is continuous, and it's more than that. So the linear algebra spaces, which I denote by capital F S1 nu are defined in this way. The one comes because we are taking the L1 norm in Fourier side, S from S derivatives, and the nu is a parameter which is zero at times zero, but for positive times it's given exponential thermography. So for positive, if we control this norm for positive times, our This norm for positive time, our solution is analytic. And that's how we will show the smoothing of the filament. So this is the result. Basically for any ratio of the viscosities and any initial interface living in these spaces with some fixed area, let's say pi. Then the node by Subinda. Then the node by sub-index C, the part of the interface that leaves the space spanned by the steady state, and the difference, this straight x, is the deviation. So if the deviation is small enough, with that smallness depending on the viscosity chunk, we can show that there is a unique global classical solution satisfying these inequalities. And these inequalities in particular will tell me that we have exponential convergence to the statistical. Convergence to the steady state, and this last equation we will show later. This is since these quantities are going to zero, this estimate is telling me that the convergence is in fact to a circle with the same area as the initial one. And that is expected because the fluids are incompressible, so the area should be preserved. Okay, so I have time, I will describe how the proof is. Describe uh how the proof uh goes. Well, first uh I said that the steady states are uniformly parameterized circles, but a priori if you give me the initial interface, I don't know what's the circle to which the interface is going to converge. And because of that, instead of a fixed circle, I'm going to consider a time-dependent one, and I will need to control all these parameters. And here, the radius of that time-dependent one. And here the radius of that time-dependent silk call will be hidden by this. Now we are studying a global intended result, so let's linearize around these silkwash. This is the system we obtain. So for the linear operator, it's the lambda minus this lower order term. And when we write it in Fourier variables, and I do this because since I'm working in binary algebra spaces that were defined for Fourier, then this seems natural. Then this seems natural. So, in Fourier variables, the linear operator looks like this. It's quite simple. It's basically ordered one. So, taking one derivative plus these anointed things here. So, to get rid of these terms here, or basically to check the eigenvalues of these operators, we diagonalize and we see that all the eigenvalues of this problem are strictly in. Are strictly negative, okay, with this sign here. So we obtain for all frequencies dissipation except for the values 1 minus 1 and 0. So we have some frequencies where there is no dissipations, and those are the ones that will give problems to obtain the detail. On the other hand, it's not too surprising that we have some zero gain values because we have some invariances in the problem, like for example, if The problem, like for example, if one checks the equations from the beginning, the problem is translation invariants. It doesn't matter where you put the interface. Okay, since we have diagonalized, we have naturally introduced these new variables, y and when we write the system. In these new variables, one nice thing is that in these new variables, the steady states, the silk codes, or the time-dependent shield. Silk cost or the time-dependent silk cost have a very nice characterization. The first component is always zero. So, basically, in these new variables, when we split into steady state plus perturbation, we have, in a very simple form, we have done a projection. We have projected our equations into the steady state part plus deviation. And we can see that the deviation part satisfies always these properties. These properties. Okay, so to conclude, we have a system with some dissipation here, except for the zero frequencies and one component of the first frequency. For those ones, we don't have dissipation, we don't expect dissipation, but we can handle them using, or at least thinking that this comes from symmetry, so we should have a natural way to control them. And the way to control them. And the way to control them is on one hand for the first frequency, the first frequency comes from the cosine and sine, and that was in the equation for the steady state, that was the coefficients A and B. Those were the coefficients that gave the radius of the circle. So it's natural to think that this frequency will be controlled using incompressibility. So we will be able to change one of the equations by the equation coming from incompressibility. And the other frequency that does not have dissipation will not matter because it comes from translation invariance. So, this frequency will not appear in the non-linear terms. So, it will really not give any problem. This is in fact the system that one obtains. Now, everything has linear term negative, so this giving dissipation. And this is the equation coming from compressibility, so the dangerous frequency is given. So, the dangerous frequency is given by all the other ones. So, one can substitute them, and then, in principle, no problem. No problem, at least at the linear level, using here and studying the linear norm, we obtain the dissipation plus the non-linear quantity. And of course, then we would need to control these non-linear terms. So, in particular, this is where all the technical part appears, and this is the second difficulty of the problem. We were dealing with critical regularity. With critical regularity. So, when we deal with a critical space, it's not clear that the non-linearity is small, but there is where the linear algebra choice of the spaces plays a role. And I decided not to include any details about that. So, basically, I conclude here. Just believe me, that in these Vinilar spaces, one can show that this nonlinear part can be controlled by the dissipation, and then one closes the source. So, I will stop here. So I will let it stop here. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Any questions? Maybe I have a quick one. It's actually a question. So in the result that you showed, I suppose that the last so actually you have to come back earlier to the the original equation, so the initial equation. Original equation, so the initial equation. Once you look in the Fourier variables, I see that you're taking jointly the two linear parts. So there's the fractional Laplace and the lower order term. So it's really the lower order term is really playing a role in here, or it could be added to the non-linear part. No, no, you need to take the whole linear part together because you want the uniformly parameterized circles to be For an apparent silos to be in the kernel of the linear operate. If you put the Hilbert transfer on the linear term, then that's. Yes. Other questions? Common? Yeah, I have a sort of naive question. If I understood well, the the linear part, the linear main component is uh the Hibbert transform and one derivative. Um that's the okay. That's the okay. Uh not really. So that's the leading part, or that's the higher order part of the equation. So to study local regularity, that's the term that you want to keep for the semi group. But when you study the global regularity, if you linearize around the uniformly parameterized symbols, then the linear operator is this one here. So you have the lambda, but also this lower order term. Okay, so where is the the difference? So, where is the diffusion? So, the diffusion is in principle even by you need to consider both together for the diffusion. This one, the lambda, gives diffusion for all frequencies. But because of this lower order term, for frequencies 1, minus 1, and 0, you don't get diffusion. So, the Hubble transform gives you diffusion? No, no, no. The lambda, the square root of the Laplacian, if you go to Fourier, this is absolute value. You go to Fourier, this is the absolute value of k. So that gives you the Fourier. Yeah? And if you consider the transport equation, that doesn't happen. No, no, this is... So if you consider this equation, simply these terms here, what you have is a fraction affected equation. Yeah, I know, but that's the reason I told my question is naive because compared with Compared with the transport equation, it's like uh the same order, right? Compared with the transport I'm not sure if I understood you, but no, like if if you write this in Fourier, you write this uh part in Fourier, do I have a no, I think, yeah, okay, I got it, I got it. The absolute value is important. Yes, in the Fourier signal. Yeah, yeah, completely. Yeah, yeah, completely. Okay. Questions? If not, let's thank the door again. And we will resume here for just for the picture, I think, so or and it will be at uh two o'clock yeah. Yeah.
