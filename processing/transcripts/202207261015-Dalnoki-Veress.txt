Yeah. Super. So let me just get my windows organized here so I can see things properly. Okay, I think that'll do. What I would really appreciate if there's any questions, please feel free to just interrupt me during the talk. If I don't get through anything, that's completely fine. So I want to, I guess, first of all, thank the organizers for putting together this great workshop. I've just immensely enjoyed the talk so far. And I was just telling Stephen that I'm up for my research grant. That I'm up for my research grant this year. And it's just so nice to sit here and collect all these ideas and stimulus for things that we might do in the future. So it's been just wonderful. So I want to tell you about bubbles and droplets as granular analogs of continued materials. The title is not very good. I'll tell you exactly what we're on about. But before I go any further, I just wanted to sort. I just wanted to sort of motivate things a little bit by saying that a lot of the work that I'm talking about today comes about from work that was done a little bit earlier. And that was done with Pierre Soulard, Elie Raphael, Tomas Sales, Eric Weeks, that were working. We were working on basically trying to understand how clusters of droplets, so these beautiful crystals that you see right here, when you crush them, how you might go from seven rows to six rows. And it turns out that. And it turns out that you can do that by having these faults that appear. And so we had a lot of fun playing with this system. And like I mentioned during my introduction yesterday, I've been kind of obsessed with droplets for way too long, and it just continues after this. So the work that I'm going to tell you about was carried out by two of my PhD students, Jean-Christophe Honoura de Biot and Jonathan. Stuff on ODBO and Jonathan Hogarth. And the trajectory of my talk will be as follows. I first just want to tell you about just a couple of tools because that helps you understand a little bit what it is that we're trying to do and how we actually accomplish what we're doing in the lab. Then I want to tell you about the motivation. The motivation is really quite simple. So I've been obsessed with this idea of how do you go from granular to continuums? When do you have too few particles? When do you have too few particles that you cannot describe things by continuum properties anymore? Where does that boundary lie? So, basically, how few particles is too few. And that's been something I've been quite interested in for a while. I'm going to talk about that with, I guess, two vignettes. So spreading of a granular analog of a liquid puddle in 3D and 2D. And if there is time, then there's a little bit of dessert at the end. What I'll say is that we're starting off with things that. That we're starting off with things that you know, some of this stuff, some earlier stuff is published and is sort of finished. And as we progress further, we get more and more into areas that are fresh. Okay, so I want to tell you how we make these beautiful monodispers droplets. So it's absolutely trivial. We have a little micropipette. We eject oil out of that micropipette into an aqueous solution that is water. An aqueous solution that is water with SDS. The SDS is surfactant, it stabilizes the oil droplets. But what's nice is that if you have an excess of SDS, they form micelles in the solution that causes a depletion interaction and causes the oil droplets to stick to each other. So we can control that very nicely by changing the concentration of SDS. So we make our droplets, we eject the droplet out, and what you'll see is if you look along here, you can see there's something strange that happens in this image right here. That happens in this image right here. There's a small meniscus that forms, and that is because the water wants to wet the inside of the pipette. So, as the oil is coming out, the water is going in. There's an instability, much like a plateau Rayleigh instability that appears, and the droplet snaps off. Now, what is nice about this method is that we're not controlling the size of the droplet by controlling the flow rate or the pressure in the system. Or the pressure in the system. We're letting nature choose the size of the droplet for us because it's an instability that happens. And as a result, the droplets are extremely monodisperse. Of course, there's no such thing as monodisperse droplets. There has to be some difference between them, but we cannot measure the difference between them. It's too small. Okay. Now, the disadvantage of this approach is that it's a very slow way to make droplets. So if you just need a few droplets, this is great, two hertz. If you're doing lots of droplets, then you need more complicated. Doing lots of droplets, then you need more complicated microfluidic approaches. So, this snap-off instability is really quite a nice way and very cheap way to get very nice controlled droplets. And the size of the droplet is very simply related to the radius of the insided pipette. So it's just a geometric factor. Okay, so here's an image of these droplets. You can see they form these beautiful, beautiful crystals, of course, because there's adhesion and because they're all the same size. Because they're all the same size. Okay, so that's how we make the droplets. The next part is that we're interested in measuring the forces between these droplets. And so I want to tell you how we do that. And so over the last years, we have extensively developed this micropipette deflection setup. And it's extremely simple. All we have is a little thin glass rod. We heat it up, we pull it. So, this is the same way that in biology people do patch clamping and so forth. Patch clamping and so forth. So we pull this pipette. We do it in a slightly different way. What we do is we pull the pipette so that it is extremely thin and very long. And so by thin, I mean that the radius is about a tenth of a human hair and the length is about three millimeters, three centimeters. And so what that means is that this is an extremely floppy fiber that just wafts back and forth in the wind, which means that you can use deflection to very easily measure force. Measure forces. In fact, we can get down to sort of tens of piconewtons of force resolution with this technique. It's really quite nice. And the other thing that's nice about it is that because it is a pipette and remains a tube even in the thin part, it means that you can use suction to grab things, including these oil droplets. We've gotten good at being able to make different shapes with these pipettes. So here's an example of a pipette where we Here's an example of a pipette where we've bent it into this funny L shape. And the reason there is because, in the one direction, for example, let's imagine that you're coming in from the left-hand side and pushing up against it. Then you can measure a normal force, but you can also measure, for example, a friction force if you're sliding something back and forth. So the geometry can be adjusted very easily. And that's again simply by just heating up the glass and melting it very carefully. And the other thing that we can do is we can make more complicated, say, We can make more complicated shapes like this, this zigzag that you see right here, and that is just for experimental reasons. Is because when this bipet is really long, three centimeters, you can't necessarily stick that into your microscopic sample cell. So if we make it into a zigzag, we can make it more compact and have it all fit nicely. So there's a lot of potential with this technique. And the other nice thing is that, of course, it's very easy to just snap off the pipette in shorter sections. Snap off the pipette in shorter sections to increase the stiffness. So you have a huge range of force constants that you can use. Okay, so one of the reasons that we need to use this for the purposes of this talk is that I want to know what is the adhesive strength between two of these oil droplets that are prepared inside this aqueous environment. So remember, it's a depletion interaction that's causing the droplets to stick. And so we do a very simple experiment on the left-hand side Very simple experiment. On the left-hand side, we have a micropipette holding a droplet. Again, just a tiny little bit of suction on there, just to be able to hold that droplet in place. Same thing on the right-hand side. The left-hand side is attached to a motorized translation stage. It's a stiff pipette. The right-hand side right here is one of these L-shaped pipettes. So here you're seeing the short section of it, but it goes up and it would go up, you know, way, way, way up because it's like, you know, three centimeters long. It's like you know three centimeters long. So, what that means is that it deflects back and forth to measure the force. So, I'll play this video for you. And so, what you can see is that as this pipette moves towards the right, they're in contact now. I'm going to start pulling apart. And at some point, it snaps off. And then you can measure the force. Now, I'm going to play this one more time. And what I ask you to do is focus on this part right here, which is the actual force measurement. So, again, Measurement. So again, I'm coming in from the left. I make contact. You can see the pipette moving towards the right. And then as we pull back, now it's in a neutral position. It overstretches and then snaps back. And so you can very easily get a force measurement in this way and know exactly what adhesion forces are. Okay, so those are the tools that are useful for this talk and for what I want to share with you. And so I'm going to start. And for what I want to share with you. And so, I'm going to start off with the first vignette, which was work done by Jean-Christophe. And so, in this talk, I think I'm going to start off first by just some very, very simple physics. So, let's imagine we have a puddle of water. Of course, if I add water to the system, I have a spherical cap. That spherical gap grows. At some point, the puddle reaches a maximum height and then grows out in area. Grows out in area. And the shape is dependent on gravity, the balance between gravity and surface tension. And the height of this puddle is given by the capillary length, which is the balance between surface tension and gravity in this system. So that's what happens for water. If we now take a granular system, of course, we see a very different behavior. We have a conical shape that forms due to the friction between the particles. The friction between the particles, we have a characteristic angle of repose. There's avalanches that happen in the system. There's all kinds of interesting physics that happens in this case. And so the question that we were after is, well, what happens if instead of having water molecules or having sand grains, what happens if we have these frictionless spheres? And others have looked at similar systems. So there's this beautiful work by Ortiz, Reen, and Daniels, where they looked Daniels, where they looked at. So, here's colloidal particles that are flowing down against a barrier. That barrier is right here. And as they change the flow rate of the colloidal particles coming down, more and more accumulate onto this surface. Now, on the right-hand side, they have expanded the vertical scale so you can see a little bit easily what's going on at low velocities. This is the accumulation that you get at higher velocities. You get a steeper and Velocities, you get a steeper and steeper cone that forms. There's something like an angle of repose that happens in the system, but it's dynamic. If you stop the flow, this goes away. And then there's this really nice work by Schwartz and Fytosa, where they had bubbles that are moving up. And again, in this dynamic system, you get a characteristic angle of repose that forms. And so for these systems, you have frictionless particles. Frictionless particles. There's no adhesion in this system. And the angle of repose is dynamically stabilized. You need the dynamics to have this angle of repose. So we want to use our droplets in a similar kind of setup. And so what we said is, well, you know, in our case, we have controlled adhesion between the droplets. Of course, gravity is playing a role because these oil droplets are buoyant. They flow towards the top of the chamber. So gravity may. Chamber. So gravity matters. It's clearly non-continuum because we have these individual particles, and there's no friction between the particles because it is a fluid. So the experiment that Jean-Christave did is really, really simple. Okay, so here we have our pipette that makes the oil droplets via this snap-off instability. The droplets float towards the top of the chamber. We're looking at it with a We're looking at it with a microscope. The top of the chamber is just a cover slip microscope slide, which is completely horizontal and flat. So the droplets hit the top and then stay there. And so what happens is that over time, there's a cluster that grows, an aggregate that grows in size. And so we were interested in understanding the dynamics of this. How does this grow? Okay. And this is what we see with the This is what we see with the optical microscope. We're looking from below, you could also look from above, but basically, because we're not looking from the side, we're looking from above or below, what we see is just the footprint of this cluster. Okay, I'll just pause there. Are there any questions about the sample geometry or what we're doing here from anyone? Last question. We're good. Please. Can you share the secret of how to level the micro cover slip to be perfectly level? The cover slip to be perfectly level or a trade secret? No, it's definitely not a trade secret. It's just, it is just trial and error. Some shims and everything like that to keep it straight. But because these droplets just, I mean, it is essentially a level that you have. It's very easy to make sure that you have it so that it's completely horizontal. Thank you. Okay. So before I show you more about this, I just want to say again. I just want to say again: so, here on the left-hand side, we have the granular system. On the right-hand side, we have this continuum system. The experiment that JC is doing is this one. So, things are not flowing down, things are flowing up. So, it's really like turning this upside down. Okay, that's the experiment we're doing. So, here's what we see with the microscope. So, this is the cluster growing in size. This is sped up tremendously, okay? It is a 500 times speed. There's one droplet that appears every 20 seconds. Appears every 20 seconds. And that's because we want to be operating in a quasi-static regime. So all we're doing is adding, you can think of it like adding one droplet of oil to the pile and asking the question, what happens? Adding another one, what happens? Image analysis is straightforward. We get the footprint, and then we can do things like plot the area, the normalized area in this case. So it's normalized by the area of one of the oil droplets as a function. Oil droplets as a function of the number of oil droplets that we're adding to the system. And this is what you see. So here you can see this cluster growing again, and you can see that, you know, there's a sort of on average, a smooth curve that you get here. But of course, there's steps because this object grows with these little micro fractures and little tiny avalanches that happen throughout the whole system in order for it to grow. Hi, quick question from the audience. Yeah. So, um, Yeah, from the audience. Yeah. So, what I'm wondering is, are you guys changing the location of the syringe tip or the micropipette tip? No, no. Thank you. Thank you for that question. The droplets are always coming up in exactly the same spot. There might be some small fluctuations from side to side, but we keep that fixed. Thank you. Can I ask a question as well? In these movies, you have these sort of patches of crystalline arrangements. Are they significant? They are the spheres are all exactly the same size, and there is adhesion, so they're forming small crystalline patches. Sonny, you have a question? Yes, Kerry, it's great talk. So I think follow up the first questions. You said horizontally doesn't move. Did you change the distance from the glass substrate? I guess the inner shaft can push the oil drops on the side. Push the oil drops on the side? No, there's no inertia in this system because the droplets are so small and the difference in density so small that they're really appearing very slowly in hits. So inertial effects can be ignored. I see, I see. Okay, thanks. You're welcome. Okay, so we can then ask ourselves a question like, well, how do these, how can these things grow in size? So we can have different models for spreading of this cluster. So if we have Clusters. So if we have three-dimensional growth, of course, the volume of the object that we have is going to scale like the number of droplets. If we have something growing in 3D, then it means that the area is self-similar in 3D, then that means that the area, the footprint is growing to grow like n to the two-thirds. On the other hand, if you have a puddle where the height is fixed, then as you add more volume, As you add more volume, you're growing in area, but the height remains constant. So that means that the area grows like n. So we have different power laws depending on whether we have 3D growth or 2D growth. So great, let's look at the data. This is what the data looks like. And so what we can see is that for a large number of droplets, we have that the area roughly goes like N. So we have a pancake that's growing. But if we zoom in on the But if we zoom in on the left, we have something that's consistent with a spherical cap that grows, or at least three-dimensional growth rather than two-dimensional growth that happens. So we clearly have characteristics of something that looks a little bit like the growth of a puddle. Okay, so staying with that analogy then, of course, for the puddle, we have gravity versus surface tension that gives us the capillary length. That gives us the capillary length. In our case, we have buoyancy for these particles moving up, that's taking the role of gravity, and we have adhesion in the system. So what we postulated is let's replace this capillary length by what we're calling the granular capillary length, where all we're doing is, of course, the gravity term is trivial, that's just ρg, and the surface tension gets replaced by the adhesion between the particles. Adhesion between the particles. Now, if we take that a little further, we say, okay, well, our patch is going to grow horizontally because we're saying it's got a fixed height. So is there a question? Yes, I read the question here. Yeah. So Kari, I'm a little bit. So in terms of the when you talk about this length scale, right, this is, if I understand Right, this is if I understand correctly. So, this characterizes the you are trying to describe the regime of very large n or very small n? Thanks for the question, Benny. I'm trying to describe the regime of large n, where we have this pancake-like race. So, the initial you do expect a continuum theory in which the particle size does not enter. That's why you construct some kind of your equations that you share on the board now is kind of. The board now is kind of really does ignores the particle level, absolutely, absolutely right. So, so remember, my motivation is to understand to what extent can we take continuum ideas and apply them to a granular system, right? That's what I'm trying to understand. And in this case, I'm using a continuum theory to try to describe a granular experiment. It's going to work for some parts, it's going to fail horribly for other parts. Like, for example, cannot. Other parts, like for example, cannot capture these avalanches, right? So, yeah, thanks for that. Avalanches, but also not the case of a very small, you cannot capture with the continuum theory the power law that you seem to show in the previous slide for very small number of n. For very small numbers, you know that it has to go like n to the two-thirds, and we capture that. But this is because, you know, not because. Is because you know, not because of continuum theory. So that's what it's just because of particle size. That I don't know, I guess. It's we're adding, we're adding granular particles to the system. If it's growing as a self-similar object, then it has to scale like n to the two-thirds. Okay, thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. Carrie, you have a question on the addition? Yeah. The addition term A that you put. So this may depend on the particle size, right? Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. And we'll get there shortly, Vincent. Okay, so we have the volume is going to grow like the area times h. The height, we're going to say that the height is going to scale like this granular capillary length that we're introducing. And that has to be proportional to the volume. The volume goes like n times r cubed. And so we end up with this expression. And so we end up with this expression right here. Now, in the experiments, we measure the area, we know the size of the droplets. Of course, rho g is trivial. And we know the only thing we don't know is the adhesion. And so we need to find that. And I've told you that we can use our micropipettes in order to get that quantitatively. So we're doing the same kind of micropipette experiment. We're obtaining our critical force. And so we can do that for a range. Force and so we can do that for a range of different systems. And so, again, Jean-Christophe has meticulously gone through and done tons of these experiments. So, here he's measuring the force, the stap-off force, or the force where you have to pull two spheres apart for a range of different droplet sizes and for a specific concentration of SDS in the system. So that's controlling the depletion interaction. And consistent with what others And consistent with what others have measured and with theory, we expect that this force goes like the concentration times the radius of the particles, and that's well established. If he then does this for different concentrations, he sees that indeed, if he increase the concentration of micelles in the system, depletion interaction goes up, you get a steeper curve. We can test how well this works by just collapsing the data. So we take now the first. Data. So we take now the force divided by the concentration as a function of the radius of the particles. We see it does pretty well, certainly within the error of the experiments. Okay, so now we know that we know how the force depends on the size of the particles. We know that the adhesion is going to be the force divided by the length scale of the system, the radius. And we know that this is proportional to the concentration of micelles in the system. So we've described. The system. So we've described everything. So that means that now we have this expression right here: the adhesion term, this A, this script A. Careful here, because I've got a regular A and a script A. This script A is proportional to the concentration in the system. So everything depends on this capillary, this granular capillary length in the system. And if we substitute that in here, then we end up with this very simple expression. With this very simple expression to describe what's going on in these experiments. Okay, so I've just taken some snapshots here. Here's a footprint of one of these clusters. This is with fairly large droplets, a fairly low adhesion strength between the particles, and we form this cluster. It's a very open cluster that forms. And then what we can say is, well, let's decrease the radius of these particles, keeping everything. The radius of these particles keeping everything constant. Well, if we decrease the radius of the particles, we're decreasing the importance of buoyancy. If buoyancy is not putting as much pressure, so you don't have as much pressure on the system, you get a much more collapsed structure and you get a larger pile that forms, a thicker pile that forms. We can now do the other experiment where we can say, okay, let's take this and let's change instead of using a small adhesion constant. Instead of using a small adhesion constant, let's increase the adhesion constant. Of course, if I increase the adhesion between the particles, I'm going to increase the granular capillary length, which means that now my pancake should be a fatter pancake. And indeed, that's what we get. You get a more compact cluster. And you can see from the darkness that you have here that you have more particles on top of each other. Okay, so in this way, Jean-Christophe has looked at, you know, Christophe has looked at a whole bunch of different experiments where he looked at different values of the radius of particles and different values of the concentration of the micelle concentration of the adhesion. And here's what you see for all these different experiments. Now, of course, what we know is that from the theory that I've told you is that we should be able to rescale all of this by the granular capillary length divided by R. And so if we take all of this data and we do that, we get a This data, and we do that, we get this beautiful collapse of all the data. So, what do we learn from this? What we learn is: okay, we can use continuum theory to explain how these clusters grow. They grow, in fact, very much like a puddle of water. Okay. Of course, what we're not capturing is the role of these avalanches or the statistics of these avalanches. So, we're capturing the granular nature of the system. Capturing the granular nature of the system, we're not successfully at this point capturing the continuum nature of the system. We're not successfully capturing the granular nature in the system. So if we smooth everything out, we're fine. If we zoom in, we're not. Larry, can I ask a question? Of course, please. Just to put this to the test a little bit, and probably you thought about this a lot. Suppose right now you're producing monodisperse, very tight. mono disperse very tightly controlled drop uh droplets right um suppose now you're able to produce bi-disperse yeah um right and or you know a different distribution such that you know then your your structure changes a little how does how do you expect this renormalization or this scaling to to work okay so that's a that's a that's a a lovely question A that's a lovely question. So, what I did not have to do not have time to talk about today is sort of this transition from a crystalline structure to a glassy structure when you have a bi-dispersed system. But the earlier stuff that I present that I mentioned, just in passing, the work that we did with our collaborators in France, where we crushed crystals, in fact, we didn't just do it for crystals. We did it for a bi-dispersed system as well. And so, this gets close to the kind of things that many. That many people have been interested in, which is how do you transition from a crystal to a glassy system? So, what Jean-Christophe did in those experiments, and you'll have to look at the paper because I don't have the slides handy here. But what he did was he would start off with the crystal, he would remove one of the spheres and then sticking a small one, do the experiment, remove another one, sticking a small one, do the experiment. So he's progressively adding defects to the system going through. Effects to the system going through the entire sweep from crystal to perfect glass in the middle to crystal again. And you see all kinds of features of glassy phenomena versus crystalline phenomena, differences in the fracture behavior. And we expect that to hold true for this as well. And in fact, so in the next vignette, I won't talk about this crystal to glass because we don't have those, we only have preliminary. Have those, we only have preliminary results on that. It affects things significantly, and it affects things significantly, you know, in a very intuitive way. Because, of course, you don't have as good, you have a disordered system, there is less adhesive structure between the particles, so it's more fragile when you have a glassy system. But yeah, thank you. Thank you for that question. Thank you. It is the direction in which we're moving. Okay. Okay, and we're moving in that direction through these experiments that Jonathan Hogarth has been doing, one of my PhD students. And so he has set up this experiment. So we're switching experiments now. A lot of similarities, but some important differences. So he has this kind of sample cell right here. This is sitting on an angle. He then has a micropipette. And what happens is he produces. And what happens is he produces droplets, and those droplets float up towards the top of the glass surface. Once they hit the glass, they go along this angled glass and hit this barrier. Okay, looking from the side, this is what it looks like. You're ejecting oil droplets. Those oil droplets come to the top. They then travel along the surface and hit this barrier right here. Okay? Are there any questions? Are there any questions about this setup? This is a setup that sometimes people find confusing. So, if you have any questions, now is a good time to interrupt. Okay, maybe I did an awesome job. Okay, so here we have what we see with the optical microscope. So, we're looking perpendicular to the surface of this glass. This entire structure, the way Jonathan has built the experiment, is sitting on a rotation stage. So, we can rotate. Stage. So we can rotate this structure while keeping everything in focus and change the angle. Now that's nice because, in effect, what we're doing is changing the importance of gravity. We're changing the buoyancy term in the system. Now, of course, so here's a bubble or a droplet that has formed. The droplet moves by buoyancy along the glass surface towards the barrier. And here's these droplets accumulating. Okay, so they form this, but this isn't too deep. So they form this, but this isn't 2D, right? The previous stuff was a three-dimensional cluster. Here, these, these, these, these little marbles are all rolling along the top surface and accumulating near the top, right? So, so this is a two-dimensional equivalent of the previous project. Now, what you see is there's action here. The pile grows and collapses. The pile grows and collapses, but there is a characteristic width of that. Width of that two-dimensional puddle that grows. Okay, so here is what this looks like. This is an image taken for a 30-degree angle. And remember, we have this granular capillary length. I need to modify the granular capillary length just a little bit because now we have an angle involved. So it's got a sine theta in the bottom. And And if we go to a smaller angle, of course, a smaller angle means gravity is less important. So, if gravity is less important, then the granular capillary length increases. You get a larger two-dimensional puddle. And that's indeed what we see. Likewise, make it steeper, gravity becomes more important, and you get a shallower puddle. So, in the same way that The same way that Jean-Christophe has done, Jonathan has done this for different values of the radius of particles, for different values of the adhesion strength. So change in the capillary, granular capillary length of the system. And if he looks at the normalized height as a function of the granular capillary length normalized by the rays of the particles, all the data for all these different experiments collapses quite nice. These different experiments collapses quite nicely. There's a lot more to this, but I'm going to leave it at that for the sake of brevity. But regarding the previous question, what Jonathan is doing right now is he's using two pipettes, one that makes small droplets, one that makes large droplets, having them come in, and then looking at what happens when he changes the ratio of small to large, sweeping from crystal. Sweeping from crystal to glass to crystal by changing that ratio back and forth. And the results are very interesting. Now, one of the things that's interesting here to me is the avalanche dynamics or this, perhaps it's not appropriate to call it properly an avalanche, but these fracture events. And so if we look at how this happens, we can see there's a collapse and then everything. A collapse and then everything spreads out. And so the business end is really what happens here in the middle. So we've been trying to understand that a little bit. We're not doing a very good job of it. But here's one image and here's the next image. So you can see that here, all that's happened between these two image is that over time, the bubble or the droplet is moving further towards the top. If I subtract these two images from each other, this is what and take the absolute value. This is what you get. Value, this is what you get. Now let's look at it during a collapsing event. So here is just before the collapse, and here is after the collapse, right? So this is just two frames in the movie sequence. And you can see that if I flip back and forth between these two, you can see that all the droplets are moving to the side and the part in the middle is moving up. So if I subtract those two images, there's a lot going on in the result. And so when there's no avalanche, this is what you get. When there is an avalanche, this is what you get. Is an avalanche? This is what you get. So, this is now a trivial way. All we do is look at the intensity of the subtracted images: image i minus image i plus one, absolute value, and you plot that. And so that allows you to capture the time between avalanches in a completely trivial way. We're also doing particle tracking right now, but this suffices to show the point. So, in this way, we're able to get the time. Able to get the timing or the number of droplets between a collapse. And so here is, you know, all the collapsing events as a function of time for a very long experiment that Jonathan has run. And so he can then look at the number based distribution, the number of particles before you have a collapse as a function, or the number of events that you have with a certain number of droplets. Okay? And this is a And this looks like a Poisson type distribution. We don't know what it is. We don't understand what it is. We can take averages and see that that behaves in a way that one might intuitively expect based on this granular capillary length. But we are all completely open to suggestions when it comes to what kind of interesting things we can learn now that we have such a nice tool to study these avalanches in the system. These avalanches in the system. Quick question. Please. So, do you wait until the system reaches a steady state before you start looking at these statistics? Because I would imagine the amount of work you have to do to move the particles greater and greater as they accumulate, right? Yes, yes, yes. Thank you very much for that question. What I neglected to say is that the barrier has a certain width. Remember, it was that silicon chip that we have at the top of the glass. Have at the top of the glass surface. So, you're absolutely right. There's a certain amount of work that has to be done to push the entire cluster out of the way. But once you've reached that equilibrium, then they just start falling off the side of this barrier and they're out. So then you reach steady state. And what I should say is, in sort of the quasi-static situation, this doesn't matter because there's so much time between one droplet coming, having an avalanche, and the next droplet coming. Avalanche and the next drown put coming. Thank you. Okay, I think we do have time for dessert. So, so this is recent work that we're currently writing up that another PhD student, Carmen Lee, has been doing. Unfortunately, she's defending her thesis in a couple of weeks and leaving me, which I'm very sad about. So she has done this beautiful experiment. This beautiful experiment. I will not go into details, but because this is about pattern information, I did want to share it with you. So she's looking at chains of air bubbles in a system. And so we get these beautiful coiling and buckling instabilities that are reminiscent of things that many of you are familiar with, if not from the literature, that at least from your putting honey on your toast in the morning, you get these beautiful coils that form this viscous coiling. That forms this viscous coiling, and the same kind of feature happens in so many different systems. Anke Linder yesterday talked about these filaments collapsing. You see this kind of coiling and buckling all the time. Now, the experiment that Carmen did is as follows. So she's got again water SDS, SDS, and actually a salt present in the system as well to shield some of electrostatics. But now she's taking. Statics, but now she's taking blowing controlled air bubbles into the system. An air bubble comes off, and then another one, and then another one. And she can, by controlling the pressure, she can control the rate at which these air bubbles form. There is an adhesion between these air bubbles because of the SDS. So if you form is slow enough, then an air bubble will come up and flow to the top and the next one and then the next one. But if you increase the speed a little bit, then one comes out and the next one comes out and the next one comes out. Then one comes out, and the next one comes out, and the next one comes out. Okay. If everything is completely balanced, then the buoyancy, the viscous drag is balanced, and you just get a chain that moves up. Okay. The way she images it is with a camera. This is now looking from a top view. So imagine the business end is right here. And we're looking along towards this chain of bubbles right here with a camera. She has a She has a surface here and a surface here to which we mount mirrors, so that with one image of the camera, we can get both perpendicular directions of this chain. Okay, so this is what you see. On the left-hand side, you see the chain. On the right-hand side, you see the chain. And then you can ask the question: well, what happens when you change the speed at which these bubbles come out? Of course, you might imagine what happens because what will happen is. Because what will happen is, if I increase the speed at which they form faster than these bubbles can rise due to the drag force acting on them, something's got to give. So this is what happens when you go faster. And this is what happens when you go even faster. And if I played a video for you, this is the kind of behavior that you see in this thing. So you can imagine that we've been having a lot of fun with this system trying to understand the physics behind it. the physics behind it and um i think that this we should have this paper out within it within within a couple of couple of weeks is my well not out but submitted within a couple of weeks okay so uh i told you about using droplets as model systems basically i've told you about three-dimensional granular puddles uh two-dimensional granular puddles and and the part that we're trying to move towards now is more work on this transition Is more work on this transition between a crystal versus a glass and what happens in these avalanches? And so, I've taken you through this trajectory where we started off with some things that we know very well to finishing off here with these things that we know less well. And we'll be very happy with any suggestions. So, I'll open up to questions now. Thank you. Any questions? Any questions? Can I start with a few questions? So, first, it was really beautiful. I have a question from each part. So, about the 3D part, so you mentioned that for the dry granular material, friction is important. And that kept me wondering if you try instead of droplets like liquid marble drops. Oh, interesting suggestion. That's a very interesting suggestion. We certainly have not tried. We certainly have not tried that. It would be a very fun thing, fun thing to try right now. I mean, to be honest, we have so much to explore just with this system that we have right now, but that would be a very fun extension. And of course, there's so much interest in these liquid marbles. Yeah, yeah, definitely. I'd be curious to find out about that. About the second part, the 2D stuff, would you expect if you add confinements on the two sites, would you expect to see a similar behavior or? To see a similar behavior, or maybe what's your insight about that? I think it would change dramatically. I think in that case, I would expect to see, because you're building up along the sides, I would expect to see a height that is going to depend on the width of the barrier. So much more like the equivalent. Like the equivalent of 3D growth with a sandpile, but in 2D. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I see. And then lastly about the bubbles, how different is this behavior of the chain of bubbles from a single bubble rising? Because we also know for a single bubble, we go from just a completely straight rising trajectory to this completely spiral behavior. Spiral behavior based on the Reynolds number. Yeah, so we are here still operating at very low Reynolds numbers. And so if we have individual air bubbles, because the air bubbles are really quite small, individual air bubbles that rise go vertically in a straight line. We're not in a regime, higher Reynolds number regime, where we start seeing some of this other interesting behavior. Oh, so in fact, it's the collective motion that gives you it is absolutely the collective motion. Is absolutely collective motion. So, so let me just add a little bit more physics to the whole thing. You've got this chain and you're pushing it up from underneath, right? You keep adding more to the whole structure. But of course, there's a drag force acting against this chain moving up, right? That causes a compression, and that compression causes a buckling. But there's no buckling length in this problem, right? It'd be very easy. Right, it'd be very easy to figure out things like what is the wavelength and all of that if there was some kind of buckling modulus to this structure. But these are just beads that are free to move back and forth against each other, right? So there's no friction there. So it's a little bit different. Very nice. Beautiful talking. Thank you. Thank you. Can I ask a question? So I really enjoyed the talk. Very beautiful. Enjoyed the talk. Very beautiful experiments and very nicely presented, just wonderful. I have the following question: I am working on granular materials, on dry granule materials, describing in particular experiments where a bunch of particles are driven, say by a sidewall or by a shear or by shaking. And in those systems, the media has not only the immune velocity. Has not only the immune velocity but also temperature, yes, which describes you know random motion of particles. Yeah, in your systems, the temperature is close to zero. Is there a way to increase the temperature? That's a great question. So this is a comment that we've had from so many referees in the past. It's like, well, your particles are a thermal, so who cares? And so I have been spending a lot of time trying to think of how to do that. And I think that. Think of how to do that. And I think that in the next iteration of these experiments, once we get through a few more, I think we do want to add KT to the system. And I think the easiest way for us to do that is we're going to have basically a rod or some structure mounted to a piezo, which is going to cause vibrations in the liquid, and that should suffice. So we've done some experiments already where you can play like a loudspeaker to create a coupon. Know you can play like a loudspeaker to create acoustic noise, but we can just directly couple it via a piezo and then and then and then we can tune the amplitude and tune the frequency and have all kinds of fun with that. But it's a it's a it's a very very good point and and something I wish we could do more easily was to add KT. But I think the next step is to put in a piezo. So, for example, it would be interesting to see a gas of those particles. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely. So, this is this is what this. So, this is why I'm having so much fun with this: because it allows us to do all kinds of questions with that, you know, we might have for molecules, but now we can actually see what happens in these very ideal systems. Of course, you can do with colloid particles as well, but these are really quite ideal because nature makes them for us. I think Ian has a question online. You still have your hand up? Ian? Yeah. Okay. So, I have a couple questions. Maybe they're related. Maybe they're related. So I'll just ask both of them. In the first part of the talk, you gave this puddle analogy, but puddles around. So, can you comment on the sort of non-disk shape and what these shapes should look like? And then the related question is, you showed this frame advancement in the 2D system. What does it look like when you do that for the 3D system? As in what way do the rearrangement events? In what way do the rearrangement events manifest in that system? Okay. Great questions. Thank you. So the area of these three-dimensional puddles, they scale the way you expect them to scale the same way as it does for a liquid puddle. It is not round or not smooth because of the granular nature. So, you know, if surface tension, effective surface tension, Tension, effective surface tension was playing a larger role. I would expect to have, you know, have things be more rounded, but because of the crystalline nature, it is not. I expect that when we start doing these experiments, not with a crystalline system, but with a bi-dispersed system, so we have now we add randomness to the whole structure, that it will be rounder in that case. But we will see. And I think looking at what the perimeter is like, or the ratio between the area and the perimeter, will. The ratio between the area and the perimeter will be very exciting there. So, that's to your first question. The second question: the subtraction of the frames tells you about the avalanche dynamics. The avalanche dynamics, we did not go into the avalanche dynamics for the three-dimensional system in great detail, other than looking at what's the height of the steps and all of that. Basically, because we don't really know. That basically because we don't really know what to do with it. Not for any good reason beyond that. I just don't know what to do with it. On the other hand, with a 2D system, what is really nice is that we can do full particle tracking because we can see, I don't have a focal microscope. So we can use, we can do, do particle tracking in 2D very trivially. Jonathan has that working right now. And then I think we can start looking at things, especially again when we go from crystal to glass, we can start looking at things like how did the part. Can start looking at things like how do the particle trajectories change in the avalanches when you start changing the structure of the system? So, so we're going there, we're going there next. Can I cut you off there?
