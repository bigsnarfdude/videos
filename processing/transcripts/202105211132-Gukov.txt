Next talk will be by Sergei Gukov. And unlike most previous talks, the title is not on the screen. So I get to tell you it's from not homology to three manifold homology. All right, take it away. Thank you, Ben, and thanks to all organizers for putting together this very nice meeting. I enjoyed all the talks and learned a lot during this week. This week. So we're almost done. And while you're listening to this talk, I want you to keep in mind the following analogy. Imagine that you have puzzle pieces, a pile of puzzle pieces in front of you. And before you start building the puzzle, it's hard to say how pieces are related to each other. And we don't know what the big picture is, what the picture is supposed to be. But if you're halfway in building, You're halfway in building the puzzle, even if you're not finished, you probably already see what the picture is supposed to be. And then at that stage, every new piece is clearly related. It's much easier to say where it should belong into the big picture. So the story I want to tell you has somewhat similar flavor in the sense that I'll tell you about a particular piece of structure which showed up five years ago, and it was, well, Years ago, and it was well puzzling. It was somewhat surprising, it wasn't clear who ordered that and why did it come about. But now, as the story evolved over the past five years, it's much easier to see clues, even in many things available around us during that time, that point to the same direction. So, this is called the power of insight. And as the saying goes, everything becomes easier and clearer in hindsight. So, I'm In hindsight, so I'm going to use that power and counter the quote from Robert Stock. So he mentioned a quote by Yoki Ber that predictions are hard, especially about the future. So I'll be telling you about predictions about the past. And we'll look around in many different areas, in particular, annual Havanov homology, spectral sequences, enumerative invariance, gauge theory equations, and so on and so forth. gauge theory equations and so on and so forth. And many elements which already showed up in different talks will give us clues why that surprising piece of structure is actually something that we should have expected. So in Hinsight, I could have given this talk five years ago using that same clues and those same hints. But again, as they say, everything is easier in Hindsight. One of the motivations for bridging this particular piece of structure with other developers. Particular piece of structure with other developments is not only that making bridges is fun and the title of our conference is perspective, so connecting different perspectives is very exciting, but also I'll try to illustrate that by composing pieces together from different perspectives allows us to ask completely new questions. And in particular, I think one of the main messages or my goals will be to ask new questions and propose several new directions. Several new directions to explore at the interface of these different perspectives. So that's going to be one of the main goals. All right, so what's the piece of structure and what kind of problem is it about? It's about categorification of Lincoln variants in general three manifolds. So Hovanov homology categorifies the Jones polynomial by associating doubly graded homology group to a knot in R3. Group to a knot in R3. So, the question is: how to do it in a general three-manifold? And at first, you might expect that this should not be too far from his original construction, because John's polynomial and invariance of links in general three manifolds belong to the same package of Bitten-Rishiti-Hin-Turai theory. So, therefore, you would expect that it should be not too difficult, not too far. Too difficult, not too far. So, with an origin derived, invariance of links or even without links of three manifolds depend on a choice of topology, underlying topology. So for me, it will be three-manifold M3 and the integer level K. The group, which is also part of the input data throughout the talk, will be fixed to be SU2. So, everything I'm going to tell you is about SU2, but generalization to higher. But generalization to higher ranks and other Cortan types is fairly straightforward. So, what we would like to have is some version of homology, perhaps again doubly graded, such that Witten-Richard-Turi invariants, much like John's polynomial and other polynomial not invariants, can be represented as graded sums of dimensions of these groups with various coefficients. Well, it's easier said than done because Easier said than done because, unlike polynomial not invariants, invariants of more general three-manifolds are not naturally expressed in terms of variable Q as polynomials or even power series with integer coefficients. So in the case of John's polynomial and its various colored analogs and high-rank versions, you get this basically for free. It's automatic that result is resulting not invariant. Resulting not invariant is polynomial in Q with integer coefficients, so we can start working on categorification. But for three manifolds, you typically get something like this, which is written in terms of K, this integer level, which describes the order of the root of unity. It's the order of root of unity Q. And K appears in various places. When it appears inside the sine function, that's not a big deal. Actually, that can Not a big deal actually, that can be written in terms of Q, but when it appears as k to some power as a pre-factor in this particular class of examples or upper limit of a sum, it's not a priori clear how to even write it in terms of q, not to mention integrality that's prerequisite for categorification. So, this initial challenge can be tackled a number of different ways. And one idea which goes back to work of Michael. To work of Michael, unifies Hof algebras and homological algebras in a framework that he dubbed hophological algebra, and this was pursued by many people, including Anda and others. Another way to tackle this challenge by working directly at the roots of unity goes back to ideas of Raphael Rouquier. And even though Andy resisted comment. Andy resisted commenting or pushing his story yesterday, or maybe two days ago, into three dimensions and four dimensions. He actually showed us some elements of high representation theory that perhaps also could be used to tackle this problem. And another way of angle of attack, and this could be to start with WRT invariance defined at roots of unity and instead Unity and instead ask if there is something, perhaps a function or holomorphic power series inside of unit disk in the Q plane, such that WRT invariants at roots of unity appear as limiting values. But instead, we would like to categorify integer, hopefully integer coefficients of that function or power series in the Q plane. So that's the perspective that I'll follow in this talk. Follow in this talk. And since I highlighted the idea of unifying different approaches, different perspectives, already at this level, I think it would be a great idea to explore relations between these three different approaches that I just mentioned. So here comes the main surprise. So in this program of trying to find a function inside the unit disk that has integer coefficients and as limiting And as limiting values reproduces WRT invariance, first and for me, the main surprise for today will be that there is not such a single function for a given three-manifold, but rather a collection of such functions labeled by elements of the first homology group of the three-manifold. And that's the same as the set of spin-C structures. So therefore, if you want to reproduce WRT invariance in this framework, not only you have to take the limit where Q. You have to take the limit where q goes to root of unity, but you also have to sum over this additional labels b either elements of h1 or spin c structures in order to reproduce double Yort impairment. So that's the surprise. And the reason it came as a surprise back five years ago, so originally it showed up in our work with Putrov and Waffa as the Alpha, as these labels were elements of H1. And then, a few years later, as the story evolved, we realized that it's better to think about them as spin C structures. This first came up in the work with GPRIN. As sets, these two are equivalent, but not canonically. And in either case, whether you think about this additional labels as elements of H1 or as spin-C structures, this was somewhat surprising. This was somewhat surprising for a number of reasons. First, WRT invariance for SU2 that we're trying to categorify is not a spin TQFT. They do not require a choice of spin structure. On the other hand, spin C structure is a lift of spin structure, and therefore this is truly new additional data that this Q series Z hat needs. That had needs for its construction. There is no contradiction because to reproduce WRT invariants, we're summing over this additional structure. So it goes away once we sum over it. And indeed, WRT for SU2 do not depend on this additional choice of spin or spin-C structure. But it's interesting to ask, and it was definitely curious and surprising. Curious and surprising, where did it come from? Also, even if you think about this additional labels B as elements of H1, that's equally surprising because WRT to QFT does not have any global symmetries or any structure that would allow turning on such labels or would require such choices in H1. So that would be. In H1. So that would be still equally surprising. Another surprise was that coefficients that I call C here, and their explicit form is not going to be needed for the rest of the talk, happened to be related to S matrix elements in non-semi-simple TQFT. So this was again quite intriguing and curious where this structure comes from. So the goal of the talk and what I meant by this By this puzzling structure in the very beginning is precisely the appearance of these additional labels. And as I go through the talk, if you like spin C structures, think about them. If you don't like Spin C structures, think about elements in H1. Either way, we have a natural question: where does this additional structure is coming from? And once I'll give you sufficient evidence for You insufficient evidence from many different perspectives that this additional structure is a good thing. Natural question perhaps would be to ask: what if we don't sum over it? After all, if now we have something that depends on this additional structure, we should be able to use it or maybe sum in a different way. So this is a question to which I'll return later. And by the way, now this offers a very easy answer to the question whether Answer to the question whether this Q-series invariance Z-Hat labeled by this PINC structure can be determined, for example, by WRT invariants. The answer is obviously no, simply because WRT invariants do not require any such additional choices and have no information, for example, about spin structure. But the resulting Q-series invariance, this Z has will have the desired properties. Have the desired properties, so they will be power series and Q with integer coefficients. So, indeed, the way they come about, at least in physics, is as graded earlier characteristics of homology groups assigned to three manifolds, and you can incorporate links. But the new and for my talk, the only interesting element that I'm going to focus on is that they depend on these additional choices. So, it says this dependence on B on these labels that On B on these labels that I'm going to talk about. If you didn't, just to maybe put it in perspective or give you simple examples, so if we have homology sphere, for example, small surgery on a node, then you don't need to worry about these additional labels. One would expect just a single Q series in such examples. But if you have something like a length space, or more generally, say, Like a lens space, or more generally, say p-surgery on a knot, first homology is ZP, so therefore there would be P different Q-series in this case. And if we go to manifolds like S1 cross S2 or S1 cross Riemann surface, and basically anything with non-zero Betty number, then there will be infinitely many such Q-series. So at first, this may seem a little mind-boggling, and I guess that contributes to the surprise that many people Surprise that many people expressed back five years ago when this first appeared, and I'll be completely honest, I was also surprised. So it took a little bit for me to get convinced that this is indeed the right piece of structure. And soon after that, worked with Putrov and Waffa. We did careful resurgence analysis with Marcus Marinha and Pavel. And this, I guess, convinced. This, I guess, convinced me that even from a different perspective, we see the same structure. So, since then, evidence was piling up, and my goal is to explain that indeed this is something rather natural. So, I won't talk much about construction of this Q-series invariance, but I want to mention briefly one way to do it. So, there are several different ways in which one can. Different ways in which one can approach really building this Q-series invariant. One that we proposed with Chipri and Manalescu is based on surgery technique that relies on theorem of Likerish and Wallace, which says that every closed-oriented three-manifold can be obtained as a surgery on a knot or a link in a three-sphere. And in this approach, therefore, the basic ingredient or fuel for the construction for the Or fuel for the construction for this machinery is really invariant for NOT or link complement. Well, if we have a single component, namely the NOT, then its complement has H1, which is Z, the set of integers. So in that case, spin C structures are labeled by integers. And we can package all this many Q series Z sub B into sub b into a formal collection introducing formal variable x and summing over b in the set of integers. At this point, x is a completely formal variable. It just keeps track of this b dependence and part of the goal will be to ask what is its purpose in life or incarnation, perhaps various other perspectives or approaches. Approaches. In turn, the collection of this Q series for link and node complements can be computed in a number of ways. One of the most efficient ones, in the paper with Chiprian, we proposed a couple, but they're fairly challenging. So we managed to do this for complements of torus knots and figure eight knots. But soon after, a very efficient approach. A very efficient approach was proposed by PORG that uses quantum groups at generic values of Q. That perhaps is not too surprising since the result is supposed to produce invariant where Q is inside the unit disk. And these are not quite the same R matrices that we see in Rashidi-Hinturayev construction, where the modules are finite dimensional. Here we, or PARC, works with infinite-dimensional Vermont models. Works with infinite-dimensional Vermont modules. And yet, it's a fairly efficient combinatorial or diagrammatic type construction that allows to produce this result for many different note and link complements. So using that and feeding it into this surgery formula, you can produce many answers. For example, here is a plus five surgery on a 10-crossing knot. Because it's a plus five surgery, homology is Homology is Z5, so we would expect 5Q series, and indeed that's what they are. So, as you can see, up to overall power of Q, all powers and coefficients are integers. That's just as expected. And this fractional overall powers of Q, such as 14 over 5, 11 over 5, is something that we'll get back to later in the talk. So, using this power of insight, my goal will be to focus on this labels B and ask what's their meaning in different perspectives connected to different approaches and try to pose interesting questions that we can explore further together. Another way of proceeding with the talk would be to describe Would be to describe for you the surgery formula, maybe walk you through some couple of examples, such as the one shown on the screen to show where it comes from, how to do computations. But this is not what I'm going to do today. I'll just focus on this dependence on B, element of the first homology of the three-manifold, or better yet, spin-C structure. And even when I And even when I was watching previous talk by Paul, I was thinking that if his story also connects to many of these other developments, I would expect that in there four manifold invariants, spin or spin C structure should also appear. And later in the talk, I'll try to explain why I think that way. Any questions so far? So far. So, this was a formulation of the problem that we are trying to solve, namely categorification of invariance of general three manifolds. And today we'll be focused on dependence on this labels B, which initially was somewhat a surprise. We'll need a couple of in the other slide. I mean, the different B's, like plus or minus, didn't it matter? Plus or minus, didn't it matter? Is there typically some kind of symmetry or something with the different values, or is it sort of an artifact of this example? No, it's a general fact. And in early days, we would write this set as H1 modulus E2, the while group. So this symmetry is the while group of SL2. Like I said, today everything I'm going to do is about Is about SU2 or SL2, and that's the symmetry you're observing. So it's completely universal. Thanks for pointing this out. Awesome. Thank you. And another question. So you know that WRT invariants also split as a sum over spin C structures? You're referring to spin SU2 refinement of WRT, right? So we have a paper also with spin C. Have a paper also with spin C structure, so which is affine over H1 with C coefficients? Yes, I certainly know that, and that's actually related to my comment here where I said that once we have this Q series labeled by spin C structures, it's natural to ask what can you get if you don't sum over spin C structures or if you sum in a different way. So in fact, you're absolutely right. So the comment you're making feeds very well here. You're making fits very well here. If you don't sum over it and take the limit, that's exactly what you're obtaining. So that's that's uh, I'll comment on it a little bit later in a different context, but yeah, that's a very good remark. So it feeds with a couple of things. And right, so we need a couple of preliminaries, or I'll use a few facts about spin or spin-C structure. Spin or spin C structures. So, first of all, there is a fiber exact sequence for classifying spaces, and here I write a piece of it, which is a map from B spin B U1 to B spin C. And this gives rise to a canonical map from a spin product of spin structures on a three-manifold NH1 into spin C structures. Like I mentioned earlier, as I said, spin C structures on a three manifold are the same. On a three-manifold are the same as elements of H1, but this identification is not canonical. However, what this map says is that if you pick a spin structure on a three-manifold and fix it, then this identification can be made canonical. But of course, it depends on your choice of spin structure. Another way of saying this is that set of spin C structure is a torsor over H1, and that's how it's often presented. Often presented. So, spin-C structures appear in many different places, most notably in cyber-Quitton invariance of four manifolds, and many useful facts about them you can find in various textbooks. So here I suggest one, which I particularly like. And it reminds us that spin-C structures is also a window into the world of four manifolds, which is, of course, the goal of categorification of this invariance for. This invariance for three manifolds. All right, so next I'll try to look around for various puzzle pieces and see where spin or spin C structures appear in a way compatible with their appearance and this Q series invariance. And first I'll go through a couple of math places and then I'll switch to physics. Then I'll switch to physics. So, in mathematics, one of the hints or clues for spin-C structures, and perhaps the most obvious one, comes from analogy with NOTS or NOT homologies, which we understand fairly well by now. And we understand that these knot homologies do not live in a vacuum or sit in an isolated way, they talk to each other. They talk to each other, and that's the beauty of it. So, again, there are many different bridges between different homological invariants of nodes, and many such relations that come in the form of spectral sequence can be seen as shadow or directly by working with Homfly homology that is triply graded and has spectral sequences to Homona-Frasansky homology, not Florid homology. Homology, not floor homology, ye's version, and so on. So it comes with many differentials that commute, and even once we take a homology with respect to one differential, we can sometimes see the shadow of others. So out of many of these node homologies, which are reasonably well developed and understood, at least one has a good analog in the world of three many. In the world of three manifolds, and that's an analog of Node-Fleur homology, which is the Higgard-Fleur homology. It associates vector space or homology group to a three-manifold, and it already tells us that spin-C structure should show up if we expect homological invariants of three manifolds exhibit same similar patterns or same kind of relations. Or same kind of relations as we see in the world of knots. So, Higger's fluoro homology, originally developed by Oswald and Zabo, is a version, kind of symplectic version of cyberquitan instanton or sorry, monopole fluor homology, which was developed by Peter Kronheimer and Tom Rofka. And another perspective on this same homology theory is Theory is based on homological or kind of Hilbert space version of relation between cyber-Quittin invariance and Gromov invariance by Cliff Taubes. So in this homology for three-manifold version developed by Mike Hutchins, one also associates a homological invariant to three manifolds labeled by spin C structures. To be more precise, each of these homology theories This homology theory is Hegrid fluor, monopole fluor homology, and embedded contact homology come on four flavors, but each of the four flavors are correspondingly related and different version. And the one which is closest to what we're going to see in SL2 Khovanov-like homology of three-manifold is the version HF. In any case, it's labeled by spin-C structures, and that's the first clue that if we expect Clue that if we expect these theories to be related, then we should expect spin C structures. Before I get there, I want to point out that even in the context of Higgard-Fluhr homology, there is one interesting ingredient, namely correction terms, which have homological origin. They're also labeled by choice of spin C structures. And these are numerical invariants, rational invariants of three manifolds that are quite. Three manifolds that are quite powerful, in part due to their homological origin. And they tell us that this categorification for three manifolds really has something to do with the world of four manifolds, for instance. Using this correction terms, Osloz and Zabo gave new proofs of Donaldson diagonalization theorem and also the Tom conjecture about genus of. Genus of embedded surface in CP2. So here is an example in the bottom of the slide. In fact, I'll use this example later. I give you for concreteness correction terms for length space. In the case of length space, we have P different spin C structures. Again, they're labeled by B, and you can see that these correction terms, the threshold numbers, are non-trivial already in this. Non-trivial already in this simple, simple example. I'll come back to correction terms later, but the point I was trying to make so far is that if we expect SL2, GL11, or SLN, homological invariance of three manifolds, to be similar to what we see in the world of knots, then and exhibit some of the spectral sequences or relations, then already. Or relations, then already from this clue, we should probably expect that just like Higgard-Fleur homology depends on the choice of spin-C structure, analogous Hovanov SL2 homology for three manifolds should also depend on a choice of spin-C structure. This, of course, is a very flimsy and vague clue, which we did mention in that original paper, but I wouldn't take it too seriously if this was the only piece of the puzzle or you know. Puzzle, or the only hint or clue that we had at the time. But it's kind of amusing to mention that if you take the answer for the Z hat or in the categorified case, we have answer for only very few manifolds. And once we computed it for either three-sphere or lens spaces, even in that original paper with Putrov and Waffer, we tried to ask how does it feed with the structure of differentials? Of differentials. So, without changing any gradings and just blindly borrowing differentials from not homologies, it surprisingly seemed to be consistent and work. And by applying these differentials, one could reproduce GL11, namely Higgard-Flohr homology. So, this to me was very surprising and is indeed indication that perhaps we should think Perhaps we should think about putting these different homologies of three manifolds in a similar package as we did for NOTs. Some evidence for this that they can unify comes from a recent paper we had with Tobias Eckholm, Angus Gruing, Pyotr Kukarski, Senyuk Park, and Pyotr Sukowski, where we studied knot complements. And again, from a slightly different angle, it seems that. Different angle, it seems that there are some relations between different ranks, very similar to what happened in the world of knots. Of course, this homologies for three manifolds are much, much bigger than homological invariants of knots. And later in the talk, I'll tell you precisely how big they are. Of course, they're infinite-dimensional, but what I mean is that the growth and size as Q degree increases, for example. As Q degree increases, for example, that they grow much, much faster than what we are used to in the case of knots. But again, everything can be made fairly concrete. So I'll show you what I mean later in the talk. Once we're talking about spectral sequences, let me come to another clue. In the SL2 world, so previously I mentioned the GL11 version of homology for three manifolds, which is Of homology for three manifolds, which is known and does depend on spin C structure. But in the SL2 world, until so far, we didn't really have such homological invariants in general three manifolds, but at least in the case of three manifolds, which are thickened annuli, there is such a version proposed by Marta, Joseph, and Adam. And originally, APS proposed this categorification. This categorification version of Hovenov homology for links and side three manifolds from SCAN module perspective. But then it can be understood from a number of other different perspectives. And let's look a little closer at the properties of this annual Hauven of homology as an example of categorification of knots and links inside this rather simple three-manifold. This rather simple three-manifold. So, this homology is actually triply graded. So, this was already mentioned in a number of previous talks. And what I'm going to tell you is most closely related to talk of Mike yesterday and the discussion that came up in questions after, especially initiated by Eugene's question. So, this homology is triply graded, so, aside from usual homological and Q grading, it has Q grading. It has annular third grading. And this annular third grading is already Z valued. And it matches perfectly the fact that H1 of a solid torus or thickened annulus is Z, the set of integers. And I want to argue that that's exactly B from the previous slide. So, first of all, there is a spectral. There is a spectral sequence very much analogous to what we see in the relation between Hovanov homology and Higger-Freuhrer homology of the branch double cover in this annular setting. So the spectral sequence was studied by Roberts and also Elie and Stefan. And it starts with the second page, which is annular Hoven of Homology of the Node, the reduced version, and converts. The reduced version and converges to analogous Hyger-Fluor homology of the double branch cover of the mirror knot. And here I mention the work of Ellie and Stefan in the context of the spectral sequence, but they actually have also a very nice paper which has graded on the title. And I would highly recommend this as a very good reading on interpretation of the Interpretation of these different gradings, both on the annulo-Hovanov side and Sucher-Higgard-Fluores side. In particular, if we trace what happens to this annular grading through the spectral sequence, we see that on Higgard-Fluoris side, it becomes the spin C structure. And indeed, it suggests that at least one way to look at tennular grading is to think about it as a choice of spin C structure or. Of spin C structure or more naively element in H1 of the solid torus. That's precisely the winding number. So that's not a big surprise. And again, it supports the perspective or this hindsight clue that in general, categorification of nodes and links in general three manifolds should be labeled by biospin C structures, even in the SL2 world. So, then in this framework, there are other clues. And in fact, as was beautifully described in Mike's talk, Elitoni and Stefan identified this annular grading, which I'm now going to call B, because it's exactly the same as what should happen for more general free manifolds with a weight SL2 weight. So they showed that there is SL2. Showed that there is SL2 action on annular homology. And therefore, this suggests that the corresponding pantragging dual variable x, which was introduced earlier, remember when I said let's package, for example, for NOT complements all the spin C structures by summing over them with variable x to the power b. This suggests that x should live in the carton torus, in the maximal torus. Taurus in the maximal torus of SL2C. And this is indeed the origin of this variable X in the story of this Z hat invariance, which originally came from Chern-Simon's theory with SL2C gauge group, or at least they have something to do with it. And finally, I want to mention: so now, once you start to see how these puzzles and pieces of the puzzle fit together, that everything is consistent and different. Everything is consistent and different perspectives are naturally talking to each other, we can try to put them together and start playing with this building block. So, one of this way to play is to say, okay, we have some knots and links in solid torus. So, we also have this surgery gluing formula, for example, from the paper which she printed. Why don't we apply the surgery formula? Apply the surgery formula to glue two solitary together. In that way, we'll obtain some knots and links in S1 cross S2 or in lens spaces. And if you start doing this, you'll see that, first of all, you indeed reproduce results that we obtained in this work with Pei, Putrov, and Wafa. We gave construction of such invariants, these z hats and their category. Z hats and their categorification for various knots and links and S1 cross S2 and length spaces. And in particular, we check that in the case of S1 cross S2, we reproduce Lova's results from his previous work. So not only these pieces of puzzle now fit together pretty well, it opens a new avenue or direction perhaps for categorifying. For categorifying and exploring homological versions of this that hat for S1 cross S2 and lens bases and many nodes links inside there. All right, so let's look for other clues. So I mentioned couple that come from math. So let me mention a couple that come from physics and interpret that in math language. And the physical setup for Physical setup for NOT invariance, again, starting or building on what we already know about NOTs, is that in 11-dimensional space-time, you take two sets of five brains. One set is basically representing or responsible for the gauge group. The other is creating a knot or a link. And you can look at this setup from many different perspectives. If you focus on S1 cross R2, S1 cross R2, you get local 3D, 3D correspondence. If you focus on it from the point of view of Calabia, you basically work with the numerative invariants. And if you look at this setup from the viewpoint of R2 cross S3 and think about R2 as a circle fibered over half line, then you get precisely the gauge theory setup that Edward explained to us. Top that Edward explained to us. So now, if you want to generalize this to study of three manifold invariants and their categorification, there is an obvious modification you would make in this fibrain system. So first of all, you would throw away the extra ingredients that are responsible for NOTS, if we're not interested in NOTS for a second. And you would replace a three-sphere by a more general three-manifold. General free manifold. So that's precisely what we're going to do. And let's look at this modification from all these three different perspectives and see whether we have some clues or hints for spin or spin C structures. So from the enumerative perspective, this is a special case of a rather general problem where we're counting either stable maps or perhaps embeddings of Riemann surfaces with boundaries. Of Riemann surfaces with boundary into collab Yao with the Lagrangian submanifold, such that boundary lands on a Lagrangian submanifold. In this enumerative context, we have to fix basic topological data of such embedding or map, and that means that we have to fix relative homology class of sigma in x, L, and that's valued in second homology group. But we also have to fix where the boundary goes. To fix where the boundary goes under this map, and it's obviously an element of H1 of a Lagrangian submanifold. So, from this enumerative perspective, the fact that there is additional data that leaves in, that these B's leave inside H1 of a Lagrangian is very standard. It's something that has been used in such open version of enumerative invariants for a long, long time. Enumerative invariants for a long, long time, and it's not very surprising. What is actually slightly surprising is where the spin structure comes from. But see, earlier in the talk, I told you that you can think of spin C structure roughly coming or being built out of two pieces. One is a spin structure and the other is choice of element of H one. So here choice of H one is clear, but dependence on spin structure is actually more interesting. And I wouldn't say that it's entirely clear. Wouldn't say that it's entirely clear. So let's look from the gauge theory perspective. If you use this reduction from the five-brain system to four-dimensional gauge theory, now with the three-sphere replaced by more general three-manifold, then you get gauge theory, namely Capustan-Witten PDEs on three-manifold cross R plus, where on one boundary you have the so-called numpole boundary condition. Boundary condition. And on the other boundary, in order to incorporate the setup that I'm presenting for you, you have to choose another boundary condition which depends on this choice of elements of H1 or more precisely, spin C structure. So let's look at this a little more carefully. First of all, the numpole boundary condition, which is much more and better studied, is already well described and originally. Is already well described in original Edwards' paper and in further work with Raif Matzo. And they pointed out that for some gauge groups, you already need the choice of spin structure to define this boundary condition. Well, this doesn't happen for SU2. After all, as we mentioned earlier, SU2 WRT TQFT is not a spin TQFT. So in this case, for original Original gauge group being SU2, you don't really need this choice of spin structure. But this is only half of the story because we still have a second boundary condition. And the second boundary condition in the context that I'm describing to is a choice. And I claim that the choice that you need to make to reproduce this Z-hat invariance does require a choice of spin C structure. And it's a kind of boundary condition that. Kind of boundary condition that we actually studied with Edward in the context of ramification in the geometric Langelands program. And it becomes literally that boundary condition if your three-manifold is a product of circle and some Riemann surface sigma. So it's labeled by choice of Lebesgue subgroup. In this case, it's U1. Again, I'm considering only as U2 story today. And variable X. And variable x would be interpreted as related to parameter eta in our notations. So where do spin or spin C structures come from in this context? They come from both boundary conditions because see in gauge theory on three manifold M3, you don't really need that extra data because every three manifold Because every three-manifold is spin. However, just like you can consider two four-manifolds with M3 boundary such that each of them is spin, when you glue them together, the resulting four-manifold may not be spin. That's how you may get W2 non-zero as a result of gluing. So here we don't have, and in that context, actually, the anomaly or the appearance or need for speech. Anomaly or the appearance or need for spin C structures, which is mostly well known in the abelian case, would be a version of Friedwitten anomaly. So that's an anomaly in gauge theory or brains on a four manifold that doesn't appear on three manifold, but it appears on four manifolds. And again, you can think about this as gluing two pieces such that each one admits a spin structure, but once you glue them together, they're not compatible. Compatible and that requires a choice of spin C structure. It's exactly the same that happens here, except that we're not talking about the closed four manifold, but we're talking about a slab which has two different boundary conditions. And it's this whole collection together that requires a choice of spin C structures. And we studied such systems in work with Apijit Gad and Pavel Putrov back in 2013 in some countries. 2013, in some contexts which are closely related. But as far as I know, this systems on slabs and appearance of spin C structures has not been studied systematically beyond that. Okay, so let me now switch to yet another perspective, 3D-3D correspondence, where you focus on another part of this five-brain setup, which involves R2 cross a circle. And in this case, you're studying some three-dimensional. And in this case, you're studying some three-dimensional theory with a two-dimensional boundary condition. And again, the choice of spin-C structure is in the boundary condition. In this case, its interpretation is in terms of momentum or charge sectors of the 2G boundary theory. So this perspective also produces connection to various other invariants. Various other invariants which are labeled by SPIN C structures. For instance, it is very useful in asking a question: what happens to this Q series invariance when you take a limit Q goes to root of unity. So if you do that, I already mentioned earlier that you can reproduce WRT invariance if you sum over this additional labels with certain coefficients. But the question I asked. But the question I asked earlier, and that Anna reiterated quite correctly, is that we can, first of all, not sum over this additional Spin C structures or try to sum with other coefficients and ask what else can we reproduce at roots of unity. And one thing that you can reproduce is invariants associated with non-semi-simple TQFTs, such as CGP and EDO invariants. And And this is actually quite natural because if you start with a quantum group at generic value of Q and Burma modules and take the limit where Q goes to root of unity without doing any additional work such as semi-simplification, most naturally we'll get something non-semi-simple first. And indeed, these relations actually are much easier than relations to WRT invariants. And also it partly explains the appearance of non-semisimple Non-semisimple S matrix in the coefficients which I mentioned earlier. A special choice of a root of unity is Q goes to 1. And in this case, things don't become totally trivial. In fact, this relation to CGP and ADO has the form of a ratio where denominator is always derived torsion. So if Q goes to 1, CGP or ADO numerator Or ADO numerator becomes trivial, but denominator still stays. And what you get in the limit q goes to one is you get basically inverse to raise torsion. So to ray of torsion is also labeled by spin C structure. So again, here we go. This is a natural place to make contact with the appearance of spin C structures in this yet another context or yet another limit. I'm sorry, Sergei. So A D. I'm sorry, Sergei. So, ADO of what is here? Oh, here it's ADO of. So, if you start with a closed tree manifold, you get CGP. If you start with a NOT complement, you get ADO of that NOT or link. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah, very good question. In fact, I was going to show something perhaps even hopefully more clear on the next slide. Hopefully, more clear on the next slide in that relation. But before I leave inverse-derived torsion, I want to point out that you can think, therefore, about this Q-series invariance as a Q-deformation of inverse-derived torsion. So inverse-derived torsion already depends on choice of spin-C structures. And anything that we said about Higgard floor, and which categorifies derived torsion, and other things, we should now. And other things, we should now bear in mind, except we should put it in a denominator and incorporate Q variables. So that's what these Q series invariance are. But among other things, they do depend on these spin C structures. So, right, closer to Anna's question, if you do it for not complements, that's precisely this formal combination sum over integers b with x to the b. With x to the b that I mentioned earlier. So, this is this two-variable invariant that we introduced with Cyprian. And in fact, already before this, some of these works that I mentioned here, with Cyprian, from a different perspective, we expected that as Q goes to one, you should reproduce inverse Alexander polynomial. So that's closely related to Melvin-Morton-Razomsky behavior of color-Jones. Behavior of color Jones and other things. And this again illustrates that this two-variable series also can be thought of as a Q-deformation of inverse Alexander polynomial. So here is a concrete example. I promise that in this talk, I won't be explaining how to compute things, or I won't be very generous with concrete examples, but maybe let me give you one more. If you take a trefoil knot, then Trefoil knot, then it's really easy to construct the series. And there is an amusing fact that two gentlemen and two functions that we know and love from completely different branches share something in common. So if you take trefoil naught and expand its inverse Alexander polynomial, it turns out that it has same coefficients, literally same coefficients, as a Q expansion of a Dedekin eta function. Of a Dedekin eta function. So I don't know if Dedekin knew anything about trefoil nod or if Alexander knew that inverse Alexander polynomial for the trefoil has anything to do with the Dedekin-eto function. But we can certainly impress our friends from other branches by telling them that these two things are related. And this function f of xq in the case of trefoil is basically combination. Combine a combination of Dedekin eta and inverse Alexander, where we use the same coefficients, and then we put Q and X together. So we just combine the dependence. So anyway, that's a simple example. Another thing that this 3D, 3D correspondence or physics perspective gives you is that it tells you how size of this three-manifold homology, the SL2 Hovanov-like homology. SL2 Hovanov-like homology for three manifolds should grow as you increase the Q degree. So we know that even in the world of knots, if we study, say, colored Holmfley homology or in some versions of colored SLN homologies, especially unreduced ones, we get infinite-dimensional homological invariance of knots. But they always grow no faster than some power of n, where n. Than some power of n, where n is bounding the q degree. So, in the case of three manifolds, the prediction from this physics perspective of 3D-3D correspondence is that it should grow exponentially, but as a square root of m. And the coefficient is something very specific. So, this c is something that may depend on a three-manifold. And another interesting project would be to explore what this coefficient is for different. Coefficient is for different three manifolds. So, to conclude, I would like to now hopefully I gave you some clues or hints why we should expect spin and spin C structures to show up if we proceed to categorify three manifold invariants and build Hovenof-like homologies for three manifolds and links in three manifolds. So, next question is. Next question is: What about relation to other known invariants that are also labeled by spin or spin C structures? I already emphasized connection to Hugo-Flohr and derived torsion, or in the case of Nodz-Alexander polynomial, quite a bit, but there are other things, such as, for example, correction terms that I mentioned. So, indeed, you can find connections to such other invariants by considering. By considering various limiting values of the Q series, so Q series is labeled by choice of spin C structure, so let's keep that and not sum over it, or maybe some special coefficient so that we don't kill all the dependence on B. But we can take various limits and the behavior of this Q series near Q equals zero, that's precisely this fractional power of Q that. Power of Q that appears as coefficient Q to the delta has many parallels with correction terms. And in fact, modulo one and maybe even modulo two, it's related to correction terms of the Higgers-Fleuhor theory. Near Q equals I, you can relate this Z-hat Q-series to Rochlin invariants, which are labeled by spin structure. A labeled by spin structure. So here I'm using this map that I showed you in preliminaries in the very beginning, where we map from spin and H1 into spin C structures. So this provides a canonical map by summing over B to spin structures, and we can indeed reproduce Rawlin invariant label by spin structures from this limiting value of the Q. This limiting value of the Q series. I have to say that in practice it's not always easy. I showed you earlier that one can compute this Q series for many three manifolds obtained as various surgeries, for example. So it's not a problem to write it as a Q series to any desired power of Q. For instance, here is an example of some surgery on figure eight naught with Q to the 500, but unless you know how But unless you know how to write it in a closed form, extracting this limiting value, for example, q equals i, which relates to Rochlin invariant, is not entirely easy. So another direction for research or exploration would be to understand the structure of this as functions of Q. So if we understood better some sort of modularity properties or something like that, we could have better grasp at such limiting behaviors. I have to Behaviors. I have to say that there are several useful clues, and I want to pause to mention that here, what happens is that this object that now depends on Q basically allows us to interopolate between different invariants, such as, for example, correction terms and Rochlin invariants. And it would be useful as another direction for the future to think about such relations. They could be useful clues to Useful clues to build more connections between different perspectives, different objects, different pieces of the puzzle that we're exploring together in this field. So for instance, one relation between correction terms and lift, integral lift of the Rochlin invariant was explored by these authors, at least in some concrete setting of plant manifolds. Of plant manifolds and small generalizations. And also, averaged versions of relations that I showed to you appeared in various works. For instance, the correction terms of length spaces that we saw earlier, if you average them over spin C structures, get connected to Cassan invariant. So this comes from work of Jake, and I actually don't know if there are versions of this relation for other three manifolds. This relation for other three manifolds. If Jake is on this call, then we can ask him. An analogous relation for Rochlin invariant at another limiting value appeared in the work of Kirby and Melvin. In fact, Rob and Paul encouraged me to look at this relation without summing over spin structures, and that was part of the And that was part of the motivation of the result that I showed you earlier. So, previously, there were some known summed averages where we're summing over this extra data of spin or spin C structures. And it would be great to have more relations like this, either summed over or not summed over. And they could provide further clues or better understanding of some of this invariance in part again because this D invariance. Because this d invariants are rather powerful and subtle and interesting, whereas something like Cassandra invariant usually belongs to the world of quantum invariants. So therefore, I want to conclude with posing another question, and you can ask this question, even at the level of NOTS. I'm more interested in three manifolds, but even at the level of NOTS, I want to ask: what about homological type invariants which really have homological origin, maybe? Origin, maybe Rasmussen's S invariant or many concordance invariants that come from Higgard Fleury theory. These are analogs of the D invariant that I showed you before in the world of three manifolds, could be reproduce some of these interesting homological invariants or maybe some diversions, average diversions of them from equally rich world of quantum invariants. So we have John's polynomial, we have colored John's polynomial, colored We have colored John's palanel, colored Homphley. So, both sides are very rich, and yet there are very few bridges between them. So, what I showed you on a previous slide is basically a small example of it. So, here is an experiment I did preparing for this talk, and it took me literally five minutes in Mathematica. So, we can take to explore this kind of question, and this is an honest question. I don't know the answer to this, I don't know if this has been. Answer to this. I don't know if this has been systematically studied, so I'm hoping that someone after I finish in a minute will tell me some further ideas along these lines. But here is a small experiment. We can take a pair of concordant knots and up to 10 crossings. This concordance classes are really well suited for such experiments because there are exactly roughly as many pairs which are concordant as non-concordant. As non-concordant. So for studying, this is a good experimental arena. And let's take one example. So here is a concordant friend of the trefoil knot, knot 810. And I take John's polynomials of these two knots, take the difference, and ask Mathematica to plot what this function looks like, namely where they coincide. Because if we're looking for a relation between quantum invariance and, say, some concordance. Quantum invariance and say some concordance invariance, then we would expect that values should be equal, right? Or rather, I plot the inverse of it. So this is the heat map, and it clearly shows that, well, at q equals one, they coincide, at q equals i, very similar to Rochlin and Varien that we saw a moment ago, and also at sixth and third root of unity. You take next example and you quickly rule out the sixth root of unity. So this is a very quick way to discover Arfin variant. To discover Arfen variant, in fact. So, again, it took me literally five minutes, and it's another direction which is easy to explore, experiment, and I think it would be extremely useful for us to do this sort of exercise. So, thank you for your time and patience. All right, thank you. I'll give you my emoji clap. All right. All right. So, questions. Jake, yeah. I guess this is an answer rather than a question. But so about your question, Sergei, that's really a property of L-spaces. Yeah, so anything that's an L-space will satisfy that. But in general, there'll be a term that counts the Euler characteristic of. Characteristic of HF red, the sort of reduced floor homology of your Y. And there's a student of Zoltan who proved that quite some time ago now, but I'm forgetting his name. Yeah. Yeah, thank you, Jake. I suspect that that's the case for L spaces, but yeah, it would be definitely good to explore this in a larger setup. I have a quick question. I've seen a formula for Z hat for negatively definite planned manifolds. And Sergei, you mentioned the surgery formula from the non-polynomial with Cuprian. Is this formula is this a way to define the invariant for more general thing manifolds or? For more general three manifolds, or are they already defined and this is just a relation between them? Well, the surgery formula for plumbings is a special case of this more general surgery formula. So basically, what you've seen is case where Kirby diagram or Kirby diagram or link is a chain of unknots linked and according to the plumbing graph. And that's exactly the same surgery formula just applied to this special FK. So question is how to construct this more general FK for other knots and links, other than, for example, this linked unknots. So yeah, with Tuprian, we suggested several. Chiprian, we suggested several ways to do it using recursion, resurgence, but they're kind of laborious. And yeah, I think that this approach based on quantum groups and Vermont modules is not only efficient, but probably conceptually is also quite useful. So that's the one which I used here on the slide to produce example for surgery on a ten crossing. For surgery on a ten crossing note. So maybe to follow up on that, does this approach work for sort of other knots that aren't just torus knots, or is it still sort of conjectural that it works in general? This R metrics approach? Right, so this R metrics approach, yeah, Tor is not. Approach, yeah, torus knots. We could do even the cheaper end using this other technique. So, yeah, actually, I didn't know if this 1045 is torus knot. Most of the knots that computed this FK are hyperbolic. So, I think by now, pretty much it covered all nodes with up to seven or eight crossings. And in the original paper, In the original paper, it was for positive knots, I believe, and the various other classes. So it includes double twist knots and so on and so forth. And there is another paper which I think is about to come out soon where it includes even larger classes. So yeah, the territory is quickly growing. And as you can see, I don't remember. Don't remember all of the cases that are covered by it, but it definitely includes all torus knots, twist knots, positive homogeneous braid knots, fibered knot, and so on. If this example happens to be hyperbolic, then this is zero surgeries on not non-hyperbolic, then this is these are a couple of examples of hyperbolic nodes. All right. Are there any other questions? Did you compute any examples for links with several components? So in the original paper, he did the case of whitehead link and boromine rings. This is, of course, very natural because by partial surgeries, you get to the Surgeries, you get to double twist knots and other things. I don't know if in this upcoming paper that should appear any day, there are more examples, but yeah, I think it would be good to explore it. Yeah. But in particular, the invariant of Pancura sphere that you get like from tree foil or from Whitehead or from Baromina is all the same. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all the same. So it's easy to check Kirby moves. And it's also easy to basically. Basically, produce. So, there are many examples of the form where you take, say, plumbing graph and replace one of the nodes by not. So, that's another link with a priori many components where you can, in various places, start inserting FKs for notes rather than unknots. So that's and for links, this FK would be multivariable series. Yeah, it depends on as many axes as you have for links. X's as you have linked components, correspondingly the point-tracking dual variable would be this B1, B2, and so on, up to as many components you have because spin C structures are labeled by Z to the number.
