And all the organisers for inviting me. I kind of get ignored sometimes because I live so far away. And so, thank you, Noah. People forget that Australia exists sometimes. And New Zealand to be fair. You came further. Oh, so according to Hamish, I was the one who travelled before this because by five hundred or something. Anyway, so this is. Something. Anyway, so this is stuff that I've been working on recently, and it's not my usual work, as you see, microbial evolution. You heard a bit about that from the news talk yesterday. But I thought it's okay to stray a little bit from my usual topic because geographically I'm straight. So, as you know, asexual reproduction or pythonogenesis has a two-fold advantage compared to sexual reproduction because Reproduction because a female can produce two offspring, female offspring, for the same sort of investment in reproduction, assuming anisotropy. And so with this advantage, asexual reproduction evolves every now and then and has an initial advantage, but in the long run, it's not a good strategy and asexual species go extinct all the time. And here's an example from Tamima wolfing sticks. Walphon sticks. So the phylogeny is twiggy, and that's because asexual lineages evolve and then they're good for a while but then eventually go extinct and the mechanism might be bullish rapid or that is something else. But what if reproduction gets the best of both worlds? What if you can do both sexual reproduction and get maybe good or bad genes from males into the offspring? Or by not mating, you can produce You can produce copies of yourself. So, this seems like a really good strategy for reproduction. And an example of this is the Australian walking stick, also known as a spiny leaf insect, or giant prickly stick insect, or insect. Another one is Exstaticomateratum. This particular one I call Heidi, and she's the daughter of a stick insect given to me by Russell Von Duriansky. His name's come up a couple of times. Names come up a couple times. And he and I were just chatting, and he said, Oh, you know, these are really fun type. Let's have a couple. So I took them, they're females, and they laid lots of eggs and behind it. And this is the second generation, and now we're onto the third generation. So I know that they can reproduce asexually because there's no male inside, but they can also produce sexually. So they get the best of both worlds. So, oh, and by the way, I took this photo myself, and it's, it's, my camera's not quite as good as Carl's, you can say. My camera's not quite as good as Carl's, so it's not quite as impressive. But I don't have to sort of point far away in his cage in the living room. Anyway, so there's this question about why this strategy hasn't just taken over the whole world. Why isn't it absolutely everywhere? And simple arguments about the advantages of sex and recombination wouldn't work because these things can get the best of both worlds. By the way, I'm going to call this. By the way, I'm going to call this FP sometimes because that's only two syllables, and this thing is just so existing. Oh, and I want to point out that in some species, pathogenesis can be cyclical and can depend on environmental conditions. And some famous people have done some models on that. But I'm not going to talk about that today. Instead, I'm going to talk about the case where if males are absent, then asexual refroduction. Okay, so what are the Okay, so what are the explanations for this that are out there so far? These are the ones that I could find. So, one explanation is that adaptation is more efficient under obligatory sexual reproduction. And some people studied the dynamics of this. And there's another body of work to do with sexual conflict theory. And under this idea, males are under selection to coerce mating, and there can be co-evolution, and there's a body of work around this. I'm not going to consider that. I'm not going to consider that. But in both cases, these ideas don't stop FP from invading. And I think Dan can see where I'm going to go with this. But here's some more ideas. So some people say maybe there's a developmental constraint. So it's actually a difficult thing to do, to be able to do both kinds of reproductions. So maybe it just doesn't evolve very often. But actually, it has evolved. It has evolved a number of times independently, and there are lots of different mechanisms which I won't go into. So, that suggests that it is, I believe, it is a barrier, but it's not a barrier that can't be overcome. Another idea is that there are recessive deleterious genes that become homozygous, and so they're expressed, and this is really bad because there'd be instant death. But Maynard Smith. But Maynard Smith points out in this 86 paper that some forms of parthenogenesis preserve heterozygosity. But I think the other thing about this is Russell actually told me that for some of his stick insect populations that he studies, the females are all homozygous at every larger. So, you know, that's so it is, again, I do believe this is a barrier, but it's maybe not a complete barrier. Barrier. Okay, so I'm going to move on to the hypothesis that I want to explore, which is that sometimes males are not around enough. So if you have high-frequency males, you prevent factors of genes reproducing asexually. So this has actually been modeled by Russell. So he did an agent-based model and looked at the properties of this. So he was able to put in space and some sexual conflict theory stuff and various things like that. Things like that. But I think, even with this explanation, there's a bit of a problem because every time sex doesn't happen, then the two-fold advantage appears. So I think the boost is still quite sizable potentially. So I wanted to explore this a little bit and think about how to sort of drive down that advantage. So, you know, how can males be kept close to the females? Can we increase dispersal? And so I thought, let's crank up the dispersal in a model and let's see how. In a model. And let's see how far that explanation can go towards explaining the absence of FP. And at this point, I should apologise to Joanna, because I might talk about fitness, and apologise to Hamish, because I might talk about equilibria. Apologise to Elene, because there's very little spice. And by the way, I don't know if it's compulsory to use the word spice in our talks. Some sort of a prank that I don't know anything about. I guess we'll find out later. Have we moved back to planes? And possibly I'll have to apologise to Carolyn for working on a stupid model, but I guess you'll be the judge of that. Okay, so I'm gonna consider a facultative pathogenicist trait, FP. Parthenogenesis trait, FP, and I'm going to assume that the males are the heterokinetic sex or hemiokinetic sex. I'm going to pretend there's a Y conzone there, whether or not there is one. And so there's going to be an FP allele, which I'm going to call U, and I'm going to assume it's recessive and excellent. And so these are the genotypes. So these are the obligatory sexual females. These are also obligatory sexual. These are also rudely sexual. These females are the ones that can do both kinds of reproduction. These are the frequencies, and the males are X, Y, and UY. These are the original males, but these are the ones that reproduce sexually but carry the U value problem. Okay, so to model dispersal, what I'm going to do is just say there are K sites that can be occupied by these individuals. Occupied by these individuals, and the population size is n. There's a fraction of the population that's male, that's y plus v, those two male frequency variables. And then the male can make some attempts to find and mate with the female. So we can write down the probability of mating here, and we can approximate this and boil the dispersal down to a single parameter, which I'll call D. And it's the same sort of thing if it's the females that disperse more if they. If it's the females that disperse or if they both disperse. Okay, so using this, we can write down the probability that a female encounters a male and there are two types of males, so we can write down those two probabilities. And the thing about this is that if the sex ratio is one to one, and if the d parameter is around two, well if it's two log two, which is around 1.386, then mating is like mass action, and dynamics are a little bit. And dynamics are a little bit like Hardy-Weinberg, except for the asexual component. So the sexual bits are like Hardy-Weinberg. So I mention that because that's sort of a reference point. Okay, so I'll do the usual thing in EQ genetics and consider all the different mating types, write down their frequencies and the consequences for the offspring, and then we can turn this into a set of recursions and Recursions and write down the mean fitness. And so this extra bit here is the bit due to asexual reproduction. And here there are twice as many offspring from that root. And in this model, there's only one parameter. So in the deterministic version, there's just that D parameter. Very little spice. Okay, so we start with the equation. Okay, so we start with an equilibrium, which is obligatory sexual reproduction, so 50-50, male and female, and this is unstable. And what we might end up with is if the dispersal parameter is lower than 2, then the female facultative apronogens, FP, go to fixation. If D is bigger than that, then there's another equilibrium that's stable, and there we have. Stable and there we have both males and females. The males are all carriers of the U algae, and we can write down what the frequency of males is, so V star. And so I'll just show you what the dynamics look like. When dispersal is low, so let's set it at 1, the FP allele invades and goes to fixation. The X allele goes extinct. The X allele goes extinct, and so do males. So there are no more males. If dispersal is a bit higher, then the U allele still invades, but doesn't go to 100%. And that's because there are still males, the carrier males, the UY males, and they enter the population and they sit at a frequency below 50%. Okay, so they're the two sort of things that can happen in this model. So this is what So, this is what happens when we vary D and we go to that point where we get both males and females. So, this is equilibrium two, where UU is fixed. This is equilibrium three, where there are both males and females. And I can compare theoretical with the human and a right-fischer version of the model that we'll talk about presently. Okay, the thing about this is that The thing about this is that when the dispersal parameter is high, the invasion process is very slow. So, this is the time taken to get to a frequency of 0.001 for these UU females. But of course, one reason for this is because I set this up so that it's a recessive algorithm. So, if it's dominant, then of course it takes less time. And so I just decided to play with that and put that in there. But that's a bit of a barrier to FP entry. That's a bit of a barrier to FPE entry, potentially. So, if we look at a stick insect, so this is another species, this is the peppermint stick insect, Megacrania batesiae. This is another FP type species, and Russell and his group did all sorts of field work on these and experiments. But there's one part of a recent paper that he published where he's got frequencies of FP females in various local populations. In various local populations around northern Queensland. So I grabbed those frequencies and plotted them here, and what you can see is that there's a bunch at 100%. So a lot of local populations are sitting at 100% female, and they're reproducing asexually. And then the rest of them sort of sit around 0.5 or 0.6. And so the sex ratio is, you know, there's a female bias. Is you know, there's a female vice. There's one funny one here, and it's not clear whether the males are about to go extinct or whether this is heading this way. I'm not sure what's going on. But anyway, with this, what we can do is turn the equilibrium around and estimate the dispersal parameter using this information. So this is not exactly big data because it's only a handful of points, but I just thought it might be fun to do. But I just thought it might be fun to do. But with this estimator, there's obviously a problem near a half and near one for this V variable. That's the mal frequency. So I chop those off and just looked at the ones inside, and this is what I get. And obviously, this has a lot of caveats, but we see that the D is sort of around 4, but it could be something bigger or smaller. It's got a lot of caveats because I'm assuming equilibrium and you. Because I'm assuming equilibrium and this model might not be appropriate at all. But on the other hand, I think I could argue that it's extremely convincing because of the uncanny resemblance to this is how some of the theoreticians like the data. Little bit of data. So I want to turn now to the role of stochasticity. So I mentioned I'm doing Wright-Fisher simulations. So now I've got this on a log scale so that we can see the low frequency. So we can see the wobbling around the frequencies, but it sort of tracks the deterministic one. Now, if this, I use the same parameters and run it again, and I might get something like this, where the Where the uh the allele um just goes extinct. Oh no, sorry. What's happening here? Oh, please about this. I think the dashed lines are the deterministic solution. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Thank you for explaining my own model. That's right. Yeah, so this is deterministic, and that's why it comes in. But there's no green wobbly line, and the red one disappears, and the purple one kind of disappears. It kind of disappears. So the U alveol disappears. So, you know, this is not at all surprising because we know about branch processes and mutants fail to enter populations. But I just want to make a brief digression. And you heard about this in a talk earlier today from Dan Salk. He mentioned the drift barrier hypothesis, and I think that's the sort of thing that's happening here. So the idea of Thing that's happening here. So, the idea, of course, is that the mutation rate can only go so low because it's limited by the drift barrier. So, as we reach molecular perfection, we can't keep going further because it's harder to fix better and better alloyles. And that's limited by the population size. Okay, so I think there's something like that going on here. So, when I look at both those parameters, the population size and D, so now if we're looking at stochastic, So now if we're looking at the stochastic version, we've got two parameters instead of one. So D and population size N. So if we look at them together and look at the probability of invasion, then we get something like this. So here, the U allele is able to invade, here it's not able to invade. So there's a low probability of invasion of that U allele if dispersal rate is high and if the population size is low. So it's a combination that's acting here. That's acting here. And again, this is in a way, this is obvious because, of course, there's going to be a drift barrier. It doesn't apply just to the mutation rate, it applies to anything where some more perfect solution might be within reach or not within reach. But if we look at a constant, the classic fixation probability with constant selection, then as a function of population selection, Then, as a function of population size, then we get something that looks like this. So, this is with high s, and this is with low s, and this is with negative s. And so, this sort of, if you look at this and think about it, you can see the drift barrier hypothesis. But this goes in the opposite direction to what I saw in my simulations. And I think what's going on here is that there are strong frequency-dependent effects, which are amplified by large population sizes. So, if the male fraction kind of stochastically fluctuates, then Fluctuates, then in big populations, that becomes important, and the allele is able to invade. Okay, so what I think is going on here is that there's a combination of dispersal and drift. These are factors that work together to hinder the evolution of FP. So we know that dispersal by itself doesn't work. It doesn't prevent invasion because in the deterministic model, In the deterministic model, invasion always occurs. And the drift barrier by itself doesn't seem to be strong enough to prevent invasion. At least under this model, it needs strong dispersal as well. And the flip side of this is that FP is expected to evolve when the dispersal rate is low and/or when the population size is large. And so I think maybe this is testable in principle, and I think we've chatted with Bossy about this. So, of course, this model is extremely simple. My motivation for chasing this up is that, I guess my gut instinct was that maybe there's a much simpler explanation than all this stuff that sexual conflict with or whatever else. So, I just wanted to start with something very simple and see if I can come up with a passing marriage explanation. I'm not sure if this is good enough. I'm not sure if this is good enough because you can still see that when population sizes get bigger, there's not really much of a barrier. So ultimately, it might be something like there's a combination of factors that explain it. So those sort of constraints that I mentioned earlier, I think are probably important as well. This could be some sort of a null model that can be built up. It's only got one parameter, and so there could be all sorts of other things happening, like spatial structure. I didn't talk about demographic change or anything. About demographic change or anything. So, selection could be important. The other thing is that FP species now are going to not look like the ones that originally invaded. So, we might be studying those species now, but they have interesting properties. Like, for example, MbaTI females seem to have evolved the ability to resist males and resist fertilization. So, that's quite interesting. Anyway, so there's a lot to think about there. And I'd like to finish off by thanking Russell for lots of insights. Thanking Russell for lots of inspiration. I chatted with Lindy a lot about this as well. And I know it's unusual to thank pets, but these are still sexy. And finally, funding from the NSC. Thank you very much. What was the intuition that led you to start thinking about spatial structure? I wouldn't have leapt to that as somewhere to look. Something clicked that made you think of that. What was it? Yeah, well, it's actually. What was it? Yeah, well it's actually the idea that the females can reproduce if they don't sing males. So if the males are sort of running around everywhere, maybe this will prevent them from ever doing this. So that was my initial intuition, which in a way is wrong because in that deterministic model you will always embed. But I thought it was something to do with that, but I think it plays a role because having that high dispersal Because having that high dispersal does seem to suppress dispersal space. But the other thing is, I'm not looking at space explicitly. Russell's simulation does, but I don't. And I think maybe it's important because I think I've kind of done a very coarse notion of it. I think there's a question for people. So for partly when you get the fact that the part of the genesis is that it's under different environmental conditions and defining Different environmental conditions, and if I recall correctly, it's often when lesbian resources are going down. Have you considered any of that? No, I think condition-dependent parthenogenesis is quite important, and I think that happens a lot. But I've deliberately set that aside because I think that's sort of another problem. Whereas here, I'm dealing with a situation where the males are not present, and so the females just. So the females just lay eggs in a viable thought that might be an interesting. But yeah, I mean I agree that the other strategy might also be something that you wonder why isn't it everywhere? I kind of think it is everywhere. Like if we look at the eukaryotes in this room, first approximation, 100% of them are facultative sexuals, right? All the fungi, all the fungi, right? It's all faculty sexual. Lots of the plants are faculty sexual. If we want to talk about even small animals, see elegans, right? You know, microbes. So it's like, really, to me, the puzzle is just why in big animals is a strategy that is the main one in the rest of the tree of life. So maybe this thing about it being more common in big populations is it doesn't. Maybe that's right on the money. Yeah, it could be. It could be. I mean, yeah, that's right. I mean, a lot of FP species are, in FB, are they? Well, it's more that the obligate sexuals. Like, facultative sex is super common in nature. It's only rare in big animals. It's very rare. I mean, it's it's possible it poss possibly doesn't happen in animals. Doesn't happen in levels. And I mean, I think there's some sort of exception. Why not in level? Well, that's genomic imprinting. It doesn't happen in birds either. They both have genomic imprinting. Once you've got genomic imprinting, you can't really do that. Yeah, that's like the developmental constraints for it. That's right, but they sell, right? So at this level, you could say, why are mammals selfing? Well, yeah, why don't we get remapered dating to sell? Ah, that's it. There's probably some sort of you guys might call it constraint, I don't like the term constraint, but something to do with having to have a coordinated, you know, like a big animal to have to move around in fairly elaborate ways. If you don't have to do that much, then you can have one bit of you specialise to do one thing, then another, then another thing, specialise to do another thing. That would be my intuition. It's twice, it's so rare and Twice is so rare and thank you very much. Thank you, all the motion.
