Now to the equation, and our goal will be to prove the small-scale formation as the time goes to infinity. And this is the joint work of Sasha, who is right here, and my former student, Jamie Park, who is currently a postdoc at the University of Basel in Switzerland. So to begin with, let me introduce to you to the Bucinesk equation. Throughout my talk, we are going to focus on the incompressible case. So the Bussiness equation describes The business equation describes the motion of a fluid that is driven by the gravity. So I will use rho of xt to denote the density of the incompressible fluid, which is the scalar. And u of xt will be a vector values that lives in 2D, so that is the velocity field of the fluid. And as for the spatial domain, we will consider it either as the whole plane, the torus in 2D. Whole plane, the torus in 2D, or the strip which has the upper and lower boundary and it's periodic in the horizontal direction. So throughout the talk, we are going to assume that the density evolution does not have any diffusivity. So which means that the density rho is just simply transported by the velocity u and it is not doing anything else. So the right-hand side does not include any diffusion. So, the right-hand side does not include any diffusion term. And as for the velocity field u, it is a divergence-free velocity field because the equation is incompressible. And the second equation here just describes, this is pretty much the 2D Euler or Navier-Stokes equation with the additional term here, that is the gravity force. So, for those of you that are more on the collective dynamic side, not the fluid side, the second, the The fluid side. The left-hand side here is simply the material derivative of u, which indicates the acceleration of a particle. Okay, so the second equation is basically saying that it's just the Newton's law that says the acceleration of a particle is proportional to the force that it experienced, where the force is the sum of these two things, plus this viscosity term, and P is implicitly determined by the required. Determined by the requirement that U is a vertical screen. And throughout the talk, I'm going to use a lot of pictures, and I'm going to use the red color to denote the part where rho is higher, and the blue color to denote the lighter density. So for example, red can denote positive rho and blue can denote negative rho. And here, negative does not really mean the density itself. Not really mean the density itself is negative because you can easily add or subtract a constant to the rho equation without changing its evolution. So without loss of generality, we can assume that rho equal to zero is the average density, and then so rho bigger than zero is heavier, so the gravity tries to hold it down, and then here, this part, the density is lighter, so it tries to flow up. Okay, but of course, they But of course, they cannot collapse into each other because the U has to be divergence-free. Okay, so that is the equation. And we are going to discuss both the viscous case where the viscosity coefficient mu is bigger than zero, and also the inviscid case where mu is equal to zero. And in both of the cases, our goal is to prove that the equation can have certain small-scale formation as time goes to infinity. And by small-scale formation, it means that. And by small scale formation, it means that we are going to have some infinite in time rows of solvolet norms, either for rho or for u as time goes to infinity. So that is the setup of the equation. So I'm going to start with the viscous case mu bigger than zero, and let me start with the review of the literature. So in this case, in 2D, the global well-poseness of regular solutions is known. So the domain So, when the domain is the whole plane, the global regularity was done by Ho and Li in the space where U at rho belongs to this Sovole F space. And as long as the exponent M is bigger than or equal to 3, they proved the global well-positeness. And this is also done by Chai in a slightly different setting of simple existence. And similar global well-poseness results was also known for a boundary. Also known for about its domain in sub-Soboleft space and also in different subof space by another Google. Okay, so this is the global well-posit result. And in addition to these global well-positions, it's also a natural question of how fast can the norm grow, right? So in terms of the upper bound for this global in-time solution, Ju have shown that for a bounded domain, For a bounded domain, the H1 norm of rho can at most have this super-exponential row. And this upper bound was refined by Kukabita and Huang. They show that for a bounded domain, the H1 norm of the solution at most grows exponentially. And the W2P norm of the velocity is actually bounded for all time. And in the whole domain, they get a slightly worse bound. A slightly worse bound, that is the superexponential bound. And this is further, so the result for a bounded domain is further refined by a border support by Kukabis, Hamasa and Zein, where they prove that for a bounded domain, the H2 norm of the density actually have an upper bound that is the exponential growth with the arbitrarily small rate. But of course, if epsilon is smaller, the coefficient here will become bigger. And the same thing can be said. And the same thing can be said for the H3 norm of the velocity vehicle. So these are upper bounds, though, right? And so it's a natural question of, well, what about the lower bound of solution? So can the solution actually have certain growth of their sober life norm as time goes to infinity? So to the best of our knowledge, the only literature that we were able The only literature that we were able to find regarding the lower bound is this result by Brenda Lis and Schoenbeck. This result deals with the whole domain R2, and so they have to make the assumption that the initial density must not have mean zero. So under this assumption, they prove that the L2 norm of U is really growing to infinity as time goes to infinity, and it grows exactly as And it grows exactly as the rate that is t to the power one-quarter. Okay. So the mechanism for this growth, in my understanding, is due to the fact that, so for example, you can try to imagine that in the R2, let's say that everywhere density is equal to zero, except that there is this portion of fluids that is heavier than everyone else. So that's the gravity force would be trying to pull it down, and then the more. Down, and then the more that this blob of fluid is going down, so the potential energy is keeping converting to the kinetic energy. So the further it goes down, the faster it becomes. And so that is how the kinetic energy, the L2 norm of U, is growing as time goes to infinity. But this does not necessarily imply the growth if we are considering the higher derivatives. Considering the higher durability. So, in the past literature, we are not aware of any examples of infinite time in time growth of either the HM norm of the density or the higher Sobolev norm of the velocity. So that motivates our research. So, together with Sasha and Jamin, for the viscous case, we obtained the following result. The following result for the torus. So we also have a similar result for R2, but for simplicity, let me just focus on the torus. So we work with the following initial data that satisfies certain symmetry assumptions and sign assumptions. So the symmetry assumption is that the initial density rho 0 is even about the x2 axis and odd about the x1 axis. And then, in terms of the initial velocity, we assume that the horizontal velocity is odd even and the vertical velocity is even odd. So, for example, if on top the velocity are going this way, on the bottom the velocity field are going that way, then this satisfies the symmetry assumption. A simpler way to describe this velocity initial symmetry assumption is that if you prefer to work with the vorticity, If you prefer to work with the vorticity instead of the velocity, you can also think about the vorticity as just an odd-off. So one can easily check that these symmetry assumptions are going to be preserved for all time. And in particular, both this horizontal axis, this vertical axis, and also the border of this torus, they will all be streamlined, which means that the velocity will always have a normal velocity zero of these. Lot of these. And in addition to that, we are going to also assume some sign assumptions on the initial density, where the initial density is heavier on the top part of the torus, so they try to go down, and the initial density is lower on the bottom part of the torus. So they try to flow up, right? But of course, they cannot cross this horizontal axis because that will forever be a streamline. Forever be a streamline. So, whatever that starts in the top part should forever remain in the top, and vice versa. And in addition, we assume one final condition that is actually crucial for us, for the proof to go through, that is, on this vertical axis, we assume that the initial density is pinned down to zero. And because the density is simply transported by the velocity field, and the vertical line is a streamline. Vertical line is a streamline itself, it means that this assumption is also going to remain true for all time. Okay, so these positive density they can never hit this vertical axis. So under these assumptions, we prove that for any initial condition under these assumptions, the density is going to have infinite in-time growth of its H1 norm, and more precisely, its H1. And more precisely, its H1 norm has to grow at least like the power t to the power 1/6 as time goes to infinity. Of course, this is a sub-linear power, and one might wonder whether this is sharp or not. Our guess is that it's probably not sharp, even though this is the best our proof can do. And that being said, under these assumptions of symmetry assumption and sign assumption, Assumption and sign assumption, one can actually go through the previous upper bound proof by Kukabita and Wang. And by following their proof, one can show that under this additional assumption, the H1 norm of rho actually has a refined sub-exponential upper bound, e to the CT alpha, where alpha is something like three-quarter, so it's between zero and one, which means that the upper bound will be something that is sub-exponential. Something that is sub-exponential, and the lower bound is something that is a power law. So the growth must be somewhere between a power law and some explanation, although we don't know which one is the case. So that is the statement of the proof. And so just to think about what is the physical intuition for the infinite in time growth. So if we are starting with this kind of initial data, We are starting with this kind of initial data where this top part is heavier, the bottom part is lighter, then as these things try to go down, these things try to go up. So among all the densities that have the same distribution as the initial one, and among all the density that satisfy the symmetry assumption, if we think about which is the density that minimizes the potential energy, the gravity. The potential energy, the gravitational potential energy, it will be that, well, if the heaviest density try to get as low as possible, and the lightest one, try to get as high as possible, right? Okay, so but then if you believe that this is an asymptotic behavior, and by the way, so this is a still open question about what is actually the asymptotic behavior for such initial data as time goes to infinity, because the Time goes to infinity, because the only thing that we are able to prove is that the H1 norm has to grow to infinity, but we don't know actually as time goes to infinity what does rho converge to. But if you believe that, well, it makes sense to converge to something like that, then the constraint that rho has to be pinned down to zero must imply that there should be some rapid growth across this vertical. Across this vertical axis. So that is just a motivation of why we believe that something like that should work. And to explain how the proof works, let me step back a little bit and talk about the connection between the Bucinesk equation and the incompressible Porcemedia equation, because the proof is relying on some similar idea. I think it would be easier to explain in that case. Plane in that case. So IPM is short for the incompressible force medium equation. And so it describes a density that is driven by an incompressible velocity field that satisfies the Darshan. So the first equation for the density evolution is exactly the same, which says that the density rho is transported by some velocity u. By some velocity field u that is incompressible. So this part is exactly the same as our Jubilee-Bussinets equation, except that when it comes to what is this velocity of u, it has a slightly easier, simpler structure. Okay, so for Pussynette's equation, it reads the following, like this, right? Where this is just the Newton's law, which says the acceleration of the particle is proportional to the force. Is proportional to the force, which is on the right-hand side. But for the IPM equation, it satisfies the thorsis law, which says that the velocity field U is directly proportional to the force on the fluid, and the force is exactly so. So, there is the gravitational force minus rho E2, and then this is correct. And then this is corrected by this gradient of the pressure. And pressure is again implicitly determined by this condition that U has to be divergence with. So now you can see that at least in this case, these two equations are quite similar in the sense that for IPM, it's a velocity that is directly equal to the right-hand side, but for the Busy Nest, it would be the acceleration is equal to the right-hand side. The acceleration is equal to the right side. So together with Sasha in the previous work, we studied whether equation to the IPM can have infinite in time growth. And by the way, the difference is that the IPM is actually an equation that is only known to be locally well posed. Even with initially smooth density, it is still an open question of whether there is a global in-time solution. Is a global in-time solution. But we proved that during the existence of a solution, the H1 norm of the density needs to have at least a certain power law growth. And our idea for that IPM proof is to look at the evolution of the potential energy. So we look at d by dt of the potential energy that is rho x2 dx. So the proof works for both R2 and torho. For both R2 and Taurus, and let me explain the Taurus case. So, if we just track how the potential energy evolves in time for the IPM, then a straightforward computation will give us that it turns out the potential energy is always decreasing in time, well, which makes sense because the velocity field is exactly driven by this gravity field, right? There are no inertia in this equation. Okay, so the difference to me is sort of like, for those of you in collective behavior, it's sort of like the difference between aggregation versus cooker smell, right? For the aggregation, it's like your velocity field at each time is directly given by this convolution, but for cooker smell, it's like your acceleration of your particle is given by that. So now for the IPM equation, if we look at the evolution of a potential energy, one can easily check through a direct calculation that this is Calculation that this is the negative of something squared, and this thing here is the horizontal derivative of the density, and then h minus 1 or squared. So it means that, well, because we are in the torus, so this potential energy is always bounded for all time. Right? Right? Because rho is always between L infinity, so this is always a bounded function. So if you are having a monotone decreasing bounded function, it means that its time derivative needs to be integrable in time. So through this relationship, we directly have that the time integral from 0 to all the time, either infinity or up to the time that this equation. Time that this equation is well posed. So this thing here is a bounded number. And once this is a bounded number, it means that if there is a global solution, then its integrand needs to get very small as time goes to infinity. So more precisely, the integrand needs to be smaller than 1 over t in the, so at least all So, at least on the average sense, right? Because 1 over t is like borderline being non-integrable. So, the integrand is small, and then we proved a lemma which I'm going to show you later, that shows that, well, if this integrand is small, it actually implies that the H1 norm of rho has to be huge. So, that is how the proof works for the IPM. And then, so we try to adapt this kind of idea also. Adapt this kind of idea also to the Business equation. So it turns out there are quite a few differences in the proof, but at the end it worked out. So we define the same potential energy as this integral of rho x2 and the kinetic energy that is just the L Time of squared. And for the Bussyness equation, unfortunately, the potential energy itself will not be decreasing in time. Will not be decreasing in time, but it is well known that it's the total energy, the potential energy plus the kinetic energy, will be decreasing in time if mu is bigger than zero and will be conserved in time if mu is equal to zero. So we are in the case where mu is bigger than zero in this proof. So this is decreasing in time. And as a result, it means that well the integral It means that, well, the integral of this gradient u L2 mark squared will be something that is finite. Right? Okay. And so this is just something that is already well known. And then, as before, we again want to track how the potential energy changes by itself. But this time, if we are just taking one derivative, we won't get something that's very meaningful. We simply just That's very meaningful. We simply just get u times the vertical velocities integral. So we know that this thing is uniformly bounded because recall that the previous literature give us this uniform entire bound of the velocity 50. But other than that, we won't be able to say much about the first time derivative. So that is why we further take one more derivative and to see what is the second time derivative of the potential. Time derivative of the potential energy. Okay, and this time, so we get some messy terms, both due to the viscosity term and also due to the fact that the Bussy Nets equation has this material derivative that results in this term. However, we do see this guy here, and we are expecting this term to help us because this is. Term to help us because this is exactly the term that we use for the small-scale formation in the IPM proof. So now the second time derivative looks quite messy, but if we take a closer look, we notice that this A of t term actually is not that bad because this parentheses is actually something that's super nice, it's always bounded, because rho itself is the density. Rho itself is a density that has its L infinity long bounded, right? And then we are taking one derivative, and then we are gaining two derivatives back. So this thing is something that have even better regularity than rho itself. This is bounded. And then the rest of the term can be bounded by gradient u squared, but gradient u squared is something that is very nice. So we know that even if we grab this A of t and take If we grab this a of t and take its integral from time zero to any time, including time infinity, it will give us about this number. So now we are going to track what about to control this B term and the rest term. So our goal is to show that if there is no growth of the H1 norm, then we want to get a contradiction out of that. So previously I already Okay, so previously I already explained that the time integral from 0 to infinity of a is something that is the innocent constant. And now towards the contradiction, because I actually want to show the h1 or of rho will be growing, right? Actually growing in a polynomial way. But let me explain an easier proof. So let me just, in this slide, I will just try to show that it is growing to infinity. To infinity. So if it does not grow to infinity, then under this assumption, we will be able to control this time integral of B term, because B is exactly including this gradient U term. So we do the Cauchy-Schwarz on B, and we also integrate this thing from time 0 to, sorry, it should be time t rather than time infinity. And then we would be able. And then we would be able to guess that the time integral of b will be growing at most like t to the power one-half. So now if we are grabbing this whole equation and integrating both of the left and right-hand side from time zero to a very large time t, then on the left-hand side, we simply just get the difference of the first derivative at two different times. Times, right? That is something that is about this number. And on the right-hand side, as we are integrating from time zero to a huge time t, this a term will be controlled by a constant, this b term will be controlled by t to the one-half, and therefore we have no choice, but the last term has to be, so this time integral from, again, sorry, from time zero to a large time t has to be bounded by t. has to be bounded by t to the 1 half. And now if you are thinking about there is this integrand whose integral from time 0 to time t grows less than t to the power 1 half, it means that the integrand has to become small. It has to decay to 0 in the average sense like t to the power negative 1 half as t goes to infinity. So this thing needs to decay and then we will use the same idea that The same idea that the H minus 1 norm of this quantity, if this is decaying, it implies that the H positive H1 norm of rho is growing. So let me also explain to you a bit of why this is true. The actual proof is done by a Fourier argument. That is not too bad. But let me try to explain the idea of the proof by a picture. So what does it mean by So what does it mean by the first derivative rho h minus one norm is tiny? Well, this norm can only be perfectly equal to zero if my rho is a function that is perfectly horizontally stratified. So if my row is just a layered function that only depends on the x2 variable, then if I change the partial one derivative, I'm perfectly going to get zero. So this is the only case. So, this is the only case where zero can be achieved. And now, if this norm is not exactly zero, but it is something tiny, then you can imagine that this should imply in some sense that my density rho is really close to a horizontally stratified function in the distribution sense. Right? Okay, but now, so if you think about these symmetry and sign assumptions that we made at the beginning of the proof. That we made at the beginning of the proof, we have pinned down the value of rho to be equal to zero along the vertical axis. So if the density is really close to a horizontally stratified function in the distribution sense, it means that it needs to be jumping from the value zero to this almost constant thing in a really tiny interval. Interval. And that should imply that across this vertical axis, there has to be a very rapid change of the value of rho in x1, and that should result in a large positive solvent mark of rho. So that is just a picture to convince you that while we expect something like this relationship holds, that well, if this norm, h minus 1 norm, is tiny in some sense, then the h5. Tiny in some sense, then the H1 order has to be huge to a certain power. The actual proof is by breaking it down into a Fourier theory, and it's not too bad. Okay, and now where is the contradiction? Well, we already have shown that this H1 minus 1 norm squared needs to decay like t to the negative 1 half, and that will imply the H1 norm needs to be growing like some positive power of t, right? But we were assuming that the H1 norm doesn't. We're assuming that the H1 norm doesn't grow, so there is a contradiction, right? And then, if you look at our assumption and our conclusion, you notice that there is the gap in the power, right? If we assume that it doesn't grow at all, we are getting that it has to grow like t to the one-half or something. So because there is the gap in the power, we will still have a contradiction, even if we are assuming that it's growing very slowly. So, by playing with that power, this is where With that power, this is where we get this algebraic rows that is t to the 16. So that is the idea for the proof of the viscous case. And then we also try to work on the inviscid case, although we ended up using a different strategy for the proof. And by the way, the reason that this proof fails for the inviscid case is because we are using the fact that the total energy is decreasing. The total energy is decreasing in time. So we use that to control the time integral of A, and that is depending on this integral being finite, right? So as mu goes down to zero, this right-hand side will be becoming infinite. So that's how it fails for the inviscid case. And now let me also review what is the result known, the previous literature in the inviscid case, because it's quite different from Are quite different from the viscous one. Instead of working with the rho and u equation, we are going to work with the variable that is the density and the vorticity. So the vorticity is the scalar that describes how fast locally the fluid is rotating. So one can easily check that by taking the curve of the U equation, the vorticity equation looks like this. So it means that the vorticity is transported by U. Is transported by you. Meanwhile, it has this growth term. So this is the term that couples the two equations together. And just like the 2D Euler equation, once we have the vorticity, one can recover the velocity from the Beuls of our law. So this is exactly the same Biosavar law as the 2D Euler equation. So for the 2D Pussy-Nass equation, if there is no boundary, then whether smooth initial data Then, whether smooth initial data can lead to a finite time blow-up is an outstanding open question. And people care about this question not only because of the interest in BussyNet's equation itself, but also because it's known that this equation has a strong connection to the 3D axis symmetric Euler equation. Namely, so the 3D axis symmetric Euler equation can be rewritten. Can be rewritten in this way. And if we think about this orange part as our row, the first equation says that the material derivative of rho is equal to zero. And then if we think about that term that plays a similar role of omega, the second equation says that the material derivative of this quantity is equal to this partial derivative of the first quantity. So these two equations do share very similar structures as. Very similar structures as long as R is away from zero. So that is their connection. And regarding the blow-up for invisits 2D Bussinesk and 3D Euler, so either in the presence of boundary or for non-smooth initial data, in the past decade, there has been many exciting developments on the finite temple. So, the first such kind of result is a numerical result done by Lo and Ho, where they give convincing numerical evidence for the 3D X6 symmetric Euler in the cylinder with a boundary. And they have numerical evidence that shows that there can be self-similar blow-up at the boundary. So, regarding the rigorous analytic proof, so Elvini and Joan look at both the two. John looked at both the 2D Bucinesc and 3D Euler, and they proved that the equation can have a finite time blow-up if we are in the domain with a boundary, and the boundary contains a coin. And likewise, for the non-smooth initial data, it's also known that blow-up can happen. So this is done by the breakthrough. So, this is done by the great thorough work by El Gindi. He proved that for the C1 alpha solution of Grady Euler, it can have a finite step blow-up. And Chin and Ho generalized this idea and they proved that the blow-up can also happen for sigma-alpha solutions in the domain with the boundary. And more recently, Wang Lai, Gomez-Serano, and Blackmaster used the physics-informed neural network. Used the physics-informed neural network to do some numerics where they obtained approximate self-similar blow-up solution for the Busy-Pass equation. And more recently, so in the work by Chen and Ho, so they have used a very delicate combination of rigorous analysis and computer-assisted estimate to rigorously prove that. To rigorously prove that there exists a stable, nearly self-similar blow-up for smooth initial data for both 2D Business NASC and 3D Euler. So however, that proof is, so for both the analytic part and also the computer-assisted proof part, I think the two parts add up to more than almost 300 pages. So the question now is that, well, and also for Is that well, and also for all these self-similar blow-up proof, they require the initial data to be really close to the profile. So together with Sasha and Jamie, we are wondering that, well, if we do not try to aim for the finite time blow-up, if all we want is to explain this infinite, so this solution can grow to infinity. Grow to infinity in infinite time, then can we construct this solution for some more general class of initial data? And hopefully the proof should reveal, like, give more intuitions about, well, how does these certain data with the right sign and right symmetry always lead to growth. So that motivates our study. And so our result for And so our result for the, so we obtained the infinite in time rows in the strip for the Pussynetsk equation that's invested. And let me now describe the result. So the domain is a strip where there is an upper and lower boundary, and horizontally it's just periodic. And our initial data takes the same even symmetry about x1 and no symmetry about x1. And no symmetry about x2 is needed because now the domain is just a strict. And so we let the initial vorticity to be odd in x1. And there is a technical assumption that the initial vorticity integral is positive on the spread portion. But even if we remove that, we can still have the same kind of growth after we wait for some time. So that is just not necessary. Not necessary. And then the key assumption that we really need is that we assume that the initial density is uniformly positive on this X2 axis in this portion, so the density is heavier. And then on this X1, on the side here where X1 is equal to pi, and also notice this is the same boundary as here, we require the As here, we require the density to be non-positive. So the initial density is hotter along this line, it's colder along that line, sorry, it's heavier along this line, and it's lighter along that line. And notice that this is something that will be preserved for all time, because the oddness of omega will be preserved for all time, which means that you will be having you. U1 will be having the even symmetry for all time. So these two vertical lines will forever be streamlined. And then the density is preserved along the trajectory. So the density along this line will forever be heavier, and the density along that line will forever be lighter. That is our assumption. And then we show that, of course, we can't prove the global warp. We can't prove the global workloseness for such kind of initial data. That is the open question. So, all we are able to say is that during the lifespan of the solution, it has to satisfy the following estimate, that the Lp norm of the vorticity needs to grow polynomially like this power. And in particular, as P goes to infinity, it means that the maximum vorticity needs to be growing like T cubic. Cubic and the maximum velocity needs to grow at least linearly, and the gradient of the density is also growing at least like quadratic. The proof is a very soft argument, which I think I'm able to explain to you in the next five minutes. So it's based on an interplay between various monotone and conservative quantities. So which in the previous proof we were also In the previous proof, we were also playing with these monotone quantities like the total energy and so on. So notice that the domain Q is preserved as we are evolving this trajectory in time because both this line and that line are streamlined. And then let's check how the integral of the vorticity is evolving in Q. Is evolving in Q. So if we are doing the time derivative of this integral of vorticity in Q, there are two contributions that come from this Business equation. One is the transport term, and the other term is this coupling between the rho and omega. So the diversion theorem would simply give us the contribution from the first term is equal to zero because u is divergence-free and also because And also because the normal velocity on all four boundaries of Q is equal to zero. Okay, so that term goes away. And then the second term here is nothing but just the horizontal derivative of rho and the fundamental theorem of calculus that we learned in fresh class tells us that, well, this can be written as the difference of this integral on the right minus the difference on the left. Minus the difference on the left. So this is giving us the integral of rho along the x1 equal to 0 minus the integral of rho at x1 equal to pi. But remember that because of our initial assumption that this part is heavier, this part is heavier, this density is strictly less than K0, this part is lighter, its density is non-positive, and these properties will hold for all the time. Will hold for all the time. And therefore, the first integral is bigger than k0 times pi for 3. The second integral is non-positive for 3. So it means the integral of omega has to grow linearly in time for 3. And now, what does this integral of omega mean? So the integral of omega, the integral of vorticity, exactly give us the circulation of velocity. The circulation of velocity along the boundary, which means that this linear growth of this integral of vorticity is giving us the circulation along the boundary of Q has to grow at least linearly in time, and that will imply that the maximum velocity needs to at least grow linearly. So, this is where this linear bound here comes out. comes out. And then, so you might wonder that, okay, but this is only linear. So how do we go from linear to superlinear in the other two bounds? The idea is that, so now this is the interplay between a conserved quantity, which is the L2 norm of the kinetic energy, versus the monotonicity of the integral of omega. Okay, so why is the kinetic energy? So, why is the kinetic energy bounded? Because the energy conservation in the inviscous case tells us the kinetic energy plus the potential energy is conserved for all the time, but potential energy is always bounded. So kinetic energy also has to be remained bounded for all time. And this implies that inside Q, so we are having that the L2 norm of U is bounded, but the circulation around the boundary becomes Allow the boundary become really big. It grows linearly in time. So now what happens? Well, if we are tracking each of these layers of smaller squares as we are gradually going in, we see that in the most outer square, the integral of u is like t, which is huge at large time, right? However, we have a total budget of a finite order one, kinetic energy. Older one, kinetic end. So, which means that as soon as we go in for something that is less than t to the minus two, then we need to have a layer whose circulation is jobs to order one. Otherwise, we would be running out of our total budget of the kinetic energy. So, this implies that in a very thin layer, we need the circulation to drop from order T to order one, and that results. Order one, and that results in a huge change of the gradient u. So this is where we are able to get that the omega is growing, has to be huge in this very thin boundary living. Okay, and then once we are having this lower bound of omega, because omega is transported along the trajectory, and the only growth of omega that you can get is coming from the partial one of rho. So if omega's maximum. So if omega's maximum value grows like t to the cube, then it means that the partial one of rho needs to be at least growing like t squared in order to make omega grow indefinitely. So that is how this proof goes. And so we also have some similar result for the infinite time in time rows in the torus. But in this case, we are not able to set these rows. able to set this row to be uniformly positive because they need to by the symmetry they need to be zero both up and down so this is why we have to only make it positive in the inner portion and so using a similar argument we are able to get that so in this setting where there has been no proof of the finite time blow-up yet so for we prove that for any initial data with For any initial data with the right symmetry where rho is odd in about the x2 axis, where rho is even odd, omega is odd odd, then the gradient of the density needs to be growing at least like t to one half. And so this is for the 2D pussy nesk. And for the 3D axis symmetric Euler, because it's so strongly connected. Because it's so strongly connected to the Tubipus test. So we are able to prove a similar result that says if we consider an annular cylinder, which is, so the radius r is between pi and 2 pi. So the cylinder has an inner boundary at radius pi, has an outer boundary at radius 2 pi. And then in the vertical direction z, it is Vertical direction z, it is periodic. So this is our setting for the domain. And then if we look at the initial velocity that is even in the z variable, so here, different color here denotes the strength of the u theta, the angular velocity. Okay, so the red color here denotes that I start initially with the large angular velocity. With the large angular velocity V, and the green color here denotes that the angular velocity is small. So, namely, along these two, so along this part, we assume that the initial angular velocity is uniformly positive. It's bigger than k0. And then in the middle, the easiest way is to assume the initial velocity is zero, or all we need is that it's less than. All we need is that it's less than some smaller constant times k0. Then, for all such kind of initial data, we prove that during the lifespan of the solution, the vorticity needs to again have this super linear growth with the maximum vorticity growing like T cube and the maximum velocity has to grow at least linearly. At least linearly. And notice that again, during the whole evolution, inside this annular cylinder, the total kinetic energy is valid for free, for 3D Euler. So it means that, so physically, it suggested this interesting secondary flow phenomena that even if we are starting with these initial velocity that is purely just rotating. Just rotating horizontally, then it says the result says that as time goes, your total kinetic energy in this periodic cylinder, which is a compact domain, is bounded, is actually constant for all time, but it will be creating a secondary flow that is in the vertical direction here. And as time goes to infinity, this secondary flow in terms of the maximum. Secondary flow, in terms of the maximum velocity, are destined to grow at least linearly in time. So that is our result for 3D Euler. So overall, so I would say that's the overarching theme of all this work is that we try to come up with some maybe like softer, shorter, more intuitive arguments that, because previously, That, because previously for these infinite in-time growth, like the work by Sasha and Shverad, also by the work by Zlatoch, for Tubi Euler, many of them are based on, so very carefully look at the structure of the Biels of R law and try to prove a certain, for example, hyperbolic point scenario. But this is another attempt that tries to show that the growth of norms sometimes. The growth of norms sometimes can also be obtained from an interplay of some these functionals. Some of them are conserved in time, some of them are monotonic in time, and sometimes if we combine these in the correct way, it can give us these infinity time growth results, right? And often for these equations that come with the gravity, we find it's a natural, in many cases, the tracking the potential energy. The tracking the potential energy seems to be very helpful to me. So, let me conclude by this free boundary pussyness equation at Singapore Airport. And you guys are welcome to visit me at Singapore. And thank you for so much. Thank you. Do we have any questions for Riel? So you mentioned that in the viscous case, right, the main mechanism Right, the main mechanism that drives the norm up is the change of the acidity in horizontal direction. But there's also a change in the vertical direction between light and gain of fluid as they come together, right? Yes, right, exactly. That's a very good point. I am intentionally hiding it from you when I was saying that there is a rapid change in the horizontal direction. The reason I didn't say vertical direction is because It's because every horizontally stratified density is a steady state. So even this guy here is the steady state with the lowest potential energy. But let's say if these things, they do not try to sink to the bottom of this upper part. If they try just to stay in the middle and if this part also tries to stay in the middle, so that is still a steady state, right? So which means that. So, which means that even if we know that somehow as time goes to infinity, your solution converges to a steady state, which we don't even know that. But even if we know that, we don't know whether it's going to converge to the steady state with the lowest potential energy. If it's just converged to any steady state that is horizontally stratified, then we wouldn't be able to argue that vertically there's a rapid change, but horizontally, There's a rapid change, but horizontally, it still has to be because you can't make a horizontally stratified stage with your density row pinched out to so on. I have probably a silly question. To have a picture of that in my imagination, if we have a can I think about it, like we have a container and there is a with water and there is a bubbles of olive or whatever which has two different densities. Which has different density, and the bubbles are separated. Does it mean that they will remain separated even if they go up, but they will be closer to each other because they are going up because of the gravity. And then we remain to be separated, but thin layer of water still, those two bubbles. They have to remain separated for all time as long as the velocity field is limited. Yeah, because for if the velocity, so if there is global well-closeness and if it implies that the velocity field is Lipschitz, it means that any two particles can at most approach each other exponentially. So they can't really touch, they can get close, but they can't touch each other in finite time. Yeah, I have a question about your mass result on the 3D axis symmetric example. Symmetric example is the annular cylindrical geometry. I wonder if you know any results on the casement where outer domain is actually like a free boundary. It's kind of like the last slide where you can't, you don't really have a fixed outer boundary constraint. Do you know if there are any results in that setting? So in that setting, together with Chung Ken-fu, a grad student Sasha, and also Cheng Yun Lu, And also Cheng Min Luo in Hong Kong, we are trying to prove some small-scale formation for, although it's not for the 3D though. So we are trying to do it in a 2D setting, so where there is the free boundary and then there is the bottom, which is just a fixed domain. And then, so in this case, we try to prove that there exists a certain initial data where the gradient of vorticity grows double exponentially. Exponentially. But in the setting that is the modification of that scenario, I am not aware of any. Okay, thank you very much. Ask a question about these. So basically, out of that setup, we're sort of like all the energy target for these thing layers. I mean most? We can't say all the energy are we going towards. All the energy, okay, let's say a portion of the energy where it's most sitting there. Financially. So i any kind of kind of uh mark going to be evidence to see that? Or i it's still possible that you just bugged it at times. About infinite time? So, I think it's possible to blow up in finite time. Although, like, actually, so yeah, I once had a discussion with Ziajia Chen because he's the blow-up expert. And I think he tend to believe that anything starting with this that leads to infinity time growth could blow up. But of course, like proving blow-up is very difficult, right? So that's why they have to work with the initial data that is already. To work with the initial data that is already close. But if he makes a guess, I think at that time he tends to believe that it should blow up. But anyway, so what we are showing here is that these quantities, they either blow up in infinite time or they blow up in finite time. Other questions? Okay, well let's thank Yao again. And we will reconvene at a lot of
