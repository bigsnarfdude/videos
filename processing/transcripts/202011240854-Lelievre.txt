A question which was inspired by multi-scale models for polymeric fluids. So in terms of technique, what I will present, I will use entropy techniques on PDs. So that's the connection to this conference. But it will not be on the existence or uniqueness of such a problem, this talk will be more about a modeling question. Talk will be more about a modeling question, let's say, which is how to derive an effective dynamics for stochastic differential equations. So, the idea is that you have a dynamics in high dimension on a vapor in Rd, and you would like to get some good coarse-grain dynamics on just a few degrees of freedom. And this question actually is important in multi-scale models for polymeric fluids, where you have exactly the same question which are. Have exactly the same question which arises when you want to go from a full description of the polymer chain, full atom if you want, to the end-to-end dumbbell problem. And this is the motivation. So let me explain quickly the motivation. So for these polymer chains and polymeric fluids, the idea is that you have polymer chains which are very numerous, small and light, and within Newtonian Small and light, and within Newtonian solvent. So you start from the momentum equation on velocity for here, an incompressible fluid. So you have pressure here, and this is the stress. And you have the classical Newton term plus what is called an extra stress. And this is where the micro simulation will come, micro-modeling will come into the picture in the sense that. To the picture, in the sense that you will model this toe going to at the level of at the level of the microstructures in your fluids. So, here it will be polymer chains. Okay, so let me explain what you do. So, this is a spaghetti which is supposed to represent a polymer chain. And the idea is that you will go from a full atom description to something which will be much coarse-grained, where you will only look at the Look at the end-to-end vector. And so you will end up with what is called the Dumbbell model, where you have only two points, these two beads, and you will have a spring here. And this spring is supposed to model all, if you want, the degrees of freedom which have been erased when going from the full atom description to this coarse-grained dumbbell model. And this is what my talk will be about. My talk will be about. But let me finish this description of the micro-macro model just to close the loop before I go to that. So, once you have this coarse-grained description, what you do is that you write equilibrium of forces on each of the beads, so of the two beads here, okay, for the Dumbbell model. So, you have a drag force, which is the difference between the velocity of the bead and the velocity of the underlying flow. You have this entropic force, this force I was mentioning, between This force I was mentioning between the two beads, so you have different models depending on what approximation you use, and then you have the Bronen force, which comes from the fact that these beads are in the solvent. So, you write this equilibrium of forces, and then by using just linear combination of these two equations, you end up on two equations on the one hand, the end-to-end vector, okay, and on the other hand, the center of mass. And the last simplification. The last simplification is to forget the noise on the center of mass and to write an order one approximation for this term, difference of velocities. And this is what is written here. And you end up with this formula for the evolution of the end-to-end vector, or this one if you go to Eulerian description. And if you couple this microscopic model with the equation I was mentioning before, and using this so-called And using this so-called Cramus formula to get the stressed answer, you end up with this micro-macro model, which has been looked at by many people, including people in this conference, in terms of well-posedness and how to discretize it also efficiently. So it's a coupled PDSD problem. Okay? But okay, so what I would like to focus on is really on this term, this F. Where does it come from? This F, where does it come from? And can we say something about this model? So the way it is written, if you go back to Bert, Curtis Armstrong, Doyle Edwards, and people like that, where these models are derived, they explain that what they looked at is that they have the very long chain. They take it in a zero velocity field background for the solvent, and they look at equilibrium, at the equilibrium distribution between these two points. Distribution between these two points, so this n-to-n vector, and then they decide that the force will be the gradient of the log of this equilibrium density. Okay, so what I would like to discuss is how we can understand this kind of derivation. Why does it make sense to do that? And why does it yield indeed a dynamics? Maybe why and when? Could it yield a dynamics on the end-to-end vector which has something to do with the original? Has something to do with the original dynamics you would have had on the full atom description of limo chain. Okay, so that's the question I would like to ask. Okay, so you can forget about the motivation now and just start with this. You have a stochastic dynamics of this form, which is typically what you would use in order to model the full atom polymer chain. Okay, so you have a potential V between all the atoms along. Between all the atoms along the chain, okay, you have a Boolean motion, which is due to the fact that you are in a solvent. Okay, I put the temperature equal to one here to keep things simple. And then you have this psi, which would be just the end-to-end vector. And you would like to derive dynamics on psi of xt, which would be Markovian. So some closed equation on Zt, say, such that Zt would be. Say, such that zt would be close in some sense to ψ of xt. Okay, so that's the question you would like to address. And to keep things simple, I will just take a situation where dimension is equal to 2 and ψ is just x1. But all what I will present is actually, you can generalize it to the case where ψ would be, for example, the norm between the distance between the two, or the vector actually. Okay, that's important. That's important. One thing which is also on this slide is this measure, which is the invari measure of the full dynamics in Rd. Okay. And from that, we will build. So this is the equivalent of the preci equilibrium, which was here in my previous slide. It's the equilibrium function, the equilibrium measure of these dynamics, of the full dynamics. And this is from Of the full dynamics. And this is from that that you will build the effective force between the two ends of your polymer chain using the free energy. So, what is the free energy? So, remember that psi is just x1 here, to keep things simple. So, what you do is that you just integrate everything except along x1. So, you take the marginal along x1. And this gives you a measure, and this measure you define it as exponential minus a of x1. So, a is defined in such a way. defined in such a way that exponential minus a of x1 dx1 is the push forward of, of mu sorry the measure in Rd by xi okay so that's so here it's in R2 okay let's say by xi okay so and so this is this is exactly what what we did with polymer chain in the sense that A was just the minus the log of this integral of exponential minus integral of exponential minus v dx2 and then we take the derivative of this guy to build the entropic the so-called entropic force so you build this free energy and the question is if you take this dynamics which is known only in r okay has thing to do with the dynamics of x1 or the original problem in r2 okay so we know that in terms of invari measure it's correct because the invariant measure of this measure is correct because the invert measure of this guide is exponential minus a and by construction it's exactly the psi star mu. So the equilibrium of Z t is the same as the equilibrium of X one T. But the question is more on the dynamics. So can we say something about the dynamics of this in R of this Markov dynamics compared to the original psi of X T. Okay, so this is how you can understand what is going on. So remember the original dynamics, which was on two coordinates, x1, x2, which is written here in terms of SDE, and here in terms of a PDE for those of you who prefer PDE. So this is just how the law of XT evolves as a function of time. So you just, this is the Foucault-Planck, the Foucault-Planck equation associated to the SDE, which is there. Okay? SDE, which is there. Okay. And again, the equilibrium is given by exponential minus V normalized. And so this is a long time limit of psi. Then we look, we're interested in only x1. So let's look at what is x1. x1 is by definition this, okay? Or if you look in terms of psi, you are interested only in the marginal in x1. So you integrate the PDE with respect to x2, and you end up with this formula. With this formula, okay, and of course, the problem is that here it's not closed in the sense that these depends on x2, okay, and in the sense that here you have a psi, and psi is not a simple function of psi bar. You go from psi to psi bar by just marginalizing along x1, but you cannot go back. So, you need a closure approximation. So, what can be done to close these dynamics? There is a simple idea, which is to say, Simple idea, which is to say I look at this term and I will take the conditional expectation of this guy given x1. So this is the SDE or the probabilistic version of that. So I introduce this B tilde, which is the conditional expectation of the drift, given that x1 is equal to z. In terms of PDE, it's just this formula. You just take a psi dx2 normalized, so it's a conditional measure for a given x1. Okay, or given x1, and uh, so yeah, so maybe I should have said that here x1 is equal to z. Sorry, so here x is equal to x1, x2, okay, and x1 is equal to z. Sorry. And you take this function of time and you plug it into a new drift. And so you end up with now a closed equation. And you can check that actually the law of z tilde t at the given time. Of z tilde t at the given time t is exactly the law of x1 t from the very beginning. So it's very, in terms of marginal times at least. So in terms of the law at time t, it gives you an answer which is quite reasonable, okay? But there is no free energy here for the moment, and it's a function of time, so it's not that easy to compute. I mean, in the sense that it will depend on the initial condition of all this stuff, so it's not very nice. So the next step is to do exactly the same. step is to do exactly the same thing, but just to do the conditional expectation here with respect to equilibrium now. So this is what is done there. So I do exactly the same, but here instead of using the conditional expectation at a given time t, I use the conditional expectation with respect to the equilibrium, the exponential minus t. And so this will be the dynamics that we consider in the following. That will be the one which is a good candidate to approximate x1. To approximate x1 of t. And as you may already have noticed, so this b of x1 is this integral of d1 v exponential minus v dx2 normalized, and it's nothing but the derivative of a of the free energy. So it's really what we expect to be correct. Okay, it's it's this dynamic is exactly the one which has been considered by Doy Edwards Kurt. Doy Edwards, Curtis Armstrong, and these people where they look at this entropic force. So they take the free energy and they take the derivative of the free energy to build the force. It's called sometimes the mean force in statistical physics. And what is the PDE? Going back to the PDE, it's just that. So the PDE is d tsai is that is d1a prime, the b is a prime, phi plus d11 phi. What is bar here? There is no bar. Okay. Okay, so this is a way to, I mean, you can understand this in the more advanced projection operator approaches. I don't, if you know, I mean, it's really very close in spirit. And so this is the result that I would like to discuss today, which is that actually you can indeed show that the two dynamics are closed. In the sense that if you take the x t, the original dynamics, and you take psi of x t, and psi is only x one, it's just the first coordinate. It's just the first coordinate. The law of x1t is close to the law of zt in entropy under some assumptions, which are the following. What you ask first is that for all x1, if you take the equilibrium measure given psi of x, so given the first coordinate, this is the formula to define it, it satisfies a log-star inequality with constant rho. And the second thing I would like to assume is that there is a so-called bounded coupling. There is a so-called bounded coupling in the sense that the cross-derivative of V along X1 and orthogonally to X1, so the D1 to V, is bounded in L infinity norm. And if you have these two properties, these two assumptions, you can show that this entropy between the two is bounded from above by a kappa of a rho, so these two parameters, times something which is. So if you look at this guy, so what does it tell you? So, what does it tell you? It tells you that this entropy, so this quantity there, okay, is bounded from above first that by this C kappa of a rho time, this entropy of the initial condition respect to mu. So that's the first thing. And then there is a minus. And this, you know, will go to that because in the long time limit, the xt will go to mu. So this will go to zero at some rate. Okay, so you have, in addition to that, some kind of exponential decay here. Addition to that, some kind of exponential decay here. And so, what this tells you is that you are below this if you want these two curves. Okay, that's and it's interesting because it's for all t. So it's an estimate which holds for all time, also in the long time limit, which is not very surprising because we already knew that the FAT dynamics was correct in the long time limit. So it's not that surprising. So I would like to finish the I would like to finish by giving some ideas of how we can prove that using entropy techniques and transport inequalities. So let me introduce the tools I need. So first I need to explain, I need to use entropy and entropy techniques to look at the long time behavior and to introduce the Lobster inequality constant. So this is just a three slide. So, this is just a three slide to recap very well-known things. Where, if you look at these dynamics, the original dynamics and the associated PDE, if you want to understand at which rate psi goes to psi infinity, the equilibrium, you can look at the entropy of psi respect to psi infinity, the relative entropy, which is defined by that. Okay, and it's a very simple computation to check that when you differentiate this entropy respect to time, you end up with minus. You end up with minus what is called the so-called Fisher information, okay, which is defined by that. And from that, by the simple Grandval lemma, you can check that an exponential decay of the entropy in that sense is equivalent to the fact that the entropy is bounded from above by a constant times the Fisher information. Okay, so you have this equivalence. So the Luxembourg inequality constant, which is the capital R here. Which is the capital R here, in some sense, encodes the fact that it's easy to go to equilibrium. So, what I'm seeing in this assumption here is that the conditional measures are nice in the sense that they are easy to sample. And this is what the easiest they are to sample, so the larger the row, the closest the dynamics on X1 to the sorry, from the release. Pix. Okay, so with this tool, let me explain how we compare the original dynamics on X1T with the approximation on Zt. So this is the PDE that you have on the original dynamics, okay? This psi bar and with this B tilde, which is unclosed in the sense that you have up psi here. And this is the Markovian approximation, okay, with A prime, which is given. Approximation, okay, with A prime, which is given here. So you see that it's basically the same PDE, except that you have changed B tilde by A prime. And how B tilde differs from M prime is that you do the conditional expectation respect to psi here and here to psi infinity. And so you would like to estimate the relative entropy of psi bar respect to phi. And so the basic idea is just to differentiate this guy as we did before respect when we had. Before respect when we had psi on psi infinity. So here it's psi bar respect to phi. And since psi bar satisfy the PTE satisfied by phi plus an error term, you have an error term in the entropy estimate, which is there. You just do a simple Cauchy-Schwarz, Jung, and you end up with this. So now you have to estimate the difference between the free energy, the derivative of the free energy, and the B tilde. So these two conditional expectations. Tilda, so these two conditional expectations, okay. And from this, we use the transport inequality because you know that it's the average of the same quantity d1v with respect to two different conditional measures. So by using this, you can bound it from above by the Waserstein inequality between the two. And using the Talagrand, you can bound from above the Waserstein by the entropy and then. The entropy and then by the Fisher information. Okay, so that's the second step. And then you plug that in the estimate I had before. You use that the infraction information is the derivative of the entropy and you end up with the result I was mentioning. Okay, so it's really the proof is really combining standard entropy estimates with this transport inequality which gives Which gives the difference of these two terms. Just a word to say that this idea of using log sub inequality on the conditional measures and bounded coupling is very fruitful. For example, you can understand how you go from log sub inequality from the conditional measures to log some inequality for the full measure. You can also analyze some dynamics which are called adaptive biosing dynamics. Adaptive by using dynamics. I don't have time to go into the details of that now. So this was, I mean, this firm I presented was about how far are the time marginals, so the law of Xt, of X1T compared to the law of Zt. You can also look at something which is more probabilistic in nature, which is the difference in terms of trajectories, really. I mean, at the omega. At the omega per omega, if you want, okay. And so you can also get a similar result using a Poisson equation on Duximarting inequalities. The big difference being that we are here on a fixed time interval. And you have a CT here, which explodes in general when T goes to infinity because there is a Grandval somewhere involved. But just to say that you can also do some this kind of things. And you can actually use these techniques to Can actually use these techniques to revisit some averaging principles where you accelerate the dynamics on the orthogonal degrees of freedoms. Okay. I'm down now. So we did recently extension of that to non-reversible dynamics, which is a case where you have non-gradient forces. And so it raises the question, what is the free energy in this context? And it is also useful to implement numerical schemes where you use this effective dynamics to help the simulation. This effective dynamics to help the simulation of the original dynamics. So, here are a few references on what I presented, and I would like to thank you for your attention. I'm happy to answer questions if you have. Okay, so thank you. Are there any questions? I have one. So, maybe it's naive and maybe it will show you. Maybe it's naive and maybe it will show that I didn't get the point. But so your starting motivation was the description of polymeric chains. Yeah. But so in the description of polymeric chains, I guess there is also, I mean, a large number of beds, right? I mean, it's like you went from a large number of beds to a typical one and then. And then trying to have a look at the marginal and see how you can close. But I guess in a large system, this closure would come asymptotically as the number of pets goes to infinity. I mean, it's a vague question, but. No, no, no, it's not a vague question. So indeed, I mean, so if you look at the way it is presented by Ross, indeed, they go from these Rows, indeed, they go from this full atom description first to n beads, and then they go from n beads to the end-to-end vector. Okay, so I did that. I go directly from here to there, and looking only at the end-to-end distance, if you want. But I mean, in principle, what you have to do is to actually introduce all these vectors on what I've explained on all these vectors, okay? And I mean x2 minus x1, x3 minus x2, etc. Okay. X1, X3 minus X2, et cetera. Okay. And your question is: I think, could I show that with what I've said that the dynamics is indeed better when I use more bits than when I use only two. In the sense that, for example, the kappa would be large, smaller, or the row would be larger, or things like that. So, in the sense that the dynamics would be better, okay? And the answer is no. So, I'm not able to. So, in some sense, if you want, I'm So in some sense, if you want, I derived a setting where I could understand why such entropic forces would indeed be good in order to get an effective dynamics, on a coarse-grained dynamics. But I'm not sure how to use this setting in order to explain in the specific case of polymeric chains why it would work. And so for me, it's still a little bit of magic at some point in this derivation. I mean, it's in maybe five or ten lines in the book. So I will use the entropic force and then I approximate the inverse Langevin by Phineas and then it's done. But I mean, what is behind that and how to mathematically prove that what we are doing here is indeed correct is still a little bit a mystery for me. Okay, more questions.
