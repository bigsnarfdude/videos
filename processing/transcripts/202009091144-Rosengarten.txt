So it's So, it's my pleasure to introduce our next speaker. So, Zeph Rosengarten from Hebrew University will tell us about rigidity for unirational groups. Okay, thanks. Can everyone see my screen? Okay, great. Yeah, so I'm going to be talking about rigidity results for unirational group schemes. Okay, so. Okay, so okay, so I'll first talk about rigidity for abelian varieties. So, one of the sort of foundational results in the theory of abelian varieties is this rigidity theorem, which says that if A and B are abelian varieties over some field K, and F from A to B is a K-schemorphism, which preserves identities, then it's a K-group homomorphism. Okay, so a priori, you only, it doesn't know anything about the group structure, but in fact, it actually. Group structure, but in fact, it actually has to respect the group structure. And this has many consequences. So, for example, it implies that abelian varieties are commutative by applying this fact to the inversion morphism, right? To be commutative means that inversion is a homomorphism. It implies the uniqueness of group structure with a fixed identity point. It implies, in order to construct things like polarizations, you can just construct maps, and the maps, if they preserve identities, are automatically homomorphisms. Automatically homomorphisms. So, this is a very important result in the theory of abelian varieties. Okay, and the proof of this fact, of this rigidity theorem, crucially uses the properness of abelian varieties. It's an essential ingredient in the proof. And in fact, this result typically fails for affine group schemes. So, if you take a polynomial, k bracket x, with zero constant term, then that defines a more term, then that defines a morphism from GA to itself, which preserves identities. But most such polynomials aren't homomorphisms. So if you take x to the sixth, for example, that's not a homomorphism over any field. Okay. So let me talk about some motivation for why we might study unirational groups. So over a perfect field, every smooth connected unipotent group admits a filtration with successive quotients isomorphic to G. With successive quotients isomorphic to GA, right? So you have this u0 inside u1, et cetera, where each thing, each successive quotient is GA, and we say that u is split. Over imperfect fields, this fails completely. Okay, so here's an example. Let K be an imperfect field and A a non-pth power. Then you can consider this group defined by the equation y to the p is x plus ax to the p inside of ga times ga. times GA. That defines a one-dimensional smooth group because you're in characteristic P. And it becomes isomorphic to GA over K adjoint A to the 1 over P via the map sending X Y to Y minus A to the 1 over P times X. Okay, so it's a unipotent group and it's a form of GA, but it's actually not isomorphic to GA over K, because if you form the projectivization of this equation, so y to the P is XZ to the P minus 1 plus A. is xz to the p minus one plus ax to the p. You can show this is a regular curve, so it's the regular completion of your group v. But the point at infinity, right, you set z equal to zero, you get the point infinity is rational only over k adjoint a to the one over p, not over k. So ga, the regular compactification, is p1, and the point at infinity there is just a k-rational point. So as schemes, this is not isomorphic to ga, let alone as groups. Let alone as groups. Okay, so the group V is an example of a wound unipotent group. Okay, so we say that a smooth connected unipotent group is wound if it emits no non-trivial K-group homomorphisms from GA. And it's not obvious, but it's the case that this is actually equivalent to requiring that all maps from the affine line to U just be constant maps. Okay, so now here's the theorem of Austerlet. So, now here's the theorem of Austerley. So, this is about arithmetic aspects of algebraic groups. So, here's an arithmetic aspect. So, in his Tamagawa numbers paper from 1984, Austerley proved the following very nice theorem. So let K be a global function field and U a wound unipotent group over K with dimension less than P minus one. Okay, P is a characteristic. Then U of K is finite. So U has only finitely many rational points over K. Over k. The dimension bound in this theorem is sharp. So if you consider the group given by, you take the V restriction of gm from k to the 1 over p, because k is a global function field, that's a degree p extension. And you quotient, there's a copy of gm inside of there. You quotient by that copy of gm. Then this quotient is a wound unipotent group, and its dimension is p minus one. But it's a unirational group. But it's a unirational group because it's a quotient of this V restriction of Gm, which is an open subscheme of affine space to the P of AP. So it's K-rational points because it's unirational, the K-rational points are a risky dense in it. So it has lots of rational points, even though it's wound unipotent. So you really need this dimension less than P minus one condition in the Austerlet theorem. So Austerley, in his paper, formulates the following question, which he attributes to. Question, which he attributes to Sarah, I believe. And he says: if k is a global function field and you have a unipotent group with infinitely many rational points, must it contain a non-trivial unirational subgroup? Okay, so if you have a non-trivial unirational subgroup, that group gives you lots of rational points. And he says, well, is that the only way it can happen? Okay, so I won't answer that in this talk, but this was actually my motivation for studying the thing I'm about to talk about. Okay. Talk about. Okay. Okay. So before going on, let me just give some examples of unirational groups to show you that they're really out there. So any connected linear algebraic group over a perfect field is unirational. So for perfect fields, unirational groups are all over the place. Tori are unirational over any field. Perfect groups, so if G equals its derived group, then it's unirational. Reductive groups are always unirational. They're even generated. Groups are always unirational. They're even generated by tori. I say the same is true here. V restrictions of Gm are unirational. They're open subschemes of an affine space. And for a finite purely inseparable extension, K prime of K, the V restriction of Gm mod this copy of Gm inside of it, just as before, is a unirational round unipotent group. Okay. So the main result of this talk is the following theorem. Talk is the following theorem. So let G and H be locally finite-type group schemes over a field and assume that G is unirational and that H is solvable and doesn't contain a copy of GA inside of it. Okay, you need that assumption because there are lots of maps to GA. There are too many maps. Okay, so then any K-schemorphism from G to H, which preserves identities, is a homomorphism. Okay, so a priori, this map doesn't know anything. Okay, so a priori this map doesn't know anything about the group structures on GRH, but in fact it actually has to sort of know something about them. Okay, so you mentioned some corollaries here. Okay, so the first corollary, any solvable unirational k group not containing copy of G is commutative. So why is that? You apply the, just as with abelian varieties, you apply this rigidity statement to the inversion morphism. So it says inversion is a homomorphism, and therefore the group is. Therefore, the group is commutative. Okay, so in particular, since this is a solvable group scheme, noctane copy of GA, so just any unirational wound uniponent group is an example of that. So any unirational wound unipotent group is commutative. And of course, the assumption of unirationality is crucial here. So there are Ofragaber constructed examples of wound uniponent groups that are not commutative over any imperfect field. So you really need the unirationality assumption. So, you really need the unirationality assumption. And you also need the woundness assumption because there are, you know, there are split unipotent groups that are not commutative. The sort of standard upper triangular ones are not commutative. Okay. Another corollary, as with the BN varieties, a solvable unational group not containing copy of GA admits a unique group structure with a given identity. And that is, as with the BN varieties, you obtain that by applying this result to the identity morphism. Okay? And then the third. Okay, and then the third corollary, which I'll mention here, is: if you have a separable extension, then a solvable group is unirational over little k, if and only if it's unirational over this separable extension. So it's not actually obvious how that follows. I don't really have time to get into the details here, but somehow the key point is this is known for commutative groups, the theorem of Aket, I think. And so you can deduce it in general from that using the sort of commutativity result and corollary one. Commutativity result in corollary one. You need to do a little work. It's not immediate, but okay. And as I said, all these assumptions are really necessary. Sorry, can you show us the main theorem again? I think this is important. Sure, sure, yeah. Okay, so here, maybe I'll just read it out again, just in case. So let G and H be locally finite-type group schemes, and assume that G is unirational. That's essential. That's the point. H is solvable. That's actually all. Uh, H is solvable, that's actually also important, and doesn't contain a copy of GA, so all these assumptions you really need, then any case scheme morphism whatsoever from G to H, which respects identities, is actually a homomorphism. Okay, so a priori, it's just a map, but in fact, it's a homomorphism. Okay? Does it have to be over a field? Yeah, yeah, this is over a field. Yes, does it have to be over a field? Because you're assuming. Because your assumption is kind of locally local conditions, aren't they? So, sorry, the local condition what? So, your conditions seem to be local. Local. What do you mean it seems to be local? So, it's you're asking locally finite type? Yes. So, can it be over some curve or something? I mean, the theorem is over a field. I don't. I mean, the thing is, these things don't. Things don't there are there are issues over. I mean, these things don't behave well in families for various reasons. Like, it's actually, I'll just mention it later, but the fact that you're over imperfect fields makes this, this is not very interesting result over perfect fields. So, it doesn't. I think the question is why you say that g and h are locally finite type if you are over a field. Usually locally means that you have a base which is uh not a field and locally finite type just means it's it's I mean okay. Finite type just means it's, I mean, okay, it doesn't really matter for the result, but you could think finite type. I mean, the point is, it's a finite type group scheme, right? It's not some weird thing, it's some finite type thing over a field. That's all it is. Like it might have lots of components or something, I mean, or what I mean, finite type, it's just a finite type scheme, right? So it's locally given by spec of like K adjoint, finitely many variables, mod some quotient, mod some ideal. Some quotient, not some ideal. That's all I mean. A finite type, like, you know, it's, it's just, it's a finite type scheme, right, over a field. That's all I mean by finite type. Okay. Okay, so now over a perfect field, any solvable group is a semi-direct product of a torus with a unipotent group, and the unipotent group is split. And so the only And so the only solvable groups not containing a copy of GA over a perfect field are just tori, right? This unipotent group has to be trivial. And so in the case of perfect fields, the theorem just says that any morphism from a unirational group to a torus, which preserves identities, is a homomorphism. And in fact, in that case, where you're mapping into a torus, the assumption of unirationality can be dispensed with. So any morphism from a smooth connected group scheme to a torus, which preserves identities, is a homomorphism. Homomorphism. And, you know, how do you check this? Well, you can check it over the separable closure. So you can assume the torus is split. And so you can reduce the case T as G M. And so you want to say that if I have a smooth connected group scheme mapping to G M and the map preserves identities, then it's a homomorphism. And this is a consequence of the Rosenlich unit theorem. This is some theorem about units on products of varieties being products of units. At any rate, though, the upshot of this whole discussion really is just that the theorem is only Discussion really is just that the theorem is only really interesting over imperfect fields. Over perfect fields, it reduces to this unit, Rosenlich unit theorem. Okay. So now I'll maybe say a bit about the proof, although I probably won't be able to, well, we'll see how much I'm able to get into it. So you can assume K is separably closed. That has no impact on any of the assumptions. So you can extend scalars to separable closure. And the key case is when And the key case is when G is commutative and H is a commutative p-torsion wound unipotent group. That's the key case for the theorem. So I'll concentrate on that case. I mean, there's some devisage to get from that case to the general case. Okay, so we're going to begin with the study of commutative unirational groups. Okay, so here's a definition. So let x bar be a regular proper curve and Regular proper curve and D a finite subscheme, then the generalized Jacobian of the pair X bar D is the group scheme representing the following functors. So you have pairs L and phi, where L is a line bundle on X bar, and phi is a trivialization of that line bundle on D. Okay, so it's like the Picard scheme, except you also add this trivialization information. Okay, so you have a canonical map from this generalized Have a canonical map from this generalized Jacobian to the usual Jacobian, but just forgetting the trivialization. And the kernel of that map is basically just units on D, right? Trivializing O D. That means you just have a unit on D. So in that way, you get this map to the Jacobian, and the kernel is the V restriction of GM from D down to K. Okay, so at any rate, the point is it differs from the usual Jacobian by just some Vay restriction. Okay, Now, the utility of this generalized Jacobian in the study of group schemes comes from the following results. So you have, so with the usual Jacobian and usual smooth proper curves, you have, if you fix a point x in your curve, then you have an embedding from the, well, you have a map at least, which is an embedding for positive genus curves, right, from the curve to the Jacobian by sending a point y to the class of y minus the class of x. Of X. So here you have something similar. If you restrict to the smooth locus of X bar minus this divisor D, then you get a map from the smooth locus minus D to the Jacobian of X bar. And then you have this fundamental result from class field theory, which says that this is something like an Albanac, but instead of for abelian varieties, it's for general groups, okay? Commutative groups. So here's the theorem, which I think is due to Rosenlucht. Which I think is due to Rosenlucht and Ser. So, for any smooth curve with a regular compactification x-bar and any point, you can let d just be the complement of your curve inside the compactification. So given a commutative group scheme and a morphism from xx to g0, so a pointed morphism, so you have a morphism from x to g sending x to 0, there's a unique factorization of it through the generalized Jacobian, where you, so you have this as your map, you know, sending a point. This is your map, you know, sending a point y to the class of y minus the class of x, and then this phi is some homomorphism of k groups. Okay, so there's a unique phi such that this diagram commutes. Okay, so in other words, the upshot, if I have a map from a curve, it gives me a homomorphism from this generalized Jacobian to my commutative group. Okay? Okay, so now if G is a commutative unirational group, so if G is unirational, then that means G is So, if g is unirational, then that means g is generated by curves x, where x is an open subscheme of the affine of p1. Okay? And if I have an open subscheme of p1, what is the generalized Jacobian? So we go back to here. Well, it's an extension of the actual Jacobian of P1, which is just zero, because it's P1, by this. So the generalized Jacobian is just a Vay restriction of Gm. So that means that if your group is generated by open subschemes of P1, then actually it's generated. Then actually, it's generated by homomorphisms from the V restriction of Gm via this phi here, right? So that's just what I'm saying here. So there's a homomorphic surjection from a group of the form V restriction from A down to K of G M, where A is a finite K algebra. And so in proving the theorem, you're free to replace G by this thing that surjects onto it. So we can assume that our G is a V restriction of Gm. And using the fact that U is wound. And using the fact that u is wound, okay, so remember g, we want to show the map from g to our wound u is a homomorphism, okay. And using the fact u is wound, you can actually reduce the case in which a is even a product of fields, so it's reduced k algebra. Okay, so now here's a lemma. Let A be a finite product of finite field extensions of K, then the Vay restriction of Gm from A admits a, so it's a quotient of a group of the form this thing. So you take a product of V restriction. This thing. So you take a product of V restrictions from ki down to k, where each ki over k is a primitively generated extension, right? So for you know, finite extensions of imperfect fields don't have to be primitively generated. There's this famous example, right? If you take fp, adjoin x, y, and then you adjoin x to the 1 over p and y to the 1 over p. That's not generated by a single element. But this says that you can actually, you get a surjection from a product of various restrictions of fields which are primitively generated, generated. Which are primitively generated, generated by a single element. Okay, so we can assume g is of this form. Okay, it's a product of groups like this. Okay, so now we have the following theorem. So if I have a purely inseparable primitively generated extension, and u is a wound commutative p-torsian unipotent group, then any pointed morphism from the various friction of gm to u is a k-group homomorphism. Is a k-group homomorphism, and furthermore, we have the stronger result: the group of such homomorphisms is even finite. Okay, so we can deduce the general case for maps from products of such groups to maps from a single one from this theorem. So the finiteness is essential here. I don't have time to go into that reduction, but suffice to say, we reduced to proving this theorem two now. So we want to show that any morphism of various restriction GM to u. Any morphism of various restriction GMTU is a homomorphism, and that there are only finitely many such. So, this is just that reduction, which I won't talk about. Okay, so now we concentrate on proving theorem two. Okay, so you can replace U by the subgroup generated by the image of this map F, right? Because you just, you know, this lands inside wherever it lands, and you take the group it generates, and that's all that's really going on. You know, that's all that's relevant for this result. So, we can assume. So we can assume that U is generated by maps, not necessarily homomorphisms, but maps from the V restriction of Gm. And now it's a fact that this group, V restriction of Gm from K prime down to K, is generated by open subsets of P1, so curves inside P1, whose complements are just K prime rational points. Okay? And then from the geometric class field theory results that I mentioned earlier, so from this result here. So, from this result here, these curves, you get homomorphisms from their generalized Jacobians. And so, just as before, we get that u is actually a quotient of groups of, well, it's a quotient of this group. So a V restriction of gm from k prime, the same k prime, to the n, so some power of this v restriction. So u is, we can assume u is actually a quotient of this thing. Okay. So now we define. So now we define two groups which together play a crucial role in the proof of theorem 2. So let lambda be a non-pth power. So we consider these two groups. The first is, this is a totally non-smooth group. So it's the group defined by just sum of lambda to the i xi to the p is zero inside of ga to the p. So this is a p minus one dimensional, totally non-smooth group. And the other group is this wound. And the other group is this wound unipotent group obtained by, as before, you take the V restriction of gm from k adjoint lambda to the one over p, and then you quotient by the gm inside of it. Okay, so these are, so this one is smooth, this one is not smooth. And they're both of dimension p minus one. So the key to proving theorem two is the following result. So this result allows you to prove the theorem by induction on u, dimension induction. Induction on u, dimension induction. So let u be a non-trivial wound commutative p-torsion unipotent group that is a quotient of this group. So this assumption that it's a quotient of this group is very important. So you take k adjoins some p power root of lambda. You know, you restrict gm and you take a power of that. So in that case, there's an exact sequence like this with u double prime wound, okay, and u prime is one of two groups. It's either the group Is one of two groups. It's either the group V lambda, this non-smooth thing, or it's the group U1 lambda, this V restriction thing. Okay, so it says that sort of every group of this form is built in a simple way in some sense, right? You have this quotient which is wound, so you can apply dimension induction to know the theorem for u double prime, and you have this thing which is v lambda or u1 lambda. Okay, right. So the Right, so the point. Well, I won't go into the details here probably because I don't have time, but this devisage result allows you to basically almost reduce to the case of when your group U is one of these two groups, which is sort of easy to handle each one individually. And so let me just explain the proof. Okay, so now I'll briefly. So now I'll briefly talk about the proof of this Devisage result. So the first step is to show U must contain one of these two groups, V lambda or U1 lambda. Okay, so what we do is we consider for any positive integer n this group, Un lambda. So what is that? You take the V restriction of Gm from K joint lambda to the one over P to the n, and you quotient by the V restriction from this subfield, K joint lambda to the one over P to the n minus one. Okay? Okay, and let n be the minimal positive integer such that there's a non-zero homomorphism from u n lambda to u. So there is such a homomorphism basically because u is a quotient of a V restriction of gm from one of these groups on top. So there is some non-zero homomorphism, and we let n be the minimal positive one such that you can get such a non-zero homomorphism. So the key point is for n bigger than one, there's an 1, there's an exact sequence. These groups are related to one another. So u n lambda maps to u n minus 1 lambda, trajectively, with kernel a power of v lambda, this totally non-smooth group. And so the point is if n is bigger than 1, this minimal thing is bigger than 1, then the minimality of n means that this map from u n lambda can't factor through this quotient. So one of these v lambdas has to map non-trivially to u. Okay, so there's a non-zero morphism from v lambda. There's a non-zero homomorphism from V lambda. And if n is one, well, then you have a non-zero homomorphism from u1 lambda, just that's by assumption. So we have a non-zero homomorphism, at least from one of these groups, and we want to get an inclusion. So now we use the following lemma. Any quotient of one of these two groups by a non-zero subgroup is just a power of ga. Okay? So if you have, so now the woundness of u tells you that if you've an that if you have a non-zero homomorphism for one of these, it actually is an inclusion, because otherwise you would. Inclusion because otherwise it would contain a copy of GA. Okay, and so now you have a copy of V lambda U1 lambda and you need to show, so I'll skip this for a second, you need to, well, let me go back here, we need to show the quotient by such a subgroup is wound. So I don't really have time to go into it, but the idea here is you use the fact that u is a wound quotient of this group, okay? This group, okay, for some n, and you know, you complete lambda to a p basis for k. And the point, the important point is u remains wound over this extension where you just get rid of all the other p basis stuff. So all other stuff in this p-basis, you just make into arbitrarily high pth powers. You join all their p-power roots. And so what you do then is you've constructed you've constructed a larger extension which has degree. A larger extension which has degree of imperfection one. It is a p-base of size one, over which u is still wound. And the fact that u is still wound is crucial because it means using the fact that u is still wound, you're basically able to do, so here's the key lemma that allows you to finish. Let K be a field of degree of imperfection one. Then any extension of GA by one of these groups, V lambda or U1 lambda, contains a copy of GA. Okay? So because U is still wound over this larger group, So, because u is still wound over this larger group, it follows that you can't quotient by something like this and get a copy of ga, because otherwise u itself would have a copy of ga, which it can't. Okay, so that was kind of rushed, but I think that's all I want to say. Is there any question? If there are no questions let's thank our speaker again thank him first time so the next talk will be at 1225.
