Okay, okay. Well, thank you very much, Mario. Thank you, the organizers, for the opportunity talking here. So I'm going to talk about branch coverings, not universality, and contact manifolds. Well, the first thing that I need to recall is the definition. Recall is the definition of branch coding. Probably all of you already know it, but it's just a quick refresh of your memory, just in case you have. Look at it. Well, it's because most people just work with cyclic branch covering, so I need to refresh the memory that we can include coverings that are irregular. So a branch covering for us is going to be just a covering after. A covering after removing a link from the base space, you get a covering map. That's basically going to be. That's a branch covering. Okay. So probably one of the most impressive results about branch coverings was due to Hildeno Sano Montesinos in the 80s. It was proved also by Thurston in 1982. And it says that there And it says that there exists a knot in S3, such as that every three-dimensional manifold can be obtained as a branch covering of S3 branches along the knot K. So that means that there is a knot that after taking branch coverings along that knot, you can get all possible three manifolds. Here I mean compact orientable three-dimensional manifolds, closed compact orientable. Close compactory intervals, three-dimensional manifolds. Well, they prove that there exists a nod that is universal, and they call it like that universal link. And they prove that after they prove this theorem, a lot of families of knowledge have been shown that are universal. And for instance, this is a very impressive result as well, that every rational Every rational herbolic knot is universal. This is proved by them as well, Hildeno San Monti Simmons in 1985. For instance, they prove that the Figure 8 node is universal. So being this one, the smallest universal note that exists, right? The threefold node is not universal. So that's the story. So that's the story. And very recently, Royer Kalshas and John Adnaier prove a similar result in the context of contact structures. So they prove that there exists a link that is transferred to the standard contact structures of S3. That you can, by taking branch coordinates along that transfer link, you can construct every contact manifold in this case, not just topological manifold, but contact manifolds. And this is the link that they show that is universal. So, well, this link like they name it as transverse universal. I don't actually like the name, but I would rather be something like contact universal, something because it's in the world contact manifolds. But okay, anyway, it is transfer universal because that's. Anyway, it is transferred universal because the link is transferred to the contact structure. So one of the questions after they show this is, well, are there any transverse universal nots in the sense that it is a connected link, a link with just one component, right? Because they show that this link of three components is universal. Well, the question is: is there a connected? There is a connected link, a knot that is universal? Well, at first, we can try to look at the Figure 8 not, but the Figure 8 not turns out not to be universal in the contact sense. This NAS transverse universal, this is a result that was proven by Meridi Casey. It is a student from Erner. She proved it on her PhD. She proved it on her PhD thesis. So that means that universality of knots or universality in the world of contact manifolds is not the same as the universality in the topological sense. But you have in the opposite direction, you have that something is universal in the context sense, it's going to be universal in the topological sense. So, well, the answer to this question is yes, there are not. Is yes, there are not that are universal in the transverse universal, and this is the result that I want to talk to you about today. This is just the idea of the proof of how we prove it. And so for the proof, I need to review a pair of concepts, well, three concepts, what a contact manifold is, what a transverse link is, and what a link. links is and what a branch cover what is the relation between branch coverings and contact manifolds uh so we can uh understand the the the the theorem and the and the results so i'm going to just go over that really fast uh so what is a contact manifold well basically it is just a differential manifold with a with a contact structure a contact structure is just a plane distribution nowhere integrable um and That basically means that locally the plane distribution looks like this. It is twisted on the x-axis and is parallel to the y and z-axis. This is happening locally on every contact manifold. For the geometers, they like to define contact manifolds as the kernel of a one form such that the one form satisfies this condition, right? Condition, right? The one form which the stereotypical of the one form is not zero anywhere. But we are not making use of this. We are going to work with contact manifolds in a different way. So that's the definition of quantum manifolds. And for a transfer link, it's just a link that is transferred to those planes. There is not much to say about it. So that means that they are not tangent to the planes. Planes. And so that's a transfer links. And they are defined under contact isotopy or transfer isotopy. This you can move your, you can, two links, two transfer links are equivalent if you can find an isotopy from one to the other one going through only two transverse links. Well, yes, that's a transverse link. And now the relation between branch coordinates and contact manifolds. So let's start with a link. So let's start with a link, a transverse link here, a transverse link, and a contact manifold. So and represents a three-dimensional manifold. And I don't know how this is called psi. Psi. I don't know the Greek letter. I believe it is. So this letter represents the contact structure. So the plane distribution of the tree manifold. So we start with this. So, we start with these ingredients and then we take a branch covering of N, branch it along the link L. So just by considering the topological sense of branch coverings, you get a three-dimensional manifold up there, differentiable three-dimensional manifold. And so, what you need to do now is, well, try to put this manifold, try to find a contact structure to this manifold. Structure to this manifold. And the natural way of doing it is just to pull back the contact planes down here upstairs. And you are using that phi is locally diffeomorphic outside of the branching set. And so you just pull it back there. But in order to pull it next to the branching set, that's the moment where you make use of the fact that L is transverse to the plane. So you can perture things and you can define this. Things and you can define this contact this pooling properly. I don't want to get into details about these constructions, but this is something that was first introduced by Jesus Gonzalez, I think in the 80s as well. I don't quite remember. So, and this construction is very well defined. That's the important thing that once you have a branch cover in a contact structure downstairs, you can pull it back, pull it up. Stairs, you can pull it back, pull it up there. And that's the thing. So you can talk properly about contact transcovering maps. That's the way that you do it. So for the thing about universality that we care about, we are going to consider S3 downstairs and something that is called the contact standard structure, which is a very special contact structure. Very special contact structure. I'm not going to define it, but we're going to talk about more about, we're going to talk a little bit more about this contact structure later. But the thing is that you're going to use a very specific contact structure and a transverse link. And the thing that this link is universal refers to the fact that if you take any possible branch covering here, you're going to construct up here all the possible contact manifolds. So all the possible three-dimensional manifolds with all the possible contact structures that you can put. Contact structures that you can put to them. That's basically the meaning of universal, transverse universal. So those are the concepts. Now let's go to the basic ideas or the proof of the existence of universal transfer links. Not, sorry. So we're going to start with any contact manifold. And we already know that this contact manifold is. Is it can be seen as the covering space branching along a knot L, a link L, that is the one that Ed Nayer and Castle found. And then we're going to compose this branch covering with a different branch scoring between two standard contact spheres, but branched along a not K. And we're going to need that the k and we're going to need that the pre-image of l is contained l is contained on the pre-image of this not k so this way by composing the these two functions what are you what are we getting is that every three-dimensional contact manifold is branched covered in the length the not k so that will that will give us a knot k that is universal that's the way that we are going to find the existence of this knot by constructing this branch covering so In this branch covering, so we already know L, so we need to find this function here, uh, this branch covering. Well, it sounds like we have to go through a lot of possibilities to be able to find this thing. And so, and so we did. Um, so, but the first thing that we have to do is to find ways to construct these functions. How do we construct Uh, contact branch coverings from the standard contact sphere to the standard contact sphere. How do we do that? That's the first problem. Uh, and for doing so, we are going to use this theorem because we want to work with something that we already know. This is a theorem of Storsten and Winkenkempel and Giroux. And that theorem says that we Says that we can, there is a one-to-one identification between contact structures in a three-dimensional manifold, a model isotopy. There is a one-to-one correspondence between this set and the open books decompositions of a manifold and model this operation that is called stabilization, positive stabilization. So, and the corresponding. So, and the correspondence between these two families is something that is called compatibility. So, if you have a context structure, you can find an open book decomposition that is compatible with it. And any other compatible open book decomposition that you got from that context structure are going to be positive, are going to be equivalent under positive stabilization. So, you can get from one to the other doing stabilizations. To the other, doing stabilizations. Well, and something similar in the other way around, right? If you have an open-booted composition, you have many contact structures that are compatible with it, but all of them are going to be contact isotopic. So, with this theorem, for me, what this theorem means is that I can, instead of working in the world of contact manifolds, means that I can work with open books. So, instead of working just with this very geometrical concept, I can just work with this. Geometrical concept, they can just work with this more combinatorial object that is open books that are the open book decomposition of three-dimensional manifold. And so, the first thing that I have to do is to translate the problem of contact manifolds to open book decompositions. So, in branch scoring, so for example, we have here the standard contact structure. We already know that this is compatible with the standard open book decomposition of S3. The standard open book decomposition of S3 is just an open book where the binding is that trivial knot and the pages are just this vibration of the trivial knot. So this is this open book, it is known that it's compatible with the standard contact of S3. And well, we also have a transfer link in the triosphere. So in order to So, in order to work with transverse links, we just can work with braids instead. And this is thanks to a theorem of Orekkov and Chef Shinshin from 2003, that there is a similar theorem to the Markov's theorem that you can just transform transverse knots to braid knots to the closure of braids. Well, anyway, we can just instead of Anyway, we can just instead of working with any transfer link, we are going to work with the braid transfer to the pages of this open decomposition. And then let's take a branch covering of this space, phi. So that means that we can take a branch covering in the other side, branching along the braid. But when you take a branch covering of a braid, a braid like this, so the pages, sorry for my drawing. So if the pages are disks, so you have a disk here. So you have a set of branching points. So you can restrict phi to this, the pre image of this disk is going to be another surface. And you can do the same for every page. And all the surface that you're, and all the surface that you're going to get are going to be isomorphic. So this is going to give you another open book decomposition of the manifold absolute. Open book decomposition of the manifold upstairs. So just by lifting every disk to the upper space, you're going to get an open book decomposition of the upper manifold. So taking a branch covering here in the left side, you get a contact manifold. Taking a branch covering in a braid in the standard open book decomposition gives you an open book in the upper space. So, and the good thing. So, and the good thing is that these two things are compatible as well. So, that means that we can just stay in the world of open book decomposition instead of working with contact manifolds. And if we manage to get here something, we manage to get as the standard open book decomposition, that would mean that here in the left side, we have the standard contact sphere. Have the standard contact sphere. So that's the way that we are going to construct branch coverings between the standard contact sphere to the standard contact sphere. Just by constructing branch coverings from the standard open books to the standard open book. That's the way that's the that we are that's the thing that we're going to do. Okay, so well, how much time do we have? Okay, so let's continue. So let's continue. So let's recap. We are going to just change our problem to work with branch covenants from S3 to S3, branches along breaks. That's what we're doing. And we are going to need that this branch covering is not only branched along breaks, but the pre-images of the pages of the open book, the composition where L is just transversed to, it is also a disk for every disk, right? Disk, right? And so this is the kind of object that we need to construct. And to do it so, let's start with a very small example. Let's take this example here. We have a disk with two branch points. We cut along this disk along the arc, along the red arc, and along the green arc. And then you take three copies of this. Take three copies of this and you glue them according to this pattern. So just take copy one and you just glue the green part of the copy one with the green part of the copy two and so on. And so and phi is then the quotient map of this copy of the copy of A is going onto A. So this turns out to be a branch covering. A branch covering, but it's not a three-dimensional branch covering. It's a two-dimensional branch covering. A two-dimensional branch covering this branch along two points only. This is branching along these two points. Sorry, true early. It's orange along two points. And the pretty much of the branching points are these four points here. Okay, so this is the one that we're going to use as pages, as the branching map of the pages that we're looking for. So what we do is just take that, cross the interval. Cross the interval, if we take a cross interval, and that gives us a three-dimensional branch scoring map. The branching set now is just two strands, and the pretty much of those two strands is four strands. But this is a branch coding between a ball and a ball. So if we want to construct something more interesting, we need to start gluing stuff, right? So we are going to glue the upper disk with the bottom disk with identity map right now. identity map right now so that will give us basically uh a a covering map between a torus and a torus we can we can we can just complete this mapping with another torus uh just we just glue a torus here we take the meridian and glue it to to these vertical lines and we just do the same in the other side a torus we take the meridian and glue it to the uh the vertical lines the uh the vertical lines so by doing this so we we are we are getting uh uh an open book decomposition and we are getting s3 again and so the final the fine the final result is just a branch covering between s3 and s3 and is branching along the trivial uh two component link um here here is the um here is the Here is the sorry. No, sorry. I went to the other slides. So here is the binding, and here are the pages. So here is the on each of these lines, we have a three-to-one branch coordinate branching along of the two points. This is what I, but you can try to see the picture from there. From there. So, but this is not enough to construct enough branch coverings. But we can modificate, we can change a little bit this construction, but instead of gluing with the identity map, we can try to find another map that fits into the quotient here. So I need to do the top disk with the bottom disk with another map. But in order to this thing to be able In order to this thing to be able to define a branch covering between solid torus and a solid torus, I need a map that I choose here to commute with the original branch covering at this top level and at the bottom level. So I need to find functions, two functions that permute like this to be able to construct a different branch covering. And well, it is a pretty high. Um, uh, how you say famous map that if you take the arc twist, the half arc twist, half arc twist, so you just take this twist to the third is this the this this line here, the vertical line is going to be mapped to this curve here that is twisting around like that. And the the arc in the middle is going to map to this arc, and it's just going to switch the orientation because it's taking because it's taken it's taking it is being rotated like 180 times three times 100 degrees sorry it's rotating three three halves times that is one time and a half um so it and and well this is this is the map that i'm going to use and it turns out that it lifts to the other side and it lifts to just one twist along the long arc here just and And here I just draw the upper image of the vertical line here, and I are these three lines, and I draw the image of these three lines under the R twist. So here is an R twist to the third, and here I got just one R twist along the line that is passing through the four points. So this is the commute. We have this commutation, and using this. Have this commutation, and using these two functions to modify our construction, what we got now is a branch covering from S3 to S3, but now it's branching along something more interesting, the threefold knot. And in the pre-image, I got a two-component link. So I just use the same branch covering, but a different pair of functions to construct this. To construct this branch covering. At the end, these are the two main ingredients that I need to construct different branch coverings. I need a branch covering between a disk and a disk, and a pair of functions, f and another function that commutes with it, or the lifting. We can think of the other function, the other function in the upper space as the lifting of f, right? So at the end, we can just think about two ingredients of the branch. Of the branch covering between disks and a function that commute with that branch covering and that lifts. That's what I need to construct branch coverings, construct this function bar phi or phi, I don't know. So in that way, I'm constructing a lot of these objects. So now I have a bunch of objects that I can use. We can just work with these objects and try to find one that in the left side. Find one that in the left side, there is the link L, and in the right side, it is branched along a knot. That's what I'm trying to do. So, to give you an example of the type of constructions, I don't have that much time to go over this example, but this is a better example. Maybe I use graphs. I use graphs to describe these branch coverings. So, for example, these graphs can be used to describe a branch. Graphs can be used to describe a branch curve between disks. This is branching along four points: one, two, three, four branching points. And this is a graph with weights. Each weight represents one of the branching points. So we have one, two, three, four on each edge. That represents one, two, three, four branching points. And each point, each vertex of the graph represents one copy of the disk. So just by using this graph, it is giving me Me a branch covering between a disk and a disk. Just by using graph, I can construct many different kinds of branch covering maps. And for example, here, I can start using arcs, for example, this red arc to take a arc twist along this arc. And the pretty much of this arc are this set of arcs. If I want to understand, if I want to take a arc twist along the green arc. The green arc is going to lift as arc twist along the small arcs, but it's going to lift to, I need to take the arc twist to the third again. And it's going to lift to one arc twist along the long arc. This is a similar phenomenon to the one that happened in the previous example: that the third power of the arc twist along the ring arc is going to leave. Along the green arc is going to lift to just one arc twist along the green arc, and in the single arcs, it's going to lift to just to the third power. And well, that's the way that this lifting works. I don't know if someone has a question about it. And I can take the red one is a similar phenomenon happened to the third also lift, and the blue ones lift to the third as well. And so just by checking powers to the third. Just by tweaking powers to the third downstairs, I can construct a bunch of links, a bunch of a bunch of braids. And upstairs, I'm going to get a very messy braid, right? Because I'm going to, a lot of twisting is going on. But if I take a look at just those four points and everything that is connect, the things that are connected to those four points are just these three arcs. So if I take the power to the turtle, the blue arc downstairs, it's going to leave. Blue arc downstairs is going to live to just one arc twist along the blue arc here. And so that means that I can use these three arcs to construct all the possible four braids using because these three arcs, the twisting around these three arcs generate the whole four braid group. So I can construct that. But well, this is an example of the power that this machinery has. But I have still the problem that if by doing this construction with that, By doing this construction with that, with just this construction, I can only get four every fourth braid upstairs. But downstairs, if the upper brake has four components, sorry, three components or two components, downstairs is going to have the same number of components. Because I don't have time. Okay, so this is the theorem, the final theorem that I got using this construction. I have to work a little bit more to be able to construct the final theorem, but this is the final theorem. Theorem, but this is the final theorem that giving any braid, I can find this phi and these two pair of functions that can give me the that is branching along a knot. And I can find any braid, any closed braid that you want, which means that there exists a transverse knot. And in fact, this also can show that there are infinite number of universal knots. Universal knots or universal braids. Sorry, universal links. Well, thank you. Okay. Are there any questions? No questions. So any other Any other example of L of a link L, universal link L? Well, I can, for example, if you know that if you have the brave form of your universal transfer link, and you know that it has, for example, four strands. And then you can use this construction, this exact diagram to construct the braid form. And downstairs, you're going to get the same braid form. You're going to get the same braid form, but with triple number of crossings, three times the number of crossings. And that is going to be another more complicated universal link. Yeah. But probably that's not the best way to get more and better universal rates, but just a way of way of getting more. But if you had to, you could. But if you had to, you could go through this construction, take that template or whatever, and actually construct a link, right? If I said, draw me a link, you could actually do it, right? I can actually do it. Yes, I can just reduce the number of components as well. Yeah, so I could, instead of four components, I can have three, two, one, the number of, yeah, I can reduce it. Yeah. Yeah, but for that, I had to use some more complicated graph like that one. But you say that the note, the February A note, is not contact universal. It's not contact universal. Well above any other rational note. I don't know. But the figure A naught is universal topologically? Yeah, it is universal. Yeah, it's topological universal, yeah. But not in the contact sense. That sense not transferred to universal. Yeah, it would be a good idea to try to see if there is one rational nod. If there is a transverse universal nod that is rational, yeah. It would be nice to see that's possible. That's possible. Okay, if there is no more questions, then we think again to resus. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mark, for the opportunity. So the next talk will be tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock in Bohaca, Stein.
