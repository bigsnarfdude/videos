Welcome back to day two of the conference. So, for the first talk, we'll have Kenneth Baker, and he's going to tell us about handle numbers of knots in three manifolds. All right. Well, thank you. Thank you all very much for giving me the opportunity to speak and to share with you some of these things that I've been talking about, thinking about. I guess I should start off by sharing. I guess I should start off by sharing my screen here, other than having you look at my big head. Right. There. I reckon that works well. Yeah. Okay. Great. So yeah, a lot more to do than I probably have time for. Let me just start off giving an overview of kind of the game plan here. Because I want to. Is I want to talk about, well, introduce the idea of handle numbers and connect this up with circular Hagard splittings and so forth. And then we'll kind of address some issues about actually incompressibility of surfaces, which will lead us into talking about Kakamitsu complexes. And then hopefully, well, I'll maybe have to cut off some stuff in the middle if I need to, but in the end, it shows some interesting examples and kind of in a toy model. Kind of in a toy model way or in an analogy that allows us to kind of easily kind of see some interesting phenomena. So, and maybe before doing all this, I thought maybe it's worth just giving a quick example of just the basic idea of a handle number and what's going on. So, right here, I have a knot in the three-sphere. It's like five-crossing knot. I guess it's five, two, and I've drawn its genus one. Uh, and I've drawn its genus one cycle circus, and um, I can kind of thicken that thing up and think about the complementary sutured manifold. And um, and in doing that here, now I've kind of thickened that up, I've now actually added in the in the exterior of that thickened up surface, I've then kind of added a tunnel, a handle. And you can see it's kind of yellow cochort disc over here, and then I'd Over here. And then I drew kind of the boundary of a disk to the other side of that surface. And so if I was to actually kind of think about the disk, I didn't shade it in because it starts to get too muddy, but I can think of having that other disk there. So I've kind of attached that handle with the yellow cool core, and now I'm going to kind of compress it back down with that beginnings of that purple disc. And if I compress that back down, I get this kind of fat thing. I get this kind of fat thing, which maybe you think can look at as being a thickened offband, which should maybe then tell you that I can actually then through the exterior of what I see there, go ahead and isotop the green over to the pink, right? And so then I can see that I can actually kind of, I've kind of swept all the way through, starting with this green surface surface here. I kind of push it up out till I am. Push it up out till I and then make a connection where I add that handle and then afterwards I'm going to compress that back down until I'm over here and then I can sweep it all now that I'm in the situation I can sweep it all the way around back onto the pink and so I've kind of swept a full circle worth surfaces although I had kind of two singularities happening where I had this yellow handle attachment and then this purple compression. Compression. And that basically was sweeping out of the circular Hagert splitting of circle-valued Morse function. And also tells me that, well, to do that entire circle, I've had a I had two handles. I had a one handle. And then I also had a two handle. And so I would say maybe the handle number of this knot is two. If it was the handle was zero, if I didn't need to use any handles, then I would have had a fibered knot. To use any handles, then I would have had a fibered knot, but we know the five-two knot is not five, and so that's that's the that's the quick and dirty of handle number, and maybe the kind of prime non-trivial example. So what I'm so I'm going to try to set a more general setting for talking about all this. And this is going to be talking about just handle numbers of three manifolds. Just handle numbers of three manifolds. So, here all my three manifolds are going to be compact, oriented, connected until they're not connected, until we chop them up, I guess. But we're starting with these three manifolds and we'll end up needing to put some sutured structure on them as well. And this is basically riffing on or kind of extending what Goda had done for knots. And he had a lot of papers. And he had a lot of papers talking about the handle numbers of knots and handled numbers of ciphered surfaces for knots. And so, this is maybe in some sense an extension of what he's done. And he's got a lot of great foundations here and a lot of interesting examples, more than I have time to talk about. And I think a starting spot to think about is if, well, if I look at this manifold and the second homology, rel boundary, well, point you do. Well, point quarter duality says, well, that's isomorphic to the first cohomology. And then, well, that's actually then also there's this equivalence with the set of the homotopy classes of maps of the manifold to the circle. And so, in that sense, we can think of a second homology class, well-boundary, as kind of telling us a collection of, you know, telling us a homotopy class of maps to the circle. Class of maps to the circle. And within that homotopy class of maps to the circle, we can talk about circle-valued Morse functions or representatives of that homotopy class that are circle-valued Morse functions. One peculiarity with that is needing to reckon with the behavior of these circle-valued Morse functions on the boundary of M. Goda, when he's dealing with knots or when maybe people are talking about Morse-Novikov numbers and looking at circle-valued. Numbers and looking at circle-valued Morse functions on knots, they kind of assume things are kind of nice and following this kind of nice S1 cross S1 structure on the boundary torus. But if the boundary of your manifold is not a torus, you have to kind of handle this in different ways. And one way to deal with that is to go ahead and insist that you have a sutured manifold structure. I'm not going to give a lot of details about sutured manifolds, and I'm still. And then so, but just quickly, we can, in this context, I think it's good to think of it as a combordism, or just some sort of comboism between two surfaces, like an R minus and R plus. And these surfaces don't have to be connected. And in fact, I want them to be able to possibly have boundary. And then their boundary is going to end up sweeping out some, through this comboism, their boundary is going to sweep out these vertical annuli. Vertical annuli. And maybe for dealing with like not exteriors, you might also kind of want to think about having some tori considered among the vertical pieces of parts that are not, you know, the beginning or the end of the borders. Well, so with that said, I want to say implicitly underneath here that we're fixing a sutured manifold structure on our manifold. And so I might start dropping this. Um, and so I might start dropping this gamma here that that designates the super sutured manifold structure, but it's kind of understood to be in the background. And if you want to forget about it, just think of kind of the case of a here, this core example of a knot in S3, where the manifold is the knot exterior, the complement of a tubular neighborhood. And in fact, we're just letting the boundary of the neighborhood of the knot be our, you know, these tori. One other thing we're going to need to do in order to kind of actually get a circle-valued Morse function that's going to work well for our purposes is we need some sort of kind of regularity, which in some sense is like a linking condition, like a non-zero linking condition. But I'm going to ask that we have a You know, we have a sutured manifold that our surface, we have a surface R representing that homology class is a sutured manifold decomposing surface, and where that when you decomposed along using that surface, you end up with no more toroidal sutures. And the reason for that is going to become maybe a bit more apparent later on. And I'm also going to call, in addition, In addition to the homology class being regular, I'll go ahead and say that such a decomposing surface representing that class is regular. And so when we're looking at our basic round example of not exteriors, you can just take R to be a seiphot surface, and then this homology class is just the generator of the second homology boundary. And then the circle valued, you know, the map. You know, the maps to the circle is just kind of going around the meridian of the knot. So, this allows us to start talking about handle number. So, I'm going to have this handle number of my sutured manifold with respect to this regular homology class, Z. And well, I'm just going to define it to be the minimum of the handle number of these regular surfaces R, where R represents Z. Where R represents Z. So, in other words, if I'm talking about the handle number of a knot, it's going to be just the minimum of the handle numbers of its ciphered surfaces. So, you can look at any ciphered surface for your knot and get a handle number, and we'll see here in a second. And we'll just minimize over all that. And so, what's the idea here? Well, given Given Z, given our class Z or the surface R, I can kind of chop it open because it's representing a non-trivial, a non-zero class. And I'm going to look at these, the circle value Morse function f. I'm going to ask that, I'm just going to arrange it so that all of my index one critical points coming around as I go around from f or go around from R, that all of these. That all of these that as we move around the circle, going from the regular value of R, that we're going to have all our index one critical points first, and then we're going to have all of our index two. And we can assume that we've kind of gotten rid or in our classes of circle-valued Morse functions, we've gotten rid of the index zero and index three. Be index zero and index three. We can always annihilate those. And so we can start off with a circle-valued Morse function that has this kind of structure, starting with our surface R. And between the ones and twos, then we're going to have some other regular value that I've shown in blue here. And the pre-image of that is going to be a surface. And it's going to, and together, R and S are determining what we call a circular Hagar. What we call a circular Hagard splitting for this manifold. Where we have this sutured structure, we're actually really thinking down here where we've cut open and that we've actually got M cut along R. So this is the sutured manifold decomposition that we have here. I'm not really showing that, but for those who are familiar with sutured manifolds, you go ahead and do your sutured manifold decomposition along R. Sutured manifold decomposition along R because it's a decomposing surface, and now we have this sutured manifold without toroidal sutures, and we can ask for a Hagard surface of that thing, right? And then this is effectively the same thing. And once we have this, we could just kind of re-glue along R to get back to our original space. And this Hagard surface is. Hagard surface is decomposing the cut open sutured manifold into two compression bodies. And I've called them Y and P for yellow and purple. And here's just kind of an example of the kind of things for like the yellow compression body. In general, you know, we're starting with R being possibly a disconnected surface. Maybe it has a closed component. Maybe a component has boundary. And then so we. And then, so we thicken R, we have R cross an interval, and then we're attaching various one handles. Maybe we have some zero handles we're attaching as well. You know, that's in general possible. So, this is a kind of a general picture of a compression body with a vertical boundary. Also, we don't necessarily require compression bodies to be connected. That's not so necessary there anyway. Not so necessary there anyway. And so then given the surface R, we can look at these kinds of, we have all sorts of different ways of getting these circle-valued Morse functions of this sort, which are going to give us a variety of different Hagard surfaces S's for the same R. And so we can look at all of the circle value of the circle. All of the circular Hagard splittings for M that use this surface R and kind of over all of the different Hagard surfaces S. And I can just ask for the minimum of the handle numbers of these compression bodies, the two compression bodies that this gives us. And well, what are the handle numbers of the compression bodies? Well, they're the minimum number of handles needed. In fact, In fact, we don't need any zero handles or three handles if these things aren't handle bodies. And if we've got a non-zero class, probably we don't even need, we're never going to have handle bodies. You might notice that this, if you did allow this class to be zero, well, maybe you're not exactly going to have your decomposing surface could be empty, for instance. Empty, for instance, as long as you don't have any autoidal sutures to begin with, and so you just start off with some sort of, I don't know, linear Hagard splitting, as we see here, versus a circular Hagard splitting. So in this kind of cascading definitions of constantly rolling it back, I mean, this is how we define the handle number of a sutured manifold with respect to a homology class. A homology class, or more focusedly, the handle number of the knot in S3. And so it's a massive minimization over all of these decompositions. Gota took this perspective with knots and showed that, in fact, this was equal, this kind of Held number calculation was equal to the Moore Snow column. To the Morse-Novikov number. And the Morse-Novikov number is just counting the minimum number of critical points among circle-valued Morse functions that are nice on the boundary of the knot. A little disclaimer, Goethe would have said two times the handle number of k because in this sense, h of p and h of y are going to both be the same number, but we'll find it more convenient to actually allow things more general and define our handle number not slightly. And define our handle number slightly differently than he does. For the exact same way that he does it, we could also talk about the Morrison-Ovikov number of the sutured manifold with respect to the homology class Z, and exactly the same way that he's giving us a Hamlet number. So, you know, there's this entire perspective of just really focusing on the circle-valued Morse functions and counting critical points. And counting critical points. But it seems like, at least from my perspective, changing critical points of Morse functions to handles gives us some extra kind of flexibility that we can be kind of a little bit more topologist. So I want to just give a few kind of basic facts about handle numbers. About handle numbers. So, this handle number is all is going to be zero only when we have some regular surface R, so that when you decompose along R, you get a product. So, translated into the setting of knots, the handle number is zero if and only if we have a fibrous knot. And then, some relations to other invariants. Patydanov showed that, in fact, the handle number, or he actually said more snow. Or he actually said more Snovikov number of a knot is bounded by twice the tunnel number. And I guess back in 2019, 2020, I showed that the handle number was actually additive under connected sums and unchanged by cabling. I won't have time to get into those proofs, but those are some kind of curious behaviors, I think, of this handle number. Of this handle number, just even when you just focus on knots. And you can see kind of develop analogies of these two results for the more general handle number of a sutured manifold. Furthermore, in some work with Fabiola, we actually can examine, I invite y'all to go ahead and look at that paper. That you can fixing the sutured structure, you can actually. The sutured structure, you can actually look at how the handle number behaves as a function of the homology class, and you can even extend it to being kind of get some natural extension to talking about real coefficients for that homology class. And it hasn't, well, I haven't understood it very well yet, but some interesting correspondence or connections with like the Thurston norm, which I guess we'll. Which I guess we'll come back and see a little bit about. So, those are just advertisements there. And I believe when Fabiola speaks later in the week, she'll tell us probably talking about some other developments. When we're looking at circle-valued Morse functions, there wasn't any need to put all of our index ones before the index twos. Index ones before the index twos. And we also didn't have to get rid of our index zeros or index threes. And what that allows us to do is if we kind of accumulate all our index zeros and ones together, group them together, zeros and ones, zeros and ones, and zeros and ones. And then we have only twos and threes here. Of course, we can always annihilate these threes and zeros and threes. We can start. We can start to sweep out as we go around the circle. We can start getting a kind of a sequence, a circular kind of sequence of compression bodies. And so this is giving us what we would call a generalized circular Hagar splitting, or I might just say generalized Hagart splitting to encompass it all. Generalized Hagar splittings, especially in the linear sense, has been well studied by. Linear sense has been well studied by Charlemagne Thompson, Saito, Charlemagne Chultons, and the circular, generalized circular Hager splittings where a lot of that work was established by Andrea Vutier's Fabiola. And what we can do when we have that, I mean, we can start kind of thinking about things in the same way that if we focus upon one of our surfaces, we can just go ahead and use that to code open. Code open. And we'll have this kind of linear stack, which is the kind of linear generalized takeout splitting that had been traditionally studied. And so one of the nice things with this circular, if you think about these circular valued Norse functions or these handlers, is that there's a lot of theory from Hagert splittings and generalized Hagert splittings. Generalized tagged splittings, and we can just port over and start using. So, you know, so given this, if we wanted to count the handle number, well, we're looking for some handle number of this particular Hagard splitting, you know, this generalized Hagard splitting. And I just say it's the handle number of the corresponding compression body. So I cancel out all of the zeros when I can. Zeros when I can. Maybe we get some more wild things, but we just kind of add them all up. And so we can say, given a generalized Hagard splitting or a generalized circular Hagard splitting, I can talk about the handle number of that. It's just kind of the handle number of the constituent compression models added up. So that's kind of our basic definitions there. And one of the things that One of the things that we can do to kind of go back and forth between Hagard splittings and start kind of moving around in the space of Hagard splittings where our surfaces are kind of representing this class. So you can think of this as a way of moving through Hagard splittings or generalized Hagard splittings associated to classical Of classic circumvalued Morse functions, is we can do some operations like thinning. And there's also like your standard Hagard stabilizations, which you can do. I actually probably should have said something about stable equivalence. Of course, there's that, but I didn't write that. But one nice, one very important operation is this idea of weak reductions or some sort of thinning that can happen. So if we have some Hagrid surface, say, Uh, Hagrid surface, say, you know, one of the blue surfaces in our generalized Hagrid splitting, if we have some Hagrid surface where it has disjoint compressing disks on opposite sides, um, so I'm kind of showing something right here. So, I'm thinking of like this is my surface, which is my surface S, and I can see I have two. I have two disjoint disks now: this disk and this disk, those are compressing disks on opposite sides of the surface. Well, that allows me to do a sort of weak, what we would call a maybe a weak reduction. And that allows me to kind of like thin or kind of pull apart and expand this splitting even further. So I, you know. You know, roughly, kind of the idea is we're able, you know, if you're thinking about the critical points that says we're able to kind of move an index one above an index two, like they're not interacting, but swap them. So I have this kind of this you know swap. Well, it's not really swap, it's like move past. You know, we're move past. Past and then once I move them past, that inserts new some new levels, new kind of regular levels in between, and gives us some new compression buttons. So, this was kind of the schematic what's happening on the critical point or the critical values picture. This is maybe a bit more of a schematic of what's actually happening there. Or what we can do is actually see a bit more of just an example where I have this kind of pair of Pair of kind of these compressing disks for this blue surface S here. So I have a yellow compressing disc and a purple one. And one way to think about what's happening is I can kind of thicken, I can just kind of thicken that up to a product and just pull these pull the ends up here and down there. So we had these things disjoint. Then once I see this, I can go ahead and say, well, now I can kind of squeeze in extra. Can kind of squeeze in extra surfaces here and eke out some other compression bodies there. So I'm going to compress those two boundary pieces of the, you know, of that S cross I, and I'll get these new surfaces here. And then after I straighten it out, I'll see this kind of other, you know, this new generalized Hager splitting with some extra levels, right? But what's happened there. Right, but what's happened there then is that I've now compressed further to where I maybe have fewer, you know, these surfaces are not, well, you know, R prime is kind of the result, you know, this guy here is the result of compressing the original hadride surface S. So if I want to do that with as many, you know, I can start to do. As many, you know, I can start to do like a whole bunch of compressing disks rather than just one, and then I can split this around where I just jumped. Where are we? Here we are. You know, I have a whole bunch of compressing disks that are disjoint, so I can do a kind of some sort of maximal weak reduction. And this will allow me to kind of pull this apart. Allow me to kind of pull this apart to where I can end up getting that. I actually have the surface R prime, which we do it enough, this is going to be incompressible. And we can see that we're kind of splitting it off. Maybe the splitting produces a handle body component, maybe nothing, but we can see that what we're getting is these other pieces. So we're getting this kind of weak reduction. So, we're getting this kind of weak reduction or a maximal weak reduction that kind of pulls apart this original Hagard surface S. And going in reverse would be, I guess, the term that's used is kind of amalgamation. We're kind of smashing these surfaces together across R, kind of pulling the feet of those, the dual feet of those compressing disks back up. So, one thing that we see from this, however, though, is that this kind of thinning or these peak reductions could change the handle number. And this handle number, I mean, especially once we conclude, if we arrive at a handlebody component, that's going to necessarily have either, I guess, here a three-handle, because it's a handle body, a purple handle body, or if it was yellow, it would be a. If it was yellow, it would be a we would naturally have a zero handle, and so that's going to force actually the increasing of getting some handle of getting some higher handle numbers. However, we can mitigate that by counting differently because what we can do instead is do this thing called the handle index, which appeared. Handle index, which appeared in one form previously in some work of Shalman and Schultz. And so basically, the idea is that the handle index, I'm using the letter J for a compression body is just either if it's made out of zeros and ones, it's just the number of one handles minus the number of zero handles, or it's the number of two handles minus the number of three handles. And so we can kind of just use that J instead of H. So you talk about the handle index instead of the handle number, and you can kind of. Number and you can kind of go through the entire same setup and talk about the handle index of a generalized Hagrid splitting or even the Handle index of a sutured manifold relative to a homology class. So those definitions can all of course go through. But one thing we can notice though that if a compression body has no handle body components, then the handle number equals the handle index. If we have no handle body components. So, but then also the handle index is unchanged by weak reductions and amalgamations. And so by shifting our perspective to looking at the handle index, we can do a lot of these operations without worrying, you know, without, you know, if we can go from something with no handibodies to something with no handibodies through a series of operations like this, we production and algorithm. Operations like this, reproductions and amalgamations, then we will have not changed, in the end, we will not have changed the handle number. That will allow us to do a few tricks. And so the main trick I'm talking about then is dealing with incompressible surfaces. So this is the kind of a key here. Back up in our definition about Back up in our definition about back up in our definition about handle number. I know we had talking about sutured manifolds, but I am nowhere saying anything about tautness. The sutured manifold doesn't have to be taut. In fact, when we're dealing with compression bodies, they're not taught because, you know, clearly compressible. This surface R doesn't have to be norm minimizing. Nor minimizing. It doesn't even have to be incompressible. So that actually all of a sudden throws a big kink in trying to want to use things about, you know, and trying to use things with the suture structure. But one thing we can say at the very least is that I'm right always considering this. Right, always considering this. One thing we can say is that this proposition right here, this thing is realized by a homologically essential and incompressible surface. And so, what I mean is that there's going to be, we can always find our surface R, which is incompressible. Which is incompressible. And that gives us a leg up or a good starting spot in order to start studying the handle number. And so what I want to give here is a quick sketch of how we use amalgamation or weak reductions and amalgamations in order to arrive at such a thing. So I'm going to start off with my handle number here, and I say, well, that's going to be realized by some. Well, that's going to be realized by some circle-valued or some circular Hagard splitting, the handle number of a circular Hagard splitting. And when I have this circular Hagard splitting, there are no compression bodies because Z is a non-zero class. And so therefore, it equals the handle index. And so let me just kind of think about it here. I'm going to remember that R is being glued up to R, the top and the bottom. Glued up to R, the top and the bottom have been glued up. And if R is already incompressible, we're done. And if R is compressible, then that means our surface S is weakly reducible. If R compressible, then S is weakly reducible. S is beatenly reducible. So, what I want to do is do a kind of a maximal weak reduction. And that's going to give me some, if I kind of do as much weak reduction as I can, that's eventually going to end me, that's going to end me up with some splitting. I've kind of really kind of pulled apart that surface S somehow, and it's going to give me this kind of larger horizontal piece that's just some incompressible. Incompressible surface. And I have some pieces like this here or here or here. And those could represent collections of components. But those I can see are going to be, those are homologically trivial. They bound. Whereas I've got this kind of other piece that I've highlighted that is homologically essential. So I'm letting that stand for kind of the homologically essential. Essential part of this part too. And then we can just go ahead and amalgamate along the homologically inessential pieces to go ahead and kind of just squeeze it back down to give this kind of other Hagrid surface where I but that's going to keep this guy being incompressible. And so now I have a generalized circular Hagrard splitting where one of my levels is incompressible and homologically. Incompressible and homologically essential. But R is being glued to R. The top and the bottom are glued together. So I can just kind of rearrange that and say, well, let's chop along R2 instead. And then I'm going to just amalgamate along my original R. And so I can then amalgamate on the other side. And this is going to leave me with a just a regular circle value or a circular Hagard splitting where I have this homologically essential and Essential and incompressible surface. But now that I'm down to it, you know, these operations did not change the handle index. And since the result now has no handle body components, I can say, well, that's going to be the handle number of that. And well, we started with something where we knew it was the handle number of the original. And so there we go. So we can find a A uh a surface, a regular surface that gives that's incompressible and homologically essential, giving us our handling model. It has a Hagar circular Hagard splitting giving us the Hamlin model. All right, where are we on time? So, once we have these incompressible surfaces, this starts to, we can maybe, we might want to kind of shift gears a little bit and start talking. might want to kind of shift gears a little bit and start talking about Kakamitsu complexes. And so if I want to think about all of the surfaces that could be used to find a, tell me the handle number for my homology class. Well, now I can say that they're incompressible surfaces. If I really want to do stuff with sutured manifolds, I would really like these to be like minimal genus or thirsty norm. Like minimal genus or thirsting norm minimizing. But alas, at this point, we only know that it's incompressible. So Kakamitsu, in the context of not exteriors, and I guess he later also been link exteriors, described these kind of simplicial complexes that are similar to the curve complex for a surface. But so there are these two complexes that we can define, which is the simplicial complex, so MS for the kind of minimal or surfaces, or I guess we can say, let's just call it the Thurston norm minimizing surfaces representing Z. At this point, we don't necessarily have to deal with the sutured structure. And so we can have some sort of simplicial complex where Complex where that's whose main objects are these Thurston norm minimizing surfaces that represent our homology class, or we have IS, which is the one dealing with incompressible surfaces that represent the class. There are some other technicalities that you might want to worry about, but about homologically essential surfaces or homologically essential boundary, which we can do. And so we're going to build a simplistic complex by saying, well, the vertices are these isotopic, you know, the vertices are these various isotopic classes of these surfaces. And then I think for just kind of discussion here and moving forward, it's easiest to go ahead and say, let me define an insimplex as being associated to a collection of n plus one mutually disjoint surfaces. Or so you know, so these we'd have n plus one vertices defining an n-simplex where the associated surfaces are mutually disjoint. Now, there's some little issues with that. And so for those in the know, I would, you know, Protesky Schulton's have a discussion of some of the issues that go on with this. And actually, that we might actually want to say something slightly different than that. But for the purposes here, But for the purposes here, you know, I think this is fine to kind of get the head around one way of defining it. I mean, we can define it this way, of course. It's just kind of what are the consequences you want to come from this, what property would you want this simplicial complex to have? Pictorially, you know, I've got these kind of four, I drew four of these Rs or these surfaces, say each representing Z. And R1, R2, and R3. R1, R2, and R3 are mutually disjoint, and so I have that simplex there. And we have these edges, and I have the triangle there. And then R4 is disjoint from R1, but not R2, R3. So R1 and R4 are joined by an edge, but R2 and R3 are not joined to R4 at all. So this is kind of a schematic of what we mean by the cat-e2 complex there. And just some basic facts. Of course, the minimal complex is contained in the Complex is contained in the incompressible complex. And, you know, going back into this thing, if we're dealing with the complexes for knots, knots and S3, then in fact, those complexes are each connected. This is Charlotte Thompson actually showed this, kind of follows from their work earlier, 1988, and also Kathmitz, who gave a different approach towards that. In fact, In fact, Protziski and Schultz showed that the minimal complex is, in fact, contractible, and they actually showed a lot more than that. I'm actually unclear if the incompressible complexes can. But one thing I do like to say is that based on what we did before, we can see that the handle number is realized by a vertex. Is realized by a vertex of the incompressible complex. And here we've kind of under the in the background, I guess I'm assuming we've thrown on a sutured structure on the M, and we are talking about Z being a regular class. And a big main question here then is: is you know, we see that it's realized by a vertex of the incompressible, but is it actually realized? It but is it actually realized by some first and norm minimizing vertex or first and norm minimizing surface? You know, and I find this a kind of really fascinating or engaging question here in that we have a whole suite of techniques and things to go after with all of the work of Hagar splittings. But then, as because we're dealing with circular Hagar splittings, Dealing with circular Hager explodings, all of a sudden we have these homologically essential guys, you know, representing Z. So, all these kind of different arsenal of techniques might be applicable. So, one can start to wonder about, you know, any of the kind of various flur theories that are around, since they can actually say something about homologically essential surfaces. And so, of course, we're, you know, it's kind of how do you pass between incompressible. How do you pass between incompressible and thirsty or minimizing? So it's, I think there's a lot of room for work to be done. And then to just focus that question even more, maybe appeared earlier, but I think Fabiola and I have wrote it down that if we're talking about just knots and the handle numbers of knots, that in fact, I think we conjecture, at least it's Conjecture, at least it's something to kind of light the fire for someone that to say that maybe the handle number of a knot is actually realized by a minimal genus cycle surface. That seems natural. It seems like it should be right, but is it? I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. It seems maybe surprising that it wouldn't be, but then again, But then again, I have yet to construct a counterexample. One approach towards addressing this, though, is to say, well, look, I can talk about a vertex of these complexes being realized by, you know, the handle number being realized by a vertex. And then you can say, well, you know, the vertices of these complexes are just surfaces representing Z. You know, surfaces representing z, in fact, they each have handle numbers, right? Um, okay, well, and in fact, if I look at a simplex, um, you know, kind of we see back up here. In fact, in fact, this simplex, if I forget about R4 for a second, well, R1, R2, R3, those are like the kind of the thin levels of a circular Morse function, you know, of a circular Hagert splitting. So, in fact, Circular Hagart splitting. So, in fact, there are handle numbers to associate to each simplex. So, we can get some sort of like enhancement of the Kakumitsu complex. I guess I'm emphasizing that we do have this sutured structure, and maybe we want Z to be a regular class. But given a simplex, even of just the incompressible surface, incompressible complex, we can define the handle number of that simplex to be kind of the handle number. To be kind of the handle number of the surfaces, the collection of surfaces that are the vertices of that simplex. And so here, just with that simplex we were just looking at, well, it's the handle number of this where I've minimized along the blue S's, right? So that allows. So, that allows us to get a definition of a Hamilton model. And then it's actually not too bad from there to observe that if like you have if tau is a face, like a lower dimensional face of sigma, then the Handel number of tau is less than or equal to the Handel number of sigma. And why is that? Well, it's kind of a schematic of this. The point is. The point is, we can get to this thing by just amalgamating this guy along R3. And so I know with the amalgamation, you know, the handle number, you know, the handle, the specific kind of handle structure I get from amalgamating is going to be, you know, could be. You know, I could be there's going to be more. I mean, we could maybe do a little bit better by choosing a different S's. You know, I just look at those two, but you know, what I get by amalgamating that, it's going to be an upper bound. And well, what we get from amalgamating is just the same handle number here. So that gives us some interesting structure. It's not quite a, you know, it's one of those things I really hope this was going to be a. I really hope this was going to be a like buzzwords of like a discrete Morse function or something, but it's not because they have some extra conditions. This looking up, it clearly doesn't satisfy that, but it's still a nice structure. I'm not really sure we call my towards that, but this suggests that there's something more. And one might hope that there is some sort of sense of kind of flowing through there or some sort of connectivity if we're wanting to look at trying to address. At trying to address this open question, is there some sort of path or at least a way of hopping through the incompressible complex of those that minimize, you know, that realize the handle number of your manifold. We just hop from vertex to vertex or go through the simplices until we end up in the minimal complex. You want to see some way of moving along there. And it seems like this kind of structure. Structure might give some open up some pathways towards doing something like that. Of course, it's not clear that the minimal part of IS, those that realize the handle number, that that would be like a connected complex. So there's a lot of questions there. So I just throw this out as a problem to just study the structure that this kind of handle function endows upon the simplicial complex. Um, yeah, and so really on time, okay, great. Um, well, I guess it's about 50 minutes. So, so, what I want to do next is actually show you some of the examples in a different setting and one that may be more approachable and also show off some of the kind of weirdness that can happen. Um, so instead of dealing with uh handle numbers of knots. Handle numbers of knots or handle numbers of suture manifolds. I'm going to look at this analogous thing of, you know, I'm going to talk about links in solid tori, right? And then given a solid torus, I have a natural kind of projection. I think of my solid torus with a fixed S1 cross V2 structure. And then I have a projection to S1. So that gives me a natural circle valued Morse function. Well, I mean, it's just a projection. And then I can imagine that among in my link type, I can. Among my link type, I can think of all of the different representatives of that link type that are Morse with respect to this projection to the circle, right? And then, well, then I can talk about the handle number of any given kind of representative of that link type, which maybe you want to think of as the circular bridge number. Of course, when we talk about bridge number, we only talk about the over bridges and not the underpasses. So it probably should be, we should have, we actually have. Should be, we should have, we actually have this kind of twice circular bridge number, right? And so we can, you know, the handle number of a representative of that link type is just the number of local extrema of this function, this projection, which strictly here, the knot. Then we can just define the handle number of the link type in the solid torus to just be the minimum of all that. And it's maybe not too bad to notice that the handle number of this link. The handle number of this link type is zero if and only if that link type is actually a closed grade. Kind of analogous, completely analogous to the fact that the handle number of a man of a knot is zero if only if that knot is five of them. And if we wanted to get an analogy to, so this is about the handle number, but then we've got this analogy about like the cipher genus. Like the ciphered genus about having an incompressible ciphered surface or a minimal genus surface. Well, this kind of idea of a wrapping number, this is kind of like the genus of our surface here, is just the wrapping number. So I've got this fixed projection, and so I can just ask the number of times that the minimum number of times that my not or my representative of the link type intersects a meridinal disk, right? Disk, right? And that's going to give us this wrapping number of that type. And so then I can also talk about the wrapping number of the link type, which is maybe more generally what people mean when they say wrapping number. But I want to make this distinction of the wrapping number of a representative with respect to this kind of particular projection of the circle. And so our open question, the one that we talked about, mentioned before, basically translates to, does there exist a representative of Does there exist a representative of this link type such that the handle number of the link type, the representative is the handle number of the link type, and the wrapping number of the link or the representative is the wrapping number of the link type. And so this is one that's a little bit more hands-on, I think. And let me just give you an example here of just one thing that we can see. So here's a, I've drawn this red L inside a solid torus and And I've kind of drawn these kind of disks, the R and the S disk, a red disk and a blue disk from the projection. And you can see that the R intersects the knot three times, and it's got two maxima or two extrema. So the handle number here is two, and the wrapping number is three. I can do a silly thing where I just kind of grab a little bit, you know, so I could just like grab this bit and Like, grab this bit and pull them all the way around. And then we'll get this thing here. And so, this is kind of a silly way of actually just getting another guy that has the same handle number, but a larger wrapping number. So we have to be a little careful about that. However, you might say, yeah, but what color should I be using here? Colors. You know, this disc here, I can see this kind of between these two handles here, I can kind of get some extra compression. So this is kind of like, well, if I think of what's happening with R, I mean, REL, I guess that comes all the way around here. I can see R is compressible. This R prime is compressible. And you can actually see what's happening on the other one, too. So this is a compressible. This is a compressible, so you're like, well, that you're not in the incompressible situation. For what it's worth, this guy that I got here, or that one, all came from the taking a strong intervolution of the 5-2-0 that we first looked at. So if you take the quotient of that, the black guy becomes the unknown. And then if you kind of look at how the red guy goes around that unknot, you're going to get this. Okay, so this was an example. Okay, so this was an example there, and you get this nice relationship of using double-branched covers. So, more interestingly, what do we have? Here is an example of rather than drawing it towards, let me just chop it open and it's easier to draw. So, I have this guy I'm going to call L0 representing some link type because it's a knot type in the solid torus. In the solid torus. And what do we see here? We've got, well, that's zeros where it's probably. We can see that the handle number is just two. Just from this, maybe it's not immediately obvious it's not graded, but I'll leave that as an exercise. And so the handle number really is of the link type is two. And also. And also, it's maybe not obvious, but the wrapping number of this here is five. That's obvious, but that's also the wrapping number of the link type. But what's funny, funny, ha-ha, is that you can see that these guys are both kind of ascending. So I can just kind of take this like annulus here. I mean, so I smell. Here. I mean, so I sweep that around the entire solid torus. I have that annulus, and I can start doing some twists along that. So here I drew one where I did kind of three twists. And I got the same handle number. The wrapping number is going up, at least it appears to be going up, but you can convince yourself of that. But the thing is that this guy ends up, you know, I still end up with these other incompressible surfaces. Other incompressible surfaces. So I have this high, the handle number is the same, but I have these like really large incompressible kind of presentations. These really, you know, wrapping numbers where I have this large incompressible. And of course, this comes from doing this trick of, you know, taking this guy and I didn't draw the whole thing. I should have done that, where you kind of take this and start spinning. Take this and start spinning it in order to create these like incompressible siphon surfaces that are not minimal genes. Paris, I think. Talked about this. This is a construction of incompressible ciphered surfaces of arbitrarily large genus. That was one way of going about that. And so that was a nicely, strongly invertible thing. That was a nicely, strongly invertible thing, so I can kind of quotient the surface, and then we can get back to these examples here. And so, this is an example where we get this, like, and that also tells me this is why I know we actually have this wrapping number. And so, we see this problem that you can have ridiculously large kind of incompressible surfaces while the handle number is kind of still minimal. Okay, and I got one more example to show you, and we'll finish that off. So, if you think this is bad, it's going to get worse. Here is a knot, and I've got this, yeah, it's a knot, and you can see I've got two different levels here. The wrapping number is both five on those, and well, for those surfaces, and let's see which way am I doing it? I guess. And let's see, which way am I doing it? I guess I'm going over here. And so if I chop it along this way, the wrapping number or the handle number is four. And we can see that it's four because if you just look, I have four guys that kind of backtrack. This guy. This guy, you know, is arc, so it has to have at least one. And, you know, and then we see that happening with the others. So we can see here, with respect to this R1, the Hamlet number is four. And so if I'm thinking, you know, and so you might say, well, okay, you're talking about the surface now, but this is a surface for a particular representative of a link. A particular representative of a link in the solid torus. But if I used, if I kind of swapped it around, so I'm going to just cut along R2 now. And you might see, well, then once I cut along R2 and I kind of forget about R1, I can rearrange that. And now I have something with handle number two. Okay. And so I have two different surfaces. What's that telling me? I have two different. Two different retinal discs, R1 and R2. They have the same wrapping number, but one of them shows me a handle number of four, while the other shows me a handle number of two. So if I translate this back into actually thinking of knots like we do here, this is an example from Goda. This is a two-bridge knot, actually, where in fact we have two mineral genus ciphered circles. Minimal genus ciphered surfaces where one gives you the handle number and the other gives you something does not give you the handle number. One gives you something more. One tells you you have the handle number of two. The other tells you you have a handle number of four. And what's the other one? I should have drawn it in here more clearly. But if you kind of look, you've got like a Mercuti sum happening here. And when it's not fibered, you can have. That's not fibered, you can have two. Instead of using this square, I could use the complementary square in the summing sphere, and that will give you a different surface that's not isotopic. And those are basically corresponding to R1 and R2. One of them has handle number one or two, the other has handle number four. So even among the minimal genus cipher surfaces, you might not have, you know, you don't necessarily have the minimum handle number. So it goes, it gets. Number so it goes, it gets crazy, anyway. I thought those were fun examples, and I hope you uh maybe somebody else is going to get make some progress here. All right, thank you for your time. Are there any questions? Hi, Ken. So, about this example, so the way that you construct examples is by, well, I think I missed it, but it's just, you just take a link inside of S1 cross D2, and then you take the double branch covering of that link, right? That's one way of getting some examples. Yeah, okay. Yeah. So and then. Yeah. So and then you just consider that circular discomposition given by the pre image of the disks as that we do. Yeah, but you do have to be careful if you really want to say something about the handle number of the actual knot or maybe link in the cover is that, you know, when we're in the quotient, you're only seeing strongly invertible things. So, you know, and the cover, and in fact, And in fact, we've seen some examples, some fairly simple examples where there's the handle number is real of a strongly invertible, but I shouldn't say strongly invertible, it's like a freely invertible knot is not realized by a symmetric siphon surface. Okay. So there is a problem there. Okay. You know, this is like a toy example. So you can see there's an analogy. So you can see there's an analogy. And, you know, I think the question for just the links in Solitaire is a fun one you can play with. There's lots of directions to go there and relations. And it's, I think, a bit more hands-on, easier to kind of maybe think about, maybe get your hair square, head on straight. Yeah. So, but then these examples are, so I wasn't sure about your answer. Am I right that you are taking the double branch covering on the link to get the example? In on the link to get examples, or is there a different way? Well, I mean, really, what the way I was going is I was starting with these known examples. And then I said, well, look, I knew they had some funny behavior, like Goda describes that example. Okay. And then I said, well, these all admit a nice involution, and I can push it down and get the picture. Where do we go? Yeah, I can push it down and get the picture. Yeah, I can push it down and get the picture in the um I can push it down and get the picture of a link in a solid torus. Okay, and so you know, I mean, I think here it's it's easier to see that this has handle number two in this picture than uh I mean than the picture I drew at the very beginning, right? It's the same thing. So then is it is is then you cannot translate a problem of finding translate the problem of finding this computing this genus the the the the handle number to the to the quotient of the notes that is like uh because you're only you'll only get like some sort of symmetric handle number or something you know okay you'll have to add on some adjectives if you're only looking at what happens downstairs or in the quotient okay thank you very much Are there any other questions? Okay, then let's thank the speaker again. Thanks, guys. Yeah, then we made that.
