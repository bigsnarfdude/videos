It's based on a recent, most recent paper I think of mine written with Lukashk Piskovsky and Matt Hastings. Also based on two more papers earlier than last year. Well actually, yeah, of the same authors from about 2018, December or November Africa, and another paper with And another paper with Nat and the same three co-authors, including me. So the So this is the Beyang card. So let me remind ourselves what the topological phases are. It's formally, well, some people don't like it to make this definition. Get the definition, but the most prevalent definition for topological phases are the class of Hamiltonians or just ground state of gap Hamiltonians. And the equivalence relation is given by the gap path in the Hamiltonian space. And when it comes to SP, this stands for symmetry protected. You impose symmetry. Normally you don't. When you talk about intrinsic topological, you don't need anything. You don't need anything. But here we were imposing some on-site unitary symmetry, Z2. And then the state is trivial without that symmetry, but becomes non-trivial with the presence of the symmetry. And we're considering a particular space-time dimension of 4 plus 1. And there has been a significant interest since the work of Xia Chen and others that That using so-called group homology, you can construct a variety of interesting models in all dimensions. And following that homologous prescription, in four plus one dimensions, there is exactly two phases. One is trivial, the other is non-trivial. And they form an abelian group. But later on, people realized, oh, maybe something is missing in that table. And so far, to date, the most exhaustive conjectural classification comes from the operant theory. And there, the predicted number of ACs under this on-site Z2 symmetry in four plus one dimensions is forming a Z2 process. One component of Z2 comes from the usual Carmel spaces, and the other is called some beyond Carmel space. So I want to talk about that one, and the goal is to. That one, and the goal is to present an explicit model for that base. So, a little further on the background: the coordinates of machinery produces action for the beyond cobalt part for Z2 gauge field A, combined with a so-called staple-Whitney class at four dimensions. So, this is five dimensions, so this is a bi-form, and this is my letter. And this is my laboratory. Steeple-Witteny class is some coherent classes that gives you a primary obstruction to construct a linear independent section of a tangent bundle. So W1 is a, if you give me a loop, a homology representative, then W1 assigns a sign. When you follow a section along that path, then it reverses orientation. Path that it reverses orientation or not. And you continue in that fashion all the way up to the dimension four. And this finds a particular section of how many? So in four dimensions, four, oh, yeah. Let me skip that part. A sufficient many number of linear dependencies. Independent section along a given four-side curve. The action was proposed. And surprisingly, around the same time, another model, probably independent from this coordinate classification, so-called generalized Generalize double semian model was written. It's a generalization of the usual double semian model in the two plus one dimensions. So let me remind you what that double semian model is. It's a super of string configurations. And the wave function consists of sup of superposition over all. Of superposition over all possible closed sprinkling ratios. But now you assign minus one for each connected component. So in this picture, relative to the vacuum configuration, this picture contains three loops. So overall, it comes with minus sign. If there are an even number of loops, then you put the plus sign. You may wonder why this makes sense because whether a Whether a component is connected or not sounds like a global property rather than a local property. But since we're only inserting signs, you can count the number of connected components modular two by observing on only local patches. That's why you can write down a Hamiltonian for it. So thinking of this connecting component, that doesn't really generalize to higher dimensions because in a higher dimension because in higher dimensions you may introduce some non-trivial move, but the number of connected components may not change. So it's tricky, it becomes tricky to assign a consistent sign. So what Friedman and Hastings interpret this picture was that, oh, maybe this sign is the number of Morse moves to create this configuration out of a vacuum. The Morse moves correct in in two dimensions. In two dimensions, corresponds to any transition that maps this configuration into this configuration. So jointly, they form some circle, but if you don't combine them, then there is some topological move. And this interpretation indeed generalizes. They took this definition as a definition for the generalized double semi. For the generalized double semia. It turns out that in odd space dimensions, so even space-time dimensions, the wave function obtained by this prescription, if you count a number of Morse moves, that prescription turns out to be equivalent, well, a finite circuit equivalent to the usual, let's say, to discover his theory, the Tori code. But in even space dimensions, so two, four, six, and so on. And so on. In those cases, they are different from the Tori code. So people thought it was an interesting model, and a mathematical physicist, Arendt Bray, wrote a TQFT built on this prescription. He wrote down an action that matches the predictions of this wave function for all space-time manifolds for sufficiently large classes. Sufficiently large classes. And what he identified is: to describe this general double semi-the action should include this channel. That was his conclusion. That was like almost two years ago, maybe three younger. So that was the status up until, like I said, months ago. Oh, okay. So since this model, this Hamiltonian model produces this Lagrangian term. Uses this Lagrangian term. Therefore, we have found a beyond comology base. But this state is perhaps too simple to be beyond. So what we, Pitkowski, Hastings, and Tantifaskar, have realized is that the dual of this topological theory in the SPD side, so this is. SPT side. So this is intrinsic topological order. So you can ungauge it and look at the SPT side. And there the ground state wave function is created by a really simple quantum circuit. If you heard of control Z, this is So this is a 2Q8, a size minus whenever everything is now. And you can generalize to arbitrary number of qubits by this way, where you assize most configurations to the plus round, but for all the plus down screens, you assign minus. This is a diagonal you integrate in these bases. In this basis. And the prescription for the dual of GBS model is that you apply PAL VZ for every zero stouse, and you apply control Z for every edge. So degrees of freedom are the vertices of some triangular mission. And then you apply Z on 0, CZ on 1, and CCZ on every triangle, and so on. And so on. Note that this doesn't care about the ordering of the underlying qubits, so which is that that gate is well defined. So just want to understand, just want to make sure I understand. So you're saying that using this move, generalizing to higher dimension, you can get generalized levels in it, but is it still like string? Is it still like string? So, okay, so you always consider quote dimension one surfaces. So, in three dimensions, you have the literal to the surfaces, and the worst transition would look like this configuration. So, you have two sheets of surface is mapped to a cylinder like this. So, you have only Only this portion. Here you have only that portion. So in general, Morse moves are the boundary of a sphere. So if you write a ball in this core, Transition from this to that is our strategy. And the constructed one is the topologically ordered one, and you only symmetry is a usual mapping between existence of numbering and mean balance. So I skipped that part. Yeah, I skipped that part. So in the intrinsic topological part, what you do is you put the degrees of freedom on the co-dimension one cells. So in three dimensions, you put degrees of freedom on the faces. But to ungauge it, you put degrees of freedom on the center of top-dimensional cells and interpret the domain laws to be your original. Walls should be your original intradictable order to Christopher. But the wave function is not like if you have a ball, then there's a minus one. It's different. No, no. So if you interpret the wave function of the SPP side using domain walls, then you recover that picture. You know, that's the usual gauge. Each domain wall has MySon, yes. It's for me all has a minus sign, yes. But in uh the gauged side, it's not a gauge uh conductive component. Is that f a minus sign or is it the entire dimension? It's different. What happens in 3D again? In in all space dimensions, including 3, so in all dimensions, what you end up with is a function of So E denotes the configuration of hypersurfaces. In these three cases, it's a surface, the literal surface. And the overall actually the design over a sign comes with i to the Euler characteristic. But in three dimensions, Euler characteristic happens to be always even. So this phase vector is actually plus or minus one. But yeah, this is the formula. The reason this is equivalent to Toronto is precisely because you can compute the Euler characteristic by local rule. There's a usual rule to compute the Euler characteristic. You count the number of vertices minus the edges plus the faces and so on. That formula can be assigned locally. So you can pick up this face. You can pick up this phase vector by a local phone circuit, and that gives you mapping from the GBS perhaps the wave function to the torque code. Torque code. Yeah, so coming back to the SPT side of the GBS, so the prescription is you put the spin halves for each vertex of a triangulation. You apply sigma Z on every vertex. Vertex, control Z on every edge, and C2Z on every triangle, and so on. All the way up to the top edge. And that's the wave function. Now, what we observed was that that circuit actually is equivalent to some product of circuits derived from the cosmology. Slightly more physically, the state that is The state that is dual to this GBS is equivalent to cohomology state on the top dimension, cancer with another cohomology state on the co-dimension two, another cohomology state on the co-dimension four, and so on. So in 4 plus 1 dimension, so it produces all the consistent story for the 2 plus 1. But in 4 plus 1, the dual of GDA. The dual of GDS is the cohomology state on the four dimensions tensored with the two-dimensional cohomology state along the dual of stable Whitman class of dimensions here. So in particular, in the flat space in R4, the dual GDS is circuit equivalent to the in-colomology state. So it cannot ever be the beyond colomology. Ever beyond commodity. So at this point, you should ask: what does it mean to have a face if you're just giving an action? Repeated question? What does it mean? Well, it's rather a philosophical question, not very precisely, mathematically defined. Given an action, what does it mean to have a What does it mean to have an action for a phase? I give you, so here, the wrapping up the story, there was a state, and there was a calculation that produced this action on a spacetime interval consistently with a given Hamiltonian. Now I show that, although I didn't write it here, that particular state was equivalent to informally state tensored with a Incommodity state tensored with some lower dimensional stuff. So, in particular, in the flat space, it's equivalent to the incommodic state. What do you mean by tens of lower-dimensional stuff, like you putting them on any walls? Ah, uh uh uh let me draw the two-dimensional picture. Let me draw the Tudebesho picture. Here's an exercise, actually, for you. So everything is triangle. Oh no, definitely. I'm sorry. Let me not do this. This is too distracting. So by tensoring, I mean you literally have the top-dimensional homology, the state, on your two-dimensional here. And then somewhere in the middle of your bulk, you embed some sub-dimensional system on the way. System on which you plug in lower dimension SVT comes from the cohomology. But there's only one copy of this in the whole system, and you don't know where it is. Exactly. So since the sub-dimensional system is embedded in the higher-dimensional space, it can be anywhere. And the motion that you move the state in one sub-manifold to another. And then one sub-manifold to another sub-manifold can be done instantaneously by a tapped one or two quantum circuits. So you don't have to specify where it is, as long as it is there. You may wonder how this homogeneous-looking state gave rise to this particular stock manifold. So So, the co-moji state can be defined not only on a manifold, but in a more general cell complex that is not necessarily a manifold. And in this lower-dimensional case, that's what's happening. So initially, the very prescription of dual GPS gives you some state along two cells in this four-dimensional manifold, but that is circuit equivalent to one. Equivalent to one state embedded in a particular two-dimensional sub. Yeah, you don't have to specify. Well, there's a particular homology class where it is embedded, but beyond that, you never know. And you don't have to know. Because the only case where the wave function is as minimal and non-trivial ample, if your wave function is on R to the N, and you have a peak one DSPT state, you can really just move it to it, so then it's not right. Exactly. It's not anymore. Right. So the wave function on R4 is not translation environment. The original wave function in the R4 is translation environment. Only the reduction circuit. I mean, so if you were to map the dual GBS into the usual homologous state in R4, then that removal circuit has to, well actually, even that is not true. Well, actually, given that it's not true. I wanted the surface compactly supported. It's not compactly supported. Then you are cheating. Why? So if it's a translation in every state, right? It's a compact state. Well, the state is compactly supported, right? And then your circuit scramble to the infinity sphere. Okay. Okay, anyway. Okay, anyway. Yeah, it is a swindle argument. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's called chicken. You swindle. Okay. So that's the background. That's the status. That's the motivation for why we are constructing a new state for the same action. We should probably let you get out because you have ten minutes. So, okay. I think that the motivation part is important, because otherwise, why would you... So our prescription is just our decorated domain wall construction. It comes with the old. Comes with the all plus sign with the colour of the colour of the colour of the colour of the colour of the colour of the colonel. So, our prescription is that you take a superposition of all three-dimensional state, that is the walk-on-one model, with the input category being the three-fermin theory, on every domain one configuration, with the overall plus sign ratio. So, okay, so let me let's decide for a little bit. The three-fermula theory is a Uh the three Fermi theory is uh is a model intensive category, consisting of four simple objects. One is trivial one. The other three are mostly symmetric. They are all fermions. They mutually breed with the mutual status minus one. And fusion rules are given by the group law of Z2 cross Z2. So everything is the same as the Tori code, except that everything is, every non-trivial particle is now frame. One peculiar feature of this One peculiar feature of this is that the usual formula. If you plug in the data of the three Fermi theory, then this becomes minus one. So the tyro central charge has to be four minus. Has to be formed by that. So, in particular, this is not chiral theory. And local 1 model is a general prescription to write down a three-dimensional state as a function or functor of this input tensor category. And it's a superposition of all string configurations in three spaces. String configurations in three-space, where each component comes with the amplitude that is proportional to the quantum mechanical amplitude when you interpret the string configuration as a word line of income amiants. So in this three-fermin theory, there is two kinds. There are two kinds of particles that generate the old particle content, and you draw it in the three-space. Draw it in the three space. When they're twisted, you plug in minus one. When they're graded, you plug in minus one. That's the three-fernium walk-in-long state. And we have to extend it to all possible general three-dimensional domain wall. And that's possible. And amusing fact is that this state is of a stabilizer code type. Every Hamiltonian term consists of only tensor product of Pali matrices in arbitrary manifold. In arbitrary manifold. Not even orientable. Don't need any orientability. So the summation is two to the number of four simplices in your triangulation. Is that correct? Two to the number of four simplices, yes. Okay. And everything comes with a plus sign. And this is our our state. And the one major result is that this state is circuit disentanglable to the trivial state. To the trivial state. It is actually the circuit we are constructing. We never write down Hamiltonian. We just show that there exists a circuit such that it maps the trivial product state into this circuit. But breaks the Z2 symmetry. Individual gates of that circuit should break the Z2 symmetry, but overall does not. So why is this state in the middle of the 19th century? So, why is this state beyond complex Z2 SPT? That's the main claim. Well, this is construction. So, sorry, the Z2 symmetry acts by flipping the domains, but otherwise does it act on the workalong pattern? Okay, so a little bit more careful. So let this be the four cell. Here's my speed. And here is what we call on every three-fifth cell what we call material leaves. And the three-formula walk of one state is occupied by this, well occupying this material leaves of freedom. And spins are there only to determine where the domain walls are. And the summation over this is precisely over the spin configuration, not this material due to Not this material use. Also, I just want to make sure your statement. So, your claim is for any closed four manifolds, or rangeable or not, this can all be turned into a product state using a quantum circuit. Yes. So, that's your state? Yes. Every PI. So, sorry, still a question. The Z2 symmetry does it act on the material? That's an act on the material. No. So why is this? One more question for your circuit. Do you know the complexity of the circuit with respect to the number of full simplicities? Complex? You have a circuit turn this into a product state. Yes. Into a product state. Yes. And you can ask how many gates you have to use. Oh, oh, oh, oh. With respect to the number of affairs influences. Linear? Linear? Yeah. It's a constant of circuits. Okay, I don't know the circuit. Okay, so that's it. Yeah, so the circuit is The circuit is actually as this form. For each spin configuration, you look at the domain wall and then insert the disentangler for the three-fermin wall. The interesting ingredient for this story is that this alone is not a quantum circuit. Is not a funnel circuit. So let me, I think I should finish with that distinction and then I will conclude. So this is like a two-minute vibration, or maybe three bits. So there's a so-called So there's a so-called notion UCA, which stands for quantum cellular automata, but that exclamation is not an exclamation at all. So let me be fun. This is just an automorphism of the operator algebra of the lattice. So what's an automorphism? It's a map between two algebras, preserving all the addition and multiplication. So whatever you could write down as a formula. Down as a formula in terms of operators and states, you can conjugate by this automorphism, and the result shouldn't change. It obeys all the algebraic rules. But since we're doing physics, the locality is very important. So every operator on your lattice that is local in some site, acted upon by this QCA, an automorphism, will give you some operator on your lattice. Will give you some operator on your lattice, but we require that it should be local to the original position. There could be some blow-up in the range, but it should be a finite number. So one side operator can be a two-side operator, but it should not be a thousand. Important result of last year or so is that that requirement. That requirement is not equivalent to. So, let me back up. So, any local unit theory you write down, the version of quantum circuit, is automatically satisfies this property. The conjugation by any unitary V will preserve this addition, as we all know. And it will preserve multiplication, because we can write down. Because we can write down like this. So conjugation is a normal morphism of your operational frame. And the composition of such a non-morphism is a non-morphism again. And being on a finite depth quantum circuit, it preserves locality by the light hold argument. But it turns out that that description is not capturing the entirety of this The entirety of this Hasa QCA. There exists some locality-preserving automorphism that cannot be written as a finite depth of circuit. Or finitely speaking, if you write down such an automorphism in any finite lattice, it's always a conjugation by some unitary. So in any finite lattice, QCI is always a unitary conjugation. But if you were to write down that unitary in terms of local gate, you end up with the deep, d. Gate, you end up with the deep, deep in the circuit. Although the final result is electronic preserved. So let's get back to the construction part. It turns out that the disentangler for the three-fergmental Walker-1 model, the disentangler for the whole spectrum of one particular Hamiltonian of the Walker-1 model, requires a QCA disentangler. A QC8 is in fingular, which cannot be written as a function structure. And that QC8 enters here. But here, we are superposing over all possible spin configurations. This summation turns out to be a quantum circuit. And this unitary being not a quantum circuit, but locality preserving, pops up when you consider the induced symmetry on the back. The induced symmetry on the boundary. So if you expose, the canonical way to probe whether a state is SPT or not, or I mean non-trivial SPT or not, is to expose a boundary and examine what's going on at the boundary. It can be gap less or topological order with some weird thing. Here, the induced asymmetry action restricted to the boundary turns out to be a QCA, which never Which never happens if you are given with the incoherent phase. And that distinguishes, that puts our state into this beyond part. Let me conclude with one caveat of my very last remark. The fact or claim, which is shown, that the boundary-induced action is a QCA is dependent. QCA is depending on the particular disentangling circuit. We do not show that it is determined by the state only. But physically, when you want to talk about SPT, everything must be a function of the state, regardless of what Hamiltonian you've used, what disentangler you used. We do not achieve that part, but if you examine carefully what has been done for the SVT, most The SVT. Most of the things, except for maybe gauging, is a function of disentangling circuit, not of the state. So we're on par stage on that. But we gave some extra arguments why the beyond, being beyond, should be argued based only on the state. I guess I will go over time, so I will stop here. Thank you. So, in the end, what's the connection to the action? We do not discuss any action. Action should be this one. Half omega. Oh. Half omega. Ta half A omega pool. Yeah. Can it still be action? We believe so. Although we do not have a particular argument that it has to be the case. Can you elaborate a little bit more about these three theories? I don't see any strong evidence they are the same. Strong evidence they are the same. There is action, half AW4, you have this general double semi-yeah, and you have another one. I don't see there's any intrinsic new should be connected. Except probably you know that the generals are the same, but that's a pretty weak statement. I which I really appreciate it. I assume the only thing you know for sure is take a close four manifold, you have the same brown state degeneracy. You have the same brown state degeneracy. I think that's probably the only one you have. But that's a pretty weak condition for any theory to be related. Just like a double selling a photographic code, they're all assigned. Yeah, I don't, well, honestly, I don't have a particular really good argument for that. Yeah. So the Bianca homology is a very important thing. The Bianca homology example, I know, is in 3 plus 1 dimension, you have time reversal, and then on the domain wall, the time reversal domain wall has something chiral. And something, yeah, that one, the three-fermional model with converse or symmetry is the beyond cohomology example in 3 plus 1d. And we think it is beyond cohomology because this chiral thing is anomalous no matter what. It's anomalous no matter what symmetry you impose. Well, in some sense. But here, on the Z2 domain wall, on the 3 plus 1D, Z2 domain wall of this 4 plus 1D model, you would have the 3 Fermion Woker 1 model, which is a legitimate 3 plus 1D model without symmetry. Because it's not anomalous. So far. But you could go to co-dimension 2D, symmetry deep. To your co-dimension to the central defect. Right, so what's the defect that you look at? So, um, well, it is what you are imagining, actually, I think. Although I didn't hear what you are imagining, but you are not imposing time reversals. We are not imposing time reversals. With time reversal, though, no, no. Uh, right. So, consider uh uh symmetry defect on the on the so symmetry defect is in general just codimension two defect. So, if you apply symmetry operator on the half space. On the half space here and no symmetry here, then you will end up with the symmetry domain and the symmetry twist across that domain also. So here it's a three-spatial dimension object. Right. Here we end up with the two-dimensional example. You have domain wall, of course, only this branch, and you are left with something weird going on there. And since on the domain wall, there's Since on the domain wall there should be the three Fermi and walk around model, further going one dimension down, there should be the chiral theory, which is not protected by any symmetry yet. But if you compare this configuration with the 180 degree rotated version, you're not requiring rotation signature. We're not requiring rotation symmetry. Well, Yeah, so, right. That is true. So, our, well, see, the it's not, it's not, it's not too airtight, I should say. But if you compare these two configurations, then the difference between this and that should be uh uh an odd odd motor of E8, that's our argument. That's our argument. In this case, the chi relative pumps from the in that on that side, here it pumps from the on the other side. So there's some sign mismatch, and the difference should be the odd number of copies of the unit. That's how we think about it. I'll probably ask you again, but I guess we're running out of time. So let's thank Joanne again for a while. Uh all maybe we could just continue with the recording. I'll stop it again. No, you should stop. Stop and start again.
