I was a postdoc of Clifton, so I'm here to just report the work of the past several years working in the direction of Clifton. Okay. So in the first section, I will give some introduction of the ABB package. I believe it has been talked about. Because I believe it has been talked several times in this conference. So I will be very quick on this. So we start from a periodic field and a group G. And we consider it dual. And we have the local underparameter. And so here I want to highlight there are two ways to give the local underparameter. One way is just give a homoxym from WF times SR2C. The other way is just give a pair. The other way is just give a pair. I think this is probably the origin in history. I don't know. But anyway, so the other one is just a lambda and a new potential element in the in hat w g, the Lie algebra of the dual group and satisfy this relation. And here this lambda is called the infinitesimal parameter of phi. And then we have author. Then we have other. For other, we just add another SR2. So other parameter is just another homophone times 2SR2C2Lg. And associated with psi, other we can define fifth psi as a London parameter. And among all London parameters, we actually have somehow we have two subsidies. One is of other type. That means it is it can be defined from other. It is can be defined from other parameters and it also has a subset that's a tempered. So, tempered other tempered error parameter must be of other type. Okay, so other packets, so that's the main theme of this conference, okay. So, for classic group, and so I think it has been mentioned many, many times in this conference. So, the Azure Mog and several others constructed Azure. And several others they constructed as a packet. And more importantly, it's not only a subset of this of irreducible representations, but together with that is a homotis of it. Sorry, I shouldn't say homophys. No, it's not homotis. It's just a map, okay? Sorry. So if we don't know how to define group structure, probably. Sorry. So we have a map. So, we have a map from this set to F side G, and this map is somehow more important. And from this map, we can define a distribution. So, the coefficients are defined from this map. So, we know that this distribution is somehow stable. And of course, there are several other properties of other packets. For example, each of its representations is a unitary. Unit tree. And originally, the pipe size is characterized by endoscopic character identity. So now here comes the question. So is there a way to somehow define pipe size automatically? And even better, somehow generalize that to other groups? I mean, originally, I believe so far it's only defined for classic groups. And to other parameters, not only. And to other parameters, not only other type parameters. Okay, actually, there are some work around this problem. So, for example, Mogglin Inshi or Neither Atobe, and they give a quite concrete description of pipe size, at least for these two groups, and probably for many others, also. And also for real number. Over real number field, for real reductive group, Adams, Babrush, and Vaughan, they propose a geometric construction of pipe side using purple shift on some geometric structure. And very recently, Adams, RNCB, and Mezzo, our Nicholas is here, okay, so he just gave a talk on this. They proved this equivalence of the equivalence of this AB package. Of this AB packet is defined by ABB and defined by ASEAR, they are the same. And for overpetting fields, inspired by this work by Adams, Barbara, and Vorgan, that's a reason it's called ABV. So, Clifton Cunningham and his group, including Bing Shu, they propose a geometric construction of pipe side. So, over a static. Over static fields. So, here is a very rough overview of the construction of this. So, probably I should escape this. I believe this has been talked in Mishti's talk. Yes? Okay. Okay, anyway, so very quickly, so given phi, we define lambda. So that's an infinitesimal parameter. And conversely, for some. And conversely, for such a fixed such a lambda, we can consider this set, the set of all L parameters, such that it's infinitesimal parameter equals lambda. So it turns out that this set is parametrized by a geometrical object. We call it V lambda or Vaughan variety. And it turns out that this set is parametrized by the okay, we also have a group H line. Okay, we also have a group H lambda, H lambda X on V lambda. And the V lambda quotient by H lambda, according to this conjugation action, this will classify all, this classify this side. And this is V lambda is called the Vaughan variety. Okay, a lot of details. Okay, so there are some general facts about this action. We know that this action has only a fine number of objects, for example, it has a unit. Finite number of orbits, for example, it has a unique closed orbit. That's exactly the zero orbit. So the zero orbit just corresponds to so record that the record that a lambda parameter feed corresponding to a pair lambda n. This zero just means n equals zero. And there's also unique open of that means that we take n to be the largest one. The regular one. And we fix the notation, okay? We fix the notation, okay. Given a phi in this set, we denote the C phi, it's the orbit, the corresponding orbit. Conversely, given orbit C, we denote by phi C the corresponding parameter in this side. And from this orbit, we can define its component group. It turns out that this component group AC is exactly the component group of the corresponding line parameter. So, geometrically, we know that this AC can classify all each lambda equivalent local system on C. So, in other words, the character or reputations of AC somehow can be identified with the local system of each lambda equivalent local system on C. And this is a L parameter set. For other parameter set, we can also define similar things. We can define group A, C, B, V. We can define group A, C, B, V, and another, okay, geometric object. Let's just escape this part, okay? Too much, too many details. So anyway, if phase is of other type, so this thing, this general thing, this general thing can be defined without recurring this fee of other type. But anyway, if phi is of other type, see if phi is defined by psi, we know that this group is exactly the epsi, the component group of psi. Design. And we consider this category, the category of smooth irreducible, but a missible representation of CF. So here we include its pure inform. That's a Vaughan version anyway. And we consider such that all of its infinitesimal character lambda is a given lambda. Accurate to define this, we have to repair the local land correspondence. Correspondence. It turns out that this simple object in this can be parametrized by this. It's given by this error packet and we have to take the disjoint union for all such lambda, such that take the disjoint union for all such phi, such as that lambda phi is the given lambda. And the local lambda correspondence also gives the bijection between this and the aphi hat. And the A V hat. So if we combine all these fee, and this will give a bijection of this from this to, you take the disjoint unit for all phi. Unfortunately, this aota is in general not unique. So it depends on choice of wiki data. Next, we consider this kind of category. Next, we consider this kind of category. It's called the H lambda equivalent probability shift on V lambda. So, okay, we can just take this as probably as a black box. But anyways, simple objects are easy to describe. It's simple objects are just exactly classified by this thing, okay? By this. So here C run over all orbits of V lambda quotient by H lambda. And we take the union of all A C. And we take the union of all AC hat. So if we combine this with the local correspondence, we get a bad section between the simple objects of this and the simple objects of this category. So this is a very geometrical category. So on this category, we can do a lot of geometry. And Clifton and his group. And Clifton and his group, they define a factor from this for any C, okay, for any fixed orbit C, they define a factor they call it NEVC using from this category to somehow you can take the rest set as the local system or the character of our list group. Then we define the so-called ABP path. the the so-called abb packet so somehow it depends on the depends on the bijection okay so the ab packet is defined as this so for any simple object in in this in in this category actually it's defined to be the support of this functor i mean if we identify identify this this these two simple the simple objects of these two categories so this is just a support of this So, this is just a spot of this. So, once you define this, so there corresponding to that, there is a natural map from this set to the character of this group. So, this map comes very naturally in this construction. Here are the very basic conjectures. For example, the first one is it should be independent of the choice of the best. It should be independent of the choice of the bad junction we choose. That means it should be independent of the choice of the width data. And the next one is: so suppose we have an author package theory. We expect that if phi comes from fib sign, that means if phi is of other type, then the corresponding author package should be the same as the AB packet. And more importantly, the map from the The map from the Pipe ABB2 to this should be the same as the map defined by author from PipeSci to IPSA hat. And for more general G and for more general phi we expect that this set, even it is not answered packet anymore. So somehow it should behave pretty much like it is answered packet. So, here's a remark. So, recently, Clifton and his student Michigan Ree, they established the above conjecture for GRN. I think for other groups, for other classic groups, it's still open. Okay, so this finishes the first part, just the introduction of A-B packets. So, the next part is: I will talk about our Next part is: I will talk about our construction on ABPEX for G2. Okay, so after they finish the general theory, they computed Clifton and his group, they computed several groups, several examples on classic group. So when I was a postdoc with Clifton, he said that why don't we probably take the next group, which is not classical, but the simplest one. That's T2, okay. So we computed some example of the. So we computed some examples on G2. But at that time, unfortunately, we don't know the local line correspondence for G2. But just recently, just recently, Aubert and Shuji and also Gen 7, they proved the local correspondence for G2 last year. But we did this work before this. So we only, we can, at that time, we can only do this for unipotent representation. Representation. So for local ending correspondence for unipotent representation, that's somehow long known by the work of Luftig. It is known that the unipotent representations of shading groups are actually established this for a joint type, okay, for reductive group geochemical type. And it's known that these representations are parametrized by unramified local learners parameter. So also very recently, So also very recently, Solveld generalized the above result to arbitrary group. Just deleted this restriction, the adjoint type. So anyway, we know, so at that time, okay, we know the local line corresponds for unipon repetition for G2. So that's a starting point. So here is our result. So for each fee in Fee in for each unramifier, the parameter G2. Again, we add this restriction just because at that time we only know this. So there exists an explicit finite side. We computed this of irreducible uniponental representation of G2 and map from race to this to the character of race group. Such that they behave pretty much like the other packets. Okay, I will explain what does this mean, okay? So the meaning of this. So at this moment, I think we don't have other packets to compare. So that's the reason that I see it behaves pretty much like the other pack because other max4G2 is still not defined yet. Actually, there are some candidates of other packs for G2. For example, in a series of work of Gang Grivich and John, I think Grivich gave a And John. I think Grivich gave our talk last afternoon, right? Yesterday. And again, Grivich and this group, just very recently still, deconstruct apex for G2 using exceptional syntax correspondence. By the way, these are just candidates, other packets. We don't know if they are really other packets. I think PongJPOM is working on the choice formula for G2 and the whole. The choice formula for G2, and hopefully, we will get a definition of other packets for G2, like what ASAP did. Okay, here are some explanations for this sentence. So, what do we mean by they behave pretty much like the other packets? So, first thing we have a cumulative diagram. So, if we start from Pi 5, the error packet. Air packet and the local line correspondence tells us that there's a projection between this and the AV cat. And now we have an ABV packet and a map from REST to REST. By the way, the bottom map is not bijective in general. And the Pyphi can be embedded into REST, and this EFI pad can be embedded into LES. We know there's a commutative diagram. And this is the first thing we should. This is the first thing we should expect for other packets. The next thing is if it's open. So open just means the corresponding orbit is open in the bulk. I will go back to this terminology later. And this map is a bijection. In general, it's not. So actually, this sentence, I mean, this part two, it generalizes the tempered one. We know for other. Is a tempered one. We know for other packets, the tempered error packet is the same as the other packets. And even if it is not of other type, this can be generalized to open parameters or open packets. And if pi is unrefied, okay, so we have too many unrefined. So this representation is unrefier, so we also use spherical, I think, in literature. And then. And then, if and only if this field closed, the corresponding object closed, and this character is trivial on this. It induces a trivial character on this group. Moreover, we can consider the distribution defined by this. Also, this coefficient is somehow a generalization of Arthur's formula. And the coefficient is like this. is like is like this. It's minus one to the dimension C phi. Dimension C phi is c phi is the orbit of corresponding to phi and minus dimension c pi. C pi is the orbit of pi. So the coefficient is like this and then times the pair between one and pi then times c pi. We expect that this is stable. And we can prove the following. So if you assume that it is stable for temperature one For temporal one, actually, for elliptic one, we can prove everything is stable. We generated in this, we produced in this. Moreover, for each phi, we can define phi hat such that the operating evolution defines the bijection between this and this. And this is a, so for us, this property, I think it's checked by B. By B. Okay, so here's a remark. Okay, so now the general Lapland corresponds for G2 is proved. So we expect that we can prove the above to the most general fee and most general replication of G2. Here is a very explicit example. Here is a very explicit example. So we consider the following feed, the following R path. This feat corresponds to the so-called sub-regular unipole representation. Actually, this feed will give us the most interesting geometry. The geometry for this is not too hard, actually. It has dimension 4 and the action group is 0, 2. The action is just the twisting of the symmetric Q. And we can show there are. We can show there are four orbits of this, and all of them are of a type. So, actually, much earlier, again, Griffith John, they give a construction of this using CD correspondence. And our results show that this packet agrees with the other packets constructed by that. Okay, the next section is about the generic Okay, the next section is about the generic generic recognition. Okay, so l let's recall generic. So now we assume G is the classic stimulus so that we can talk generic. So R parameter is called generic if this it if it's error packet contains a generic representation. So there's a famous conjecture by Gross Press and also Rales. It says that a parameter feed is generic if and only if this error factor is regulated as equal to. Is regular at s equals one. That means it has no pole. So, this conjecture has been checked by many people, okay, for many different groups. And I think the most general result is given by Gang Chino. They put this conjecture and the assumptions. Also, they check these assumptions are satisfied for all classic groups. So, at least this conjecture is known now for classic groups. For classic group our result, we can connect this to geometry. So we show that the parameter field in the corresponding cog if and only if this parameter is regular at s equals one. So if we combine with this, okay, so to see to save some words, we see that a parameter free is open. That a parameter feed is open if the corresponding C feed open. Okay, actually, it does not save too much words. Okay, so if we combine this result with the previous conjecture of gross process and RALIS, we can find that it fits generic if and only fits open. So this gives a very simple description of the generic parameter using this kind of geometry, using Vulgan. Using Vulgan. So final remark is: one more remark is: if we require feed open, then we can fix the local correspondence such that the corresponding generic representation corresponding to exactly the trivial character of the AF hat. This should be one standard result in look-long correspondence. Okay, here we propose a conjecture which generalizes this one. So the first thing is the gross process and RADIS conjecture can be listed as follows. So a generic, sorry, a error packet, it contains a generic representation if and only if the corresponding error parameter is generic. Sorry, the error parameter is open. The field open. Feed open. One generalization of this is the following. So we conjecture that this ABB packet, it contains a generic representation, if and only if it is open. Okay, so the next sentence just explains that what is indeed a generalization of the bar. So for example, if phi is open, we know that this pi phi EBB is the same as pi phi. The same as pi phi, so it contains a generic rep it contains a generic representation. Conversely, if phi is not open, in general we know that this pi phi b is larger than pi phi. So this conjecture just sees that even pi phi b is larger. It cannot contain any generic representation if phi is not open. So this indeed generalizes the above one. The above one. Okay, we can also prove the following thing. Okay, if G is the causes rate and the classic group, that means if you assume the result of this conjecture, if you assume this conjecture, then we can prove uh the the following conjecture. So it looks like the the bottom one is a generalization of the bar. It it turns out that somehow they are equivalent. Somehow they are equivalent. So the top also implies the bottom. So if feed the error parameter of G, and then this guy contains a generic representation if and only feed open. That's just the rest of the list conjecture. So this conjecture now is true for quasi-subdicted class groups. I believe I will skip this part. This explains somehow the geometric. So what should we do to prove this zero? We do to prove it zero? So, what kind of geometry we should do to prove it zero? Actually, the geometry is quite easy. Okay, the next part is when we restrict everything to other type. So, we recall that air parameter is called tempered if its restriction to WF is bounding. It's called tempered, tempered, sorry, tempered if. called tempered tempered sorry tempered if its restriction into w is tempered so we know that if it's tempered then pi phi the airpeggl so every representation in pi phi is representation so that's the reason we call this kind of parameter temper so if phi is tempered then we know that phi is of aster type we mentioned this before and we have a proposition to characterize the tempered error parameter so error parameter is a tempered So an error parameter is tempered just if and only if it is both of author type and open. So this gives a geometric dis description of a tempered air parameter. Okay, so here comes the Shahidi conjecture. In 1999, Shahidi conjectured the following. So if phi is tempered as in type phi, it must contain a generic representation. So we know generic representation is very important. know genetic reputation is very important in the study of automorphic reputation. For example, in the study of in the London Shahidi method. So he basically assumes everything is generic. So that's a reason Shahidi would like to expect such thing as true. This conjecture has been checked by many different authors. So the following, later, just very recently, Shahidi proposed Shahidi proposed the following enhanced conjecture. You see the following: so, assume that we have an arsenal package theory. Okay, so actually this kind of assumption is just to make sure we have an arsenal package theory. Then it says that the pipe side contains a generic reputation if and only if size is tempered. Actually, this one indeed implies the above one, so it is indeed. The above one. So in it is indeed an intensive conjecture. So we know that if psi is temporarily then pipe psi is the same as pi pi phi. So the air packet is the same as the other packet. And if side, so the new container of this conjecture just says that if psi is not tempered, then pipe psi, it cannot contain any generic reputation. Some history of this. Of this, Ba In Liu and Shahidi proved this conjecture for quasi-specific class groups and certain assumptions. And later, Bai Inlio and his two students, Heather Tan and Shi Hong Lo, they proved the enhanced shid for displayed SO2R and SP2N. Actually, if you assume the if you assume this, if you assume the previous uh Bogan's conjecture, Boggin's conjecture. So if we assume that the pipe ABB equals pipe psi, actually the previous conjecture implies the enhanced shaded conjecture. So the previous one is somehow a generalization of this. So here, in your joint work, work with Bai Inliu and Hazu Ching and Xi Hong Lo, we somehow propose a new framework to We somehow propose a new framework to solve this. Okay, so for first concept is given psi, we define sine height. Sine height is you just switch to the last two answer two. And we know that for a given representation, we can define over evolution pi height. Okay, so the theorem says that this the previous Jahides conjecture follows from the following three assumptions. The first one is if pi is in pipe psi, Pi is the impipe psi, then somehow the orbit of pi must be larger than the orbit of psi. This is again a geometric description of description of the pipe size. It's not a characterization, but it's a property the pipe size should satisfy. And moreover, we expect. And moreover, we expect desire. So when we switch psi to psi hat, we just switch pi to pi hat. And the final assumption is for any generic representation, pi arc0, its dual, its overdue, should be in the error packet of the lower, of the zero orbit. So this phase. So, this phi zero is just a zero orbit in this V lambda. So, the inherent ID control should follow from these three assumptions. There are some comments about these three assumptions. So, first thing is assumption two is it was proved by Bing Shu for at least for these two groups, probably for more general groups. Can I make a comment approach? Approach. I mean, this one. Okay, the third one is essentially checked by author. So if pi is generic, then it's two, its operator is in a zero orbit. Assumption one appeared as a conjecture in one of the papers. So this somehow sees a very important geometric property of. Somehow, see the very important geometric property of other packets. The following is a sketch of the proof of the proof theorem. Actually, the proof of this is very, very easy. Okay, so given pi, we can consider this superside pi. Let's call it side pi. That means the of the Of the other parameters of psi, such that pi is continuing in pipe psi. So, assumption one says that if we take the lower orbit, the zero orbit, then if pi is here, then if psi pi must be a singleton. It cannot be anything because if pi is in pi phase zero, it cannot be larger than any other one. Okay, so it must be a single. And assumption two sees that if we switch pi and pi pi height, we just switch psi and pi psi height, so there should be a bijection between these two sides. And assumption three sees that if you assume that pi upper zero is generic, then pi zero height is in the lower orbit. But in the lower orbit, pipe psi zero height should be singleton by the first assumption. Assumption and by assumption two, this two is a bijection. So this pipes beside pi zero, pi rpi zero should also be a single term. So that's essentially the that's essentially the enhanced idea conjecture. That means there is only a single psi which can contain generic representation, no other psi which can contain generic representation. Sure. That's a good question. Okay, I don't know. I I don't know. I don't know. That's a good question. We can probably ask Nicholas. Do you notice? Okay, how about other? I mean, are about author i mean uh do we know any other other author packet that contains generic recognition if beside non-generic sorry if besides non-temporary okay so hopefully this is also true for real groups okay our next result is that uh we we just checked the assumption one for for these two groups the the Groups. So we give a new proof of these two groups. We give a new proof of the enhanced ID. So the proof of one, it uses very explicit construction of other packets, which is due to Moglin and Bing Shu and Autobik and Bai Inliu and his two students. Okay, the final final part is Part is the final part is some consequence of cousin lost take. So, cousin lost stake appeared quite naturally in the geometry. So, many people see that the cousin of stake is known, but probably Peter has a student who is still checking this, trying to write down proof of this very explicitly, probably for many groups, for general groups. Okay, so here is the Okay, so here is the cardinalistic. So cardinal lost take says that okay, so for for any pi in in this, it's an eraser representation. So there exists a proverb shift, okay, so somehow we call it co-standard, right? Co-standard representative co-standard prover shift and such that for each pair, pi pi prime, so the masculinity of pi prime appeared in the standard module of pi of the standard model of pi of pi is the same as the manifestation of m pi appeared in the t pi prime. t pi prime is the private shape associated with pi prime. The good thing about this is you are the right hand side is somehow computable. It's somehow relatively easy to compute. We can see some examples. For example, if we fix a lambda and fix the open orbit C proper zero in this we like C upper zero in this V lambda, and for any other for any other object C, we can compute this multiple state. So, what kind of thing is this? So, here, this is a generic representation. So, this is a generic representation. This corresponds to the open orbit and the trivial character in AC leader head. And this one is a co-standard for high phi C1. That means it's any phi. Okay, sorry. It's any phi. Okay, so sorry, it's any phi, but we require the character on any phi is a trivial. We can compute this very explicitly. This matrix is actually one. Okay, that's the first result. The second one is so if we require if we require the if we just consider the open orbit, even we vary this row. This row is a is a character of this. Zero is a character of this group, but it's not trivial anymore. So we can show that its costenship is just the corresponding shape defined by some point in the local correspondence. Okay. So here is a easy, it's just an immediate consequence of risk calculation and the risk conjecture. So we computed it. So we computed this and we can now transfer this to reputation theory. In the reputation theory, the radical side, we can see the following. So if pi zero is a generic representation corresponding to phi arp zero, and for any phi, we assume, of course, we assume they have the same lambda, then this pi zero, this generic representation must appear in the standard module player. There, with a much listed one. And for any other pi in the open orbit, even if it's not generic, its standard module is irreducible. This one corresponding to the second part. Okay, the last one is somehow a generalization of a customized Shah Shahidi sta standard model conjecture. So Shahidi's standard model conjecture says that if if pi is generic, then its standard standard model is ir irreducible. Standard module is irreducible. And this one sees that even we don't require pi the generic, but just if it is in the open orbit, that's enough to see each standard module is reducible. Actually, this result is known without using the cardinality. But I think it's nice to give this a geometric description. Okay, one final page is: we can see something about central character in other packets if you assume the customer stake. So if you assume the customer stake, actually if you look at this, if you look at this statement, we can see that the the central character of this one must be the s must be the same as the central character of this one. Be the same as the central character of this one because it appeared in as a sub-cotion of this. So this should have the same central character. So this will give us that for any phi, the central character of this representation is the same as the generic representation. But also for any phi, it's expected that for any two representation in the pi phi, they should have the same central calculation. This should have the same central character. So we can denote this central character by MXP. So each pi phi, each representation in pi phi, they should have the same central character. So the current says that if phi1, phi2, they have the same lambda, then they should have the same central character. And so, as a consequence of this, we know that if pi 1, pi 2 are two representations, they have the same lambda, then they should have the same central character. So in other words, we know that representation in this packet, this should have the same central character. Actually, we expect this true for other packets, but I don't know if it's known in general. Okay, that's always stopped here, so
