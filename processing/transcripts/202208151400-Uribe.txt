To a general audience. And so, we are for our first talk, we are very excited to welcome Alejandro Uribe from the University of Michigan. And he's going to talk to us about the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues of the Dirich-Leighten Reimann operator on the ball. Thank you. Thank you, David. Thank you, everyone, for coming to the talk and to the organizers for the opportunity to speak. To speak. So, I'm going to talk about the well, the title: the Didi Slave Engine Operator for the Schrodinger Operator on the ball. That part of the Schrodinger operator did not make it into the already long title. This is joint work in progress with Salvador Pérez Esteva and Carlos Villegas from the Instituto de Matemáticas de la Unam. Okay, well, so let me. Okay, well, so let me start with. We can skip that because whenever I see a talk with a table of content, I always forget the table of content anyway. So anyway, I want to start by describing the operator that we're interested in. So for now, let's take a smooth and bounded domain omega in Rd, and then we give ourselves a function q that is smooth. A function q that is smooth up to the boundary. And we form the associated, let's form the associated Schrodinger operator where the Laplacian has a minus sign here, the geometer's Laplacian. And MQ is the operator of multiplication by Q. Now, let's assume that zero is not in the Dirichlet spectrum of LQ. That's necessary in order to define the operator. Necessary to, in order to define the operator. So that means that we have this operator RQ, which is the Dirichlet resolvent. So it's an operator from H minus 1B into H10B. This is the Soviet space of functions with zero trace. That's the Dirichlet part of the condition, and it satisfies this property. So it's a right. T. So it's a right inverse, so that's the Nirschley resolvent. And using that, oops, I'm the first time I use this piece of software, so I'm only learning how to do this. So then if we have a function on the boundary, then we can extend it to the domain. You see the regularity there, and then we can form this difference. Reference, the extension minus the resolvent on LQ of F. And this function u satisfies LQU equals zero, and you restricted to the boundary equal to the small f that we defined. That's this condition here can be seen by applying LQ to this definition here. And the fact that RQ is the parametrix with usually boundary conditions. Parametrix with the usual boundary condition. And therefore, we can then define the operator that we want called capital lambda n by taking, so applied to the f that we had above. What we do is we take this function u that is unique and then take its normal derivative. Here, of course, there is an explicit restriction to the boundary, the normal derivative at the boundary. The normal derivative at the boundary. And we take the outer pointing normal for this. So this is the Dirichlet to Neumann operator that can be defined under the condition that the zero is not. I mean, you can define it for LQ provided that zero is not in the Dirichlet spectrum of LQ. And it's a general theorem that already was, I think, alluded to this morning. Already was, I think, alluded to this morning, this morning, that lambda q is a first-order self-adjoint two-differential operator. And the principal symbol of this operator is the Riemannian norm function on the boundary. And so the symbol is positive. The symbol I will be using throughout the talk, I will be using the standard theory of pseudo-differential operators. Pseudo-differential operators with polyhomogeneous symbols on manifolds and facts about them. So, in the statement of this theorem, of course, being the first instance of that. And so we take, so the symbol is defined on the puncture cotangent bundle of the boundary. And it's a positive function. And so, by general theory, since the boundary. General theory, since the boundary is compact, the spectrum of lambda q is discrete and bounded below. Um, so I am new to this to the study of this operator. I have never written about it before. And so I don't exactly know when, where this was first proved. But anyway, there are computations that in very similar analogous settings for Laplacians with variable coefficients, for the Schrodinger operator, and many others. The Schrodinger operator and many others, where the computations are the technique of proving this theorem is very similar one to the other. And I put in some references here. I wanted to mention something that I believe is... So this morning there was mention of the Steklov problem and the Steklov eigenvalues. And again, that's a piece of the problem. Again, that's a piece of math that I don't know very well, but it seems to me that in order to claim that that spectrum is the same as the Dirichlet-Norman-ton-Neumann spectrum, you need to have the Dirichlet-Neumann operator. The statement of the Steclov, the construction of the Steclov eigenvalues does not make reference to that. And the condition is that the zero should not be in the Dirichlet spectrum of the operator on the domain. The operator on the domain. So there is that small difference that I learned from my collaborators. I think that the diff, to clarify, I think this morning Q is assumed to be zero and therefore zero is not in the Dirichlet spectrum. All right. Thank you. Okay, so that's very general. And oops, again, I'm learning to use this thing. Now, we're going to restrict our attention to the ball. And so by the ball, I mean, this could be done in higher dimensions. I mean, this could be done in higher dimensions, but we've been working in three dimensions, and some of the results that we're going to mention are specific to three dimensions. And so, the geometry is very concrete. We will very much be using the spectrum of the spherical Laplacian, which is the radial part of the ordinary R3 Laplacian. And I stole this, I should give this nice figure. You can find that. It's a commons license figure in. Figuring in Wikipedia. And to explain our results or the structure of the spectrum of the Git-Neumann operator in this case, we need to have a close look at or a reminder of the spectrum of the spherical Laplacian acting on functions on the sphere. So this is very beautiful and very, very classical. The L2 of the sphere, so this block here. This block here. L2 of the sphere breaks as the direct orthogonal direct sum of the space of spherical harmonics. So HK is a space of all spherical harmonics of degree K. Oops. Harmonics is with C, I know that. And the eigenvalue, these are the eigenspaces of the Laplacian and the eigenvalue on HK. And the eigenvalue on h k is more or less k squared, and the dimensions grow linearly. And hk can be thought of as well, or is as well, equal to the restrictions to the sphere of harmonic homogeneous polynomials of degree k in R3. And they can also, they also are the irreducible SO3 subspaces of. SO3 subspaces of L2. So SO3, of course, acts on the sphere and therefore on L2. And these are the irreducible subspaces. Each one is a different representation of SO3. And as a corollary of that, we can immediately see what Lambda 0 is. So Lambda 0 is the same, the notation is consistent, is Lambda Q with Q equals 0. Okay, so if you don't have, and you can see it. Don't have, and you can see it from here because then you're looking at harmonic at boundary values of harmonic harmonic functions. So you take the HK, something in HK, it's already by this description of what the harmonospherical harmonics is, you already know that it's the restriction of a homogeneous polynomial of degree k. And when you take the radial derivative, you get back the degree of the polynomial. So what happens then is that So, what happens then is that h0 are restricted to hk is k times the identity. So, the hk are also the eigen spaces of lambda 0. And you could even see that lambda 0, therefore, is something like, I shouldn't be doing this, but I'm something like this. You complete the square, it's more or less a normalized square root of the Laplacian. It's a completion of the square or something like that. The square, or something like that. So, lambda zero is completely explicit. Now, what happens when we add the potential term? Well, so then we can write lambda q, the Dirichlet element with Q, as Lambda zero plus whatever it is that remains, this S which we call SQ. And the lemma is that SQ is of order minus one, it's a side O of order minus one. Order minus one. And the principal symbol is explicit. And so this typesetting here is a little bit maybe hard to read. It's just the Q restricted to the sphere divided by Q. Okay, so the boundary values of the potential show up as the principal symbol of SQ. And now from here. And now from here, we can conclude something about the spectrum of lambda q, namely that they form clusters around the spectrum of lambda zero. So this precise statement is that there is some constant, which is essentially the L2 norm of multiplication by Q, such that the spectrum of lambda Q is contained in shrink. Q is contained in shrinking intervals here around the sequence of natural numbers. So the picture, and I'll show you a slide later on, but the picture basically is that if this is a real line and this is a natural number k, then the eigenvalues will be contained in an interval of order one over k here. And moreover, the multiplicity, the number of Moreover, the multiplicity, the number of eigenvalues in here will be the same as the dimension of the corresponding space of spherical harmonics. So the number of eigenvalues there is growing. So technically then, not technically, I mean, we can write the lambda kjs, which are the eigenvalues of the actual lambda q. It's very convenient to write them as. To write them as k plus whatever you need to add or subtract to get the actual eigenvalue. So again, this may not be the best software for this, but because the what I write goes away after a little while. Anyway, so the mu KJ are the shifts from the From the unperturbed eigenvalues. You can think of this in terms of perturbation theory. And I would want to motivate to why these clusters have to exist in this way. And so it is based on ideas from, you can see it in terms of perturbation theory. It's probably easier to think about the square of lambda q, which is lambda zero squared plus now r, where r is now of order zero. R is now of order zero. Being of order zero, it's bounded in L2 on the sphere. And then you can think of using the minimax principle for computing the eigenvalues of lambda q. And so for the minimax principle, you're supposed to look at Rayleigh quotients or metric or, you know, expectation values on unit vectors. And you can see that the quadratic form of lambda q from here is going to be is going to be bounded by that of lambda q. bounded by that of lambda zero plus the L2 norm of R, which is some fixed number. And so that means that the spectrum of the square of Lambda Q are inside interval center now at the squares of K plus or minus a fixed constant, fixed with respect to K. And so from here, so these guys are formed, these eigenvalues of lambda q squared, they fill out a fixed An interval of fixed length as k tends to infinity around k squared, and when you take the square root, you get the previous picture. Oops. And the following are the main invariants that I want to talk about. So how do you study a spectrum that looks like that? Well, since there's so much structure to it, and we're thinking about And we're thinking about it really as a perturbation of the spectrum corresponding to q equals zero. We want to look at precisely the distribution of these shifts mu kj. So here's a theorem that has kind of a long history, especially for the for Laplaci potential on the two-sphere. So the Schrodinger operator on the two-sphere, which is Which is well a similar situation to what we have. That's where these invariants first arose. Anyway, what do we do? So let's go over this slide. So the claim is that there are distributions, compactly supported distributions, beta i on the real line, that give us the distribution of the mu k, so the shifts, in the following sense, for every test function phi. And we want it to be smooth in order to. And we want it to be smooth in order to have the full asymptotic expansion. Then we take the average of phi on k times the shifts. So this k there in blue is present so that, remember that the mu kj's are bounded by one over k, are bounded by the constant over k. So the mu kj's themselves are shrinking, but then by Are shrinking, but then by hand, we're going to put in here a factor of k. So, in order to spread them out and have a very nice, it's a Zegel limit theorem type. And so the claim is then that these averages, density of states, or whatever you want to call them, for every test function have an expansion as k tends to infinity in decreasing powers of. In decreasing powers of k. And the coefficients, of course, depend on the test function and they define distributions on the real line, these are the beta i. And what beta zero is, is not very hard to compute. Beta zero, the principal simple calculus of two differential operators, well, I'll tell you exactly what beta zero is in a moment. It's very beautiful. Moment, it's very beautiful, but it's fairly straight, it's straightforward to figure out what it is. It's a measure, it's a measure, and DMUQ is a push-forward measure that I'll describe later. The higher order betas are the ones that are of interest in our work, especially just what the next one is, okay? And how to compute those. And how to compute those. And those are much more difficult to compute. But you know, as everybody here knows, computing spectral invariance is one of the traditions in the subject. And once you have spectral invariance, you can try using them for either direct or inverse problems. So it's very natural to try to obtain information from the higher order betas. And that's really what the talk is about. How do we get a handle? How do we get a handle on the higher betas? Is there any way to compute them? So, here is an actual numerical example of something similar. I don't know if you can see. It's a little bit hard to see. There isn't, I mean, these are actual eigenvalues of a matrix that would give us an approximate cluster. And you can see that the only thing to see is that, you know, here they are very dense and here they are less dense. And that kind of, that is the kind of data. And that is the kind of phenomenon that the previous theorem is telling you something much more precise about, because it's a full asymptotic expansion in terms of distributions. So where does this theorem come from? Well, as I said, as I said, around the late 70s or early 80s, people were looking, of course, people working on spectral theory and a very People working on spectral theory, and a very natural thing to study is the Schrodinger operator on the sphere. And so, um, Einstein in 77 studied delta Sn plus V, where here V is not Q. V here is a smooth function on Sn. So it's all surface data. And the same thing is true, except that you have K squared instead of K and so on. There are some differences, but you still get clusters in the setting. Clusters in this setting. And Colande Verdiera was also studying more generally spectrum side os with periodic pie characteristics. I'll explain what those are in a moment. But in particular, the Laplacian-Onzol metrics is another example of that class of operators. They are very special, but they have a very rich, interesting structure. And Yelemin continued the study that Weinstein had started. Einstein had started. So I put his 81 paper on the references as well. So what are these by characteristics? Well, they are the Hamilton trajectories of the principal symbol of lambda q. So this should have been a lambda q. Okay, we're talking about the spectrum of lambda q. And so the symbol of that is the norm of c, the co-vector part. There's a clash of notation. So my field. A class of notation. So, my figure here, I identify the cotangent bundle with the tangent bundle. And so the figure is a point on this P on the sphere. And V is a tangent vector. And for Mach C, the Hamilton trajectories of that are simply geodesics parameterized by arc length. And so in the case of this field, And so, in the case of the spheres, they're just great circles, gamma, and they are parametrized by arc length. So, the Hamilton trajectories are all periodic of smallest period 2 pi. Are there any questions? And so, in particular, of course, they are all periodic, and Anculin de Verdier's theorem applies. And what the theorem says, says, I didn't write it in detail, but it says. Don't write it in detail, but it says that the clustering phenomena will occur whenever you have such an operator with periodic by characteristics. So, let me tell you what the first invariant is. And so, I have to introduce the space of oriented geodesics of S2. So, the oriented geodesics of S2, as I said a moment ago, geodesics are great circles. I'm going to try to draw. I'm going to try to draw here. So, if you think about here is supposed to be a sphere, this is a great circle. And a great circle is defined by a normal vector. So, maybe I can use my hand, you use the right-hand rule to see that an oriented circle on the sphere is given, if I use my right hand, is given by my thumb direction. And it's the same as an oriented two-plane. And so the space of the space of... The space of oriented geodesics, so a point on this on script O, calligraphical is a great circle, an oriented great circle, is the same as the Grasmanian of oriented two planes in R3. And by the right-hand rule, it's the same as another copy of S2. But it's very important to distinguish between script O and S2. In high dimensions, script O is not the same as a sphere. It's again your Grass-Mayen of two plus. Again, you're a Grand Manion of two planes in Rn or N plus one, and always, always in any dimension, always, always a symplectic manifold, symplectic manifold, because it's a symplectic quotient of the cotangent bundle of dimension 2n minus 2 for Sn. And anyway, we can define the Reynolds transform on S2. Of on S2, which maps, say, smooth functions on S2 to smooth functions on O simply by integrating any function Q on each oriented geodesic with respect to arc length and normalizing. So you get an even function in the sense that if you Q hat is an even function. You um, q hat is an even function in the sense that if you change the orientation of gamma, you get the same number. But nonetheless, it's um, it's very useful to think of it as going into the oriented geodesics. And then what is beta zero? Beta zero is the push forward. Here's the formula for beta zero. Beta zero is the push forward of a certain measure here. So, as you can imagine. So, as you can imagine, the space of geodesics has a nice invariant measure that comes from the geometric construction. Let's normalize it to have it mass one. So, it's an OSO3 invariant measure with total mass one. And so we take, so here's a recipe. You take the potential, which is a smooth function on the ball, you restrict it to the sphere, you take its Radon transform. So now you have a function Q hat on the space of oriented geodesics. Space-oriented geodesics, and then uh, so I forgot to put the test function on the right-hand side. I'm sorry, you always discover some typos when you do this. So, the test function is here, should be here. Okay, you compose the test function, any test function phi with this phi hat. Now you have a function on all that you integrate. So, beta zero, then what I should have written is that this is the push forward measure, push forward. Push forward of this D-gamma measure by the Radon transfer. And we're going to see how this comes about more or less in what follows. So how does one go about proving, say, this theorem and trying to understand the higher order invariance? Well, so the thing to do. Well, so the thing to do is to understand better how these clusters are formed. I gave you an argument based on the minimax principle, but that's certainly not nearly enough. And so there's something called the averaging method, which is what Gilliman and Weinstein used. Colande de Verdier used something slightly different. So here's the averaging method. And what I call, which gives rise to the centralizer of the Laplacian on the two-sphere. The averaging method is the following theorem. There exists Q, a side EO on the two-sphere or of order minus one, such that lambda Q, our operator of interest, is unitarily equivalent to Lambda zero plus capital Q. And the great advantage is that now. And the great advantage is that now capital Q commutes with lambda zero. Okay, so up to a unit applying a unitary conjugation, which by the way, the unitary operator is a pseudo-differential operator of order zero itself, but that will not matter. You can reduce to the perturbation. Remember, lambda q, we had written it as lambda q was written as lambda zero plus sq. Well, we can conjugate. SQ, well, we can conjugate this to something else that looks the same with it, but it has the enormous, the Q capital Q has the enormous advantage of commuting with this. And so it maps for each K, the K, the HK, the spherical harmonics of the degree K into themselves. And now it's a matrix. It's a finite dimensional, that restriction, Q restricted to HK, is now a finite dimensional self-adjoint operator. So you can. Self-adjoint operator, so you can diagonalize it, and those are the mu k's. Those are exactly the mu k's. And so we really are trying to find asymptotics of the trace, normalized asymptotics of the trace of a function. Okay, there is this lambda zero because we put a k in front of the mu k's, right? Remember, we had k times mu k j sum over j. And so anyway, that k will not matter a lot, actually. But we're basically trying to take functions of trying to take functions of of of of q lambda zero q and then taking the trace of that now this operator q uh the method consists of first trying to to to get a hold of what this capital q is and this capital q is constructed um in the say in the pseudo differential world by successive approximations so that's why the word method averaging i think that's where it comes from right method is something that you do over and over again Method is something that you do over and over again. And so, what is the averaging method? Well, so a key role is played by the exponential e to the i t lambda zero. So the eigenvalues of this are e to the i t k because the eigenvalues of lambda zero are just natural numbers. And so e to the i t lambda zero is a unitary group that is two pi periodic. It is two pi periodic. And so And so for any psychiatric A, one can define the average, a average of that, which is simply you act on A by conjugation by this exponential. And since you have a two pi periodic group, you can take the average of that from zero to two pi with respect to t. This is actually, I didn't write it down, but this is actually the same. So not. Actually, the same, so not itself, but when you restrict this to hk, is the same as making a kind of a topless operator where pi k here is the projector onto hk. So you're just compressing the operator into to be diagonal, block diagonal with respect to the decomposition into k order spherical harmonic. Decay order spherical harmonics. By Yegorov theorem, this averaged operator is again a pseudo-differential operator with the same order as A. And the principal symbol is, well, I have to take, by Igorov's theorem, I have to take, compose the symbol of A with the Hamilton flow associated to this Fourier integral operator, and then take. And then take the average of that, of those functions of t, and that's exactly what you get. That's exactly how you get the Radon transform. So the symbol of A average is the Radon transform of the symbol of A. Now here I am making a bit of a jump because this is really a function on the quotangent bundle of the sphere minus the zero section. Whereas this, I told you, was a function from the space of orbit. function from the space of orbits into the the complex number say but you see the the the average this thing thing here is invariant is constant on each by characteristic so we can just restrict it to the unit tangent bundle and and it becomes a function on the orbit space um and and and not surprisingly this av for a all of these averaged operators commute with lambda zero so here i tried to explain a little So, here I tried to explain a little bit as to how we can identify functions that are constant with respect to the bicaracteristic flow with functions on all. And then using this averaging method, we can start constructing this operator capital Q that is that we want to get that cusaged values are the mu kj's. So here's the So here's the beginning of the, or well, a couple of steps of this averaging method, which is that our original operator is unitarily equivalent to this guy here. So we have lambda 0, which is of order 1. Then we have the average of SQ, which is of order minus 1. And then we get another term, which is of order minus 3. And then this is of order minus 5. They go down by. Order minus five, they go down by twos. And I point out that here we have an average, so this commutes, there's an average here, so this thing commutes, and we can stop here. I mean, we chose to stop here, but you can keep going. So I'm going to ignore this thing. And F, I know there are many details in what I want to tell you, and time is running. So F is something you construct explicitly. Something you construct explicitly, okay, out of the data, and it satisfies this kind of cohomological equation. Okay, and so what is the proof of this proposition? Well, because you have such a relationship, you use this F, you exponentiate F and that, and use that to conjugate lambda Q. And then you can do an expansion in terms of iterated commutators, which makes sense in the pseudo-differential sense. And the first correction that you get is this. And using this property and some computations, you get the kind of expansion that you want. Okay. You have to do this twice to get this second term here. But this thing here will give you the first correction, but you can keep going. You can average up to a point, and then you have something that doesn't commute anymore, but you can do something analogous again, you get another term. So now we are then led to introduce to the ring of pseudo-differential operators that commute with the Laplacian. That's because we are in such a special space, this is a very sizable object. Okay, meaning it's it has there are lots of operators that commute with a Laplacian. And the claim is that there is a complete There is a complete symbolic calculus for these operators. See, when you work on manifolds and you try to do spectral theory of manifolds, as you know, one of the obstacles you have is that you don't have a global, I mean, depending on what you want to do, but one of the problems is, of course, you don't have good coordinates that you can work on systematically in general. And so, if you want to do through differential computations through all orders, it quickly becomes, I mean, it's difficult. I mean, it's difficult here as well, but at least I claim that there is an inheritance, a natural complete calculus on the ring of two differential operators that commute with a Laplacian. And those are based on the so-called coherent states. So there are very special spherical harmonics that we call coherent states. So let me tell you, I'm looking at the clock on the wall. Let me tell you more or less. Wall. Let me tell you more or less how they go. So I take a unit tangent vector for each unit tangent vector as in the figure before. There's a P and the V. Then, sorry, I got, there's another typo here. I apologize. This would be p plus iv dot x. X. Okay, so maybe I can just tell you what it is. If I choose this tangent vector here, then I get x plus iy to the power, x plus iy. It's just a complex coordinate if I choose this tangent vector. I start at 1000 100 and then the vector. zero and then the vector v is zero one zero so it's just a complex coordinate on the plane corresponding to the geodesic um and uh so it's a complex coordinate and so um it's harmonic and not only that but any power of it continues to be harmonic okay and um and in fact it concentrates on the geodesics determined by z so i'm sorry i didn't explain this very well Explain this very well. But think of the equator and then the function x plus iy to the kth power. Okay, and that you can then let the rotation group act and you get all the alpha z k's. And they, for various z's, they, I mean, they concentrate like x plus i y to the k concentrates on the equator. And if I And if I take the L2 inner product with another one corresponding to a geodesic that is not the equator, then there's a beautiful formula, an exact formula for what their inner product is. And it's less than one, except if they are actually the same geodesic or they lie on the, you know, it's the same geodesic. And so using those, one can define the Veresian symbol of an operator by taking the Of an operator by taking the matrix coefficient for every z, I have my alpha zk. Alpha zk is a spherical harmonic of degree k. And we can then take the, these are normalization constants, given any operator a, its Beresin symbol is a function of k and z that is simply the matrix coefficient of a on alpha z. And that is now a function. Is now a function of k and of z. Now, z was original on the tangent bundle, but you see, if I choose a different z on the same geodesic, the alphas are going to change by a phase factor, which will cancel between these two. So in fact, we get a function of n times the quadrant orbit. And some of the properties of this is that this actually determines the operator. This actually determines the operator. And the trace property is that the trace of A, AK here is A restricted to HK. Okay, that's just given by the integral of, I didn't write this correctly again. I'm sorry. I spent a long time doing this and I still messed it up. Okay, so it's given by the integral of this function for a k fixed. Fixed. So anyway, we have this, and they have in, so if you fix a and let k tend to infinity, then these matrix coefficients have a beautiful asymptotic expansion to all orders on functions a j that are on this Grasmanian. And there is a star product, and this is the simple calculus that I was alluding to at the beginning. So you can At the beginning, so you can this this ring of commuting operators is is is a ring, and so you can ask for the symbol of the comp of the composition of two, and you get the claim is that there is a power series that gives you the symbol of the composition, and you get a star product then on this Grasmanian O. And there's something known about these Bs that appear here. These B's that appear here, and it is indeed a star product that in the direction of the symplectic structure of O. One of the fun things about this project is that I proved this in work that I did nearly 40 years ago. It was the first thing I did after my PhD. The paper appeared in 84. And I didn't touch this for decades until Carlos and Salvador brought up this problem. And we've been able to use this successfully, which is a fun thing for me since it's been so many years. I can't believe it. Anyway, given the time that I can see is running very quickly, I wanted to say in more detail how having a symbol calculus allows you to take, to compute the invariance. If you have the full symbol of this capital Q. So the Capital Q. So the message here at the end of this thing, this slide that I won't go in detail, is that if you give me the symbol of Q in the sense that I just told you, then the calculus that I did 40 years ago, in principle, allows you to compute the beta. Okay, so that's where we are. If we only have the Berescent symbol of capital Q, then we can plug it into the machine I developed four years ago. Machine I developed four years ago, and we get information now. However, it's not so easy to find the Beresian symbol of Q. Okay, so there's a whole strategy that was new to me to compute the Beresian symbol of Q. And so the main thing to do, and now we have to work inside the ball. Remember that this lambda Q is arises from a boundary value problem. So now we have to work inside. We need to, I mean, this. We need to, I mean, the problem is to compute, remember, this is these kinds of matrix elements. We have to compute these kinds of matrix elements. And here is the proposition. So that's an expansion of what, the beginning of the expansion of the symbol of capital Q, the full symbol of capital Q. And so here there are these A0, sorry, there are these. There are these terms here. And then the hats, here are hats. I don't know if they're easy to see. So these are Radon transforms. So these are Radon transforms. And the leading term is just Q. So AQ hat is Q hat. That's going to give us a beta zero. That's the principal symbol calculus. And the next term, the new thing is that it involves now the radial derivatives. So now we have to take. So now we have to take the Radon transform of Q of its radial derivative and of the Laplacian, the spherical Laplacian of Q. And then they get more and more complicated. Now, this proposition comes from a different set of techniques that it's a very nice series of techniques or beautiful tricks that I am going to have. I am going to have to really rush over. But essentially, the beginning of it all is if you want to compute this SQ of a coherent state. So now here it's a little bit ambiguous because these functions, remember, they are like something like x plus iy to the k. But now that's what they are on this side. But on this side, they are being acted on by RQ. So these are their. So these are the same functions, but as functions on the ball. Okay? And one can then check this. This is basically just looking at the definitions carefully. And then there's a first application of Green's theorem tells us that what we need to be computing if we want to get the answer to what is the Verescent symbol of this thing is the, but here you see it becomes hard because here's a resolvent. Hard because here's the resolvent, the resolvent of the Schrodinger operator. We need to compute this matrix coefficient. So, how can we get a hold of that? Well, there is a method. First, one shows that there is an identity here that one can prove, where U is this object that we need to compute, the resolvent of Q acting on Q alpha ZK, and it satisfies this relation. And it satisfies this relation, which you can use recursively. Now, the point is that here we have R0, the free resolvent. Okay, and it's just algebra, but it's a very nice fact. And then you can iterate this. You can iterate this because Q appears here. Q appears here. So you can iterate the identity algebraically and you get something that looks like this. That looks like this, where you get powers of this operator. Now, these operators are zero, are smoothing, they are the resolvent of the free Laplacian. I mean, LQ itself is, but anyway, we want to keep track of the dependence on Q. And so it turns out that this gives us an asymptotic expansion in K. So harmonic analysis enters here to show that we get an expansion in K. We get an expansion in k that these objects are getting smaller and smaller with respect to k as j increases. So we have some expansion like that. And then there's further trick to then get rid of, well, compute the whole thing. We still have R0 to deal with, but there's more integration by parts and stationary phase arguments. Arguments and so the conclusion finally, looking at the time again, is that we can compute beta one, okay? And beta one is, and we get a hold of the shape of the follow of the higher betas. So, beta one, let's look at beta one here. So, we have beta one acting on a test function is now the derivative of test function. Now, the derivative of test function. This is the derivative of test function composed with the Radon transform of Q. And now we have this measure here. Before we only had the D gamma, but now Q itself is highly nonlinear. And, well, it's nonlinear in Q here because, so here's the Radon transform of Q, here's the radial, the Radon transform of the radial derivative, and then there is this part as well. And then there is this part as well. And the constants here are explicit. I just didn't want to write them down because I'm actually, I personally, I'm not quite sure, you know, they're explicit fractions, but we're still computing in detail. And now what about the higher order invariance? The higher order invariants can, as I said, Aki wanted to say that they can also be addressed this way. And so they are more complicated. So they are more complicated. They involve the first and second, beta 2 involves the first and second derivatives of the test function. The first derivative term is not so hard to compute, although this A2Q appeared before, it's already quite involved. And the second derivative involves this expression that I have not computed completely, but it's But it's rather complicated. However, you know, in a way, to me, it reminds me of trying to find heat invariance by counting derivatives, you know, and seeing what kinds of things can show up. One can address this problem here as well. And it looks like the beta 2 involves the first and second derivatives of the test function. And the first and second derivatives that are invariant, invariantly defined on Q, the covariantly defined, if you like. So those are going to be the real derivatives and the spherical Laplacian. And so we can expect that that's the general shape of the band invariance. The method gives us that beta j. You see, it's a little bit, to me, it's a little bit nerve-wracking in the sense that we're computing integrals in the end. We need to integrate the. Integrals in the end. We need to integrate the symbol to get these numbers. And there are many, many functions that give you the same integral. So we can compute the function according to the symbol calculus, but then we integrate it and say we get these complicated things. And then I wonder, is there an easier expression that has the same integral? And in fact, it already, to obtain the expressions that you see on the board, already we had to integrate by parts to reduce the order of the distribution. Beta 1 originally appeared. Distribution beta one originally appears as a second derivative of phi times something, but by integrating by parts, we get it down to a first derivative of phi. So there seems to be structure there that we're not easy, that is hard to see, but yeah, so well, we want to understand the actual structure for general J and we want to either try to use them to approximate this spectrum well or to This spectrum well, or to look at perhaps getting some inverse spectral results. Like I'm convinced that the set of equipotential Q's has to be compact, but or something like that. But we're not there yet. We've been computing with this calculus. So thank you very much. All right, everyone. So at this point, I'd like to ask: does anyone have questions for Alejandro, either in the room or online? Are there questions in the chat as well? I can't see it. There aren't any. Anyone? Anyone? Maybe Alejandro, can I ask a quick question? Sure. So I was wondering, you had this asymptotic kind of thing about the dependent, or sorry, the order of the distributions in terms of J. Is there anything could be said about, for example, the differential degree of the coefficients in Q? I'm sure, but I don't have an answer. Okay. But that's the kind of thing that it would be fun to think about. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just, I'm thinking. Yeah, I'm just thinking of like, for example, this Melrose computed this asymptotic expansion or this kind of asymptotic formulas for the heat invariance also in terms of polynomials and integrals of polynomials in the JIT of the curvature. And there were some kind of, yeah, nice dependence that led to things like compactness, for example. Exactly. That's exactly what one possible way to go from here. Exactly. I mean, what you see. I mean, you see, what do I want to say? So, this Perezian calculus that we have been using, the one I wrote about 40 years ago, see, what is actually happening is that this ring of operators that commute with the Laplacian, I just want to show you the inner product here. Where is the formula here? You see, so we really are behind the scenes. Behind the scenes, this ring of two differential operators that commute with the Laplacian is actually in disguise the same thing as the Veresien-Toplis operators on CP1, on the Riemann sphere. So for those of you who have heard about quantification and so on, so this always is symplectic manifold. And struct products have been constructed on symplectic manifolds. This is more than a structure. On symplectic management, this is more than a struct product because we actually have operators associated to functions on O, and there is a symbol calculus. And we, you know, the thing I wrote a long time ago has to do with these Beressian symbols, which are, well, what you see on the board, these are these inner products with coherent states. But there are other star products that are equivalent. You see, there are other ways to define the symbol of an operator. Uh, the symbol of an operator in this sense that may have a simpler, more symmetric calculus, and so there could be simplifications that are happening that that would have might that would happen if we were to use a more different calculus. Um, and that's a very intriguing idea. And so, but anyway, this works, it's messy, but works. As for example, do you think anything is? For example, do you think anything is possible on other symmetric spaces, for example, or extensions of them? I mean. Yeah, so the clustering phenomenon occurs on any, when the boundary is a symmetric space, rank one, though. Yeah. But I'm sure there are extensions that are definitely doable. Thank you very much. Sure. All right. Other questions? All right, other questions? I had a short one. So, beta not to me makes sense. Beta one is already somewhat complicated. Your expression for it. Is there any intuition about the kinds of geometric quantities that are in there, maybe if Q has some sort of symmetry? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really have been computing so hard, but I don't know. Right. Yeah. No, it's a good question. Like, what kind of answer do you think would make? I mean, yes, you can certainly consider cues that have symmetries. Radon transform sort of complicates it, doesn't it? Radon transform complicates it, and that seems to be essential. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, a very artificial assumption to make is that Q restricted to the boundary is a spherical harmonic. Boundary is a spherical harmonic. Now, why would that help? Because then the Laplacian, because then it's for a spherical harmonic, the Radon transform of a spherical harmonic is a constant times itself. Because the Randolph transform is equivariant with respect to the SO3 action, so it has to act on irreducible source spaces by a constant. Incidentally, if Q, so I was going to say. So, I was going to say if q is even, if q is odd, the random transform is zero. Okay? The kernel of the random transform consists exactly of the odd functions on the sphere. So if q restricted to the sphere is odd, then you get zero. But then you have to be careful because then, remember, we want to have a zero is not in the visual spectrum of the operator. So, but maybe that can happen. I don't know. happen i don't know if q is sufficiently small perhaps perhaps small small and odd and then and then the expressions will simplify yeah in in case q is radial okay then what happens then then everything commutes with rotations and these bands reduce to a point to a point that does that is not going to be k it's going to be you know the multiplicity is not broken by by symmetry Broken by symmetry, but it reduces to the whole thing collapses. And then we have an expand, you know, you can ask what happens when you still get a spectrum with a certain multiplicity, but you get a displacement from K, and that can be analyzed. Interesting. Anyway. Yeah. Is there anything else and any other questions on Zoom? If not, I think let's. If not, I think let us thank Alejandro again. Thank you. All right. At this
