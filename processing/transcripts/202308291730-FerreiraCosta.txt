Thank you very much. Firstly, I would like to thank the organizer for this opportunity. It's a pleasure for me to be here in this nice event, if online way, but thank you. Un saludo, a todos ustedes. Okay. The title of my talk is By Lipschild and Differentiable Sufficiency of Weight Jet. Sufficiency of weight jets. This is a joint work with Marcelo Usaya from Fiscar, Brazil, Yicarlos Humberto Jr. from Universidad de Federal do Piaui, Brazil. I would like to thank the FAPES by the financial support of this work. What's the main goal of this work? What is the main goal of this work? The main goal of this work is to investigate the bilips and differential sufficiency, but in the setup of the weight jets, I want to look at the sufficience, but in the set of weight jets of map germs of weight degree. But why are we interested in this subject? First, because it's a classical. First, because it's a classical subject in singularity theory. This subject is related with other k-notions in singularity theory, as for instance, the finite determinacy. And it can be used to investigate the classical problem of classification of elements in singularity theory. Okay? But what does sufficiency sufficient mean? The idea is the following. Give you a map Germany F. The polling. Giving a map journey F, it's unnatural to ask when we can truncate F without affecting the local topological type determined by F. This problem consists of the suffix property of jets. This notion of sufficience was introduced by Hennett Tong when he studied the theory of structural stability to establish the theory of structural stability. After Tong, this subject gained prominence in the singularity theory. In the singularity theory, several authors investigate this problem. We can see the pioneer work, the paper of Ku, the paper about topological sufficiency of jets in 1969, and many other authors investigate the problem of sufficiency of jets or in parallel the problem of finite determinants. We can see many, many, many colleagues, many, many, many researchers. Colleagues, many, many, many researchers. The second reason is that we obtained some results which have more general aspect in some sense, such as our ambient space is the set of CK map germs. Many papers work with same finite map germs or analytic map germs. Our results improve the degree of substance of jets in the classical jet space obtained by takings in the case of functions and obtained by Luis Antonio Favreau, Julio Canillo Martin's formats. Also, we give a simple result in terms of bilips are sophistiant because lips sophisticated was not considered by the previous work of Tackins and Fabromarić. Of packings and fabromarchines. Even we use a similar approach of other papers about substantial jets. In other words, we use techniques involving controlled vector fields. Our construction has a geometric aspect closer than other kinds of Lipschitz constructions. Then maybe it can be more interesting to investigate Lipschitz properties. Lipschitz properties. This was Sijina's commentary. Thank you, Sijin. Also, we obtained similar results obtained by Tackins and Fabromarchins in the setup of weighted jets point of view, considering a new space of jets, the weighted jets, where we fix a weighted W1WN. Another reason, in spirit of the Pony. In spirit of the Paunesque works, we also retain recent results, in fact, in a pre-print about the weight sufficiency of jets, but now modifying the Hermannian metric in the search. When you replace the usual metric by a singular metric, we obtain new results and we can compare these two things. This was suggested by Pawnescu. School and finally, we are interested to compare our estimates about jets with other estimates about finite determinants, for instance. We can see an example of the paper of CG and Marcel Usaya, where they give Where they give conditions of Cl finite determinants. And we can compare this condition of them with our condition in terms of filtrations, for instance. These are some motivations of this work, okay? So now we introduce some ingredients and some notions preliminates. Each German G of Class C. German G of class CK satisfying that the R j of G is the same R jet of F, where Ret of F is denoted by Z, is called a CK healization of Z. An arjet Z is taken to be sufficient in CK if any two CK healizations F and G of Z are G equivalent. Our equivalent here denotes the right equivalence. Denotes the right equivalence given by the change of coordinates in the source. And we include the topological billips and CI are equivalents. Okay. But from now on, we indicate this equivalence just by C0 or Bilips or CI equivalence. There are many characterizations and properties of study of science of jet in the case of topological beliefs. The case of topological bellips and CI. And here we see some authors that investigated this problem. In the topological case, Kuol, Jazef, Boschnak, Quarz, Bushars, and Bilip Sufiens, we have Vallette, for instance, CI Suficienz, Tech, Takim, Scuper, Favor, Marchins. And of course, there are other characterizations of Characterizations of substantial z for other equivalence relations. If we consider, for instance, the equivalence of the z of sets of the V equivalence or right-left equivalence, net A equivalence, the K equivalence. For instance, in this morning, Marielle and Isi talked about problems related to finite determinants, and also problems about Also, problems about finite determinants, about the groups V, A, K. We have many papers about this also. But now we introduce our subjects. Given p vectors v1, vp, Rn, let di the distance from vi to the subspace generated by the other vectors vj, where j is different from i. In the case that vi, the In the case that Vi depends of x, we write dix for the distance. Then this distance di can be expressed in terms of these vi by these expressions. It is not a geometric definition. But there exists a practical method to calculate this distance di's using these inner products about the vectors vj, vk, using the grammatrix. matrix and we call d v1 vp is the minimum of the distance d1x dpx we use we will use this definition of d in the next slide okay for all z in the r head space we introduce the numbers small rz and small r0z given this way here In this way, here is the definition of the previous definition of the minimum of the distance. This kind of inequalities are typical in the problems about sufficient subjects. And Favor with Martins, they proved the following theorem. Let Z on our jet and suppose that And suppose that is more z is smaller than or equal to r where r is this r and suppose that this condition holds for some i bigger than or equal to zero, then they prove that z is c i sufficient in cr they have a condition to c i sufficient in cr when p is equal to one this result of This result of favour martinis is exactly the result of tackins. Then, this result generalizes the result of tackins with the same condition. Other interesting thing is that if since Rz is smaller than or equal to r in the hypothesis of theorem, then this first part of our condition r minus rz plus one. Minus Rz plus one is always positive. Then even if I is equal to zero, as a consequence of Fabromarchin's result, is that this at least is zero sufficient in CR. Okay. Now we introduce the weighted version of these results. The weight R jet of F we denoted by denoted by JRWF, W indicates the weight, is the polynomial map of such that all monomers of its coordinate functions have weighted degrees smaller than or equal to y. And we denote the set capital JRW, the corresponding space of weight jets. Similar to the previous case, each gen G with the same Each germ G with the same weight jet of F, and we call the weight jet of F by Z, is called a W say K realization of Z in the weight space of jet. Similarly, the definition of sufficiency, the previous definition of sufficiency, now in the context of weighted jets, we define it. Defining a weighted RZ is said to be WG sufficient in CK if any two realizations F and G of Z are equivalent or again G denotes the R equivalence, the change of coordinates in the source and the W indicates with related weights involved. An example to clarify. An example to clarify this notation, consider f like this function. This is a weighted homogeneous of type 1, 2. The weight of variable x is 1 and the weight of variable y is 2. And the degree of f is 4. Okay? And f in this case coincides with the 4jet of f is in the 4 jet. Is in the 4z space. But now, if you consider J like this, where we are plus Y4, then the 4jet of F is distinct from the 4J of G. Consequently, the higher z of F is distinct of higher z of G. But if we consider the weighted version of the jet space, Version of the jet space for this fixed weight is one, two for the variables X and Y, we can see that the F and G, this F and this G have the same weight seven jet, but they don't have the same eight jet because this guy has degree eight. Has degree h then the this monomial doesn't belong to the seven jet of g okay. We consider a usual control function ho associated to the weight is w1 wn this is a classical control function and we introduce new two numbers bigger Bigger RW and bigger R0W like this. The difference of these numbers with the previous number is that now here appear the control function in the exponents conditions here are different. And the first result that we obtain the context of weighted jets is that if we fix a set of If we fix a set of weights and suppose a similar condition given by Tackins and Favori-Marchinis, then we conclude that Z is at least belips sufficient in CR. Observe that if we apply this last un for the set of weights where W1 and Wn is all equal to one, then the weightage The weighted jet space is the classical jet space, and then we obtain the following corollary. Our R big R reduces to small R and we have this corollary. Z is at least bilips sufficient in CR. Then our corollary is stronger than the takings and Favoro-Margins theorem when I is equal to zero. Because for they, for them, They prior them, then concluded that Z was at least C0 sufficient in Cr. And now we conclude that at least bilips sufficient in Cr and also we obtain a similar result of tackins and fabric martins in the set type of weight jets in the similar way. We also produce a condition, similar conduction, one condition that if Condition that if this condition holds for some I bigger than zero, then we concluded that Z is WCI sufficient in Cr. Note that the condition of Tackins or the condition of Fabromar Gines is similar but different. Here now in our contest appear the greater degree here and the greater degree here. This results appear in the paper published in the Journal of Singularity last year, and our results generalized the results of Tackins, published in Vincionis Mathematicas in 1971, and the paper of Fabrico Martíns, which generalized the result of tackling, but was published in Portuguese, in a Portuguese magazine. Here I Here I have an example, but my time is running out. I think I can skip this example. This example is just to show that we can apply our results, but we cannot apply the classical results. Because, for instance, if you have F and G like this, where theta is one deformation. Is one deformation of appropriate deformation here. We can conclude, for instance, that these two guys are one, two, C7 realization of Z and then for our theorem, they are one, two, C1 equivalent. But we don't conclude nothing about this in the classical contest because these guys do not have the same information. Do not have the same for yet in the classical J4, chochu. Then we cannot apply the classical results in the literature, but we can apply our results. Finally, we can show some recent progress inspirating the Ponesque works. We now modify the Riemannian metric in the surge. We consider a new metric, a singular Riemannian metric, given. Riemannian metric given this way. Why do we consider this metric? This metric is basically like the singular homogeneous metric. We want to keep some properties of the user or inner product for this new inner product. Then this is crucial to define this singular method in this way. And now we introduce two new numbers. Now tilde. Now, tilde big RW and tilde big R0W, but now this situation is more delicated. This is different. It's not easy to computation this number in the first moment, but after we can compute. And also, we obtain two new results. Obtain two new results similar to the previous one of our paper. Now, in the new context, replacing the similar metric. We also obtain a similar result for belips sufficient in CK, and we also obtain a similar condition to give the condition about the C sufficient in CR. The condition is the following. Falling the condition is oh, okay. The condition is that the difference is that replacing the singular metric. Now, here appear the smallest degree and not more the greater degree. This is a difference, and this result are in the paper submit to publication now in this. To publication now in this year, a recent paper. Okay? Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your talk. Is there any questions in the chat? If not, well, we think the yeah, I'm sorry, yo, Carlos, thank you for your talk. For your talk. Thank you very much. And now we start with the next talk right now.
