Okay, okay, fine. So it's could you make it full screen if you that would be good? Yeah, yeah. And may I turn off my camera for faster connections, maybe as you wish, whatever you prefer. Okay. So you can go ahead. Can you see the full screen? We can see, so you could start. Just wanted to turn off my camera. So, I would talk about land shift corrections due to non-conference. Would talk about land shift corrections due to non-competitive space. Could you start, please? Yeah, I'm trying to start, but it's not I'm not able to move down my slides. But there's nothing to do if you cannot go down to the to the to the slides. I will again share. We cannot see it either. Yeah, I will again share. Give it another try. Can you see it now? We see the first page, yes, the first slide. I don't know if you can go to the second one. Yeah, that is the problem. I'm afraid I don't know what to propose. This is a bit of an animal. So now we can see the second you can see and this one I have shared the PPT person PPTX yeah but you can't see the full screen we cannot but you know we have one way or another to hurry up so I think it's better to start if I can It's better to start. If I can scroll down, just to start. Scroll down in a rather quick way, please. Yeah, yeah. Can you start? You can see? Yeah, we can see. So, start saying something. Okay, so I will start it like that. So, motivation for this studies, and we will discuss a bit. And we will discuss a brief about angular momentum and then non-competitive space and then find a structure of hyperhydrogen atom, splitting of lamb shift, and then we will come to the outlook. Lamb shift of hydrogen atom levels are basically zero-point oscillations of the electromagnetic field, which brings about the perturbations in the motion of electrons and leads to effects known as radiation corrections. The interaction between particles in vacuum is an evidence of universal interaction and interconversion of particles of matter and Interconversion of particles of matter and field quantum. The ability to repeat experiments at different places and at different times is based on the invariance of laws of nature under space-time translation. Now, another motivation for non-competitive physics comes from PhD in weak interaction, that is, per ET non-conservation in weak interaction, which indicates the lack of symmetry in the spatial properties of the particles with respect to inversions. Of the particles with respect to inversions, that is parity. This seems to contradict the isotropism of space, which demands that angular momentum should be conserved. The contradiction is removed by combined inversion with space. In such invariance, a symmetry is manifested only in the charges of the particles, and space remains intact. It remains symmetrical. So, however, this combined parity is not conserved in weak interactions in which strange particles participate. Symmetry generates new solutions, such as if we have a planetary orbit and if we rotate that orbit with some rotation transformation, then still that would be a valid solution for that orbit. Similarly, the spherical harmonics of a hydrogen atom, if you rotate the spherical harmonics, there will be still a solution of the harmonic of the hydrogen atom eigenvalue problem. And if you take the linear combination of all the You take the linear combination of all the spherical harmonics, there will be still be the solution of the hydrogen. This leads us to a formalism of rotation groups, where we form symmetry groups as rotations, that is orthogonal SO3, and then covering group is unitary SU2. And irreducible representation of this covering group manifests themselves as different types of particles, such as vector spin 1, spinner, spin a half, or scalar spin 0. Spin zero. Then we have quantum spin, which has no classical analog because electron, if electron has a spatial extension, then we have to have six coordinates to completely describe its picture, such as three coordinates to locate its center of mass and three Euler angles to specify its orientation in space. But we have limits of theory. We continue to treat electron as point to fix its position. Yet the spin angular momentum is not derived from any position of momentum very. Derived from any positional momentum variables. Same kind of problem we face in spin-orbit coupling. For any particle, its spin angular momentum has no dependence on spatial wave functions, while its orbital angular momentum does depend on spatial properties of the wave functions. So, how it is possible then to two add two vectors from different vector spaces? We invent ad hoc mathematics to extend the meaning of addition, create a tensor product of the given vector. addition create a tensor product of the given vector spaces and then this product space tensor product space can be decomposed into direct sum of disjoint subspaces here we have a spin orbit coupling hamiltonian you can see that linear operators are dependent upon the spatial parts so they are subspace of a unit sphere and it's And its basis is a spherical harmonics, whereas spin part doesn't exist in these coordinates, but it is a Hilbert space with basis 1, 0, and 0, 1. So overcoming this problem in the vector model of atom, we understand physically that angular momentum, orbital angular momentum, L and spin angular momentum, they both And spin angular momentum, they both combine to form a total angular momentum J, and this J processes around the applied magnetic field or the magnetization axis that is Z, and its cointilation is along the G axis. Now we come to the non-competitive part of the quantum mechanics. To contrast classical mechanics with quantum mechanics, we have classical trajectories which can be determined if initial conditions. Determined if initial conditions are given. But quantum mechanics does not prescribe any such flavor view on trajectory. Heisenberg uncertainty limits the simultaneous determination of position and velocity of the particle. Then how quantum mechanics is different from classical mechanics in its discrete values of observables, in its superposition among the eigenstates, in the strong correlations among the observables, such as Bell correlations. And again, it is important to note that this classical quantum distinction is not. Classical quantum distinction is not made on the basis of a spatial extension only, but rather it should be judged in the units of Planck constant H, which has the dimension of XM, which is length times momentum or time into energy or angular momentum. For example, electron in hydrogen atom resides in quantum domain, but electrons in usual electronics are safely in classical domain. All pictures of quantum mechanics reduces to classical mechanics in the limit of H tends to zero. And the components of position and momentum operators obey certain computational relations. Certain computational relations. Now we come to the non-computative quantum mechanics formalism, which is suggested that space-time at primordial universe was foggy. So we impose a special condition of computation. We induce a parameter called a structure constant and we represent our computation of spaces. Like now we understand that our x and y axis are not commuting with each other. Are not commuting with each other. They have a different value after rotation. So, such a space defined by computation relation is non-computative space. Now, defining this grid of two dimensions, x, y, we come to arrive at a limit of our area beyond which we can't resolve. So, that comes around 10 power minus 40 meter square. Now we formulate our commutation relations. We put our constraint along the x x like x and y coordinates or the position coordinates, but momentum and position momentum, those commutation relations we don't disturb. Then we introduce suitable coordinate transformations so that we can go from non-commutative to commutative space, which is inspired from the molecules. Now we write the hydrogen at the Hamiltonian and we have R prime coordinate which is relative coordinate between proton and electron, mu is the reduced mass and potential we can represent in terms of this non-competitive coordinates x prime and we can transform them back into our normal coordinates. Now doing this transformation and using the computation relations limit and The computation relations limit and the anti-symmetric property of the theta i, we come to a reduced expression where keep we keep only theta of first order to check the its signature of non-commutability. Similarly, using binomial expansion, we reduce potential further into a form where we arrive at an expression where it is apart from one by r term, it is depending upon. From one by r term, it is depending upon an angular momentum term. This angular momentum term. So now we got a perturbation in our potential. This perturbation is L dot theta, where L is the orbital level of momentum or angular momentum, and theta is the structure constant of our space-time grid, our definition of non-commutability. So, and taking z-axis along the Taking z-axis along the normal unit for theta, we arrive at a perturbation which resembles LZ theta z. Now we can evaluate our expectation value for the energy spectrum. And as L z commutes with the original free Hamiltonian, we can write our delta E in terms of N L M eigenstates and 1 by R cube of the spherical harmonic. Of the spherical harmonics, this kind of expression is well known. We use that expression and then we get energy correction which is dependent only on the z component of our angular momentum, M, that quantum number. Now we come to the spin-orbit coupling, where our angular momentum and spin-orbit, spin angular momentum both will couple. Angular momentum both will couple to form a new angular momentum J and we have new quantum numbers they are JZ and J. Using those we will take the expectation value of L Z our original perturbation and for by using claps Gordon coefficients property we arrive at a value for the expectation value of energy Using Claffe Gordon coefficient for S half and evaluating the expression, we arrive at a shift in energy or we arrive at the correction in energy which is dependent on GZ now or otherwise L terms are same as the previous expression where we were performing the coupling. Now we come to the land shift. You see that The lamp shift, you see that 2p half and 2s half they are both equal in energy according to direct theory. But it is according to quantum electrodynamics. The vacuum affects the electron energies and they get their energy perturbations and their energy gets shifted. So now using our non-commutative framework, we establish that our energy collection comes as with a term J. As with a term JZ. That is total angular momentum J and its projection on the J axis, maintenance axis. And energy is dependent both on N quantum number, L quantum number, and J quantum number. And we know that this J Z can be further split into all the values, integer values from minus J to plus J. Thus, in our case, L is equal to 0. Thus, in our case, L is equal to zero is like they don't show any correction up to first order. So, 2s half level is not changed. Otherwise, 2p half level undergoes any splitting because j has value half here and we get 2p minus half and 2p plus half new states which were not present in our regular coordinates. It came only after we considered the non-commutativity of space. The land shift itself is split into two. Shift itself is split into two lines corresponding to different GJs. So, for bore, you can see the demarcation in Dirac, we got our finite structure splitting 2p 2p3 half and 2p half and 2s half and 2p half. These both level were equal in energy, so they were degenerate. But on the arrival of quantum electrodynamics and by the experiment of Willis Lamb, it got clear that these 2s half and 2p half, those two states. Half and 2p half, those two states are having two different energies, they are not same. And using non-quantitative quantum mechanics, we can arrive further that this lamp shift itself can be split into some energy. They still have some kind of scope of splitting. Now we come to the outlook of our talk. So energy of the electron in hydrogen atom is nearly 13.6 electron volts. 13.6 electron volt, and the spin-orbit coupling that is the finite structure constant when we can couple the spin of the electron and orbital momentum, the energy finite structure constant, finite structure that correction comes around 10 to the power minus 5 electron volt. And Lamb shift is 10 times shorter than that. So, order is 10 power minus 6 electron volt. And the hyperfine structure is similarly nearly a little bit shorter than Lamp shift. Shorter than lamp shift. So, if we are getting some correction, energy correction of the order of 10 power minus 8 electron volt or 10 power minus 9 electron volt, certainly that would lead to kind of signature of non-commutativity of space because that thing we have motivated from parity non-conservation of the weak interactions and interaction of vacuum from the material particle like electro. So, with this, I would. So with this, I would end my talk. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Any question? Any question from people online? There is a question by whom? No, no, I was only clapping my hands. Ah, okay. So, there is no question. So, there is no question. In that way, let us thank all the speakers and all the participants of this meeting.
