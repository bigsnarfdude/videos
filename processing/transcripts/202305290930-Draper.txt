Okay. So, that is what we want the second talk by Christina Robert from Danas on Killing's gift. And we all know this is Bill Ethan, right? Any other gifts. Please start. Thank you. Good morning. First of all, I would like to thank the organizers for giving me the opportunity to know this nice place. The only thing I enjoy more than G2I are the mountains. The title of my talk is The Killing's Gift. It's not about my own results, it's all about well-known things. But well, in mathematics, what is folklore for oneself is not always folklore for the others, and conversely. Was popular for the others, and conversely. So, I think everybody gains from this opportunity to talk together. So, thank you again for the organizers. I will, well, the killings give, of course, refers to G2, the group achilling didn't expect to find so a pleasant surprise. The structure i the the structure of the talk is as follows. The structure of the talk is as follows. First, I will give a quick review of the historical origins of Lipluxieri. I usually work in Lie algebra and the definition is so polished that it seems an easy thing. So I wouldn't like to forget the wide world of things surrounding these ideas. Afterwards we talk about how Keelin tackled the task of the pre-classification of the Lie algebras and explaining a little bit the power of the concept of roots. Then I will explain the role of the octonions to give nice descriptions of G2. Octonions are usually Octonians are usually the main tool to explain exceptional objects. I don't know that only in the case of G2 because in G2 also we have three forms. Finally, well, I revisit what John has told us and D2 and CD2 in the middle of And CG2 in the middle of his story. So I will begin with the emergence of the history of Liquid Bus theory. The historical origins are, of course, analytic concerning differential equations. So the founder of Lie group theory was the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lin. He discovered that continuous transformation groups could be better understood by Linux. Could be better understood by linearizing them and studying the corresponding generating vector fields. These vector fields, calling that period infinitesimal generators, and this set of infinitesimal generators, well, formally algebra, Lee was a contemporary of Felix Klein. The question that was in the air in those That was in the air in those times after the appearance of the known Euclidean geometries is what's really the geometry. And Claim proposed in his famous Erlangen program that this geometry is the study of the invariance under the action of a group. And Lee also was inspired in Galois. Galois associated to each algebraic equation a good. Each algebraic equation, a group permuting the solutions, the roots, in such a way that the equation can be solved by radicals when the group is solvable. So Lee's idea was to try to attach to any differential equation a group in such a way that both solvabilities are equivalent or something like that. A little bit more precisely, if we have a differential equation, Have a differential equation. If you have a one-parametric subgroup of R to the group of diffeomorphisms of the plane, it said that the subgroup leaves the equation as stable if it removes the solution. If we relate to each comparametric subgroup the vector field induced by Induced by it, and we attach to the differential equation this vector field. Li's theorem says that phi, Lip's equation is stable if and only if set is an eigenvector for x phi. And in this case, he provides an integrating factor, well, that is a function such mu such that the product of mu and the differential form is such. Mu and the differential form is etc. So, well, it's easy to solve it. For instance, this is an example. If you rearrange the equation, then it's easy to understand why the group of rotation leaves invariant of the equation, because this is the square of the distance to the origin, and this is the slope. I mean, the tangent of the angle at the point between the solution through P and the radius. Through P at the radius from the origin to P. And so this group permutes the solution and then making us in the previous slide xq plus yp is an integrating factor and then you can solve the question and find solutions. And well, so the notion which has evolved to the notion of the group is this one, the group of Is this one, the group of continuous transformations in Rn, which has a set of invertible transformations which can be composed and depending continuously upon R parameters. In the previous example, this is the group. When you will derive, you obtain the infinitesimal generators. In this case, one, in general, R, which is a basis of. General R, which is a basis of the tangent algebra to the group. Well, this is only to insist on the local behavior and to see an example with more parameters. And if you think of the orthogonal group, you know that most of its elements can be written as composition of three rotations of x's A one, A two, and A three and angles T one, T two and T three, Euler angles. 12, 13, Euler angles. So when you derive, you obtain the three infinitesimal generators, which are the basis of the Lie algebra of spray symmetric matrices. And well, these infinitesimal generators span Lie algebra and gives rise to this concept. In fact, a Lie algebra is an algebra. An algebra and the commutative and satisfying the Copy identity, simply no more. And some questions which were in Lie times are these ones. What were all the possible Lie algebras and how they can appear as Lie algebras of vector fields? Well, Li himself did the classification. He himself did the classification for two complex variables. And besides, well, two families of complex sympolyagles were well known at that time. The orthogonal group preserving a metric, the group preserved in a body of form, well, also from the thought of simplexic group preserving a non-degenerate two form. But then, well, there was an unexpected and astonishing discovery. An astonishing discovery. Killing published the classification of finite dimensional simple complex Lie algebra, which has called sometimes the greatest mathematical paper of all time. Besides the Lie algebra of orthogonal, special linear and symplectic, we found not only G two, but Not only G2, but five additional examples: G2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 8, of these dimensions. Well, these are the linking diagrams, but the question is, who is E2? Well, English correctly is what is E2. Killing has the structure constants. But it doesn't seem very useful. Well, perhaps, perhaps, but it's difficult to give meaning. Take into account that with this table, Keeling couldn't prove the Jacobi identity, not even. So, Keeling, the question from Keeling to Engel was to try to understand D two as a local transformation group in Rn and what's the minimum n. And the answer was provided by Engel and Cartan simultaneously into papers in the same journal in 1893. In 1893, and here the answer is N is 5, and D2 is the stability group of this Faffian system. This is the Carton's paper. The whole Carton's paper. So, one for me was surprising, first because it's very short, and second, because I have not been able to understand at the moment. Hopefully, someone in the audience could can help to me during these days. Can have to me during these days. But at least when here is the Fafian system, I told before. But well, what I can explain is the meaning of the sentence, the meaning of the sentence only. What means G2 is the stability group of a Fafian system. For instance, in this case, this is a Fafian system, and this is the distribution of dimension 2 attached to the. Dimension two attached to the Parthenon system, and the algebra infinitesimal symmetries is the set of vector fields which borrowed with the vector fields in the RNB. It's easy to check that these 14 vector fields belongs to the infinitesimal, the Liadra infinitesimal symmetries, and it's easy to compute that the multiplication table is G. The multiplication table is G2. For me, it's not easy to know why there are no more vectors because when you write, it's a PDE. Well, I would like to send more, but I have no time. So now I explain how killing tackled the classification and well, this is not only killing classification, it's also. Classification is also Cartan because Cartan corrected the Killing's work in his thesis in 1894. And so, well, Killing gave us the gift, but Cartano wrote it. So the main ideas of the classification are, well, it's what is taught in a LiADRAP course usually, are these ones. Only at these ones. If you have a complex simply algebra, you can consider the adjoining operators in this way. They are non-zero, so you can identify the algebra D with the Lie algebra form by the adjoining operators. And so you can use linear algebra tools as, for instance, simultaneous, sorry, the diagonalization of endomorphisms, because you are in linear algebra. Because you are a linear algebra. So consider a Cartan sub-algebra. Cartan sub-algebra is the maximal sub-algebra formed by semi-simple elements. An element is semi-simple if its adjoint map is diagonalizable. And as the cartridge of algebra terms are to be abelian, the diagonalization can be done simultaneously. And so you can consider You can consider the simultaneous eigen spaces that are called root spaces. The simultaneous eigenvalues are called roots. And the set of simultaneous eigenvalues is the root system. The decomposition of a sum of root spaces is the root decomposition. And here, this root system contains in a very precise way. Contains in a very precise way the information about the algebra. Well, is this an easy example for those for whom this is the first meeting with roots? Especially linear algebra of well, trace less matrices of size three. Here you can consider the Cartman sub-algebra formed by the diagonal matrices, which has dimension two. This H is a generic Hermann. Generic element. The unit vectors Eij are eigenvectors for any generic element H. And these are the eigenvalues. These are eigenvectors independently of H, but of course the Eigen values depend on H. And well more precisely for any element you For any element, you send to, for any element in the Cartosov algebra, you provide a complex number. So, what you have is a linear map from H to the complex number. That is, an element in the dual. And if, for instance, you call this alpha one and alpha two, the remaining are linear combinations in this way. I'm going to write your thing the use of your decomposition. Solid composition. And why we can't make a picture of the previous example is because roots live in a true Euclidean space. These are more or less the ideas. You can consider the keyline form given as the trace of the composition of the adjoint operators are. Of the adjoining operators of any pair of elements. And the Killing form is non-degenerate. In fact, this is equivalent to the semi-simplicity of the algebra. And when you restrict the Killing form to the Cartan sub-algebra, this is non-degenerate. So you can identify the Cartan's of algebra H, which is new L. And moreover, you can consider the inner The inner product in H, and you can translate to H star in this way using this map. And moreover, the key point is here. If you take E, the vector space, real vector space, real span by the roots, and you consider this bilinear form induced by key. Induced by key, by it, not only takes values in R, but is positive definite. It's a true Euclidean space. So you can consider lengths and angles. And in the previous example, both have the same length and angle 2 pi 12. So you can get this picture easily. And the classification is based in that when you have a Lie algebra. When you have a Lie algebra, a semi-simple algebra, and consider the root decomposition relative to a carton-sub algebra, then the root system satisfies this definition. It's an aster-true system. The definition of an aster-true system is a finite generating set of an Euclidean space such that if you have a root, the only multiples are plus minus alpha. And the set is invariant, and the reflections relative to half her plane is orthogonal to the elements, which are called roots. And the coefficients in the reflection, denoted usually with angles, angles not bilinear, angles, are integer numbers. And this is quite restrictive. This is quite restrictive. It shows there are no many roots. It shows there are no many root systems. For instance, in dimension two, these are the only four possibilities. In light blue are the names of the root systems. I mean the root systems, not the Lie algebra so much. The conditions here are so restrictive that the proof reduces to combinatorics. And well, it's easy to compute. To compute all the root systems, these are all the possibilities. For instance, this is a master root system. This definition does not require any algebra. D2, the root system D2 can be described in this way. He is the authorite 111 in R3 and Three and consider the set of vectors whose square of the length is either two or six. And this is an easy computation. Phi is exactly this one, this set. And these are the lengths on the angle. And this is G2. But the question, of course, is there is a real algebra or not for each of the system. And how How to find it. In particular, we would like to find a Lie algebra of Tai V2. The question: the answer is affirmative for each root system phi. There is a semi-simple Lie algebra whose root system related to some carton subject is precisely phi. But which one? Well, of course, if you believe the existence, Believe the existence only to have a variety, it's very easy because you can give a model for each root system. There are not many. But in those times, Keeling didn't have either models, nor descriptions, nor nothing. So he constructed the two by brute force. By brute force. Because the uniqueness permits to reconstruct the unique candidate. So he obtains the table multiplication you saw before. More or less, this is brief, but the ideas can use to Ideas can use to their uniqueness. But I see that proof of existence is different, but you can give a model. Although it took time, I know the volume. So I don't know how to say. Key ideas, this is the sketch. He calls a root system irreducible if it cannot be written as a disjoint union of two or three root systems. Two orthogonal systems choose an element in the Euclidean space which is not orthogonal to any element in phi. This permits, gives a concept of positive and negative roots according to the hyperplane containing them. And you can define a simple root. Simple root means it cannot be decomposed as a sum of two positive roots. So are the roots closer to. So, are the roots closer to the hyperplane? And with these simple roots, you can define the Cartan matrix with the angles we considered before, and all the information is contained in the Cartan matrix. To summarize, the information is usually written the thinking diagrams that are graphs with R vertices joining by this number of edges. By this number of edges? Well, the rest of the ideas are more or less, there are not all the following. If you want to reconstruct the Lie algebra from the Dutch system, you know that the Cartman's of algebra is abelian, you know the dimension, and you know how eight multiplies with all root spaces. Router spaces because you know the eigenvalue. All the root spaces are one-dimensional, so well, we only have to say how they multiply. The decomposition is a grading where you multiply two root spaces, the bracket is containing this sum, in the space related to the sum, for each root, the algebra. The algebra obtained by G alpha plus G minus alpha plus the powerquet is isomorphic to L C L 2, so you can choose a standard basis EFH. And well, this is a key idea that for any positive root, there is a path from simple root until alpha, such that all partial sums are Are positive at roots, roots, real roots. So you can choose an element multiplying is like this. Well, the structure constants are integers and are given by the length of the change of roots and so on. So, well, more or less, we can imagine. So, we arrive at the part. The part we are trying to describe how, well, the description Cartan gave in 1914 about Octonians to describe detail. So recall today our hero is Itu is the main character, but the supporting character is Supporting character is doctonius. Here is a picture of the final plane: seven lines. Each line behaves as i K in the Patonian algebra. 1, 3, 7, and 3, 1 is minus 7 and so on. And in this block, there is a formula to recall without necessity of drawing panopen. Of drawing kind of point. And only recall a little bit the battle of Doctrinions. Recall that Sir William Hamilton was fascinated with the role of the complex number to describe rotations in the plane, and he tried to obtain a way of describing rotations of the space. And he didn't get it until someday walking with his wife. Why by the breach in Dublin when he suddenly saw that the answer the solution was to double C, not to think of R3, but of R4. And the same year, John Graves wrote a letter to his friend Hamilton about the possibility of double again. But, well, he didn't publish his results, so the doctonians are usually attributed to Arthur Keylay, who published the results two years afterwards. And oh, Doctonian algebra can be constructed doubling the quaternion algebra by the same procedure, the so-called Kiley-Dixon doubling process. With this definition of O is, of course, the same algebra that obtained in the final plane. This is an isomorphism. And the properties are very similar to the quaternion algebra, except for the non-associativity. Do fails associativity, but at least they are alternative, and you can change parentheses. Change parentheses when only two of the elements are repeated. As in quaternions, you can define a conjugation which permits to obtain the inverse of any element. So it is a division algebra. And we have a multiplicative node. This is important, a multiplicative node. I can put the twice more. I can put the twice notation of Jones also to try to not confuse the audience. My trace is twice real part and imaginary octonions and zero trace octonions. Well, and the imaginary part is the well the projection in the silicon. In the silutase octonion path. Sorry, why is this called trace? Why is this called trace? Is it trace of some of the motions? Can you uh why is this called trace? Why do you call trace? Samagon can translate, please. Ah, this is the trace and the norm because it satisfies sorry, yellow perhaps is not the best colour. Yellow, perhaps, is not the best colour because it satisfies this second polynomial equation. So, well, trace is a good name. Okay, and recall that this permits to define a cross product in R7 in this way. Them in this way. Then, when you multiply two silutrase octonions, the vectorial part gives a coarse part and satisfies Lagrange identity and so on. Well, Catan's theorem says that the derivations of the Octonian algebra is the Lie algebra D2. Here I explain that this is quite general, that always for any kind of algebra, the Lie algebra of derivations is a Lie algebra. The Lie algebra of derivations is a Lie algebra. A derivation is a linear map satisfying this Leibniz type identity. In general, for any associative algebra, A minus, the same algebra on the space, but with the commutator-in-cell algebra. So if you have a vector space, then the morphism is always associative. So you can consider the minus, which is. Minus, which is the general linear algebra GLB. And the derivation is always close for the bracket, so always is a derivation. But this means difficult because how a derivation is and how to find them and how to use them. Well, if we use L X R R X, the left and right. Are the left and right multiplication operators XL in the previous talk? Being a derivation is characterized in this way. Also, left and right multiplication operators can be used to describe examples of derivations in any kind of Lie or any kind of algebra. For instance, in Lie is a derivation, which is written in this way only if it comes from associative. In Jordan, this is a derivation. But in alternative algebra, But in alternative algebra, our case is more difficult. Nothing of the previous is a derivation, these are derivations. The operator dxy in this way is a derivation. If you want to apply to an element set, you obtain the triple product minus three times the associator. This is suddenly, but it's practical. And it's more interesting. And it's more interesting that these kinds of derivations span D2. And how this fits with the roots? Actually does not do it. Because the root decomposition we all were was for complex antipodes. And now we have a real altogether. Real algebra. Our algebra does not admit a root decomposition. Sure, it admits a root decomposition after complexifying. So the solution is to consider the casin, the split oxonian algebra. When you apply the Kaye-Dixon-Doubling process, The Kayak-Dixon doubling process to H, if you ask for the new element L to satisfy L square equal to 1 instead of L square equal to minus 1, then you obtain the split octonion algebras O S. This is the only change. And this is the only change in the norm. And well, it's a completely different algebra, although, of course, both have the same complexification, but the proposition. But the properties are different. This is, of course, no division algebra, and the null is not positively defined, the norm has to have neutral signature and it has isotropic vectors and so on. From explaining the relation between that algebra and roots, it's convenient to choose a good basis, and this is a good. And this is a good basis, a good basis for us, formed by two identons, equal and e2. And these three elements form a totally isotropic subspace of dimensions 3 and also this. In fact, they are the eigenspaces of the left multiplications with L. And these are all the products. So, here it is summarize all the information. We summarize all the information of the algebra because this is a table of multiplications. And well, this slide is not relevant for our purposes. It's only if you don't like Eileen Dixon process and it's difficult for you to recall. And probably some matrices is a model of split octonions, easier to recall, but it's the same. You can think of OS. Can think of OS as matrices 2 by 2, but the elements in the diagonal are reals, and the elements out of the diagonal are vectors. And you multiply naturally alpha alpha prime plus, here you have to put dot product because you want to obtain an scallop. And alpha u prime plus u prime. The only top price in things. Surprising thing that you have to consider in the cross product in R3 here and here. But of course, it's the same algebra because this assignment works and you have the same rules of multiplication. And then it's very easy to obtain the root decomposition here. This is a carton subalgebra. I already mentioned two because the s sum of the three operators is zero. of the three operators is zero with our operators d and all the vectors of the recall that derivations are spanned by the operators d x y and all the elements d u u u b or b are even vectors simultaneous even vectors so this is a straightforward computation Well, I wouldn't come back to the group. I would like to follow with the algebra, but no time. So we want to describe the groups because at least there are two, but begin with the group of automorphisms of doctonions, which has the relatively algebraic derivations of doctonions. The group of automorphisms are bijective linear maps that is Rejective linear maps that is preserving the product. It frightens a little bit because if it was already difficult to find derivations, automorphisms have to be much worse. Not even we can sum them. So first, think that automorphisms are isometries. This is a first idea because the question he asked. He here he asked. As the algebra is quadratic and satisfies this polynomial equation, the cohesions determine, if you apply an automorphism F and recall that F of 1 is 1, then you obtain that trace and norm are preserved by the automorphism F. So in particular, F belongs to S, the orthogonal group of O and moreover the orthogonal group of O0. Over the orthonal group of O0 since producer 0 trisotonium. So d2 is in a so-called. Second idea: as O is generated as an algebra by IJ and L, any automorphism is determined by the images of IJ and L. Does it mean that any triple determines an automorphism? No, of course not. It means that at most there are one. For instance, the three vectors, images of IJML, have to be unit and orthogonal. Is this an enough condition? No. But almost, but almost. Consider the stiffened manifold of orthonormal frames formed by orthonormal frames in Orson. Normal frames in R7 with three elements. So a chili triple is when the third element is also thrown out of the subalgebra generated by the two alarms as IAL. And D2 can be any chi LA triple determines completely an automorphism. And well, the heat of the proof is that this is an orthonormal basis of O0 and the product of O0 and the product of O can be completely recovered from this using the Lagrange identity. So the two can be considered as a two-dimensional one of BC3. What's the Lagrangian entity? Stop like this. So you can recover completely the breath, yes. Because all these elements are orthogonal between them. Well, it's possible to write this condition independently of octonions that G2 is perpendicular to the algebra generated by the two others? Yes. To others? Yes, because we can define a threeform which vanishes on the triple and in a chylate triple just when which vanishes on a triple just when it's a chylate triple. So we arrive at the three forms approach. This description long predates carton octonionic description. Cartan octonionic description because this is from 1914 years before. And Engel was very proud of his description. In his own words, we hereby obtained a direct definition of our 14-dimensional simple groups, which is as elegant as one can wish for. So, with our same notation, consider that reform gives three form given in this way as the well consider the three linear map at the moment given by the norm of the octonionic product and if you don't like octonions you can replace the octonionic product with the cross product in r7 no problem and alternativity says that this is alternating so it provides a free form so in these terms due to is the So in these terms, G two is the diffeomorphic to the manifold of B73 such that this is zero. This would be a nice description of G2, where if not for the fact that here is difficult to multiply, but well, it's the same. And on the other hand, D2 is the group of objectively. Bijective linear maps preserving preserving omega. Well, one of the implications is easy because if well, if preserves the product, of course, preserves omega, because omega is given in terms of. Omega because omega is given in terms of the product. But the opposite direction is not easy at all. It's based on this fact that the norm is completely determined by the three form. This formula permits to recover the norm with the three form. And of course, if you have the norm and the three form as n is normal degenerate, you recover the product. And angles, the nice angles theory. And Engels the nice Engels theorem, which is very beautiful, says that E2 is the stabilizer of a generic three form, omega. The general linear group acts on the set of the three forms by pullback, and we have proved that the stabilizer of omega is G2. That was the stabilizer of the remaining three forms. Well, if I have another three form as the dimension of the linear group is 49 and the dimension of the three forms is 35, the dimension of any orbit, well, the dimension of any orbit is at most 35 and the dimension of the stabilizer is at least 14 and is exactly 14 just when the dimension of the orbit is the total so. Orbit is the total, so if and only if the orbit is open. A three-form omega is called generic if the orbit is open. And well, the Enders theorem says that there is only one orbit of generic three forms in the complex case, our omega, and there are just two orbits of generic three forms in real case, omega and omega s. Omega s is defined. Omega s is defined in the same way by quick split octonions. So, any generic reform to find the stabilizer in G2, that's the conclusion. These expressions are with our previous notations. And how many real groups are of type G2? We have, of course, automorphisms and automorphisms of split octoniums, which can describe. Of split octonions, which can describe other stabilizers of omega and omega s. Of course, we have the Lie algebra's derivations are derivations of split octonions, which can be described as the stabilizers of omega and omega s in this sense. The notation with minus 14 and 2 is the usual notation relative to the signature of the killing form. G2 minus 14 is called compact because 14 is called compact because the kinetic form is negatively finite, and G22 is called split because it admits a root decomposition. So, well, no more generic three forms, so no more Lie algebras and groups, because for each algebra, there are one connected simply connecting the group, but we are not sure if our groups are simply connected, at least not sure with the second. Well, I want I'm going to explain why G2 acts on the sphere of dimension 6 and why S6 is the quotient of G2. All the work is done because you can consider S6 as the six as the set of vectors in R7 or set of unitary set of sister trace oftonions on of norm equal to one and as it two preserves norm trace of course acts on S6 and it acts transitively because any unit any unit vectors can be completed until a caliber point so you So you can move from any elements in the sphere. And which isotropy, isotropy subgroup? If you fix an element, I, and you want to know which are the automorphisms fixed in I, if an automorphism fixed in I fixing the space orthogonal to one and I, which is a complex vector space of dimension three, and the restriction is a Restriction is a unitary map with respect to this Hermitian form. And of course, well, the restriction determines F, so 6 is as the action is transitive, the quotient of G2 between over the isotropic group. In particular, G two is connected and simply connected. But this is not the case for the cassine G two, the tomorrowism of split octonions. Of split octonions. Although it's very similar, recall that the norm is no longer positively finite. The restriction to sigilite Sotonions has three ones and four minus ones. And again, the same argument as before with the polynomial equation gives that G22 the automorphism. Are the automorphisms are isometric. So they are transitively in the pseudo-hyperbolic space of the vectors in norm equal to minus one. For instance, take L, which has norm equal to minus one, which is this isotropic subgroup. Here appears again our totally isotropic subspace U1, UE2, U3, and which can easily. And which is the eigen space relative to telephone multiplication with L. And so if an automorphism preserves L, preserves U plus and U minus also. But the restriction to U plus determines the other and the pseudo hyperbolic space is the quotient of G22 over SL3. In particular, it's not simply. Free. In particular, it's not simply connected. It's connected and not simply connected, and you have a double covering. Well, there is only one slide to speak about cosets of G2. I have chosen only the compact group G2 and only the reductive homogeneous spaces over non-connected and non-abelian subgroups, closed subgroups. Subgroups, closed subgroups. If you want to do with U22, you have the double of the family of quotients. And if you consider parabolic, you have another interesting world full of interesting things. But there is no time. So this is only to offer a panoramic to the quotients of G2. Besides, I have 8, besides X6, we have the We have the symmetric space of dimension 8, which is the which lives in a Grasmanian space, is the subspaces of dimension 4 of Alsa, annihilated by the three-form, and this is a description of the symmetric space. And fibrilline over them, we have the unit fiber bundle over the sphere. Over the sphere, which can be identified with the Stiffen manifold, B73, B72. And also, we have a quadric, which is the oriented graph-man and so on. These are twisted spaces. This is very odd because it used the principles of algebra. And this is easy, but very unknown. Nobody has studied. Nobody has studied. I don't know why it's a kind of flat manifold. Well, and I have five minutes. Okay. I only want to explain how the G2 fits in the story John told, although the beginning is the same. Consider the map of zero traceoctonia to and domorphisms given by the left multiplication. By the left multiplication. As because of the alternativity, you have this, and so you can extend this map rho to an homomorphism of associative algebra between the Clifford algebra related to minus n and endomorphism algebra. And the restriction to the even part is an isomorphism. The spin group lives here, so the spin, you can consider the spin group living here. Group living here. And well, it's the same description as before. Well, I usually the norm of the product, but it's because I'm used to deal with arbitrary fields. But in R you can consider all the vectors, unit vectors. And the question is: the spin group, what is preserving? It's preserving something. Can be defined by preserving some kind of product or something like that. Or something like that, and the answer is yes. Consider this triple product in orange given using product of octonions and the group preserving this triple product if spin 7. Exactly, spin 7. And of course, this works in spin-toctonians. And why is D2 here? D2 lives on ESPN 7, of course, because it preserves the product. Of course, because it preserves the product, it preserves the triple product. But what about the quotient? What is so? First, the spin 7, this is spin 7, acts again by isometries. Take care because the reason is not this one. This is a double covering, but the action is not the same. Okay? The reason. The reason the automorphisms act by isometries is that identity using the that the three form is alternating. So you can prove this. Well, acts by isometries. So it acts in the octonions of unit octonions and is a transitive action. And who is the isotropy group of an element here in S? Here in S in the sphere of dimension seven? Well, the isotropic group is, of course, G2, because if F preserves this product and preserves 1, preserves XY, because XY is the triple product X1Y. So 7 is the coefficient of spin 7 among you two. No, this is an well, another POS of G2 in the real world that is nice, but I think no. Well, if you want. And so thank you very much for your attention. I live with this Okubo sentence. Okubo is a famous algebrist and physicist working with non-associative algebras. Although Although perhaps you don't use in geometry, I don't know, but of course, it's a very beautiful mathematical engine. So thank you very much.
