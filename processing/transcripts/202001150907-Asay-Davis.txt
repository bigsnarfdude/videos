I'm going to mostly focus just in general on what the community's done with ice sheet ocean coupling. And if there's time, I'll get to some of the specific things we found with some DOE coupled ice-sheet ocean models. But I'm guessing that's the part of the talk that's going to have to be triaged. So the general outline is sort of what considerations there are in coupling and the different components. Coupling and the different components in ice sheet ocean coupling. And basically, what I realized in writing this up is that ice sheet components are in pretty good shape for ice-sheet ocean coupling. So it'll really be talking about coupling and the ocean component and kind of what goes into making them ready for this problem. Then I'll talk just a little bit about some of my thoughts about initializing coupled ice-heat ocean models, because it's a bit tricky, as anybody who's done it will know. There's many of us who are involved in a model intercomparison project called MesoMIP. And the coupled portion of that project has seven participating models that I'll just briefly list and kind of give some basic components of. And if I have time, I'll get to these two, the popsicles, and returning to the E3SM model that Steve presented, just talking about our ice-ocean coupling there. Our ice-ocean coupling there. And if not, I will skip directly to this discussion a little bit about how ocean biases, but really in general, Earth system model biases are going to potentially be kind of a big problem for projections with ice sheet models unless sort of our community and the Earth system model community engage a lot with each other and work out the biases. Okay, so getting into ice. Getting into ice sheet ocean coupling more specifically. Some of the things I'll talk about is the difference between offline coupling with restart files and online coupling, say, with a coupler. I'll talk about some of the specific considerations in Earth System Model couplers that you might need to think about if that's a direction you're going with your ice sheet model. One of those considerations is dynamic component masking, which is kind of new for most Earth system models. Most Earth system models. And one component of that dynamic masking is basically making sure that your components kind of agree on where you're floating versus grounded so that you're not melting undergrounded ice. And then in the ocean component, there's a lot about moving boundaries, the grounding line, the calving front, but even just the thinning and thickening of the ice shelf. How to think about making sure, if it's important to your ocean model, that you somehow don't, that sort of everything in That sort of everything in your ocean is connected to every other part of the ocean, so kind of a flood fill. Certain types of ocean models have issues with the horizontal pressure gradient. I'll talk just briefly about that. And then just some things that we might keep in mind about what we know and don't know about the ice-ocean boundary layer, which is really important for basically getting melt rates from ocean models. Okay, so coupling. So, what are the considerations with coupling? So, what are the considerations with coupling? And then, what are the different approaches? A lot of the models, especially the earlier ice sheet ocean models, use offline coupling. And the basic approach is in some way you checkpoint or you create a restart file for your ocean and ice sheet components, or maybe your whole Earth system model. And then you kind of stop the whole process, you do some sort of update of the geometry of your ocean model, maybe some. Model, maybe some of your other components. And this typically requires extrapolating some ocean properties into new ocean cells that weren't there before. So it's not a very physical process, but it's super easy. It's one of the easiest solutions to what's called the wetting and drying problem. And so the pros are basically that it's quite easy, that you can kind of take advantage of infrastructure you might already have for initializing an ocean model. The cons are definitely that. The cons are definitely that it's not so clear how to make this approach conservative. So, by default, it really isn't conservative. You're doing some sort of ad hoc extrapolation. If you want to make it conservative, it tends to be kind of in a hacky way. You kind of compensate for whatever properties are lost or gained by this extrapolation process. And there's other unphysical aspects of it. And it can be pretty clumsy if you're on a supercomputer and constantly starting and stopping your Your Earth system model or your coupled model in order to do this process. So, talking with Adrian, for example, in UK ESM, they do this coupling only every year, in part because they can kind of get away with it, and it's not starting and stopping the model so often. Yeah, we'll start anymore and they load anyway. Wait. So it was the model checkpoint save and carry on. So, at least for us, the difference would be that you checkpoint the model, but then you kind of have to stop the running process in some way to do this update of the geometry. And you probably have a gajillion processors that are doing nothing while that update happens. And if it's not very long, then it's fine. But if it's sort of a non-negligible amount of the runtime, then that can slow down the whole process a bit. Down the whole process a bit. I'm just curious because I've just got experience with one ocean model, this stopping and restarting on an HPC. Surely this depends, this varies ocean model by ocean model and HPC framework by HPC framework. How hard it is to do that? Yeah. Sure, yeah. I mean, but it's a fairly generic problem that you're waiting in the queue, so you're not necessarily running constantly. So if you have the luxury of having an HPC where you get to run all the time, then you might not notice this so much. The time, then you might not notice this so much. But if you're finding that you're having to re-queue or run particularly long jobs to take advantage of basically stopping doing this process and restarting, I mean, I've just found that it's much slower than running a standalone. So let's say the ocean model is the most expensive part. It's still much slower to run the coupled model just because of the clumsiness of this offline procedure, at least as we experienced it. And we did a lot to try to use basically the ice sheet processors. Use basically the ice sheet processors to do the sort of overlap, the timing, and things like that. And even with that, it's still a lot clumsier and a lot slower than a standalone component, where you can just not worry about basically exactly when your run is finished. So, I mean, at least the hope is that online coupling will sort of, this is what Earth system models in general do between other components, and that online coupling might offer sort of a more obvious way to. A more obvious way to do coupling between ice sheets and oceans in an Earth system model. So, certainly in E3SM, this is the type of approach we're taking. And one aspect of that is you probably need some way of updating the geometry in the ocean model in a more continuous way. So, you're not going to do this abruptly every month. You're going to do it continuously, probably every time step, but at least every few time steps. Maybe every ocean coupling interval, which is more like every hour or something like that, rather than every month. Or something like that, rather than every month or every year. So there's some fairly obvious advantages. It's a lot easier to be conservative. So meaning that basically if your ocean column thickens, you would just suck in ocean water into your ice shelf cavity in an obvious and sort of physical way rather than some sort of extrapolation process. And the biggest con to this online coupling is basically figuring out how to do these moving boundaries in a more Moving boundaries in a more sort of, I mean, basically, the ocean models were not designed typically with this wetting and drying or moving boundaries process in mind, and so it's pretty tricky to add it in after the fact. So this is the sort of partial list of coupled ice sheet ocean models that I'm aware of, and many of them I'm aware of in part because they're involved in this MesoMEP effort that I'll talk about a little bit later. But basically, there's about equal numbers at this point of offline. Numbers at this point of offline and online coupled, but the online coupled are quite a bit newer and many of them are still really in development rather than finished. If anybody knows that any of this information is incorrect or some are missing, it would be important to know. I didn't include other classes of models that maybe Olga will be talking about in the next talk, but there's classes of models with, say, plume models representing the ocean or that kind of thing. And that's not something I included in this list. And that's not something I included in this list. And there's parametrizations, and I think Elin will talk a little bit about sort of somewhat simpler approaches to how you treat the cavity. But this is really full 3D ocean models coupled to sort of full complexity ice sheet models in some sense. Okay, so the coupler that E3SM uses as well as CESM, the Community Earth System model, is called CEEM. And that's where we basically have started our development of Aishido. Have started our development of ice sheet ocean coupling. And so these nearly identical pictures just show melt rates computed in the ocean model without the coupler or in the coupler. And basically, the results other than some masking are qualitatively quite similar. But there are some advantages in doing the melt rates in the coupler. And the chief one is down here. It's basically that we can use the high spatial resolution Ice sheet. We can use the high spatial resolution ice sheet grid and the high temporal resolution ocean coupling frequency to compute melt rates that are appropriate for both components. So the ice sheet model would really like to have melt rates that are on its own grid and at its resolution. And one of the chief things that I'll get into in more detail in just a little bit is that basically this allows the ice sheet grid to be used to decide which cells are floating and which are grounded. And that really helps. And that really helps to prevent melting undergrounded ice, which can then drive grounding line retreat that you don't really want to have. So, for us, the coupling of a dynamic geometry is something we've thought about quite a bit, but it's still a process that's under development. By the way, feel free to interrupt me at any point if there are questions or clarification or anything like that. So, one of the other frameworks I'm aware of for doing ice sheet-ocean coupling is. For doing ice sheet ocean coupling is called Physoc, the framework for ice sheet ocean coupling, and it's developed by Rupert Gladstone based on the ESMF framework. And this is a really nice tool because it's meant to be fairly generic. So you could, in theory, at least, take any ocean model that has been used within an ESMF coupling framework and any ice sheet model and kind of just add the specific pieces needed to describe the To describe the grid and a few things like that, and then at least in theory, coupling should be possible. Of course, your ocean model has to support all of the things I listed before, and we'll get into a little bit more, moving boundaries and so on. But at least it's a promising way of basically not having to develop a coupler from scratch for yourself. And then UKESM is the other area, the other Earth system model that I'm aware of that sort of has this process. And talking to both Rod. And talking to both Robin and Adrian, they're basically using this offline coupling process. So, as Adrian was just saying, they save checkpoints, they update basically the NEMO geometry in that checkpoint using something like their initialization process each time to develop new NEMO geometry. And then they sort of bilinearly interpolate melt rates from NEMO onto the bicycle's grid and continue. Feel free to say anything more if there's anything you would yeah so the the interpolation will work you know so we've got idea that to embed a dense scaling but it's not clear at the moment that that's yeah in terms of so you you presumably have to deal with this problem of sort of because melt rates are computed on the ocean grid you have to figure out some way of making sure they don't end up under grounded ice and that's that's a little bit of a complication yeah something we Yeah, it's something we deal with as well. Okay, so one of the things I wanted to talk about in Earth system models, and one of the reasons that Earth system models might like to basically have ice sheet ocean processes in them, is that typically Earth system models do a pretty crummy job at dealing with both solid runoff fluxes. So, this green curve is the solid runoff flux in time, and this is the spatial extent of that. Spatial extent of that. So basically, this is what an Earth system model typically thinks calving looks like. And so one of the things we've done is gone to a climatology of icebergs, basically melting of icebergs from a NEMO simulation, and are using this map to do iceberg fluxes instead and based on a climatology. So we've basically gone from this green curve, which has sort of the wrong seasonal cycle, to this. Seasonal cycle to this purple curve, which has a more reasonable one, where basically go ahead. It's mostly just a question based on my own ignorance. I mean, when you talk about under ice melting and that sort of thing, I have a sense of what the grid resolution on those kind of walls is away from the ice. Is it still the same resolution as you get into the ice? That depends on the model, but basically similar. So for us in the Earth system model, us in the Earth system model we're we're at basically in the in the polar regions we're at a ice a sea ice and ocean resolution of about 30 kilometers so that's typical sort of maybe a little better than one degree like a half degree IPCC type resolution but yeah it's so we have grand plans for having much higher resolutions say 10 kilometer even five kilometer in this region but for now it's still relatively unique It's still relatively uniform under shelves. So, the phasome model, which is an unstructured finite element model, actually does go to quite fine resolution under certain ice shelves to basically be able to capture the dynamics. So, it really depends on what the model capability is. But I think that's pretty unique among ocean models that basically it's ours, MPAS Ocean, and Phason, that are really capable of doing that refinement. I know that there were ambitions for the UK model. There's a UK model that's fully finite element, but I don't think that that has really gone into production. So this is, just to round things out, this is what's called the liquid runoff in a sort of version of the Earth system model where you don't have melting under ice shelves. And this is what we get when we do have melting under ice shelves. And so the total mean annual melt. And so the total mean annual melt, freshwater flux rather, from calving plus melting is about the same in these two approaches. But the seasonal cycle and the spatial distribution is really different, and that really can impact the fidelity of the climate around Antarctica, especially. All right, so this is a bit of a tricky thing. I don't know that I'm going to get into too much detail about it. But basically, unless you really work hard, your grid for, so in this case, is an atmosphere, but you could think of it as being. Is an atmosphere, but you could think of it as being an ocean and the ice. They overlap in a pretty strange and sort of tricky way. And if that's true, then you have to kind of think about: okay, what are the individual overlap pieces? There's a lot of software for handling this, but it's not necessarily prepared for these dynamic sort of masks between components. So that's something you really have to think about. Because basically, if your calving front moves and your grounding line moves, all of these interactions between components are affected. I'm not going to go. Components are affected. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail, but the ones involving the ice sheet are kind of obvious. But the fact that the extent of the atmosphere and ocean, sea ice and ocean, atmosphere and sea ice is also affected, that's kind of a messy process, basically. You don't want the atmosphere interacting with the ocean through the ice shelf, for example. And so then there's this consideration specific to grounded versus melting. I'm just going to show a car. Versus melting. I'm just going to show a cartoon. Basically, let's pretend floating ice is here, and the ice sheet grid is this sort of tilted one, and the ocean grid is this other one, this sort of sheared one. And this is grounded ice. You basically want to be careful that the ocean sees melting only in this region, as does the ice sheet. So the ocean grid cell might sort of experience a smaller melt flux than if it were melting over the whole grid cell. And the ice sheet will be very careful not to. And the ice sheet will be very careful not to melt under the grounded ice. That's just something that basically has to be thought about. There are various approaches to it, but the simplest one we've come up with is if you just do the melt fluxes on the icy grid. Perhaps I'm thinking of this as a vertical grid in this, sorry, a horizontal grid. So, yeah, so this is. So, yeah, so this is looking down on a, say, this is a grounding line, and you're looking down on it. So, in terms of the vertical, could you explain a bit more what you mean by that? I just meant that half of that ocean vista should not have any ocean in the sea, maybe. Right, so I guess my experience is that that doesn't matter too much, that it's better to have ocean under grounded ice and just not have melting in that little bit of ocean undergrounded ice, than it is to not have ocean at all and not be able. It is to not have ocean at all and not be able to compute a melt rate, not have an ocean property. And in fact, wetting, I mean, having wetting and drying in your model means that you're going to have to have ocean cells. Yeah, but I mean, but that's a bit of a different thing because you probably don't trust the properties and you probably wouldn't send those properties on to the ice sheet model. Well, you just have a very small edge of the deck. Yeah. So this thin film approach, which Dan knows more about than I do, actually, is typically like a centimeter thick. Is typically like a centimeter-thick ocean under the ice. So it's got ocean properties, but they're not particularly evolving in a realistic way. They're just held kind of fixed and diffusing. This is an issue about where you want to compute the ocean circulation or not, like you need a certain minimum thickness there. Right, so that's good enough. Yeah, so that's a different consideration, but it's definitely true for a lot of ocean models that you basically thicken around the grounding. Around the grounding line, you can't get as thin as the grounding line really should be. So, in many ocean models, you also vertically thicken the ocean column to basically allow for, say, two cells minimum thickness or something like that. And it's quite tricky. Yeah. Any other discussion or questions about that? Well, I guess I'm slightly concerned about just raising it in order to be able to compute something without thinking about whether that's idealistic. Yeah, no, we do. And actually, I think it's not that we raise the bottom of the ice. Typically, what's done at this point is digging down the bathymetry. And partly for the reasons that Dan discussed, that seems to have less of an effect. So basically, the flow under the ice is affected a lot by the slope of the ice. So you want to try to preserve that near the grounding line. But the bathymetry, the details of the, I mean, it matters some. There's no way to say that it doesn't, but there have been various studies. Say that it doesn't, but there have been various studies, one in Fasum recently, basically showing that, yeah, there's a lot of places at least where you can thicken without a huge impact on your melt fluxes. So we'd ideally like to keep things thin, but for reasons that I'll get into shortly, it's numerically quite challenging. Okay, so here are getting into that, some considerations about the ocean component as opposed to the coupling. And so I'm going to show a bunch of pictures. And so I'm going to show a bunch of pictures from a couple of different idealized simulations. This is from DeRitt and Goodmanson, where they have basically an idealized pine island with a ridge. And so this is looking from the side, and this is looking down. And you're sort of retreating past this ridge. And basically, it illustrates nicely various aspects of ice heat ocean coupling that you have to take into account. So the most obvious is as the ice cell thins, the ocean model has to sum. Ice cell thins, the ocean model has to somehow be able to go into that space. And there are a couple different approaches, but the one used in this model is just this extrapolation, this offline coupling approach. So in a Z-level model, basically to represent an ice shelf, you have some sort of top index, just like you would have a bottom index. So a Z-level model just has flat layers in the model. And so the ice shelf is basically getting cut out of those flat layers in the same way that the bathymetry is getting. In the same way that the bathymetry is getting cut out of the bottom of the ocean model. And so to add that to a model, you're sort of re-indexing every vertical array in the entire model, but once you've done that, you kind of have this idea of a top, just like the bottom of your ice. And all of the other types of models, so terrain following or layered models, typically what's done is basically to depress the top of the ocean under the ice shelf, and that can have its own. And that can have its own set of numerical difficulties. So, the next consideration is basically something to do with how browning lines move. And this is where basically the difference between offline and online coupling is kind of related to whether you're going to have a wetting and drying scheme, where you have a thin film perhaps, or whether you're just going to extrapolate ocean properties and update your ocean domain as you go. So, this model. You go. So, this model used this process of updating the ocean domain. So, basically, each of these has a sort of hiccup where there's an extrapolation process and then the model spins back up to steady state. Whereas in Dan's recent work in the MITGCM ice ocean model, they basically use this thin film approach, and correct me if I've misunderstood. But basically, so this is a coastal application, but basically the same is done under grounded ice where you have. The same is done under grounded ice, where you have a thin film of ocean, and it's considered to be kind of dry, and those properties aren't allowed to change particularly much. And then there's some sort of way that ocean water can, say, flow into that thin film area or flow back out, and you get basically the creation of new thin film. I think it's a little less sophisticated than what they've done for shallow water models and tidal estuaries, because there's just complexity. Because there's just complications of trace. Yeah, there's various approaches. It's essentially just treagle under the ice sheet, not doing anything. And then the last consideration is just the calving front. So these Z-level models with sort of flat layers are also able to have very abrupt, very horizontal, very vertical calving fronts, like here. Here. But terrain-following models like ROMS and MPAS Ocean basically have to have some sort of smooth representation of the calving front to prevent pressure gradient errors, as I'll talk about in a second. And so that's basically a consideration. It affects the dynamics possibly quite significantly right at the calving front. It's a lot easier for ocean water to move in and out of the cavity if there's a relatively mild transition between the two compared to this abrupt. Transition between the two compared to this abrupt one. So, again, somewhat related to what Dan was talking about with topographic features that block motion in and out of ice shelf cavities or across sort of sills or that kind of thing. Okay, so then there's a question of how that calving front moves. So, you have this, these different types of representations. Some models, so this is the popsicles model, it's also a Z-level model, it can represent basically the It can represent basically the calving front and the calving process as an abrupt change in that front. So you can basically move it abruptly from out here to back here. But in a different type, like a layered model or a terrain following model, that cabbing front is probably going to have to move fairly gradually to a new position so as not to completely shock the ocean. And that's going to have to happen sort of over many time steps in a relaxed way. And that may affect basically the And that may affect basically the realism of the ocean dynamics. I mentioned just briefly connectivity to the ocean. I don't think I'm going to go into this much. The gist is, in this particular simulation, there are these subglacial lakes that aren't connected to the ocean for a while. And at some point, they become connected. And so in certain types of ocean models, you really have to think about that. You basically have to do a floodfill all the time to find out what part of your ocean is, what part of your potential ocean is actually connected to. Is actually connected to the main ocean. What would you flood fill it with? I mean, you have to specify salinity and all that fun stuff. Exactly, so that's the extrapolation process. You can do the extrapolation process in one or two cells, or you can do it in a whole subglacial lake. And it turns out to be numerically okay to do that, but it's physically pretty crummy, I would say. So, if conservation is an issue when you're doing a little extrapolation here and there, it's really an issue when you're And there, it's really an issue when you fill in a subglacial lake. But surprisingly, the models don't blow up, so we kind of continue to be okay with this process. I'll add just that this model is on what's called a C grid. That means it's somewhat easier to sort of connect, basically it's easier to have a smaller number of grid cells and connect flow into these channels. I worked with a model that has a different configuration. With a model that has a different configuration called a B-grid. Velocities are at corners rather than edges. And in that configuration, you need a whole bunch more cells to have connectivity. And that means you're, in the same way that we're digging in depth, we're sort of horizontally digging out much broader channels than we really have just in order to have connectivity. That can mean you have a lot more flow back into a region like this than you really would if you had higher resolution. Do you just need one grid cell with a C grid? For a C grid, maybe. For a C grid, maybe or two, depending on if you want return flow. You could have return flow that's purely vertical, then you could get away with one, but it's best to have two. And in the pop model, which is a B grid, I had to have three, so that's quite a big stencil, basically, to have a channel. But this connectivity issue for the models that have to deal with it is a pain in the butt. Okay, so I mentioned pressure gradient a couple of times. I just want to kind of give you. Times. I just want to kind of give you a cartoon feel for why that's a problem. So, this is a cartoon of an ice sheet, an ice shelf growing on top of an ocean. And basically, this is some sort of a terrain-following coordinate. This happens to be the one that we use in MPAS Ocean. So it's kind of terrain-following, it's definitely terrain-following at the top, not quite terrain-following at the bottom, as you'll see as we progress through this. But basically, there's a number called the Haney number, and that measures. Called the Haney number, and that measures how thin and tilted layers are in a non-dimensional way. And if that Haney number gets too large, and what we mean by large really depends on the ocean model, if it gets too large, your model's going to blow up. And so as the ice sheet grows, the ice shelf thickens, you basically get larger and larger Haney numbers, and you have to do something about it to keep... So in this case, I've done some sort of nasty process to make sure this Haney number. Nasty process to make sure this Haney number never exceeds five, which we've found in our model is kind of the upper limit for us. And so I've done nasty things here at the bottom to make that happen. Turns out, in similar ways to what I was talking about before, you can do some fairly nasty things to your bathymetry without affecting melt rates too badly. And I'm glad to see Dan's work that somewhat more rigorously tells me what I kind of already knew: that you can mess with bathymetry a surprising amount without. A surprising amount without completely ruining your model. So that's basically pressure gradients. It's something that we think about in a lot of models. Then there's the boundary layer physics under the ice sheet, and I'm not going to have any time whatsoever to get into it, just to say it's a whole process that, say, Adrian is involved in a lot, sort of thinking about simplified 1D models. We're involved in doing large Eddy simulations, trying to sort of understand. To sort of understand more of these dynamics. Basically, there's kind of a problem where we don't really have a resolution-independent way of representing the boundary layer physics. So, as you start, you might be okay if you're not resolving that boundary layer at all. You might be okay if you're completely resolving that boundary layer and you know something about the turbulence, but we're really not good at that transition. Okay, it looks like I am already running out of time. I'm just going to then talk about Then talk about initialization very quickly and then let it be at that. So, initialization basically for idealized setups, we have a pretty good idea how we initialize models. We start from no melting. We kind of spin up the model, the ice sheet model with no melting for a long period of time. You wouldn't have to do that, but this is our typical procedure. And then the question is: sort of how much you're willing to shock that system by having. That system by having warm versus cold ocean conditions. So, in a lot of the coupled modeling I've been involved with, we kind of decided we would start with cold conditions to not shock the system too much and let it warm up over a period of time. And so, this is the MISOMEP experiment. In Dan's system from 2012, they just you guys just basically hit it hard with warm conditions right away, even though you spun up to no melt. We were criticized by the reviewers, but By the reviewers, but that's how it goes. But anyway, so I mean, it's just something one has to think about, but a lot less with an idealized configuration because you're not trying to reproduce observations. But in a realistic configuration, it really does take some thinking. So you're going to have to spin up your components in some order. And the way that, at least I had done it with the Popsicles model, is that we first spun up the ocean using observed topography. And we did that in the hope that we would somehow. And we did that in the hope that we would somehow be able to create an ice sheet state that was close to the observed topography, so there wouldn't be a lot of geometric shock when we started coupling. And so you start from rust, you have some climatology of temperature and salinity, you extrapolate under ice shelves and you do a spin-up whatever you can afford. And then you maybe tune some parameters to try to get the melt rates to be a bit more realistic, but they're not going to match observations. So then you go to the ice sheet and you might do spin-up, you might do data assimilation, that's what we've talked about this whole. Simulation, that's what we've talked about this whole time. But the main thing is it would be great if you could use the ocean spin-up melt rates to do this just so you can kind of prevent some shock, switching from observed melt rates to what the ocean is actually going to simulate. Try to prevent transients in your ice sheet model that are going to develop because there's likely to be quite a difference between the ocean and observed melt rates. And observed melt rates. But that's got its own set of issues. But regardless of what you do, there's going to be at least a small shock, either because of geometry or change in melt rates as you start. Just to quickly point out that that can go into Morrow's tau term or whatever he had in his optimization, just like the surface max pattern can. But it, um, so just skipping to the very end, so I don't worry about all of this. This is just Don't worry about all of this. This is just details of just skipping to the very end. If you have melt rates like this, then they're okay. Sure, you might be able to do this, but if your melt rates are off the charts different, you're not going to want to optimize that out of your ice sheet models. I'm assuming the melt rates are. Right, so this is part of the other consideration. It's basically you want to have Earth system models that can provide at least a reasonable starting point, or you're not going to be able to do projections or even useful hindcasts, as we've Useful hindcasts as we've experienced ourselves. Yeah. And we've seen, basically, we've seen this in both coupled models that we've seen. You can get quite divergent melt rates depending on choices in forcing and things like that, and it's pretty frustrating. We don't seem to find that we're nicely in this region, except in the very recent simulations. Fingers crossed. Okay, thanks a lot, and hopefully, this. There's time for some discussion. Did it only do 20 minutes? It's still going. Oh, it's still going. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, we can leave it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, damn. Really interesting points at the end about initialization of couple of models and considerations that need to be made. So, this, you know, two bullet points, one saying observations, the other saying spin-up, and they're not going to match. They're never going to be the same. They're never going to be the same. This was sort of meant to be a choice that you're making. That's not the point I'm making, but what I'm wondering is: you know, I guess there's very dimension tuning, so there's various ways of changing sort of like low-dimensional numbers per parameter sets to try to get things to match. I've heard people discussing changing the C D or whatever, the frictional coefficient, cell by cell, which is probably a mistake because that's not gonna match in sort of 20 years or 30 years. You know, 20 years or 30 years. What are the aspects of observations that are important to tune to for something like this? So, yeah, so getting back to there's also just not per cell, but per cavity tuning some of these parameters. And there's something to be said for maybe some cavities are a bit rougher than others, and you might be able to tune to some degree. But I think one has to be really careful. So if you're basically, if your ocean is far too If your ocean is far too cool in the Edmundson region, for example, it's conceivable that you could tune melt parameters and get a melt rate that's high enough in that region. But that would be a bad approach. Are you talking about bulk melt rates other than instead of say patterns with melt rates? Yeah, no, right. But even to get the bulk, and absolutely, that's largely what we focused on in these particular plots is bulk melt rates. But right, absolutely. So let's say your first order thing that you're Your first-order thing that you're trying to do is get the bulk melt rates under the ice shelves and perhaps even average it over the region in sort of the right space. You could conceivably do a certain amount of tuning, but you're right. The patterns will be wrong, but more importantly, the response, or equally importantly, the response over time to changes in ocean conditions are going to be vastly different than if you had corrected the biases in some way. So I would say what you want. I would say what you want to do is go back into your ocean model or your Earth system model and try to figure out something about what processes are going wrong. That would be the first thing to do. And if you can't do that, it would be better to try to do some sort of correction to the temperature state than it would be to try to do that with some sort of sub-ice shelf process. And that's kind of the philosophy in ISMIP6 approach. I think this is more an aspirational comment, and it cuts across the different approaches. But and it cuts across the different Earth system components, right? But you address the same thing, right? You so, in all of these components, in the ocean, in the atmosphere, in sea ice, we spin up the model. So that's one choice to have it to something that we think is well equivalent rated or we have all the alternative, we try to fit it very well to observations. And each of these separately will not work, right? Because the spin-up state will be biased heavily and the observation state will have shocks. Observation state will have shocks. And so it really brings up the aspiration whether in the next decade we really focus on a formal calibration approach that can really combine those two. So what is the process that brings in the observations and the issue of a well-known state within a joint framework. And because this project Klima brought up for all the Project Plima brought up for all the skepticism about machine learning and so on, they do recognize and say, well, for a long time, atmospheric models have had issues with the same biases for the last 50 years, never been able to solve them. And one of the conceptual approaches is we really need to have a formal framework to calibrate the model such as to bring in the observations in a more consistent manner. So it's easy. So it's more easily said than done, but it just keeps to be pushed under the rug to say, we hope that the spinner produces something useful, but when it doesn't, we tune something, but then we tune something, there is no formal process in place on how to do that well. And so it's, again, I admit it's a hard problem, but I think it's one, since we're talking about mathematical concepts and approaches, I think maybe I think make this community and the atmosphere and the ocean and the coupled community sort of aspire to this and the common development to see how this can be. And I think that ice-ocean sort of initialization is complicated by quite different time scales. So it depends on whether you care about long-term transients in the ice sheet, but small changes in ocean climate can drastically sort of change that trajectory. Yeah, I think we have time for cutting. So I was just going to say, the experience in other multiphysics, heavy school multiphysics communities like Field Structure Interaction, is that it's not sufficient to communicate conservatively interface quantities. That you and have a stack and still have a stack of solar, but that's not sufficient to guarantee stability. Um you really have to treat it as a two-way couple problem. To treat it as a two-way couple problem and a half implicit solution of the interface. And otherwise, reduce abilities that are artifacts and numerics. I don't know if that's the case here. Of course, this is more complicated than just fluid structure interaction. But the modern approach there is you write down everything at the continuum level. Timely Gang's problem, you couple, you write down interface positions. The naturally s the natural the conjugate of interface attractions is naturally satisfied weak form. So you don't even have to compute that stuff. That stuff. And then, you know, once you have this coupled system, then you can ask: okay, it's going to be highly low-conditioned because of different properties. Then you have some kind of pre-conditioner.
