And she will talk about quantitative hypocrisy estimates based on Hermit-Speich theorems. Thank you very much, Maria. And I would like to start with thanking the organizers for organizing such a nice event and for giving me the opportunity to present my work here. So I can see already the first typo, so it's not a good start. Maybe I'm coming from death. Like this is the correct one and this is the wrong one. So today I'm gonna talk about. I'm gonna talk about here as the title says uh some hypercorsivity estimates based on obtained by Harris type theorems. So oops this is not the word this is yeah yeah so my outline is mostly the main references I'm gonna mention today. Okay, I will talk about many other papers as well, but these are the main ones. So first two when I introduce When I introduce Hairstype Turants, my references will be mostly these two. So the versions of the Turants are from these two papers. And I'm also going to talk about the applications, how we can use these type of results to obtain some hypocrisy estimates. That will be mainly like my work, which I started doing during my PhD with Jose Alfredo, who is my. My PhD with Jose Alfredo, who is my PhD supervisor. And last two papers that are in grey. I'm not going to talk about those, but these were the starting points of this work, like where Jose suggested me to work on this type of, like use these type of methods in these non-local integral differential equations, maptikinetic equations, which we first see the results on these. Then we try to Then we try to look at also the kinetic equations which in this first paper here in the applications. And yeah, let's go. Oops, not that side, this side, yeah. So let's start with very basic introduction. So you all know what the kinetic equation is, but yeah, let's separate this transport term where f is the probability. Like, f is the probability of the probability density function, basically describing the probability of finding a particle at time t, at position x, moving with a velocity p. And the velocity and the space position are in this phase space living here. I will describe this later on when we are interested when we look at the particular equations. And our transport term will be either the free transport operator or sometimes. Or sometimes when we are talking about the kinetic equations appearing in gas theory, it will be also sometimes I'll consider confining potential external force field here. And the collision term will specify the equation we are interested in, which I'll define later. And only maybe main thing about this, it acts only on the velocity variable. And today I'm gonna consider only the Gonna consider only the initial data, which are probability measures. Here, P stands for that defined on this phase space. So now let's go to the hypocoursivity as you all of you know, but so we would like to find the time-independent solution, equilibrium solution for the kinetic equation I just described here. Equation: I just described here, which I refer to as QAE. And that, and I would like to look at the convergence as time goes to infinity to this equilibrium solution. So, more precisely, I would like to find a constant, positive constant, and a positive function, such that as time goes to infinity, this function function will converge to zero and it will satisfy this type of inequality. This type of inequality, if that is the case, my equation will be called as hypocursive in the distance which is star here, which will be specified later. So if this function is exponential, then I have exponential convergence to equilibrium, geometric convergence, also it's called s. Or if it's not the polynomial, but the one-over-polynomial function, let's say, then it is a. Function, let's say, then it is slower than exponential, subgeometric convergence. And yeah, so basically, this is what hypercoercivity is all about. It's just the mixing of the, like, estimating the mixing of, yeah, so like when you have the kinetic equation, then transport happens only in the space, right? Then the collision terms, like collision terms, acts only on the velocity, then which has. The velocity, then which has a dissipative effect. And again, the transport mixes this dissipation into the space variable, and you try to estimate this effect of mixing. So that's what's hypocoursility, and it's due to these, like starting with these references. And there are many more afterwards. Okay, these are the starting points. And yeah, so today I will be interested in. Today, I will be interested in the kinetic equations which are described by continuous time Markov processes. So, then the study of long-time behavior of Markov processes is referred to as ergoticity. So, then I will make a connection with the ergotic behavior of Markov processes with the spectral properties of the semi-groups generated by my kinetic equations. So, I will make it precise a bit later. So, like according to this very nice paper, like also, there are two ways of obtaining quantitative estimates for continuous time Markov processes. The first one is the Poincaré type inequalities, where you try to prove integral bounds on the generator of my Markov process. So, it goes more into the classical hypercoercivity, which will. Into the classical hypocoerciity, which we will mention briefly later. And the second one is the Hairstep theorems. This is based on finding nice Lyapunov functions and using those we prove some nice inequalities on the generator of the generator of our Markov semi-group. So my talk is today, as you guessed from the titles, about the second one. About the second one. And this paper, they also mention a connection between these two approaches in the sense, like by means of some inequalities they call Poincaré, Paris, or something like that. So in this nice paper, there is a nice connection between these two approaches. So more. So I said that I'm interested in the kinetic. interested in the kinetic equations which are described by continuous time Markov semi-groups. So continuous time Markov semi-groups are identified or defined by their transition probabilities, which is here P T of P T of uh Z E. Here I'm looking at some measurable space that is nice polished space and Polish space and sigma is its sporal set, and Pt is my transition probabilities for this is for Tz to Z E is a measurable function for every oral set E and this is Is a probability measure for every Tz. Okay, so some basic stuff. And currently M of Z will be the space of finite measures and P of Z will be space of probability measures later when I refer to them. And yeah, so what I will look at is this Markov semi-group or stochastic semi-group sometimes it's called and the main problem. Sometimes it's called. And the main properties, like I will not go into so much probability, the main properties are: it's a linear symbog, and it preserves positivity and it preserves mass. So how it is associated to the transition probability functions? It's of this way. So this semi-group generated by the basically defined by the transition probability functions of a continuous Markov Markov process are like by these actions of the semi-group on finite measures or its dual on the measurable functions. So when I say st of f0, this will be the solution of my kinetic equation with an initial date on f0 at time t. So this is what I'm going to use. And st of F infinity will be the session. F infinity will be the stationary, I mean F infinity will be the stationary solution for my PT. So let's look at first a bit of the references ideas. So yeah, this has said already. So the ideas going back to Dublin's paper from 1940, where he showed that if a Markov chain has a Markov chain has uniform, like the transition probabilities of a Markov chain has a uniform positive lower bound, then this Markov chain has a mixing property. Mixing means that it admits a unique stationary solution, unique invariant measure. So this was his result. And there is a, like, I guess, second or third chapter of this book by Stroup, which is explaining this theory, like this paper. Explain this theory, like this paper very nicely. And it's okay, it's not a new book, but this is the second edition. And then, next result is due to Paris, where he looked at the conditions of having a unique invariant measure for a Markov process, general Markov process this time, it's not a Markov chain. And then later, Main and 3D push this to Push this to show how to use this result, like to show how to, like, having this unit invariant measure, how they can show the exponential equilibrium to this invariant measure. So, then, around similar time, these uh papers, they use the similar ideas uh into subgeometric settings, not exponential, but algebraic or polynomial piquet. Algebraic or polynomial decay. And then until the paper of Martin Hayer and Jonathan Mattingly, like after this paper, these type of results gain a lot of interest in the PDE community. The reason is that they show how you can get quantitative estimates based on verifying the hypothesis needed for this type of results quantitatively. You could get your convergence race really quantitatively, constructively. And there, actually, the proof was also very easy to follow, especially these ones. To be able to read it, you should have some sort of probability background. But this is mostly the proofs are like by means of Wasserstein distances and Wasserstein distances and therefore the estimates they obtain in total variation distance or L1 distance. So after this, many people started looking at how to incorporate these ideas into more PDE language or PD problems. So then there is also the recent preprint by Josa Fredo and Stefan Mischler. They even like more More simple, I mean, not simplified, but then they started, they wrote the proofs of these theorems in purely kind of PVE language by using semi-group arguments and interpolation arguments. So then you can use these things to get results on the spectral properties of some integral differential operators, which can be described as piecewise deterministic marks. As piecewise deterministic Markov processes. So, this is some literature review done. Yeah, so let's look at what these Hairstike theorems are. So, the first condition that you look at is a, like, there are many names in the literature because these are kind of old results. Results are uniform mixing property. So, if you can prove for your Markov process starting from an arbitrary state to transition to any other state is positive, uniformly positive, then you satisfy this type of condition. But sometimes this is not easy to show, especially on the whole domain. Like you can sometimes show it in a particular subset. Show it in a particular subset of your state space, then you need the second condition, coming as geometric drift condition, to say that your process infinites visits this subset infinitely many times where you have a minorization condition. So it's like you try to find a small set, you try to find a set where your transition probability. Your transition probabilities are uniformly bounded by some positive quantity, positive number, then you show that by means of Foster-Lyapnov inequalities that your process visits this subset infinitely many often times. Then, if you have these two conditions verified, the theorem gives you a unique invariant measure and Measure and depending on how weak the second condition is or how strong you will have either exponential convergence or algebraic convergence. This is mainly it. So you don't have any information about the stationary state. You don't know how its shape is, like how it looks like, what it looks like. You just know that it exists and you lift it. And yeah. So in the case of Dublin, where you can prove uniform positive lower bound, so you don't need the second condition. So this is the simplest case. I'll just read it with you. So you have a Markov semigroup, let's say, or stochastic semi-group defined on a space of finite measures. And it says that there exists a constant between 0 and 1, and a probability. And a probability measure, and some time tau, such that after some time tau, your solutions can be bounded uniformly by this quantity. And then, if you can satisfy this condition, which is D, Lawness condition, then you have a unique stationary solution. And for any probability measure, you can have this hypercoarsivity inequality I showed in the second slide. Inequality are showed in the second slide. And then, what nice thing about this is that you can know these constants, they just are appearing in the condition that you need to verify. So, that's what I mean quantifying the hypercorsuit estimate. You just know the rate and you know this constant. So, that's the goal anyway. So, this is the simplest case where you can find this uniform positive lower bound. Positive lower bound all over the state space. So, if you cannot do that, the second theorem is the Harrison's theorem. I will call it S. You have the similar condition as Dublin's here, as M, minorization stands for minorization, but here it's not verified in the whole domain, like not it's not valid for all probability measures, but probability. All probability measures, but probability measures defined on a set whose, like how large this set is, verified, like determined by the first condition, which is the Koster-Bioplot condition. So, what does it say? It says that I have a nice function here which satisfies this type of inequality. So, here, L star is the generator of my Markov process. So, I told you that my equation is. That my equation is the flat semi-group defines my equation. I showed, I defined it as ST, right? And the tool of this is S T star. And how I define the generator of my process is that for any of the other. Here for any smooth function. So, this is how I define my generator, instances small generator of my processor or forwards operator. And yeah, so once you verify these two conditions, then similarly you will have an existence of an existence of unique stationary solution, and you will have this. And you will have this uh uh the the inequality, uh hypercoercivity in um um to weighted total variation distance, which I defined it as this. So in the first one I forgot, this is only oh no, this is the second one, so it's counterintuitive. Uh this is the total variation distance or L1 distance, let's say the between two probability measures. And yeah, so Yep. So this is the second era. And the third one is the most more complicated subgeometric case. So here the main difference is, I will not go into detail, but the main difference is that you are not able to verify this foster reapno condition as strongly as in the previous case. Here, it's directly. Here it's directly on phi, my Lyapunov function, and here this is in the sublevel sets of some functional. So you need to find a functional which satisfies this type of inequality and also there are some specifications of this functional strictly concave, positive and increasing up to infinity and the To infinity, and as your Lyapunov function goes to infinity, the derivative of V of your Lyapunov function will be equal to zero. And the same thing, this is the minorization condition, which is valid again in some part of the domain, which actually I did not, I guess, write how R is defined here, because it's getting. Because it's getting longer. So, what we need to pay attention here, I'm writing the version of the theorem from the preprint of Joseph Friedman and Stefan Mischler. So, there, to be able to write their proofs in a nicer semi-group-like way, they couldn't get rid of this Feller assumption. So, what it means for a Markov semi-group to have Feller property, it should map bounded measurable functions. map bounded measurable functions to the space of bounded measurable functions to the space of continuous functions. So this is an extra assumption here, which we deduct, which we did not have in the other two theorems. Okay, so these are the results. So here, yeah, it's a bit looking complicated, but that's a good question. Yeah, sure. So your setup here, I guess, it looks like it's... So your setup here, I guess, it's hard for me to tell based on the V and the H, H indebts, but it looks like you can get things that are algebraically decaying, right? So if you're in a situation where things don't relax exponentially, your thing will apply, potentially at least? Yes, yes. So this is for sub-geometric convergence, right? I guess I don't know what's going on. Yeah, yeah, sorry, I forgot to maybe say it. So this is now I understand you're subgeometric. Okay. That's exactly what you're asking, I guess. Yeah, that's the thing. Yeah, that's the thing. Yeah, I mean, now I will show this on an example, very simple example on a linear BGK equation, which will be a bit maybe easier to follow, what they mean. Okay, so before going to the examples, I would like to make some comments. So what are the differences of using these type of methods to These types of methods to like compare to classical hypercoercivity methods. So, first of all, is the first thing is the initial data and the functional space related to that. As I showed you, we can get the convergence hyperversity estimates in the total variation or weighted total variation distances by using these type of approaches, which is also kind of physical when you think about initial data like minimum. Data like minimal assumptions to make an initial on make on an initial data for problems, kinetic equations describing gas dynamics would be like having the finite measure, right? So sometimes, like for classical hypercoercivity techniques, you run into some problems. You may not be able to use them to get the estimates in L1 distance or like a weighted total variation distance. One example here is. Variation distance. One example here is the Kinetic-Foker-Planck equation, which generally you need this type of assumption. So, what was the collision term of the kinetic kinetic for the right-hand side of the like first equation I wrote would be something like di-convergence and plus. Elephant class means friction term, something like this. So let's say the equilibrium of this linear Kendig-Boker-Planck equation is F infinity, which will be something like Gibbs distribution, right? And if you write the equation in terms of this, so I showed the equilibrium as F infinity, then you will have this collision operator self-adjoint in L2. A joint in a L two space which is created by this equilibrium. So then it's difficult. You cannot get an estimate on this hypercourse with the estimates of L1 setting. But for harsh type results, you don't need these type of things. That's what I meant to say. And then they are also valid for initial data, like with bad local. With bad local regularities, like drag measures or like initial data loading became tails. And this is one command. And the other one is anyway you have seen in the statements, but they all completely give like constructive proofs and quantifiable convergence rates, all these rates depend on the constant appearing in the theorems or the Lyapunov function. Theorems or the Lyapunov function. Another thing. And maybe for me, most interestingly is this last part, which works well with non-explicit, non-equilibrium stationary states. What do I mean by this? So for the kinetic equations, like appearing in gas theory, sometimes, most of the time, maybe we can guess the shape of their equilibrium, right? It will be like something like Gibbs. Equilibrium, right? It will be like something like Gibbs distribution. But for kinetic models appearing in applied sciences, like from biology, for example, or some other applied sciences, you don't know the shape of their equilibrium state. So most of the time, for the classical hypercorciative things, you need Poincaré estimates and they involve some type of L2H1 spaces with the weight inverse of your expression. With a weight inverse of your equilibrium state. If you don't know what it is, in the case of kinetic equations in the applied sciences, then you will not be able to use these type of methods. You can use Harris's type of results very nicely. I will show you later if I have some examples on that. Yeah, that's all. That's all. So now I would like to show a little bit of an example on a very simple kinetic equation, which is a linear VGK equation proposed by these three physicists in 50s. And yeah, one of the simplest hypercoercive kinetic equations that you may see. So here is the this is the transport term. Transport term. Here is the external force confining potential phi, and on the right-hand side I have this collision term, and where M is the normalized Max Belian, normalized meaning that the temperature and momentum I take them as constant one. So I'm not interested in the Cauchy problem for this equation today, but I just cited some references where Uh references were uh still being studied, and actually, I guess in the non-linear cases, still very hard. So, what we know about this equation in the as time goes to infinity is that it will converge to this equilibrium state, which is given by Maxwell times e to the power minus the potential, combining potential, and is then look at. As we go on, each speaker is getting more efficient at getting rid of that particular notification. Oh, should we underview? Yeah. Maybe excuse me actually implies the time remaining for my talk, but I don't know. So anyway, so the for the when uh the space isn't force, we don't have of course this uh confining potential, then other equilibriums Then our equilibrium state simply will be the normalized max value. And when we are in the full space for quadratic confining potential, we will have exponential convergence to this state. And when you have sub-quadratic potential, like weaker potential, then you expect to have slower convergence. So this is the behavior. And okay, in the classical tools it has been studied by many people. Some of the references are here. There are more probably. And now I'm going to look at how we can use these previous theorems that I mentioned on this equation. So first I state the theorem. Mainly it says that okay we have the solution of the linear BGK equation where the initial data is a probability measure. Data is a probability measure, and we are either in three regimes, but I put only two of them here. So either we are in the like position x is in the torus and no confining potential, or we are in the whole space, x is in Rd, and we have a C2 confining potential, which satisfies this type of um uh di type of condition which with some positive constant, which means like it's quadratic. Which means like it's quadratic, at least. And if I'm either of these two regimes, then I can show that there exists unique equilibrium, which anyway was null, and there is an exponential convergence towards it with the rates. I can identify those. And the weight function here in the first case, it is the simplest case. We will not need to use higher. We will not need to use Harris's theorem. We use Dodwin's theorem here. The weight function is one, so it's the total variation distance, and the second one, the weight function, is given by this expression, where h is the total energy, which means kinetic energy plus the potential energy. So these are two regimes, and the last one is that we are still in the Rd with the C2 potential, and it is subquadratic. So it's weak. Subquadratic, so it's weaker potential, and then my I can get this estimate. Okay, one is here, total variation, L1, it's the same thing. I can bound it by these quantities. xi is here, is a constant between 0 and 1. And yeah, and my homie equilibrium state. So now let's look at simple Look at simple, maybe proofs of the in the first case at least. So here, the linear BGK equation on the torus there is no compiling potential. So we look at the transport part alone. There is the collision part which I'm not considering. And the semi-group generated by transport part alone, you can write a solution in terms of characteristics like this way. Characteristics like this way, and what you do commonly, also not only here, is that you can bound this solution by repeatedly using Duhamer's argument. By Cm would be the let's go just quickly back. C plus M would be this operator here, the positive part of the collision operator. And yeah, so yeah, so So, yeah, so what I'm looking for is a positive uniform lower bound for this quantity, right, for some time t. So, if I can quantify the bounds on the right-hand side, I'm done actually. So, for that, what I need is to look at the actions of these two operators on measures, probability measures, and try to quantify the bounds for them. So, first one would be in the collision operator. So, the idea. Operator. So the idea is that we allow to jump with any small velocity. So what do I mean by this? Like if I look at the lemma, so for any given beta, I can find an epsilon such that for any probability measure, I can bound the action of this collision part on this probability measure by this quantity. And this is very And this is very actually simple to see. For example, if you for any given beta, if you choose, you can choose this epsilon, this constant, to be Maxwellian distribution with V equal to beta, right? So this is not very difficult to see. Also, the second one, but it looks a little bit scary. So I also made this famous star. The second one will. Lemma star, the second one will be the lemma star star. So here we are looking at the action of the transport part alone. That we are saying that we are starting in a ball with a radius r, any place in this ball, with any small velocity, we are allowed to start. And what I'm saying is that I can go to any, I can reach any part of any point in this ball with a In this ball with a velocity which is predetermined. So, this is what this lemma is all about. So, for any given time toll and R, there exists some beta and R tilde, such that for all times bigger than this given timefall, I can bound the action of my transport part on any starting point. On any starting point in the torus within the radius r by this quantity. So, if particularly, for example, if we take the r initial ball to be the radius of the initial ball to be greater than square root of d, then I can get rid of this part, it will be always one, then I will have this type of simplified bound. So the So uh the uh how I mean I wrote this proof, but I don't know if I don't have time, so you can just quickly check check that it's not very difficult, but maybe uh looking a little bit horrible. So first, for any given toe and r, you look at the action of this transport on the on the on my measure, probable drag measure at position x0, and my velocities are living in a ball. And my velocities are living in a ball with the radius beta. And it will only act on the transport, on the position X part, right? So then I take an integral, I integrate it and change variables here. You see, I changed here. And then I try to look at this part. So that part, I can write it as such cos just cos x minus y. Just because x minus y specified by triangle inequality, and then if I assume that my r is my beta is greater than 2r over t, then I can enlarge this part. And then, if again, if I, since I'm my x is in, like, my goal, x is. Like goal X is still living in a ball of radius R, then my goal R tilde is greater than 2R over T, I can say that my initial starting ball of radius R lives in the in this in this ball. And then Then by combining these two and putting these together, I can get my final bound. And yeah, that's right. Yeah, the lemma, which is showing that the Dublin condition that I stated for positive lower bound is this one. So this is simply coming from using these two previous lemmas that I mentioned. Two previous lemmas that I mentioned. So, I did not write all the details, but since our goal was to estimate the Duhamel's part that I wrote as a bound for my solution at time t. I just use one by one these two lemmas and integrate in V and at the end I get this type of bound. So here is the t-star time in the Star time in the Dublins condition, and that you can see the constant. So then this gives me the exponential convergence in the first theorem. And so this was a simplest case where you could use Dublin's theorem, but the others are not that easy. So I'm gonna skip the proofs, but just to say that now, when we are in R D with a potential at With the potential is at least quadratically growing. I can verify the Foster-Lyapunov condition by just using this Lyapunov function. So in my theorem, the constants that I mentioned are corresponding to these one steps. So for the minorization condition, now I cannot simply track the characteristics because now it's not. Characteristics because now it's not the transport part, it is not just pre-transport, but there is also deflection due to the confining potential. Then I kind of look at the characteristics of this ODE, solution of this ODE, and the idea is to show that for small times you can approximate the solution of this ODE by this one. So for that, you sum That you some we somehow build an approximation like V2 minus n square, something like this. So you build a not approximation interpolation between this one and that one, and yeah, try to track the characteristics, and it involves more computations, but in the Computations, but it's done, it's doable. And then these two gives the exponential convergence for the case when we are in R D with the combining potentials occurring at least quadratically. And then in the subgeometric case we can see that this phi, same phi, verifies the deeper foster lyapunov condition. Foster-Lyapunov condition with this type of functional. So, in general, in the subquadratic cases, you will have like the functionals you will look at will be of these type, similar type, for other equations as well. Then you can see the graph like you here, I'm uh showing this uh this last observation. That's always Always I'm showing this. Yeah, this is the drawback of using Paul so much, I guess. I'm not able to go here. That is in these are the ones that I'm writing in the last lines, which are not there. Yeah, so this is in the This is in the simplest case of linear BGK equation, how we can use these results. And now I will little mention that the papers which are using this type of arguments into different models. So for the paper that our paper with José Carl, Chupikao, and Josephine Evans, we also use this to show the linear Boltzmann convergence equilibrium for linear Boltzmann equation by. Linear Boltzmann equation. By linear Boltzmann equation, I mean that the two particles are not colliding, but the particles are having an interaction with the background, which is already in equilibrium. This is what I say, linear Roltsman equation. And similarly, we get exponential convergence, and for sub-quadratic potentials, we get sub-exponential convergence, which you can quantify. I think the new Quantify. I think the new thing in this paper was that maybe it was the first results for quadratic subgeometric case, for the like first result, first quantitative results in the subgeometric case, let's say. So here, the other paper by Bernoull, he looks at the collisionless gas, which is described by the kinetic free transport equation, which means that the collision term on the right-hand side in the first equation is. On the right-hand side in the first equation, it is zero. There, you look at the boundary, the confinement comes from the boundary. So, with these two papers, he treats the Maxwell and Churchinian-Lampus boundary conditions and uses these type of arguments to show convergence to equilibrium. So, the Maxwell boundary conditions are like the combination of diffuse specular reflection and diffuser. Specular reflection and diffuse reflection, and Churchin Dumpus boundary conditions are a little bit complicated, which are taken into attention, taken into account of the outgoing velocities after interacting with the boundary. They keep some of the information from the incoming velocities. So, in the other paper, Joseph and Evans and Angeluki Menakake, they show Show the existence of a non-equilibrium stationary state for non-linear BGK equation on an interval. So this means you have the BGK on interval like and with two boundary conditions at two ends. So this is like diffuse boundary conditions which are like modeling the fact that there are two different heat reservoirs in both sides of your domain with different temperatures. At a bit different temperature. And here, in the other paper, Joe and Ivan Meino, they showed the exponential convergence to equilibrium for linear degenerate Boltzmann equation, which is something like in the right-hand side. When I have the Boltzmann, I multiply the right-hand side with the bond, L infinity and non-negative function. Infinity and non-negative function. And yeah, so there are also results on the Kinetic-Foker plane. And here Carl considers the general force term, which I'm not writing the Kinetic-Foker plan because I don't have time now. And the other papers, they look at the cases where you have sub-geometric convergence rate. And what I wanted to talk to you briefly was that this last work, the Ron-Enthumble equation, which Work the Ron Enthumbel equation with Joe because there you cannot apply these classical hypercoastivity techniques. I mean, we could use this, but I'm not going to mention that, but just maybe one sentence about why it is important. So it's basically for bacteria which are going on runs, which is a constant speed transport, and then they tumble randomly, like nut. Randomly, like not very randomly, but according to the food source, wherever the food source is, they try to tumble that direction and go another run. So it's like very similar to linear BGK equation which we saw, like on the right-hand side. And yeah, so what I'm just gonna mention is that how different it is from the VGK. So first difference is the compile. So, first difference is the combinement mechanism. For the BGK or the kinetic equations in the gas theory, the confinement mechanism comes from the confining potential, right? For the BGK here, is coming from the bias in the job, the stumbling event. So, this randomness and the preference towards the food source. Then, as I said initially, this shape of stationary solutions for this random tunnel model. For this random Tammel model are not known. At least, I don't know how they look like. So, in general, as the kinetic models in the applied sciences. So, there is this paper, a very nice paper, for hyperforcivity for linear equations which are conserving mass, which is the case as the Ran and Tumble as well. But there, to be able to apply these techniques, your equilibrium state should be living in the intersection between the kernels of the transport. Between the kernels of the transport part and the collision part. So, this is not the case for the Ronantanel equation. So, you simply cannot apply this theory. So, then you don't... Yeah, that's why there were not many results before. So, I'm not able to talk about our result, but yeah, we could show the exponential convergence to equilibrium in arbitrary dimension for Ran and Humble equation, which I guess maybe I just Maybe I just stated like that, and that's all. These were the previous works, and I think that's all. Questions? Wait a second. Thank you for a nice talk. Actually, I'm curious about your elastics and how running trouble. You have a mail run. Temple. You have a mirror, the temple improves. Like, does it play any central role when you're on emergency street? So, yes, it does fit. So, this lambda term you mean, right? Yeah, or what kind of condition do you put on the nail? Yeah, so that's I wrote like these kind of things. So, here, the lambda is like this in the Is like this in the literature as well, where psi is in general a signal function, which here we can generalize it. So this is the shape of lambda, which is accepted in the, I don't know, previous models as well. It's not something we come up with. For example, here in these previous works, this psi will be the signum of simply the x times v. Here, the signum of this is S is the chemical track. Of this is S is the chemotrac that's it here. So this is the first thing, the shape of lambda. And then we have some assumptions on the chemotractant density, so this M is the log of chemotherapy density actually. But like maybe this is interesting to you. We should we have a lower bound of this integral because we were using Because we were using this formula, right, in the linear VGK case. Similar thing we are doing here, so we need somehow a bound on, if you look at as the like a genetic equation from gas theory, that it's analogous with the bound on the collision frequency, something like this. So this is the main assumption. And you don't like a straight family about the mm-hmm. No, I guess, but it comes from uh From uh so it does it degenerate as chi goes to one? Maybe it's another way of phrasing her question. Does the do your bounds degenerate as chi goes to one in some way that you understand? So chi goes to one? No, I think no, because chi cannot ejen is actually as a part of the language. Actually, as a part of the limit, you have different behaviors. Like you either go to fractional diffusion or diffusion. So I wonder what. So I think the case we are looking at here, it does not degenerate because also when I go to look at this limit macroscopic limit of this particular run ensemble that I'm considering, I get this uh flux limited Keller second type of thing. So where also there is no I guess blow up or something like that. A slow or something like that, so because of this flow stimulus part, so yeah.
