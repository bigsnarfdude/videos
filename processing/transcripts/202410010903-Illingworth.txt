It's Freddie going to talk on colouring hydrographs and the interception tactics. Thanks very much. Thanks everyone for coming. Thank you very much to the organisers for organising a wonderful workshop and inviting me to speak. So this, well I'll spend the first half of the talk just discussing caring hypergraphs and intersection spectrum and survey integrating problems and second half I'll talk about some joint work with Kevin Hendry, Neil Kamchek and Jane Tan. So I'd better start by sort of defining some of the things in the title. Things in the title. So in this talk, hypergraphs, sometimes they'll be uniform, so all the edges will have the same size. And I will say that they're uniform like this. And sometimes they'll just be set systems where the edges will be all sorts of stuff. And what will be my colouring hypergraphs? Well, colouring graphs, we know you give colours to vertices and each edge needs to receive two colours. For hypergraphs, you can either say, that's the usual definition, so the usual definition of colouring. The usual definition of colouring is every edge gets at least two colours. The fewest colours you need to do this, you denote by pi H. But there are other things you could do, there are other ways you could generalize this definition. So you could have a What we think of as a rainbow or strong colouring. So rather than every edge getting at least two colours, whatever we could say, every edge is fully rainbowed, so there are no repeated colours at all. In a graph, that is, each edge receives two colours, you could say each edge is rainbow. This is here. And while I'm here, I'm going to define one more version of colouring. There's sort of a halfway point between these. So, here we want every edge to get at least two colours. Here, we want every edge to get as many colours as possible. You could ask that each edge gets at least three colours, or at least four colours or something. So, what I'll call a C strong colouring is now every ledge. Now every ledge gets at least C. Where my C is some constant. Do you adapt if the edge is small? Do you adapt to long? Right, okay, yes, this is a good question. So if I want each edge to receive ten colours, but I've got an edge of size nine, okay, well I'll do the best I can. That edge needs to be rainbow. So every edge gets at least three colours, or. More is many. Yeah, so we try to give them at least C, if we can't, as many as we can. Right, because the fewest number of colours needed to do this will denote by chi H C. So actually the usual colouring in this notation is chi H2. And I guess this rainbow version is basically chi H. Be tar h infinity. While I'm here, I'll mention rainbow colouring can be reduced to just a graph colouring problem. If you take each edge of your hypergraph and replace it like leak, the colour of that graph is the same as the rainbow colour of the hypergraph. That doesn't happen with this version. There isn't some sort of auxiliary or simple auxiliary graph or hypergraph that converts this sort of colour into this sort of colour. So this is a So, this is an interesting thing. But for now, we'll just think about normal colouring, and I'll come back to this later to take the opportunity to define this. I've got to tell you what an interception spectra is. We have a hypergraph H and this interception spectrum is very simple. It's just It's very simple. It's just the sets of possible intersection sizes between different edges of the hydrograph. So for example, if h's are matching, then this is just a set zero. Because all edges are disjoint, so otherwise intersections are empty. Otherwise, intersections are empty. And it's not immediately clear why this thing should be related to colouring hypergress at all, but it goes back to a folklore, a result of Orange Robot that was possibly known before then, which is that if a hypergraph needs more than two colours, the colour, so two is a few itches we have to colour one. So, two is the few as you have to colour, just like the rest. But if a hypergraph needs more than two colours, then one must appear in its intersection spectrum. So there must be two edges that meet on exactly one vertex. And there are lots of nice proofs of this. I'll give my favourite now. So here's a very naive way of colouring a hypergraph, or trying to colour a hypergraph with two colours. To colour a hypergraph with two colours. What we'll do is we'll order the vertices and we'll just go along and we'll try and colour each vertex blue if we can. If we can't, so if we come to a vertex and colouring it blue would leave an edge that was fully blue, then we'll colour it red. Then we'll colour it red. See? If we create a blue edge, so this is all the stupidest algorithm you could think of. And if our hypergraphers need more than two colours, it's going to fail. And how is it going to fail? Well, we How is it going to fail? Well, we can't create a fully blue edge. The algorithm is designed to not do that. So we must, to be fair, we must create a fully red edge. There's an edge in our hypergraph that we coloured or red. Okay, but why did we colour this vertex red? Well, it must have been that we wanted to colour it blue, but we couldn't. So there must have been vertices before it in the order, or blue. Or blue, and if we'd cut this vertex blue as well, we'd have got a blue edge. Great. Well, these two edges have intersection exactly one. So one appears in the intersection text. This proof gets slightly more, though, because what it says is if a hypergraph has come out of numbers. If a hypergraph has chemical numbers more than two, however you order the vertices, there must be two edges which meet on exactly one vertex, with the first edge to the left in the order and the second edge to the right in the order. Because all these, when we came to this and wanted to colour it blue, we didn't because there were vertices that we'd already coloured that were blue. This is a very nice observation, and in fact, in some sense, In some sense, it gives us a lot of understanding of hypergraphs with profit number model two comes from this observation. So, just to give an example, Schwerber and Shapira noted that because of this, this says that in any ordering you must have this configuration. So, if I've got an R-uniform hypergraph, Hypergraph with chromatic number more than two, not only must you have a one appearing somewhere as an intersection, you must have lots of ones appearing. There must be lots of pairs of edges where one appears. And in fact, I'm getting into prefer time notes, it's nothing. If you just check based on the number of orderings, this shows there are at least. There are at least this many ones. And this is actually best possible because this is tight. And a complete uniform hypergraph on the correct number of verses, which is best possible. Another place you can use this is this old classical problem of question of Burdish robust. So here's the question. How many edges do we need in an R-uniform hype graph for it to have a pattern of more than two? So what is the smallest number of edges in a hype graph where h is larger than four and And schematic number. And one of the early applications of the probabilistic is this number lies between 2 to the R and R squared 2 to the R. Both these bounds are random bounds. And this lower bound just shows that if you have fewer than this many edges, a random colour. Fewer than this many edges, a random colouring will work. However, if instead you think about this algorithm and say, okay, I've got a hypergraph with not that many edges, I'll randomly order the verses and apply my algorithm. What happens? Well, you can already improve this lower bound. You can gain an extra four foot of R. Just Just by if you have fewer than this many edges, a random ordering with positive probability won't contain this configuration. So you get some nice boost already above this. Okay, what's the best bound now? Well, the best bound now is due to Due to Brad Krishna Sri Vasad from 2000, improving this R quarter to root R, essentially. And this, they just have a slightly cleverer colouring outlook, to be honest. It's sort of random with a recolouring step at the end for edges and what. And that's the best we know. And that's the best we know. So there's still this nice gap between root R squared for this particular problem. It's the fewest number of edges you need in the uniform hypergraph. So it's not Alto Crossing number more than the trivial two. So then this wiggle is times one plus little one or something. Oh, so no, no, these wiggles are constants, though. I'll smaller order or constants? Just constants I don't care about it. By the way, this is not a problem of L which I know and of L ch And move under the shipping not this one, that is. Yeah, this is the B profit. Okay, let me say that. Okay, let me set another way these relates, another observation version like this. Okay, so the classic numbers more to two, then one appears in the intersection spectrum. We also noted if the classic numbers more than three, then there must be two disjoint. Then there must be two disjoint stations. And there are various ways to prove this, but one simple way is to just try this argument again. So all your vertex, and then one by one. Firstly, you try and colour a vertex green if you can. So, your default is colour it blue. If you can't, because that would create a funny blue edge, then you try and colour it red. And if you can't, because that would make a red edge, then you colour it green. And again, sort of what can go wrong. So, Commerce number is more than three, so we must fail somewhere. We don't make it blu-ray, and we don't. We don't make a blue edge and we don't make a red edge because the algorithm forbids us from doing that. So we must make a green edge. Okay, why was this first symmetric green? We should have, you know, we defaulted to try and colour it blue. Well, there must be an edge which would have been all blue if we coloured it blue. Or blue. We first tried the things blue. It's green because we couldn't colour it red. And it was look, so for each vertex. No, so for each vertex, we would try and colour it blue, and then we try and colour it red, and then we colour it green. No, no. Why is this second vertex green? Well, we could have tried to colour it green, but also we would have tried to colour it red, we didn't, so there must have been a red edge we'd have made. And these two edges are disjoint because these are all blue and these are all red, so the verses are different. Sorry for all that. Sorry for all that. Right, so this is quite nice. So we know if the kinetic number is more than three, then both zero and one are dropped here. So this floor is a whole unless there is a loop, right? Oh, you mean like a singleton edge? Yeah, you're assuming there are two vertices. You're assuming there are two vertices in this. Sure, I mean I discard the signal. I'll discard my single fractions. That's the third problem, yes. Let's not worry about it. Yeah, so if the first number is more than three, then both normal one appear here. And this is sort of the best you can do because urgent final proved to six. For every k, there is a hypergraph which has connected them more than k, and its intersection spectrum is the standard part. This is just saying there are hyperclass that are simple and of arbitrary large market number. Somehow this completes the picture in some science. So if we just look at this result once more, what it's saying is that if you have a hypergraph H that's A hypergraph edge that is intersecting, by which I mean any pair of edges meet. Let's chronic numbers at most three. This isn't necessarily a uniform hypergraph, it's just a set. Necessarily a uniform hard graph, it's just a set system, you know, intersecting in the sense of set systems any pair of edges meet. And Ernest Lovat asked the following question. So any intersecting hydrograph is three-colourable, and some will be two-colourable. The question is: which ones are three-colourable? Okay? And if which ones need three. Which ones need three colours? If you need three colours, is your hyper reference some sense complicated? So the question was: suppose H is intersecting and I leading how small can the maximum thin in your intersection spectrum B, and how small can the size of your intersection spectrum be. If I dropped intersecting, the outer piece is not very big. The intersection spectrum can just have size two and the maximum can just be one. But under the condition of intersecting, it wasn't so clear. If you sort of To give you sort of two examples of intersecting hyperas that do need three colours. Sorry, I have missed H intersecting R U4 and has committed number more than two, or has commuted number three. Well, that's a straight question. To give you two examples of hypergraphs with this property, you could take, for example, the complete three-uniform hypergraph on, say, five vertices. This is intersecting because there just isn't enough. This is intersecting because there just isn't enough space for it not to be. You can check it needs to be colours. Or the following plane. So this is these where you have vertices of the intersections and each line is an edge and the circle is an edge. This is also intersecting and needs three colours. But so the question was for our uniform, how's Are you form? How small can these things be? And what did they prove? Well, they showed actually there must be quite a big intersection. So they and also Shellah. Just look at this. Shellard. Shows that there must be a pretty big intersection, a size at least R over L or L, which is very different to the non-intersected case. And okay, so we know intersecting hypergraphs, they, because of the result I robbed out, one has to be an intersection size, otherwise the B to 2 plural, and there's a big one. They showed there was also. They showed there was also at least one more. So they showed there are at least three things in the interception spectrum. What do they conjecture? Well, they conjecture, certainly, they think this one is at least linear in R. In fact, they think it probably is R minus a constant. If your intersecting hypergraph needs three colours, it should have a really big intersection. Simply for this. Are you assuming R as R? These are all at least some constant times. Sorry, I'm writing these sort of squiggly. No, I was just thinking what you say R8 with these three. For instance, the final plane. Fine, yes. R is at least taxable. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so what's the there was almost no progress on this until the first paper. Always no progress on this until the first paper of Matir Lucich Stefan Block by Sudikov show that the size is at least square root of but still so that's that's the state of the art and this is from um I think 2018. I think twenty two. But still, there's this nice big, big gap. So there's a gap between. Do you need, should there be an intersection of size basically R, or is R over one R correct? And the size could still be linear and R. I think the best upper bound is, there are examples of it most R over two, the best upper bound. So it's very linear. So there's really big gaps in there. Are there any questions on this? Because I'm about to move on to talking about the result with Kevin, Mino, and Jay. These are some nice problems I thought. Okay, so let me talk come back to these. Come back to these of strong colouring. Right, so C strong colouring. Now, rather than every edge getting two colours, I want every edge to have at least C colours. Or, before I move now. They're rainbow. Don't worry so much about rainbow. The half-hyper graphs are the ones with huge, huge edges, where so small edges won't really be a problem. And the minimum number of colours needed to do this we write as chi Hmm C. And I'll call this so it's the C strong chromatic number. Sometimes called, I might just call it the C chromatic number. I might just call it the C chromatic number when I'm talking. Okay, so how do these things behave? Well, clearly the more colours you ask for, and it's received, the harder it gets to colour. So as we proceed, the thing ought to go up. And reminder chi H.2 is just the usual notion. Okay, obviously MIT. Obviously, Nixon, the natural question to ask is: are there examples with small, let's say, chromatic number, but huge chi H13? And there are. You can construct examples where, say, chi H is 2, I mean chi H3 is huge, as large as you want. In fact, here's basically the general way to do that. Take Take your two favourite hypergraphs with large mathematicians. Take H1, H2 with chi HI large, lethal, and construct the following hypergraph, H. So its vertex z is just a disjoint union. Of the two buttons sets. And what is edge set? Well, you just take any edge in H1 and any edge in H2, and that's an edge. Okay, so what's what's going on here? So what's going on here? This is H1. And so if there's an edge, edge here and an edge here, then their union would be an edge in H. And that's for all pairs of edges. So how do I colour this thing? Normally with just two colours, I'd colour everything in H1 blue and everything in H2 red. Two, because I can just go blue, red. Every edge of H meets both sides, so that's two colouring. Why, however, is this huge? Well, suppose I didn't use many colours to colour vertices. Because H1 and H2 are a huge chromatic number, there would be, somewhere on H1, there would be a monochromatic edge. There would be an edge that says all green. And similarly, Green. And similarly, H2 is a huge chromatic number, so when I colour it, they must be a monochromatic edge. But these two together, they're an edge of a monochromatic edge, maybe it's blue. The union of these two is an edge of H that only receives two colours. Is that okay if there were some Is that okay? There are some strange looks. Okay. And then a particular example, so a special case of this, would be if I took h1 to be something really silly. So if I took h1 to be a single vertex, so what am I saying? I've got h2, which is some hypergraph with large plus. Large classic number. H1 is just a single vertex v, and I take every edge of h2 and add v to it. So h is now each edge. Right, so I've draw the edges of H1, and I've just insert a V into every single edge. And I've just inserted V into every single edge. Sorry, edge of H2, and I've inserted V into every single edge. You can check this argument still works. The H you get has huge sort of three column number. But also, this edge is intercepted because all the edges meet on V. So, what we say is we know if a hypergraph is intercepting, its normal quantity number is small, but its really strong quantity number might be huge. Might be seen. So, with that in mind, Blaise Minister Yoshido in 2014 asked: okay, so if it's just intersecting, right, so if we're saying that naught is not an intersection spectrum, right, all pairs of edges meet, then the normal plot number is small, but the street plottable number might be huge. What happens if we forbid more small intersectional vectors? What happens if If they just T intersecting, so by this I mean that not only do all pairs of edges meet, they meet on at least t vertices. Now what happens here? Well So, firstly, we do this construction, but we add t new vertices rather than just one vertex. It will be t intersecting, and t plus two compressed number can still be huge. Fine, okay. So that's like sort of saying, if I'd taken two to be zero, that's just saying, okay, so hypergraphs confusion graphic number. And we knew, okay, we have this thing that if you're intersecting, you're one intersecting, then chi H two is bounded. So is that still true now? So, is that still true now? So, they were able to prove that this is bad. So, if your hypergraph is T-intersecting and you want to colour it so each edge receives at least T colours, you can do that. And the number of colours you need is not arbitrarily large. And the way they do this is basically a random colouring. Plus, some nice results on spread measures. Okay, there's a gap, right? So that's nice, but we've launched generalised listening. So they asked, what about? And they conjecture it should be bounded. And so negative, I'm not noted. So negative, I'm not noted, but random covering work well. What do I mean by this? I mean, so for any n and for any epsilon, there are hypergraphs H that are T intersecting, but a uniformly random N colouring. Will succeed with promise methods. So you've got to try something slightly different. And that's that's our theorem. So this is Kevin near counting time show that if vegetine setting Is bounded by some function t. Please don't ask what the function of t is because it's some sort of huge exponential thing, quadrupic exponential. You'll see why they did. Something absolutely massive. Um but you say a lower bound? Is there a lower bound? Uh uh there's a linear lower bound. Uh two t plus one I think. T plus one, I think. I think just pick a suitable complete. That's not a problem now. Yes, it's enough to blip. The rest I don't know about is linear, it's a correct, complete hypergraph. So just to rephrase this in sort of the notion we had before, what this is saying is if this is huge, then in fact, Then, in fact, there must be some intersection small. Because if it's huge, you can't read T-intercept it. You must have some pair of edges that meet on a few verses. In fact, we've slightly more than this because you might. You might ask, okay, well, when is the T plus L strong big? Just for some L, but what is it that can make this large? The obvious way to make this large is to do what we did here. We had two vertices whose sort of neighbourhood, so one way that's possible is. So one way this is possible is you have T vertices, set S of T vertices, where if you look at, so there's S, if you look at all the edges that contain S and you remove S from them, contain S and you remove S from them, if what's left, so this is the hypermath, it's called H S. It has a large L pattern. So, this is just the generalization of the observation we made here. If you started with a hypergraph where the L pattern was big and you added T new vertices to all the edges, you'd create a hypergraph where this is big. So, that is one obvious way to make this large. And in fact, we show that is the only way. So, if this is large, if the 2 percent number is big, then Button number is big, then there must be a set of two vertices on which this link has larger alpha buttons. So a qualitative characterization of where this is functional. So yeah, are there any questions about the statement? Because I'll now try your flavour of the proof. So now's a good time to ask. So does this say the resist S? T is larger than the resistance. If is this resist S sub slash? This is big. Well, that's not saying the size of S. Oh, sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry. Yes, I should say SI exactly. Sorry, yes, SIS. The way to make this large, if you have a T insect language, is the only way to make it large is to take your favourite thing, which has a large L for the number and chuck in T verties to every edge. For L equals 1 in that implied. Well, yes, I mean for in some sense, for L equals 1, this implies this, right? Because every Because every hypergraph has it's very easy to colour a hypergraph so every edge gets at least one colour, just colour everything blue. So if an edge is one, this is always one, so this is all so flavour of the proof. So what do we do? Well we start with a hypergraph T. We start with a hypergraph T, so I have a graph S, there's T intersecting. And this is very, very objective. So I'm going to prove the, give you a flavour of the first statement rather than the second statement, but log the ideas carry over. And this is huge. This is like really, really, really, really huge. And developer proof, I'm going to write. Proof, I'm going to write down various colourings of this hypergraph, which will, you know, our particular colouring C, the colours of the vertices. And if I colour the vertices some way, some edges will be, will be happy with some edges, so some edges will get one class. We'll say those edges are fixed. We'll say those edges are fixed by this colour. We're happy with them, don't care what they have enough colours, don't care what they and some edges won't get few of them to, so we'll get most of you. And then sort of broken edges that we need to we need to do better than not to change our colouring to fix those broken edges. Colouring to fix those broken edges. Okay, so what's like a nice colouring that fixes like a good one, you know, surges? Well, imagine you've you picked a particular.x v, and you thought about all the edges that contain v. Okay. Then suppose I deleted V from all those edges. So I think I looked at what's this? Well, these guys were T intercepting. So if I look at all the edges that contained V and then removed V, it's now T minus 1 intercepting. And okay, by induction on T, On T, I can colour, say can call the vertices, so that all these edges, all either contain V, get at least T colours. And Dutch upon T says, ah, but I'll add V back and give that T a new colour. And then all these edges that contain V, so Edges that contain V, and that with a new colour, all these edges that contain V now get these T plus one colours. Okay, so this is a this is a particular colouring. There's a colouring C V that doesn't use too many colours. By induction, I'm colouring the vertices with at most F of T minus one. F of t minus 1, which is big, but much, much smaller than f of t, so it's okay. So yeah, I've got a current C V that fixes all the vertices, so all the edges that contain V. So I can, okay, so for a particular vertex, I can fix all the edges that contain it, and for another vertex, I can also fix all the edges. And for another vertex, I can also fix fix and be able to contain that. And so C U fixes all E that contain U, C V fixes all E that contain V. If I'd like to fix all edges that contain both U and V, also contain either U or V, well I can take a product colouring. A product colouring. That's like an x for times. If I colour a vertex x by a sort of pair, the first coordinate will mean that every edge that contains u is fixed. The second coordinate would mean that every edge that contains v is fixed. This is a sort of product colouring idea. That's nice, and you know, you could keep doing this with lots of vertices, but that might not work. Doing this with lots of vertices, but that might not work. I mean, there might just still be lots of edges that don't contain any of these vertices you've fixed. So, okay, but still, these are nice colourings. And the idea of product colouring is very useful. So, what are we aiming for? We do these colourings, and okay, we don't use many colours, so we know there are lots of edges which aren't fixed, so lots of edges that are broken, and we'd like to get some structure. What structure are we going to aim for? Well. The structure we're going to aim for is what we call a bromelia. Bromise is not a word no, but it's a type of flower native to the tropical Americas, in particular native to Barbados, which is where all of this work was done. And what is it we had? Well, it's a bit like a song power, but it's not, this is rather pointless. If I expect all to look. In fact, it looks more for some firm than some firms. So, what is everybody out? It's a list of edges, E1, say up to EB. Okay, here's E1. E2, part of E2 is inside E1, part of E2 is outside E1. E3, or E3, splits into two bits. One bit is inside E bit, one bit outside the strip perfect bit. Similarly, E4 is inside, splits. Similarly, four splits inside here, and so on. So, your edges in this list, you should split them into two parts. The first parts are nested, and the second parts are disjoint from everything along to the other thing. And we want, we're going to find these. These are a big part, yeah, this is a big part of the proof. I'll get to how you find these, and then I'll stop. This is the thing, yeah, wait a minute for. If you look at a Bermudian, Wear it for. If you look at a Bromini, I mean, these are like petals, and these are like Santa, which is sort of nesting in. Anyway, so how might we find all these? Well, suppose thus far we've got some edges. A short list of edges you want to dl. Edges you want to ELF, which you could think of as the first L edges of the meaning algorithm. Let's just say it's the solistic edges. These guys, they split the vertices into regions. A bit like a Venn diagram. If you have three edges, you split the vertices into eight regions. So these split into excuse the L regions. Some of these regions we've been Some of these regions will be big. So big regions, you know, size at least e to the 12. Small regions, size at least t. Okay, so we can come, this is right, there aren't that many regions. We can come up with a nice colouring. I'll write C R, R for regional. What's my colouring going to do? What's my colouring going to do? Well, on different regions, I'll use distinct colours, so the palettes will be different for each region. Small regions, I'll colour them rain-ready colour. So I'll colour, each person looks differently, use T colours, that's what it's going to cool with. The big regions are colour with T plus one. So I'll make sure if you look at a big region, So I'll make sure if you look at a big region, you'll see exactly two plus one different colours on that region. This is a colon. Which edges does it fix? Well, it actually fixes any edge that meets at least. At least tonal regions. Because different regions get different colours. So any edge that meets deep small regions gets at least tall colours. That's good. It also actually fixes any edge that contains a big region. Because each big region gets two different codes. Okay, and how many codes does it use? Okay, and how many colours does it use? Well, it doesn't use that many colours because they're 2TL, A2TL regions, and we're used and those T plus 1 colours. So uses T plus 1 to 2TL colours. Okay, which is many, many, many, much, much less than the splatter number. So there are lots of edges, which this does not fix, which are broken. And in fact, those edges, the hypergraph they form, still have absolutely huge TOSOL Sprite numbers. What's that saying? That's saying there are lots and lots of edges which meet at most T of the regions, which is nice because there might be quite. Which is nice because there might be quite a lot of breaches. I mean, 2TR might be a fairly bigger than T. So somehow, if our thing is a huge quantum number, we can find lots of edges which extend the sequence and where the new edge meets fewer of the previous regions. So somehow the intersection is quite simple. And we can iterate this. We can add E to our next edge on our list and keep going. Still a switchbot number, do a regional colouring, possibly more edges. And with this, you can find a long sequence. A long sequence, a relatively log sequence, such that each edge meets the most T of the previous regions, so the regions created. We can make this, you know, provided the quatter number starts hugely. This, you know, provided the quantum number starts huge enough, we can make this as long as we wish. This isn't quite, I mean, if you look at Bromilliad, each edge meets at most two of the previous regions. The edge number four meets the region that's inside all of them and meets the region that's disjointed point. So we've got a sequence where everything meets at most t, sort of t degenerate sequence, and you'd like to convert it into a two-degenerate sequence here. And the way you do that is by a couple of applications of Ramsey. Applications of Ramsay. Just to clean up and get me out. And I think I have, I don't think I have time. So, okay, I'm going to have a very, very good flavour. What's going on here? When I place edge number five, it might be out. I would like it to live inside here and outside here. I do not want it to touch. For example, there or there. What does touching here mean? That means touching the cement. That means touching the symmetric difference of E1 and E2. Touching here is like touching the symmetric difference of E3 and E1. So, in our long list, a triple will be bad if EC met as much difference of two researchers and And if by Ramsay, you'll either get a large collection of verses where all triples are bad or all triples are good. Good, you have a really ads, we'll just check the deficiency. Bad, okay, you get lots of triples like this. And what you can show is because edges meet only at the most T of the previous regions, the intersection E C with the different symmetric differences. With the different symmetric differences, can't take too many forms. And you can apply rounds again on that to show that there'll be an edge which meets some edge, say EL, that meets EA, the symmetric difference of EAEB, the symmetric difference of EBEC, and the symmetric difference of EAEC for some triple ABNC. So this is like rounds of triangles, so it intersects all of these regions. Intersects all of these regions already set. However, for any three sets S, T and U, if I take the symmetric difference of S and T, the symmetric difference of S and U, the symmetric difference of T and U, I take that intersection, it's empty. That's where the contradiction comes from. And so you get the meaning out. Now, okay, how I use Romeouts to win at the end, I don't have time for, but I will state one problem that's very nice. But yeah, it's these well, these applications of Ramsey, boost.fft. There are a few more things that boost FFT, but this is sort of, you apply first hydrograph Ramsey for triples, and then you apply edge RAMs for triangles with lots of colours, with T columns. Okay, so this one more phrasing our result was If this is big, then there exists some L to mode to minus one inside the intersection spectrum. So this is sort of generalizing the second focal, well, second result of learning levels I wrote down, that if your poster number is at least four, you must have sort of zero appearing. So problem. So problem is the following true. If this is a big H is just any hypergraph, does there exist some L ring one and some function of T such that So, this said this is big, there are two edges which meet on a small number of vertices, and most team are smaller. I'm asking, if this is big, is it the case there are two edges that do meet, that meet on a small number of vertices? And for any function of t, I don't know. This may be very hard. May be very, might not be very hard, might be very easy. I sort of problem occurs in while preparing for this talk was a very, very natural problem. And none of us, none of the four authors know the answer, but I think it's very natural. And it's a sort of generalisation for first. Schematic number are more than three. So more than two means you must have two edges that meet, and that means not only exactly one vertex. That's what I have to say. Any questions? Do you believe the yeah. But yeah, um maybe we don't know enough examples of half graphs to really test that, but yeah, and I think because even there's an abound for blaze nicely. My signature showed that this is a nice that they conjecture this is this is the place to start and sometimes we can place either improve this or maybe just improve our balance by exponential, like a simple exponential rather than something crazy exponential if you're looking to improve these balance. Let's do the first part. First bound from below there is the
