All right. Yeah. Thanks, everyone. So now we have Will Chen, and he's going to be telling us about Markov Triples, ModP, and SL2P cover. So we'll look for it first. All right. Thanks to you for inviting me. It's always a pleasure to be here. Okay, so I guess we can just start by shifting our dimensions a little bit. So instead of thinking about the Markov equation where there's a 3, I'm just going to take the situation where there's... And it turns out that integer solutions of this are bijection with integer solutions of the Markov equation where there's a 3 here and you basically just like, so here there's a solution 3, 3, 3, right? And this corresponds to the usual Markov equation. To the usual monoclonal support, which is one more. Or for this talk, this equation is much better. All right, so what am I, I guess I'll describe what I'm going to explain the proof of. The proof is the, what I'm trying to, well, what I'll explain is that if we consider, let's call this equation x, right? And let's, just to avoid proliferation and notation, so we'll just. Proliferation notation. So we'll just say that x star p is going to be the f p point of x minus the trivial solution 000, the zero solution. So there's an action of a large group on this set. And in this case, you could even consider it to be GL2Z or SL2Z. We can even, let's just say GL2Z right into this set basically X fire. Basically, acts by these PSA solutions. They generate a group which is essentially DL2Z or PGL2Z. And the conjecture of Baragar and Borgen, Gambert, and Sarnak is that this action is always transitive for all people. And Borgen, Gamber, and Sarnak were able to show that, so let's just recall there exists a large orbit C of P, so for every P, there is a large orbit such that. So for every p there is a large orbit such that for all epsilon greater than zero, the complement of this orbit is at both p to the epsilon for p dot r t. So what this means is that if you could show any kind of poly, you know, prove any kind of polynomial lower bound of the sizes of a general orbit, right, then you would actually be able to show that this. Then you would actually be able to show that this large orbit is the higher. So you just need any kind of polynomial lower bound. Even like if you could prove that every orbit has size at least p to be, no, one over nine, that would be enough to show that for p large, this must be the only orbit, because every other orbit must have size, this says that every other orbit must have size less than phi. Okay, so that's what we're going to do, and so the theorem that I'll talk about today is. That I'll talk about today is that for log p, size of the size, how should I say this? Every orbit on x star p has size equivalent to zero model. So how would you how would you how should we? How should we start? So, the proof is going to involve some topology, though I think right after this talk, Daniel Martin will present a very elementary proof. So, let E be a punctured elliptic curve. So, in this case, we can just take E, E sort to be given by an elliptic curve over C, so that's just C module over lattice, and the picture will be. And the picture will be: so you can pretend the lattice is a square lattice, and the sides, the opposite sides, are blue. And the fundamental group of this guy is going to be generated by two loops, right, which I'll call A and B. So we'll let phi be the fundamental group of this elliptic curve for some choice of base point, this punctured elliptic curve, and this is going to be a free group of rank two. And it's going to be generated by A and B. So there's a you can consider the mapping class group of this punctured elliptic curve, and we don't actually have to explicitly refer to the mapping class group in this talk, so I won't. But the mapping class group will act on the fundamental group, and for the purposes of this talk, we can just talk about the outer automorphism group of pi, of this fundamental group, of this free group of right two. It turns out this is isomorphic to GL2s. And the isomorphism is just given by this. And the isomorphism is just given by this natural abelianization path from pi to z squared. And then that induces this isomorphism. And the idea is that this preserves the class of the commutator of A. So the idea is that if you take a small loop around the puncture, that loop is represented by the commutator. That's what I'm done. Another thing we'll Another thing we'll have to consider is the so-called character writing. So, hom pi sl2 mod gl2. Okay, so what do I mean by this? I won't describe this in too much detail, but perhaps the right thing to say is that you want to take SL2 as a functor that assigns to any ring, a group. So, for any ring, you can consider SL2 of that ring, and similarly for any ring, consider GL2 of that ring. ring, consider GL2 of that ring. Well, actually, I suppose you probably want to start with this. You should really start with this. So you start with, you consider SL2 as a functor, and you consider this as also a functor which associates to any rate a set, a set of homomorphisms. And then that functor turned out to be representable, and then you want to take the quotient of that functor of the corresponding scheme by TLT. Okay, so we don't have to say too much about that. Let's just Talk too much about that. Let's just refer to a very concrete example, which is the situation where the situation over C. So X of C, this is just going to be from pi SL2 C up to G L 2, up to conjugation. So here GL2 is acting like conjugation. So this is a moduli space of representations up to equivalence. And already, in this case, so you can kind of try to count some dimensions. So you can kind of try to count some dimensions, right? So really the action by conjugation factors through the center astributing. So you start with POM from pi to SL2. SL2 is three-dimensional. Pi is a three-group of rank two. A homomorphism from three group to rank two to any group is just given by a pair of elements of that group. So this Hong thing is going to be six-dimensional, quotienting out by something which is three-dimensional, effectively. You're quotienting out by basically PGL2, which is three-dimensional. And so the results. And so the result should be three-dimensional. And it was actually already observed by Frica many, many years ago that this is isomorphic to C cubed. So just the affine party space. Okay. And of course on C cubed, there are coordinates. So what are the corresponding coordinates? So the coordinates are given by x, y, and z, where x is the trace of phi of a, y is the trace of phi of b. Of phi of B. Okay, so what is A and B? A and B are these loops, right, which are elements of this group. So this is generated by A and B. And then phi is a general element, a general representation. So you take a representation, a class of representations here, and then you consider the trace of phi of A and the trace of theta B, and then the third coordinate, of course, is the trace of phi of AB. And then the picture is that. All right, so we've got these. So there are, okay, so let's start on the left-hand side. The idea is that these three coordinates actually are algebraically independent, in fact, generate the coordinate ring of this variety. So in particular, you can just think of this as a migration of sets or a homeomorphism of topological spaces, or isomorphism of complex manifolds. Okay, so there's another piece of structure on this whole thing, which is that. On this whole thing, which is that, so remember, out plus pi preserves, it acts on, well, as outer automorphisms of pi, so it means it acts on pi up to inner automorphisms up to conjugation, and it also preserves the class of this commutator. Okay, so we have an action of out of pi on the left, and an action of out of pi on the right. And it preserves the commutators. It preserves the commutator, so you can, because it preserves a commutator, it might be nice to consider this map, which I'll call T, which is just the trace of phi of the commutator. So given a phi in here, you can take the trace of phi of the commutator, and you get a complex number. And if you do the same thing on the right, just by following through this isomorphism, you could ask, well, what do you get? So t of x, y, z. So now you can express t in coordinates. And it turns out that T in coordinates, and it turns out that t of xyz is just given by x squared plus y squared plus z squared minus xyz minus 2. And so this is where you get the Markov equation. So t inverse of negative 2 is exactly the Markov equation x squared plus y squared plus z squared minus xyz. Sorry. Uh sorry, sorry, this one resolution too is this inside affine 3 space. And so in particular, what we have is, so on the right, this is basically the space of Markov triples, and on the left, we have that essentially maps from time to SL2Z. SL2z such that the trace of phi of the commutator is negative 2, this corresponds to Markov terms. So I guess this should be up to equivalence. So I think it suffices to take up to conjugation in SL2s. I think that suffices. Or maybe GL2s. Maybe I should say GL2s are just to be. Okay, so we have this, and the idea is that you can actually do this with basically any ring. You don't have to take C, and there's a similar picture for any ring. And so we're going to consider now. So let's do the same thing, but instead of C, we'll consider of C, we'll consider Fp, finite field with P elements. So I'll just write SL2P, right? This is just SL2 of FP and then you're taking the quotient by GL2P, and then the analogous picture is, well, this will map certainly to this character verity, x of Fp, which is in this case, again, just going to be Fp. Which is in this case, again, just going to be fp cubed. Just like in this case. And so let's actually think about also what does this set on the left correspond to? It corresponds to so the set, I mean, this is a set of representations of the fundamental group, right? Maps from the fundamental group. These are basically, yeah, these are representations of the fundamental group. Representations of the fundamental group. Of the fundamental group. Representations of the fundamental group can be viewed as covering spaces. So that's one way to think about them. And so you can consider these as SL2P covers of E-circ. So pi is the fundamental group of E-circ, of the functured elliptic curve. So we're going to further kind of refine this. We're going to consider instead, so to make contact with Markov equation, we're going to impose an additional condition, which is. We're going to impose an additional condition, which is that the trace of the commutator is negative 2. So that will correspond to, well, will correspond to, so we'll call this guy x, right? So there's going to be a bold x, which is like the whole character variety, which is affine 3 space. And then there's going to be a non-bold x, which is like this slice of the character variety, where the trace where t is equal to negative 2. Where t is equal to negative 2. And that'll, so this is the Markov equation. So we get this. What does that correspond to? That corresponds to, well, covers with, let's just say t equals negative 2. And I'll just write it that way. But what does this mean? It basically means that if you take a loop around the origin, if you consider a cover of this punctured loop. A cover of this punctured elliptic curve, and you consider a loop around the origin, you can lift it to a loop, well, to not necessarily a loop in the cover, right? The idea is that when you lift it, it might not become a loop in the cover, but it might, there'll be some monitoring, right? So you lift it to a point above the space point, then as you follow around the loop, you might end up at another point in the fiber, and these two points will differ by some element of SL2P, by some element of the Galois group, which is SL2p. Some element of the Galois group, which is SL2P. And then we assert, and that this construction is actually all defined up to conjugation. And so we're saying that this is going to be the subset of covers such that this monodromy has trace negative 2. So this is negative 2 in FP. So negative 2 mod p. Okay, so now on the left-hand side, we've got this inclusion. And then we're going to do one further kind of refinement, which is instead of all homomorphisms, we're going to consider surgeon. We're going to consider surjections. t equals negative 2 mod G O to P. And this is going to map to x star, what was called x star of q, which is basically just everything other than the zero, the zero point. And then on the left-hand side, what this corresponds to is connected covers. So covers which are moreover connected. So, this condition on trace equals minus two, does it imply that if you take a power of the commutator, then it's actually gonna be a circle around a function? Yeah, if you take the power of the commutator, that's just represented by the circle that goes around multiple times. Or in the colour, if it's in the colour. Yeah, so if you. So, minus two modulo p. Because so minus 2 modulo p can be lots of things, right? Well, in terms of SL2, it turns out that the only things that it can be, it has to be, so there are only three conjugacy classes of trace negative two. It's either the negative identity or negative identity together with something here, right, which is not equal to zero. And it turns out that this A can't be zero if it appears as the image of a commutator under a surjection. And so the only And so the only thing that can appear are: so if it's trace negative 2, basically means that the monogram is given by some element of this form, where a is not equal to 0, and so it has order 2p. And this is actually a critical point. So that monotromy or ramification. So the monotromy, the order of monodromy around this branch point is also the ramification effect. So ramification, random. ramification random index two p covers with randification index two p and all the pre-images of this of this publisher okay yeah so okay so we have this out this action by out pi right and it acts on all these sets it acts on this character variety it also the action Variety. It also, the action continues to make sense here, and in fact, it descends to an action here. Out pi acts on this guy on x star p, out pi acts on this guy on the left, it's a set of surjections of conjugation. And in fact, that isomorphism is alphi-pi equivariate. Okay, so what is Okay, so what is this? These are Markov triples mod P, right? So what this says, oh, I should say that this is an isomorphism. So these guys are not necessarily isomorphisms. I know this guy is definitely not an isomorphism. This one is not necessarily an isomorphism. But the bottom guy is an isomorphism. And so this tells you that Markov triples mod P can be identified with this set of rejections up to conjugation. Up to conjugation, satisfying this trace condition, trace equals negative two condition. Why is that true? Is that obvious? That is a nice more formula. It's not obvious, you have to do some more. We can talk about it. Okay, so I guess the idea now is that, I mean, I guess we've been talking about deformations of Markov numbers and Markov triples and Q deformations and so on. I guess I can introduce. Deformations and so on. I guess I can introduce another type of deformation, which is that, all right, so these are mod P Markup numbers, or Markov triples, right? So that means that you can view mod P Markup triples as these certain jetions of conjugation. Well, you can also view this, so let's call this, well, actually let's just go over here. So let's consider this right here. So NP is going to be the set of connected SL2P covers Covers of elliptic curves with trace with t equals negative two, in the sense that I described it before. It's a set. You can just think of it as a set. It's probably better to think of it as a moduli stack. But we can just think of this as a set of isomorphism classes of these covers. And the idea is that here, in the previous situation, the base curve was fixed. It was just our fixed elliptic curve E circ, or E. Fixed elliptic curve E circuit or E. Here we're allowing the elliptic curve to vary. So as you vary the elliptic curve, you'll get different covers. So given any cover of an elliptic curve, you can kind of just associate to, you could forget the cover, and you can map it to just the so-called moduli stack of elliptic curves, which you just think of as a set of all elliptic curves up to isomorphism. So you just send a cover of the elliptic curve to just the elliptic curve. That's the Just the electric curve. That's this map, it's this forgetful map. And it turns out this is a covering map. So basically, M11 is the modular curve, H mod SL2C. There are some subtleties. Here we want to view it as an orbifold, or a stack. But you can kind of think of it as, it's really just another way to think about it, is that it's just, you can think of it as a surface whose fundamental group is SLT. As a surface whose fundamental group is SL2Z. Think of it as some kind of surface whose fundamental group is SL2Z, or actually in this situation, it's probably better to even think of it as out plus of pop, right? Where out plus is like this index to subgroup of out, which acts with the determinant one on the organization, corresponds to SLGC. So because this map is a covering map, one thing that that means is that for every elliptic curve, there are Is that for every elliptic curve, there's always a set of isotopic classes of covers of that elliptic curve satisfying this condition, it's always constant. And so that means that if you take a point here that corresponds to, for example, our fixed elliptic curve E circ, and then you take its fiber. So its fiber is certainly just going to be this x star of q, right? Basically, by Basically, by the definition of this map, it's a set of all, by the definition of this map, the fiber above the point that corresponds to E-circ is exactly the set of isomorphism classes of SLTP covers, of trace negative two, right, corresponding of this particular E-CERC. And because this is a covering map, you can study the geometry of this covering space by how the fundamental group. Fundamental group acts on the fiber. And so the fundamental group should be thought of as out plus of pi. It acts in some way on the fiber. And it turns out the way it acts on the fiber is exactly the way that it acts, corresponds to exactly the way that it acts on Markov terms. Okay, so what does this tell you? This tells you that out plus pi orbits On x star p, they correspond to the components of m p of this, right? And under this bijection, so this is a bijection, the size of an orbit corresponds to the degree over m. Over M11. So the idea is that this MP, which I've only defined as a set, well, it actually has a topology, means a covering space of M11. But in general, it may, a priori, maybe, we kind of just cook this up out of nowhere by just declaring this space. It turns out it has topology, but it might be disconnected. And just by Galois theory, then the classification of clubing spaces, its connected components will correspond to the orbits of the fundamental group. The orbits of the fundamental group of the base on the flight. And if you have an orbit, then you can consider its corresponding component. That component will be a covering map also of M11, and that covering map will have a degree, and the size of the orbit corresponds to the degree. Okay, so what's the idea? So at this point, we can basically set up the describe where this mod p property comes from. Where this mod P property comes from. Zero mod P divisibility by P comes from, yeah? Isn't it true that the conjecture is then saying that MP is connected? Yeah, exactly. Then what this says is that the conjecture says that MP is connected. Which also says that, basically says that any SLTP cover of a punctured torus with trace invariant negative two, that they're all topologically the same. There's only one kind of SLTP cover of elliptic curves with monogamy trace negative two. Elliptic curves with monogamy trace negative two as a top, of two of logical equipments. To come back to this isomorphism here. So this means that every Markov triple comes from an integral Markov triple that you've taken off. This also means that every Markov triple... Well, if you're not implied. This isomorphism does not tell you that, but the connectedness would. This isomorphism does not tell you that every Markot. So isomorphism does not tell you that every Markov cost triple Mark P comes from an integral Markov triple. That's the strong approximation. Yes, because you're just, I mean, SL2Z subjects onto SL2P, right? Yes. And then if you know that on the right, you subject onto Fall Mark of triples, then you've got, you know that. But why must every surjection to SLTP come from a surjection? Yeah, well, I guess you could ask why must it lift to a map, to SL2Z? I guess that's basically the question. Yeah. Yeah, it's not clear that given a surjection, given a generating pair of SL2P, that you can lift it to a pair in SL2Z with trace negative 2 is key. Like integrally negative 2, not negative 2 mark e, but integrally negative 2. With commutator trace. With commut with commutator trace, integral, you know. That would also imply connectivity. That if you could do this with that. Yeah, I think if you could do that, that's more or less. I think that should be. Okay, so at this point, we can just kind of sketch the idea very quickly. The idea is that there is a certain special line bundle. So this is a vector bundle. So, this is the vector bundle of rank one on the moduli sacroclimic curves such that for any component M inside this space mp, for any of these components, remember we want to show that every component maps that has degree divisible by p over m11. So we want to show that for, so what we can show is that for any, there exists a special All we can show is that for any, there exists a special line model, actually, let's give the name lambda, such that for any component of MP, the pullback of lambda, okay, so what do I mean? Remember, f is this forgetful map, so if you have a component in here, right, and you have a lambda, which lives, the lambda which lives over m11, you can pull it back to this component. And such that the pullback is actually a p tensor power. For some line bundle k over m p over m. Okay, so first let's just, I probably don't have, I don't have too much time left, so I'll just say that why is this enough? Well, it's enough because if you now take degrees, what we'll get is that the degree of the pullback. Of the pullback, so that's equal to the degree of k tensor to the p, but then degrees, these tensor products, they kind of pull back, they pull, they basically multiply the degree. So this is p times the degree of k. And then here, when you pull back a line bundle, well, this map is a finite map, right? It's just a covering map, so it also has a degree. And it turns out when you pull back a line bundle, the degrees get multiplied by the line bundle. Degrees get multiplied by the degree of a map. So this is the degree of this thing. Okay. And then it turns out that, well, normally degrees of line bundles are integers, in this case it turns out it's 1 over 24. But it's still kind of okay, right? Because if you pick P to be like something which is not two or three, then the degree of F is kind of divisible by P. F is kind of divisible by P, basically. That's basically where the congruence comes from. I mean, there's a lot of details here. But that's basically the source of the congruence. And I guess I'll just stop there, and then people can ask for more details if it's just higher. Questions from Would you guess that it's conceivable to demonstrate? Well, I think Daniel Martin may have something to say about that. So, what was the question? Would it be possible to deduce connectivity of NP more directly without this? Yeah, so I think it's very hard because it's kind of like this question about um do you know this question about like descendant on fall, like classified gala orbits and descendant on fall. Um it's like you you just kind of pick out, right, so maybe the first thing is you could consider the class of all, you know, A5 covers, A5 is alternate, A5 covers of Q1 minus, right? And then the absolute Galgrow acts on them, but you have no idea whether or not the action is trans. It's the action is transferred basically. You have no idea whether or not the components are, the space is connected. And that basically corresponds to saying, well, at first you might start with A by covers, and then you realize, okay, it's not connected, but why is it not connected? The connected components will correspond to some discrete invariants. So maybe you can identify some discrete variants. And then you say, okay, there's a discrete invariant for ramification index. So now we say A-byte covers with ramification given by such and such. Now you ask, is that connected? And then it turns out that maybe, well, in some cases, you might be lucky. Maybe, well, in some cases you might be lucky, but then in other cases, there might be like a more hidden discrete invariance which you haven't discovered, right? So, kind of understanding connectivity, I think, just from the definition of the moduli problem, I think it's very subtle. It's easy, maybe it's easy to prove disconnectiveness, because then you just have to come up, be clever and come up with an identify a discrete invariant. But showing that there are no discrete invariants is kind of very tricky. So, I think the only way is to do, I mean, these. I mean, need some kind of global understanding, which I guess the work of working in Cameron Sorry helps to give. So, suppose, I mean, so you've got this action of the Calvo group, and so you've got a representation of SFP. And so, if you understand the classification of the representations of SF2P, so this one is giving you one particular representation. Giving you one particular representation. What's the representation is what, on the homology of the colour? Uh yeah, on the homology like say on the H0, and say you want to look at the orange. The colour. Yeah. You want to show it. No, SLTP does not act on this. It's type to see will it seem to Galois covering? SLTP is a Galois covering on this is a set of gap SLTP Galois covers on the limited curves. Yeah, it's so SLTP is acting on that side. Not on this side. Not on this set. Oh, SL2Z, yes, SL2Z acts on that, yes. But really, what's acting is L plus I. So there's a lot of SL2Z's appearance. Really, there are two ways. I think Eric has a question. Okay. Can I ask for a little more detail about what Lambda and K are? Yeah. Specifically, if K kind of. Yeah. Typically, any kind of technological bundle of the picture. Yeah, Lambda is the Hodge bundle on the moduli side of the group. So it's so the diagram, which I'll just put here, is so here's M11, here's MP, or no, sorry, here's M, which is our hypothetical component of MP. This is the forgetful map. Over M11, you have a universal elliptic curve. Over M, you have a fullback universal elliptic curve. But then M is a Universal curve, but then M is a moduli space of SLTP covers, and so it emits a universal family of SLTP covers. And okay, so what is lambda? Lambda is the hot bundle, which you can think of as, so this is the zero section of the elliptic curve, and so it's the pullback of the cotangent sheet of the elliptic curve through B11 over m11. And then the idea is that when you pull it back, you can relate it to. You can relate it to, so assume that there is a section here, in which case you can relate, kappa is basically tau or back of the cotangent sheet of C over N. And the idea is that what is this? Okay, so like you want to view M as being like a line, a complex line. E is like a complex surface, right, where the fibers are elliptic curves. The curves. And then C is going to be another, well, complex surface, but, ooh, this actually came out quite nicely. It's a complex surface such that, which maps to E, right, which maps to this surface, which is an SL2P cover on this surface, fiber by fiber, over the last. And then what is tau and what is sig? What is tau and what is sigma? Basically, the idea is that, okay, so here you've got a section which is the zero section, and then that zero section corresponds to some, may correspond to some section here. And we're basically looking at the tangent sheaf, kind of the relative tangent spaces of C and of E along this section, kind of restricted to this section. And basically, the idea is that because this is a ramified section with ramification. The ramified section with ramification index 2p. Oh, sorry, actually, it should be 2p. But it's fine. It helps the section slightly. Because this is a ramified cover with ramification index 2p along this section, along these punctures basically, that implies that the tangent sheaf, well, the cotangent sheaf here is basically a 2pth tens of power above the cotangent sheaf. And that's how you get. Right. And that's how you get this. That's how you get this. Can I rephrase this in a slightly lower level way? You take the standard differential on the screen forks and you just pull it back along this graph type cover. You'll get some sort of differential on the branch curve. And what you're saying is that the divisor, the zero divisor for that is all of the zeros you can apply to the, I guess. 2D, I guess, right? I think that's reasonable. I think that's true. I have to think about that. Can you rephrase it again? The zeros are what? Yeah, he's saying that if you take a global section of the cotangent sheaf here, but you don't want to take a Here, but you don't want to take a global section. Sorry, I'm not even saying to take a global section. I'm saying take your favorite little picker, take the square torus. Yeah, yeah. Take the SL2FP covering class. That supports a differential. It's coming from pulling back the material paper. And then the I mean, I guess what I wanted to be true was that, right, that differential has zeros. Zeros for time or something. So there should be just zeros of 2p multiplicity at the random location points. So in particular, this k is sort of just a root canonical bundle of that curve. Yeah. Great. Thank you. Well, the k is like a pullback of the canonical bundle. It's not a root. Yes, sure. Yeah, because it's because it's on M, it's not on the curves. Yeah, yeah, so it's like you're restricting the canonical bundle to. Restricting the colours, to the zero section, or to the ramified section of the channel. Okay, well, maybe we can thank Will again. Next talk is five minutes, the last talk before lunch. Um Oh, it's not. Wait, what? Oh, okay. Well, I am kicked over with the time. I'm doing the hardness in the middle of the problem.
