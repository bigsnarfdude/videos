Yeah, instruction. Thanks, Sandra. Yeah. So thanks. I'm very happy to be here. It's a real pleasure for many reasons, both mathematical and all of the mountains. As probably everyone's already learned, I like hiking quite a bit. Yeah, so I'll tell you about some joint work with Clark Barwick and Saul Klassman. And it kind of... And it kind of maybe fits into two of the themes. One is reconstruction, and the other one is it's a kind of anabelian-ish phenomenon. And I'll also, through the talk, explain this word that Clark created, which I think is very useful for describing what kind of phenomenon we encounter. But so I just want to kind of mention at the beginning. I just want to kind of mention at the beginning that the tools that we kind of use are maybe things that are a little bit different from what one might expect. So they're tools from a stratified homotopy theory. So we're kind of maybe coming more from homotopy theory and And Ir Tohoi. But I'm not going to focus on these tools today. I want to focus on the kind of results and context, but I just want to kind of mention that these are kind of key players in how our proofs of everything work. And then the plan for the talk is that I want to start by telling you about a reconstruction result of Wyblotsky. Well, Boy Wesky has many theorems, but a particular theorem of Boy Wesky would not tell you of. And then, so that's going to be a bit of motivation, and then there's another motivation that kind of comes from logic called the conceptual completeness theorem. But I mean, I don't really know logic, so I'll explain it in a way that hopefully will be. In a way that hopefully will be understandable even if you don't know logic, because I don't, so it's understandable to me. And then I'll explain this exotomy result and reconstruction result. Okay, so these two pieces will be kind of motivation. Okay. So let's start with this result of Roybots me. And to contextualize this, I want to again rephrase the Neukert-Uchida theorem. So I think we've seen two rephrasings of it so far. And this third rephrasing will be kind of in line with Max's question. Max's question a few days ago. So, I want to fix some notation at the beginning. So, throughout, x is going to be a scheme. Usually it'll be QCQS. And I'll write X sub at for the category of a tall sheaves of sets on X. And I don't want to, yeah, maybe highlight that this is not the ATAL site, because I'm going to write it enough times that it would be very annoying to write sheaves. And so maybe let's recall a description we have of this category of A-hell sheets for a field. So if K is a field, then a choice of Of separable closure K separate. Okay, K gives a description of this, a tall sheaves on spec K as just continuous representations of Of the Galois group with respect to the chosen separable function. Okay, so the reformulation of the Neutrick-Uchiba theorem is as follows. So say we have K and Have K and L that are number fields. So, yeah, a couple of days ago, Max asked a question about describing isomorphisms between K and L in terms of certain maps of classifying stacks. And this is essentially saying that. So isomorphisms. Isomorphisms between K and L, these are in bijection with equivalences of categories between these categories of eight-all sheaves. Well, and then, okay, I should probably take these. And then, okay, I should probably take these up to the general host of the list. Okay. So, any questions so far? Okay, so the reason why I wanted to recontextualize things in this way is because growth indeed, again, in this famous letter to Paul Things that now I think many of us have mentioned. Mentioned asked a question or made a conjecture about a theorem like this being true in a more general setting. And I'll explain specifically how Vojvatsky proved this conjecture. So, Vojvatsky in I think 1990 Who is still a graduate student proved a version of this conjecture, but it's not just for fields. So, the setup is that k will be a finitely generated field of characteristic zero. And x and y are normal. are normal finite time case schemes. Then what Grosskandi conjectured and Voyowatsky proved is that homomorphisms of morphisms of k-schemes from X to Y, those can be completely recovered from the maps of The max of a tolerable point. So those are the same things as what in the world of she theory is called a geometric morphism. So these are some right adjoint functors whose left adjoint preserves finite limits, like these. Preserves finding limits, like these things that arise from taking push forwards on cheaps. But they should live over the etal topos of spec K. Again, everything should be taken up to natural isomorphism. And there's one caveat here, so I left up a little space here for a reason, which is that there are certain. Which is that there are certain kind of obvious properties of morphisms of schemes that just some random map of boy doesn't satisfy. For example, we're in the context where you have like Chevrolet's theorem here. So like, you know, the image of a constructible set is constructible. But that's not a purely topological fact. That's not just like some fact about Zariski spaces. Zorisky spaces, it's about morphisms of speech. So there's some kind of obvious condition that you have to restrict. But this is kind of not that important for understanding the result. So the point is that you can completely reconstruct a scheme, a normal scheme, over one of these fields of characteristic zero from the category of. Zero from the category of the tall sheaves, remembering the structure map down to the field. Any questions? Great question. Is X et al on et al sheets or only constructible ones? All et al. But it's sufficient to use constructible because you can reconstruct all etal sheets from constructible sheets. So I'll mention this later. Yeah. But any other questions? So maybe let me make one remark that has to do with this normality assumption. Just because I think it's good to kind of remember, you know, or see why this kind of assumption is needed here. So, yeah, the point is there's something. And the point is, there's something that, well, in English translates to the topological invariance of the eccultopology says that this association. This association of a scheme to a tall sheaves on it inverts universal homeomorphisms. So those are maps of schemes that are homeomorphisms on the underlying spaces and also after every pullback of that property. There's other ways of defining these, but one example is if you normalize is if you normalize this cusp, taking a tale sheets on both of these things are the same. So you have to restrict to some setting where those things are inverted. And in characteristic zero, inverting universal homeomorphisms, it turns out to be the same as semi-normalization. Now, Vojvatsky didn't prove that form, but probably that should be true as well. And another maybe remarkable And another maybe remark is there so I kind of posed this as a problem on Tuesday. In positive characteristic there are conjectures like this, but as far as I know nothing, you know, we don't know how to do this in positive characteristic, or it hasn't been written down. So there's some open-minded problems in that setting. Any questions? Okay. So yeah, this result you might view as some kind of maximalist Anabelian geometry, where instead of just remembering a tall pi 1, you remember everything about a tall sheets. Okay, but what I want to kind of explain is that there's something much closer to at all pi1, though it is more, that is sufficient to kind of remember everything and it kind of plays a number of different roles. So I want to, in the second section, give some more motivation from a different theorem. Called the conceptual completeness theorem, which is some sort of completeness theorem in logic that has a very nice formulation in algebraic geometry. But before I do that, I want to explain something else that's kind of intimately related to this, which is, you know, you might ask the following question. So, for a field, we know how to describe We know how to describe the category of atologies in a very explicit way using Galois groups. What about some more general schemes? Is there such a description? For example, like a DBR. That's kind of the most simple thing. And I want to explain how you can do that in the case of a DBR. And this is going to be really related to this kind of theorem and logic, though that's kind of maybe surprising. Of maybe surprising. So, I want to work through this example first, and then we'll kind of come back to this picture here. So, A will be a DVR, and let big K be the fraction field, and I'll choose this operable closure, and I will let a cap up, which hopefully looks sufficiently different. Which hopefully looks sufficiently different, be the residue field. And I'll also choose a separable closure. And let's write X per second. Okay? So, well, this fraction field part taking Taking specs, this is open in spec A, and this part is closed. And they're complementary. So we can construct, or maybe I should say we can describe the entire category of sheaves via what What is often called Rick Lambot or Artin blooming? And so what is this saying? So let's write I lower star for the closed embedding and a JLover star for the open embedding. Start for the open embedding. And what this general art including procedure is, is it says that in a tall sheet on the big thing can be described as a triple of things. Triple of things. So one is a sheaf on, let's call it S, that is on a closed piece. So one way we can think of that is as a set with an action of the Gala group of Kapla. I have to prescribe an HL sheath on the open piece, which I want to think of as a set with With an action of the Gamlo group of k. And then I need to provide one additional piece of data, which is a map from the sheaf on the closed piece to the pullback of the push forward of the sheaf on the open piece. So it's described by those three. So it's described by those three pieces of data. Now, these two I kind of describe in some Galois theoretic terms, but what is this gluing functor? So for that, you can describe this using the decomposition group and the inertia group. So do you need that map? No, just any map. Just any map. Yeah, so how it works is like if you had a sheaf on the big thing, you would say this is I upper star of the sheaf, this is J upper star of the sheaf, and then this map is I upper star of the unit map from the sheaf to From the sheaf to J upper star, J upper star. Yeah, but it's just any half. Okay, so let's let D A inside of the Galois group of big K be the decomposition group and IA the inertia And the Galois group of the other field is naturally the quotient of the decomposition group by the inertia group. And so the point is that under this identification, this I upper star J lower star Lower star. So if I want to think of it as something going from sets with G big K action to sets with G kappa action. This just sends this guy to, well, first you restrict the action from here to the decomposition group, and then you take. And then you take fixed points by the inertia group, and this has a residual action by this quotient, which I'm identifying with the Galois group of the residue shield. And so the point of this is that you can completely describe HL sheaves in terms of two pieces of Galois theoretic data and then some ramification data. And then some ramification data using the decomposition and inertia groups. And one of the upshots of the talk is going to be that this is basically always true. It's not just true for a DBR, but you have to be careful about that. But the question that I want to kind of explain an answer to that has to do with this theorem in logic is, yeah, I mean, is kind of, yeah, can we Kind of, yeah, can we we always reconstruct from gala log groups and decomposition error groups. Any questions so far? Okay. So what kind of X's should I have in mind? So in the end, it will, well, I mean, for the kind of best reconstruction results that are reconstructing the scheme, they should be in the context of Rodrigo Skies theory. But in general, But in general, it'll turn out you just need X to be QCQ. So basically, no assumptions. Every scheme I like to think of is PCP. Well, you can't reconstruct new potential thick innings, right? Tick innings. Well, yeah, but if you're just reconstructing a tall cheese, it's insensitive. All to use, it's insensitive to this restriction that you expect with a normality. Yeah, yeah. But just for reconstructing HAL sheaves, any QCQS will do. For reconstructing the scheme, that's very much false. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks. Okay, so here is the result I want to explain, which is called a conceptual Which is called a conceptual completeness theorem. So this is, I'm going to just say a super special case of this that applies to algebraic geometry. But this theorem goes back to Machai Andreas in like forever ago in 1977. And Jacob Lurie was a Jacob Lurry has also done some very important work on this recently and strengthened what they did quite significantly. And this is a super special case. And what it says is the following. So for a morphism F from X to Y of QCQS The following are so if we're in the context of Volyvansky's result, we're interested maybe in knowing when a map of schemes induces an equivalence on a tall to boy. So the first thing is that the push forward on a tall sheets is an equivalence of categories. Categories. And then the second thing, it's analogous to results that maybe you're familiar with. Like, I mean, it's actually also a consequence of this theorem in logic. Like, if I have a continuous map between compact post-first spaces and it's a bijection, then it's a homeomorphism. Or if you have a map between spectral topological spaces and it induces an isomorphism on specialization cosets, then it is an isomorphism. Then it is an isomorphism of spectral topological spaces. So the claim is that the induced functor on categories of points. So I am going to explain what this is, but I'll explain what it is in a second. So it's the from the category of points of the Hawaii plus. Of points of the A tau tuplus to the category of points of the A tau tuplus of Y, that this is an equivalence of categories. Okay, so I'll explain what this thing means. I mean, maybe it's familiar to some people, but maybe unfamiliar to others. And in any case, it's useful to say what it is. It's useful to say what it is. But before that, I just want to highlight a consequence of this conceptual completeness result and Voibotsky's theorem. Okay. So the corollary of this and Frobotsky's theorem is in the Theorem is in the setting of this theorem of Huyweltsky. What this says is that a map of these k-varieties is an isomorphism. Is an isomorphism if and only if some sort of functor between some other categories that I want to claim are more simple than just the atol topics in a way, gives an equivalence of categories. These are just the toposteotic points? These are just the toposteoretic points? Yeah, they're the toposteoretic points. Yeah, but I'll spell out what this means explicitly. Yeah, thanks for the question, whoever supposed. Okay. So, okay. So let me explain what this category of points is. So if you know what toposteic points is, I'm just going to be describing this. If you don't, that's okay, because I'll say what it is explicitly. But let's recall something, which is that if I'm given a geometric point, so I'll write x-bar for the geometric point and little x for its underlying image point in x, and a tall sheaf. Well, the stock at this geometric point, one way of calculating it. One way of calculating it is to take the sections of your sheet after you pull back to the local ring. I mean, this is something that's always true, but the local ring in the ACOM topology is this strict tensilization of the usual local ring, where the strict tensilization here depends on the choice of separable closure given by the geometric. So, okay. So a definition, if you are not familiar with it, or a computation, if you are familiar with it, that the Growth Integrating School did, is it describes this category of points as follows. So this category of points has the following kind of things. So its objects So its objects, they're geometric points. And for me, maybe just to highlight, what I mean is that the extension is a separable closure. You don't need more. You don't need more giant separably close extensions. And then the morphisms you can describe in a number of different ways. So there are two ways to describe them, and both of them will be useful, so I'll mention both. So if I want to compute Hans in this category of points, In this category of points between two geometric points. So I'll name them as S-bar and eta-bar, S for special, eta for generic. One way of computing them is taking maps between these strictly Henselian local rings. So they're Homs of schemes over X from The more generic point to the more special point. So, yeah, why in this direction? Well, it's because if you have a map from here to here, then you can pull your Then you can pull your sheaf back further and take sections, and then you get a map from the stock at the more special point to the stock at the more generic point. So that's one way of describing what the morphisms are. Often people call these atal specializations. But I want to offer a second way of describing what the morphisms are. Okay. So the second point, so this is a continuation of the above, of the below, is you can also describe these as lifts. So the data all right, like what you're describing in red, you have a map from this str uh spec of the strictly Henselian local ring. The strictly Henselian local ring, which I like to think of as an infinitesimal neighborhood of S, because one way of describing it is as an inverse limit of all of the et all neighborhoods of S. And the data of a morphism is the same as a lift from this more generic geometric point to this infinitesimal neighbor. Any questions about this definition or computation? The drama definition, of course, is that it doesn't depend only on the category of exit terminal, but uses geometry. Yeah, well... Is it really points of exital or is it points of x sort of realization? It's possible to describe it using only exital. It's possible to just I mean, yeah, so right, so. Right. So maybe what's being pointed out is that this category, like, yeah, one way of describing it as as stock functors, which only depends on the topos. And this seems like maybe it depends on more, but it actually doesn't. One way of saying this is that there's a way of defining these local rings that only uses the topos and doesn't use anything else. But I'm kind of sweeping that under the brush. And also it's a theorem that there are. And also it's a theorem that these are all the points of the table. Yeah, it's a theorem that these are all the points of the shows. So yeah, there's some non-trivial things going in here. It's kind of sort of a definition sort of in retrospect. Yeah, it's only a regular definition and then there are theorems and then this is what comes out. Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's why I said this. So you can take it as a definition if you weren't familiar with it, but it's actually not a definition. It's actually not a definition. So, yeah. Thanks for highlighting this. Any other questions or comments? Okay. So I want to make an observation or kind of two observations that are kind of key observations. So the first one is that Is that if you look at the endomorphism of a geometric point in this category, it has a familiar description. It's the Galois group of the residue field of the point you're picking out with respect to the chosen separable closure. So the thing that I want to highlight is that this has a natural As a natural profinite structure, but I mean, this is just a category. It doesn't have any kind of, you know, I just said it's some category. And the second thing is actually about looking at a random morphism in this category. A random morphism in this category or the hom sets. So, maybe the thing to recall that I kind of said verbally in a few minutes ago is that if you look at one of these strictly Hansellian local rings, and let me make my notation to use S because I kind of will care about it being the more special point, you can recover this as a limit over H of all neighborhoods. So for this, maybe it's convenient for me to say these are atal and quasi-compact maps to X, along with the data of a lift of this geometric point to the eight-fold map. And this limit, this is a co-filtered limit. Co-filtered limit. And the maybe point that I want to highlight, but I won't say in too much detail, is that the hom sets of this category of points. Of this category of points between just two different objects, also have natural profinite structures. And this is seen using well using the same thing. Well, using, you know, I'll call this star and I'll call this star star. So the point is that if you describe things this way, you're asking for morphisms from this geometric point to this, which is some sort of limit of stuff. You pull the limit out, it's a co-filtered limit, and then you realize that. And then you realize that it's a co-filtered, you can understand it as a co-filtered limit of profinite size. So it's a profinite set. So, okay. The point of all of this is just that there's some additional structure on the category of points that is just there for free. And that essentially, if you Essentially, if you use this additional structure, it gives you a lot of mileage. So that's the kind of next thing I want to explain. Any questions about this? Okay, so maybe the thing that I want to say is that I'll just say the kind of idea of a construction that we do that's now very, not very far from what I've said. So Is so in this work, we explain how to really make this thing a kind of sketch precise and endow this category of points with the structure of a category. In profinite sets, so that the topologies on the Galois groups are the topologies on the Galois groups. And what we call the resulting thing with this extra structure is Gal X, because it's a globalization of Galois groups that kind of records Galois groups at every point. Galois root of every at every point, and some ramification data between them. So it turns out there are a couple different ways of thinking about this. So much like how the eta homotopy type, if you're familiar with this, or if you just say tall Pai 1, but the eta homotopy type is a pro space, this you can think of as a pro object in categories. With finitely many morphisms. And it turns out some basic category theory tells you that that sits inside of categories in profit sense. So when you say what does pro object when categories Categories categories. Yeah, so okay. Secretly I'm using that. Is it an infinity categorical project or pro-object? No, I mean it's this is really just a one categorical but what does it mean pro object in category? So you can think of it as an it's a formal inverse system of categories. Of categories. Yeah, I mean, it's pro other. Yeah, I mean, it's up to equal. If I understand that the category is enriched in profile sets, I don't know. Um so finitely many morphisms implies finitely many objects. Implies finitely many objects. Yeah, I mean, the identity. Yeah, so I said this in a clever way. If you have finitely many morphisms, you can only have finitely many identity morphisms. The reason I want to stress this is because it'll just make something a little bit easier later. Okay. So this might seem a a bit complicated, but somehow A bit complicated, but somehow, um, I think it's actually not so far from what we're used to. So, like, I mean, maybe one thing to say is, you know, maybe a more natural thing, and I mean, something that even Grosandeek highlighted, is it's a little bit more natural instead of like working with the Atall fundamental group, to work with the Atall fundamental group one. So you don't have to. Groupoid. So you don't have to restrict to connectedness or make choices. And I mean, it's the same kind of thing that happens. You just say groupoids with finitely many points. So it's a notion of pro-finiteness for categories of curve points. Okay. Okay. So everyone is all right with that, then I want to kind of now explain. Kind of now explain explain the kind of the results that we proved. Okay, so so this third So this third section is going to be on taxonomy and reconstruction. So to do this, I just want to briefly recall something or add a little bit to something that Jesse brought up in the previous talk. Talk. So I want to recall something from topology because the first result I want to talk about is a kind of algebra geometric version of a result in topology. So I just want to ignore kind of all hypotheses, so I'll just say t is a nice topological space. Then hopefully something that is familiar. Hopefully, something that is familiar is there's a monogramy equivalence between locally constant sheaves, say, sets, whatever, on t. And, well, I don't want to choose a base point, so I'll say functors of the fundamental group point of t to sets. And how does this work? Well, it works by sending a local system to the thing that sends the Thing that sends a point to the stop at that local system. And then, if you have a path, you realize: well, local systems on the unit integral are almost constant, so there's a canonical identification between the stops at any two points with paths between them. Now, the kind of more general result that Jesse mentioned last time. That Jesse mentioned last time is that if, say, say, I don't know, T S is a nice stratophyte space. Then there's a similar description of constructible sheaves on T, say relative. On T, say relative to the stratification X. So that means sheaves that when you restrict to each of the strata are locally constant. So there's something called an exit path category. And what it does is have the fundamental groupoid records points. Records points and then all paths between them is records points and then paths that start in a lower stratum indexed by the stratifying coset and exit out. So maybe there's a kind of good example to do that I think explains a lot of this, which is there's a stratified space that's the unit interval with this stratification. With this stratification. So it has two strata: a point, zero, and then the half-open interval. And the kind of thing that you realize is that if you look at constructable sheaves on this guy, well, you can describe it in terms of representations of a quiver, but maybe you'll need to say it this way. It's functors out of an arrow, just sets. And the point there is you have to record the stock here. And then since it's locally constant on this contractible guy, it's actually constant. So all the stocks are canonically identified. And you read. You realize that there's a specialization map relating the stop here and the stop at any other point. If people want, I can explain that more. But the point is that these exiting paths in stratified spaces are kind of governed by maps from this that start in a stratum and leave. So when you pull back to here, you always get specialization maps from stocks at lower strata to stocks at higher strata. And the claim is. At higher strata. And the claim is that the data of a constructable sheet is exactly the stocks and these specialization maps and how they play well together. So, how do you encode a phototopic and pads? Yeah, so you have to encode this. And that's part of the, yeah, I mean, it actually gets somewhat technical, but I want to push all those details under the rug. So, part of our original motivation for this. For this, was to do this in algebraic geometry, where things maybe are a bit harder in certain ways and easier in other ways. So, the other thing I want to say is that Clark came up with this word that I quite like. So, you know, if you call this the monotromy equivalence, monotromy for exit paths, he created this word called exotromy. And that's what is used to refer to this benomyl. Is used to refer to this phenomenon of representing constructible sheaves as functors out of the quote-unquote exit path category. Now, of course, in algebraic geometry, we don't really have paths, so we do something else. Okay, so now let me really explain first. Okay. Okay, so here's the exotic theorem. So X is going to be a QCQS speed. And R will be either, say, a finite ring or it could be something like this. Or it could be something like Z, QL, QL bar, something like this. And so the theorem is that there are equivalences of categories. So on the one hand, let me do the kind of set version. And then, okay, then I have to talk about Trinity categories at some point. So constructible. So, constructable atal sheaves of sets on X. So, this means that there is some finite stratification over which on the strata the sheaf is locally constant with stops that are finite sets. So these are the same things as functors out of this galaxy to finite sets. But let me put a Fine. But let me put a little decoration here, which is continuous. So, meaning they have to respect all of the actions of Galois groups and natural profinite structure on homsets and this. So, why I made this kind of pro-category description before is it's possible to describe this using pro categories, which is you extend the functor construction to pro categories along co-filtered elements. A long co-filter equivalence. So, okay. And how this equivalence works is exactly as in topology. It'll send my constructible sheaf to something that sends a geometric point to the stock, now equipped with the action of the relevant Galois group. And what does it do to morphisms? What does it do to morphisms? Well, whenever you have one of these maps from one of these strictly Hansalian local rings at a more generic point to the one at a more special point, you describe the stalks, as I said before, by taking sections over Over these local rings, and you have a natural comparison map just given by Colbat. I mean, kind of informally, what it says is the data of a constructible sheaf is the data of all of its stocks with actions of the Galois groups. Factions of the Galois groups and this kind of ramification data relating with them. Okay. And then the second result here is that this is true at a fully derived level. So the second piece is that, okay, maybe you all should tell me which version of D I should write. Do. Okay, so in order to formulate this, I really need to use higher categories. So, if you don't like that, I'm sorry, but it's actually unavoidable. So the derived category of constructible atal sheaves with coefficients in R, and by constructible, I mean the stocks are perfect complexes. So maybe sometimes this is written CTF or something like this. It's equivalent. It's equivalent to the same sort of thing as functors from this Galois category that respect all of this kind of topology to perfect complexes. And this is why I need higher categories. I mean, to actually make this right, you need the target to not just be the homotopy category. No assumptions on L. No assumptions on L. No assumptions on L. But maybe the one thing I want to say is for things like the ZL, QL, QL bar, in order to really make this precise and for things to work out correctly, you need to use condensed map. And this is exactly why I had some And this is exactly why I had some hand in some of the foundations of this, was because you kind of need to have this kind of foundations in order to talk about the derived pedimary of a topological ring in a really kind of good way. And okay. So one of the kind of nice things about this is this is true at a fully About this, this is true at a fully derived level, but this guy is really just a one-categorical thing. When you do this in topology, like, you know, maybe the easiest thing to say is like the derived category of local systems, this isn't determined by pi1. It's determined by the entire homogeneous type. But in algebraic geometry, somehow, since everything in some sense is locally a k pi1, you just need an ordinary category. Okay? So. So that's one thing. Now there's a second result that I want to explain, which is that you can completely recover the etal homotopy type from this invariant I've introduced. Let's say I don't want to do condensed map. Could you put pro and really you put well really Yeah, I guess, I mean, the problem is, you know, what do you mean by this kind of continuous functors from this thing into perfQL? So for ZL, you can avoid convinced math. But I mean, to say precisely what it means to kind of respect all these topologies and things like this, you you need this kind of issue is the target category. The issue is the target category. The issue is the target category. But yeah, that's a great question. Okay, so the other thing is I want to describe another result, which is about recovering the etal homelocopy type from this invariant. So this This guy, it's a pro category. The Atoll homotopy type is a pro space. And the claim is that there's a natural equivalence between, on the one hand, the I call homotopy type, which I usually write as this, and, well, it's a pro space. It's a pro category, so I can get a pro space by taking. So, I can get a probe space by taking classifying spaces everywhere. So, if you take this probe category and you take classifying spaces everywhere, you get the atol homotopy category. So, this definition never uses hypercovers or anything like this. And there are some also theorems you can prove with this that I think are pretty hard to prove using any other formulation of the et al. So that's another result. And let me finish in the last, I think, I have two or three minutes with a reconstruction result. So the last theorem is a reconstruction result. So maybe let me reiterate something that Jakob asked earlier, which is, okay. Okay, it turns out that there's a completely natural way to reconstruct all ATAL sheets from constructible atol sheets. So these data are really the same. So if you believe this result, then combining this with Voibosky's theorem, let me just kind of say it informally. Well, the first thing is not using this, which is that these et al. topoi A tall topoi and morphisms between them can be completely reconstructed from this galaxy. This gal x. So that's something that's just true in this QCQS setting. And then combining this with Wrybotsky, you get a reconstruction result. So this is a consequence of what we do, and of course, Wojbotsky's result, which is that if you have a K, that's a finitely generated field of Of a characteristic zero, then this assignment from your scheme X to this category with all of this extra structure is a complete invariant of a normal finite type base D's. So, and by complete, I mean not just that you can recover the isomorphism type, but you can recover all morphisms if you remember all of this structure. So, I think of this as very analogous to the, what's the acronym, close results. So, it's somehow a bit different. It's saying, you know, you don't just remember kind of this risky space, but you remember. And there's a risky space, but you remember also the data Galois groups of all the residue fields and how they interact. And this completely determines the scheme. Okay, thanks for listening. The better question is for Peter. This last theorem is this relative over Is this relative over case? Yeah, it's relative. Yes, I didn't have a random approach. But yeah, it's kind of in the exact same setup as Voybrotsky's result. You just replace a tall topos as a invariant with this thing. I guess if I give myself this kind of Galax, time X is irreducible, the generic point, so to speak, is sort of characterized. Characterized. Must be sort of the only because specialization always go to particular of the function field. By POP gives me already birational classification. Ah, yeah, just a very good point. Yeah, thanks. And if you if you look at what Althurian uh proofs that um Proves that the actual rational data, actually the functional field reconstructs the field. I think there's a lot of specialization and recovering those things. So I think this is closer than it looks like. Yeah. Yeah, this, yeah, we should talk more about this island. Yeah, this is very nice to know. Other questions? So all of this seems very tied to the topos. Anything to say about the flat topos? So the flat topos. Okay, so maybe I say one thing before I get to that, which is actually what we do, how I kind of mentioned at the beginning, oh, we do this general thing for infinite top points. It applies to way more. Version for any topoid. It applies to way more general stuff. The flat topos, I think we can say some stuff, but part of the issue, at least kind of, maybe it's just a mental pluck, is that I don't think we have a characterization of the points of a flat tempos. So you can say, oh, you construct this kind of thing, but then you don't know what it is, maybe. So is there a hope to get all sorts of? Uh I don't know. I don't know. I'm not sure. But yeah, that's a great question. But yeah, I mean, so this kind of result, though, I mean, it works for many other topologies. It's just kind of nicest to describe in the atologies. Final questions? No? Let's thank Peter again. Let's thank Peter again. And we'll resume at 3:30.
