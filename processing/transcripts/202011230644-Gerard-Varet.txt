Okay, can you see any uh can you see see the slides and hear me properly? We can see the slides very well and also you yeah okay so the time is yours. Okay, thank you thank you Anishka a big thank you to you and to Miroslav for this kind invitation and so I will discuss And so I will discuss some recent mathematical results on the effective viscosity of suspensions. Okay, so what I call here a suspension is a large number, n, of particles inside a fluid. And because they are rigid, the particles induce some extra resistance to strain. And so hopefully, this extra resistance to strain. This extra resistance to strain can be seen from a microscopic viewpoint as some extra viscosity for the field. And more precisely, the hope is that when n is very large, so mathematically as n goes to infinity, the resistance induced by each particle, I mean, all of these resistances should average. And at the end of the day, we hope to model the suspension by a single fluid. Suspension by a single fluid, but with some modified viscosity coefficient that would be called effective viscosity. So, of course, this is a topic of great concern in rheology. There have been many experiments, many numerical simulations, and the principle is more or less always the same. You shear a suspension, and then you compute the rate. The ratio between the energy dissipation of the suspension and the energy dissipation of the free delone when there is no particle inside. Okay, and so this should give you access to the effective viscosity. And of course, in all these experiments and in all the numerics, there is a crucial parameter, which is the volume fraction of the particles, of course, the solid volume fraction. Particles, of course, the solid volume fraction that will be denoted phi. So when phi is small, this is dilute suspensions. And when phi is large, this is dense suspensions. And of course, there is a limit called phi c, the maximum flowable volume fraction at which the dynamics of the particles is completely blocked. Okay, so when the suspension is fully jammed. And so as a result of all And so, as a result of all the experiments and the numerics, you can plot curves of the effective viscosity versus the ratio phi over phi c. And so you see, if you are a bit optimistic about these curves, you may say that there is some kind of typical law where the effective viscosity maybe could be expressed as a function of the Expressed as a function of the ratio phi over phi c. Okay, but there is no real theoretical foundation for this. And notably, for dense suspensions, there are many, many open questions, even from the point of view of physics. Okay, so for this talk, I will restrict to the dilute case. So that would be more the right of the left part of the curve. And I will show you a bit of mathematical analysis. And I will do that on a simple model. So, as you can see, my particles will be spheres. So, there will be n spheres, b1, bn, with radius x1, xi, sorry, x1, xn, and a radius Rn that is small. And outside the particles, I will just consider a Stokes flow. I will just consider a Stokes flow. Okay, so you have this steady incompressible Stokes equation. And on top of that, I'm saying that the particles are neutrally variant, which means that there will be no sedimentation. Okay, and I also neglect the inertia. So that's a very simple model, but which is of common use in the field. So the balance between the various forces tells you at the end. Forces tell you at the end that the force and the torque on each particle is zero, which gives you the cancellation of these two quantities. So that's the force on ball BI and that's the torque on ball BI, and both of them should be zero. So that's the balance of forces in the fluid and at the particles. And then I complete this with boundary condition. So the particle. Condition. So the particles, as I said, are rigid. So they are described by some translation velocity ui, some angular velocity vector omega i. So these two vectors can be seen as Lagrange multipliers associated to these two conditions. Okay, and on top of that, as I am considering effective viscosity, I want to see the reaction of the flow to shear. The flow to shear. So I impose some shear at infinity and more precisely some strain here. So you take a symmetric matrix which is trace-free because of the divergence-free condition, and you say that far away u n, the velocity field, should behave like Sx. Okay, and now the question is, can we approximate this suspension model by some effective field equation? So we would like to approximate it by a single stoke. To approximate it by a single Stokes equation like this, but with a modified effective viscosity coefficient μf that may now depend on X and which hopefully should be different from the original viscosity of the feed μ in the region where the particles stand. So, as I said, I will focus here on the dilute regime. So, more precisely, the solid volume fraction will be assumed to be small, but independent of n. Okay, and I remind you that the solid volume fraction is the volume of one ball, 4 pi over 3 Rn cube, times the number of balls. Okay, and you should divide, I forgot that, by the macroscopic domain where the particles stand, but I will. Particle stand, but I will assume that this volume containing the particle will have size one, and I will make it more precise later. So if you work at small phi, then the effective viscosity should be a small perturbation of the original one. And so you may hope to find some approximation in form of an expansion in powers of phi. And you hope that Hope that having an expansion up to order k, you will be able to find an approximation at order k of the solution. And the kind of results we get is this kind of condition where we say that uniformly in n, the difference between the true solution u n and the effective approximation should be small compared to phi to the k in some L P. Okay. So that's the hope. And a last remark is that, of course, when you deal with the field mechanics problem around obstacles, the periodic setting may be of interest. But in the case of suspensions, where the particles should move under some dynamics, and here it's kind of a frozen model at some time t, in this setting of suspensions, the periodic The periodic setting is not enough, and you should at some point deal with more realistic and mostly random distributions of particles. Okay, so let me start by discussing a first-order approximation. So look for an effective viscosity under the form mu plus phi nu1, which should hopefully give an order one approximation in phi. Approximation in phi. And so there is a very, very famous paper about this, which is due to Einstein 1905. And Einstein showed that if the suspension is homogeneously distributed in the domain, and if the interaction between the particles can be neglected, then you should add this correction to the original viscosity. So you should take at first order. At first order, μf being μ times 1 plus 5/2 of phi in the domain where the particles stand. Okay, so that's Einstein result. But as you can see, this is a bit vague because, okay, what does he mean by homogeneously distributed and under what condition on the particles the interaction can be really neglected? Okay, so. Be really neglected. Okay, so that's questions that need some mathematical treatment. And as far as I know, the first works in this direction are due to Sanchez-Palencia and Levy and Sanchez-Palencia through homogenization techniques when you assume that the particle stands on a periodic grid. Okay, and then there is a nice study by Haines. Sorry, that should be an I here. That should be an I here, Hence, and Matzukato, still in the periodic case. Okay, so here they justify Einstein's formula, but of course, as I said, I mean, considering periodic distributions is quite restrictive. And so there have been other studies trying to improve this. And there is notably a paper by Illéré, Mathieu Illéré and Ji Wu. Mathieu Iray and Di Wu, where they justify Einstein's formula under two conditions. So, the first one is a kind of homogeneity condition, saying that the empirical measures of the particle center should go weakly to some uniform limit density. So, the density should be properly normalized, the characteristic function of some domain O. So, that's the homogeneous. Some domain O, so that's the homogeneity condition A1. And then they have a second assumption, A2, which tells that the minimal distance between the particles should be greater than constant n to the minus one-third for some absolute constant c independent of phi. Okay, so of course, this covers as a special case the periodic case, and this is already a big step forward. Big step forward compared to the periodic case. But still, this assumption on the minimal distance is quite strong. And you can realize that when you compare it to the simple no-penetration condition, telling you that the spheres should not, of course, penetrate each other. So the no-penetration. Each other. So the no-penetration condition tells you just that dn is greater than 2rn, right? The distance between the centers should be at least two times the radius. And when you replace Rn by its expression in terms of n, and in terms of the solid volume fraction, you find a condition which scales like phi one-third n minus one-third to be compared to n minus one-third. n minus one-third. So at small phi, the scaling is somehow not good. So of course, to neglect the interaction between the particles, you need more than the no-penetration condition because you don't want some clustering because in Einstein's rezoning, you have to neglect the interaction. But still, in terms of magnitude, this assumption on the minimal distance is quite strong. And so that's why we've tried to improve this a little with Richard Huffer. With Richard Huffer. And we show that Einstein's formula is still valid if we replace this strong assumption on the minimal distance by a set of two conditions. So one is a slightly bigger constraint than the no-penetration condition. I replace the two by two plus delta for some arbitrarily small delta. And then there is this condition. And then there is this condition A3, which is a condition, I mean, a cardinal condition saying that there should be not so many balls close from one another. So it's a quantitative version of a no-clustering condition. And so this is more satisfactory from a physical viewpoint because you have the right scaling in terms of, I mean, it's close to the no-penetration condition, and the last assumption is satisfied. The last assumption is satisfied by most particle distributions. I mean, you can construct particle distributions out of random stationary processes. You can draw randomly through IID random variables, the particle centers, and they will always satisfy a condition like this. So, this is up to now the optimal assumptions under which Einstein's formula is valid. Okay, so that's it for a first-order approximation. Can we go beyond? Can we go up to a second-order approximation? So, again, there have been many formula in the literature, many physics papers with formula for periodic and random distributions of particles. But when you study the literature, you see that the formula do not always coincide. So, you have papers dealing with the same setting. Papers dealing with the same setting, but they do not find the same formula, which is quite annoying. And also, there is, I mean, some methods of derivation are not so clear. So, for instance, in the random case, there is a very well-known paper by Bachelor and Green, where they use a kind of renormalization technique, which is, at least to me, not so clear. So that's why we try to reconsider this a bit more. A bit more. And when you deal with this, you realize that deriving a next-order approximation is much more difficult than deriving Einstein's formula, because as soon as you want a phi-square approximation, you have to deal with pairwise interactions of the particles. And in particular, you realize that the knowledge of the limit density, meaning just put Meaning, just putting an assumption on the limit of the empirical measure is not enough. So, the microscopic structure will play a role here. And so, in particular, you need to impose more averaging properties than the assumption A1 on the empirical measure. So, typically, I mean, you can replace it by an assumption which is that the points, I mean, you start from a point. The points, I mean, you start from a point process, which would be stationary of intensity one, so at scale one, you rescale it by a factor n minus one third to have small particles, and you keep the ones that fall into some given domain O. Okay, so that's typically a modeling through stationary point processes that you need to have some more averaging. Averaging. Okay, and so under this kind of condition, one can indeed derive rigorously second-order approximations for the effective viscosity, and you have really explicit formulas. So I started the study under the assumption A2, so meaning that you still have a strong assumption on the minimal distance. And then I refined it. And then I refined it, and actually, then Mithier Duranx and Antoine Gloria had a very, very nice and more complete contribution when you remove this assumption, this strong assumption on the minimal distance. Okay, so just for as an example, you have two little results that where the second order correction for the effective viscosity is explicit when you have a periodic. It when you have a periodic distribution of particles and when you have a random isotropic stationary distribution. Okay, so I don't know if I have a couple of minutes left, Agneshka. Yeah, you have three more minutes. Three more minutes, perfect. So in the last minutes, I will just give you an idea of the tools that are used to prove this kind of results and to study this effective viscosity. Effective viscosity. So there is a first ingredient which is called the method of reflections, which goes back to Smolyshowski. And typically, when the particles are far enough from one another, so typically under the assumption A2 of strong minimal distance, you can actually compute the solution of the freed particle system that I showed to you through some iteration. Through some iteration where you only involve single particle problems. Okay, so you have a method of iteration that gives you quite explicit formula for Un and so this quite explicit formula for Un gives you a quite explicit formula for what the effective viscosity should be. And at least doing things formally, you see that the second order The second order correction μ2 is given by a kind of mean field limit where this potential W is explicit and it's quite singular. It's a Calderon-Sygmund kernel. And this is very important that this is Calderon-Zygmund type to then have the proper mathematical analysis. So as I said, the second order correction, it involves pairwise interactions through a mean field limit. Through a mean field limit. And so then to tackle this mean field limit, to understand under which conditions it exists and to give expressions for the limit, we really relied on nice, very nice mathematical works by Silvia Serfati and coachers on Coulomb gases. So they have a kind of similar problem where they have to compute a mean field limit. Where they have to compute a mean field limit with a potential W. And okay, in our context, this is the potential that I mentioned to you. And you can have, I mean, this kind of interaction integrals can be written down as an energy. So that's the starting point. So when you have an F which is nice enough, for example, L2, you can introduce the stokes solution of Introduce the Stokes solution of this equation with source term divergence of Sf and then you can express this kind of things, this double integral in terms of energy of this stock solution. Okay, and so the idea here will be to replace this F by the empirical measure so as to have access to the mean field limit. Because formally, when you replace F by the empirical measure, F by the empirical measure, you find this kind of mean field functional. Okay, and so then the idea is: okay, that's an energy, and then we will know things about the limit of this energy. The problem is that this is not okay because you have something which is not h minus one at the right-hand side when you have a direct mass here. So, the energy is infinite, and this limit is infinite. So, this is not, I mean, this is just a formal thinking. I mean, this is just a formal thinking, but as explained by Serfati, you have a way to make sense out of this through some kind of renormalization, regularization procedure. And if you follow this kind of renormalization and regularization, then you fall into the scope of more classical homogenization problems that you can tackle by usual homogenization theory arguments. Arguments. So that's how you can get an expression for the second-order correction to the effective viscosity. And if you relax the assumption on the minimal distance, then you cannot use the method of reflection, but you use the so-called cluster expansion method, which is a tool in statistical physics. So that's the background for the proof of the mathematical results, and I will stop here. Results, and I will stop here. Thank you. Okay, thank you very much. And are there any
