To this beautiful location and to present a problem. So, I was asked to facilitate a group in dynamics. So, this will be a problem about dynamics, also in numerative combinatorics, I would say, which maybe hasn't been the focus as much so far. Yeah, and my goal is just to, again, present one very concrete and I think tractable problem that we could potentially work on, but it's going to. But it's connected to a lot of interesting mathematics, including things that many people in the audience have worked on. So I also see the possibility of project developing in different ways. And let me say that I really don't have so many slides here. So definitely be able to get through them all. So please stop me at any moment if you have questions. And I'll be a very elementary and understandable talk. And understandable talk. Okay, so starting with Catalan objects and lattices on them and the dynamics that result from these lattices. So I think we're all familiar with the Catalan numbers, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 5, 14, excuse me, and so on. I'm glad I wrote them here. I wouldn't have to be able to see if you wrote them out there. And they count many classes of pump-in-curved objects, including non-crossing partitions. Non-crossing partitions, non-crossing set partitions, so we've seen these already. Here I'm depicting the third Catalan number. So maybe this isn't such a good example because all of the set partitions are non-crossing in this case, but of course non-crossing means that when we arrange the numbers 1 through n on a circle in clockwise order, the convex hulls of the blocks are not crossing. Another famous class of Famous class of Catalan objects are the dick paths of length 2n. So these are paths from 0, 0 to 2n, 0 that take up steps of the form 1, 1 or downsteps of the form 1 minus 1 and never go below the x-axis. Triangulations of an n plus 2 gon, pretty self-explanatory, and also plane trees. And also, plane trees with n plus 1 nodes. So, a plane tree is a rooted tree that's drawn in the plane. So, here my roots are at the bottom, so that these trees kind of really grow up like a tree. And the key fact about plane trees is that the children of every node are distinguished left from right. So, sort of this one is different than this one, they're kind of isomorphic as rooted trees, but they're considered different embeddings into the point. To the point. And sort of all of these different interpretations of the Catalan numbers will feature in what I'm going to talk about. So it's not just a survey of, but yeah, if any of these are under here, please stop me now and I'll explain further. Of course, there's a famous product formula for the Catalan numbers in terms of binomial coefficients. So we like beautiful formulas like this. Okay. Okay, so this is a workshop on lattice theory, so let me mention that there are at least three important lattices on Panaman objects, which come from the different interpretations that I've outlined here. We've already seen at least two of these. So the first one is Creveras' lattice of non-crossing partitions. These are the non-crossing partitions just ordered by refinement. By refinement, so subset of the usual partition lattice. There's, so I'm giving, I'm sort of attaching a name to each of these different lattices. So this one I don't think we have seen yet, and it's maybe the most naive order on Catalan objects, which is just take all the dick paths and order them by sort of containment or nesting, you know, if one path always stays below the other. And I'm calling this Stanley's lattice, which is something. I'm calling this Stanley's lattice, which is sometimes the name given to it because of work that Richard Stanley did related to this. And it's a distributive lattice. Again, I'll talk more about it in a little bit. And then, of course, the last one and the one that maybe has made the most appearance so far at the workshop is the Tamari lattice, which I guess there are many ways to kind of realize the Tamari lattice. I'm viewing the elements here as triangulations. The elements here as triangulations, and the cover relations between them are defined in terms of flips. Again, I'm not kind of writing down the definitions of any of these, but hopefully the examples make the order clear. We'll probably see more perspectives on the Tamari lattice. For example, you know, its Haasa diagram is the one skeleton of the Ososihudra and so on. Okay, but for me, I'm just interested in the interested in the kind of order theory, the OSET structure of these. And we can already see that for n equals three, there are three, you know, these three lattices are all different from one another, although they have five elements. The really interesting thing is that each of these lattices, in a sense, gives rise to dynamics on the Catalan objects. And what we will see in just a moment is that the dynamics are See, in just a moment, is that the dynamics are the same, in a sense, for all three of the lattices. So, even though the definitions of the dynamics coming from each is different, what we get in the end is, in a sense, the same for each of them. Okay, so let me start with the non-crossing partition lattice. So the lattice of non-crossing partitions is complemented. That means every element has a complement. So, a complement is a complement of an element, pi, is an element which An element which meets with pi to the bottom element and joins to the top. And the Creverus complement, which was defined by Crevorus, is one particular choice of a complement for each non-crossing partition. And again, I'm not kind of defining things formally here, but just sort of giving you a definition by example. So let's say we want to define the Kerbores complement of our non-crossing partition pi depicted here. I think I stole this image off of. I think I stole this image off of some paper, by the way. So maybe Brendan wrote this paper. I don't know. Anyways, I hope they don't mind. There's some other images I've taken from other papers. Okay. Is that a valid citation at the level of check GPU or something like that? Okay. So we start with one non-crossing partition here, pi, and we want to find its complement. What we do is so the numbers 1 through n are. So, the numbers 1 through n are arranged in clockwise order already around our circle, and we insert in between each of these numbers a new number that's primed. So, sort of 1 prime falls between 1 and 2, 2 prime falls between 2 and 3, and so on. And then we draw another non-crossing partition, but this one on the primed numbers, which has the property that it's kind of maximal, it has the most things joined together, subject to the condition that it doesn't cross the block. It doesn't cross the blocks of the original partition. So in this picture, we're sort of showing both pi and pi prime at once. And then pi prime is just, you know, when we forget about the original pi, we now have a non-crossing partition, again, on the same numbers, one up to seven. And you can check that it really is a complement in this sense of joining to the top and meeting to the bottom. Okay, questions about the Okay, questions about the Kriverose complement, its definition. So if you think about complements for some very basic kinds of lattices like the Boolean lattice, you take the complement of a complement and you get back the original thing. That's not true for the Creverus complement, though. If you think about it for a minute, you can see that if I do this procedure twice, because I made this choice to sort of put one prime here to the right of one, that has to be a good thing. Right of one, that has an effect of when I square this map of progress complementation, I get not the identity, but a rotation, a clockwise, or I think actually counterclockwise rotation by one notch, so 2 pi over n radians. And that means that in particular, Crevores complement itself has order 2 times n, because rotation has order n, so this has order 2 times n. So, this has order 2 times n it's square in this rotation. In fact, the entire orbit structure of Grevas complement can be described because the natural Q analog of the Catalan numbers is a cyclic seving polynomial for this action. So it has a very regular orbit structure and has a nice small order. In fact, it's the same as rotation of non-crossing matchings of the numbers 1 up to 10. So that's another way to do it. So, that's another way to do it. Okay, so this is our first dynamics. And for me, dynamics is not going to be, it's just going to mean an invertible operator acting on a finite set, which is maybe the most boring kind of, you know, if I told somebody who thinks of themselves as studying dynamical systems that I'm studying invertible operators on a finite set, they might think, well, that's not dynamics at all, but we'll see that there's some interesting things that can be seen. So, the second dynamics that I want to define and talk about comes from the Stanley lattice of DIC paths. So, remember, this is a distributive lattice. So, I'm going to define something called row motion, which is defined, it acts on any finite distributive lattice. Okay, so let's recall that every finite distributive lattice can be represented as the collection of order ideals of a finite posset P. ideals of a finite poset p ordered by containment. And what does row motion do? So here I've depicted row motion. Okay, so my poset in this picture is this triangular poset, and I'm shading the elements in black are the elements in my order ideal. And row motion is going to look at the complement of my order ideal. So order ideal is a downward closed set. Ideal is a downward closed set. The complement is something that's upward closed, a filter, and it'll have some minimal elements. Those minimal elements will form an anti-chain, and then I can take the order ideal generated by those minimal elements, and that will produce another order ideal, which is I prime, and that's the result of applying row motion to my order ideal. It turns out that this is an invertible operator. Operator, you can, each, it's sort of made up of three parts, and each one of those parts is a bijection. So overall, it's a bijection from the set of order ideals to itself. Okay, there's a paper of Cameron and Fonderflas where they show how to, they give kind of a different description of row motion in terms of toggles, which are local involutions. Toggles, which are local involutions defined on the order ideals that either add or remove an element when possible. And from that description, it's also very easy to see that this is a bijection. The name row motion was coined by Jessica Streicher and Nathan Williams in their famous paper on row motion and promotion, which kind of generated a lot of interest in this area of dynamical algorithm combinatorics. And it's called row motion because in that description, which I'm not telling you. That description, which I'm not telling you, in terms of toggles, you kind of act row by row. But this is the name now that has anyway stuck. And so, yeah, so this is row motion. And for just an arbitrary finite postet P and its collection of order ideals, Romotion behaves kind of chaotically. We can't say too much about the expected structure of, for example, the orbit structure or the order or anything for a random post-set. For a random postet. But, okay, in the case of the Stanley lattice, we have some very nice behavior. So first of all, let me explain, again, just kind of by example, that dick paths correspond to order ideals in this triangular postet that I'm drawing here, where you have to be careful to sort of get the height, you know, to place the x-axis in the right place, but basically the dick path. This is in the right place, but basically the dig path cuts off the order ideal. So the elements below are in the order ideal and the elements above are not. And it's a theorem of, and of course, you know, containment of nesting of dick paths corresponds to containment of the corresponding order ideals, which shows how that Stanley lattice is a lattice of order ideals. And there's this very nice result of Armstrong, Stung, and Thomas, which says that, well, the Crevoras complement. The crevorous complement action on non-crossing partitions and the row motion action on dick paths are really the same in the sense that there's a bijection from dick paths to non-crossing partitions, which transports row motion to periverous complement. So let me, okay, so I drew a very small example here. So this over here is row motion of dick paths. Dick paths. There's one orbit of size three, so you can kind of convince yourself that this is the minimal element. It's sent by rub motion to this, and then it's sent to the maximal element, and then it loops back. And there's one orbit of size two, and it's those two things that flip back and forth under real motion. Under Crevorus complement, again, there's one orbit of size two and one orbit of size three. And so that's kind of And so that's kind of the content of this result of Armstrong, Stimpen, and Thomas, which is saying that the orbit structures are the same. In particular, there's a bijection which they describe that, you know. I think maybe Nathan had the term bijection for this, where you have a bijection that respects an action on both sides. Okay, I don't know if that one cut on the same way that Roman should cut it. Can't all be winners. Okay, but that's what's going on here. Let me just say that, you know. Okay, but that's what's going on here. Let me just say that I'm not going to tell you what this bijection is. It's not completely trivial. In the Stryker and Williams paper, they describe maybe a way of thinking about it in terms of the relationship between promotion and row motion, which is nice. And let me also mention that in a recent paper of Ben Adenbaum and Sergei Elizaldi, they show maybe my favorite way of thinking about this AST bijection, which is that it's really a special. Bijection, which is that it's really a special case of the Robinson-Schenstead-Knuth correspondence in the case of 3-to-1 avoiding permutations. And again, I can explain more about what that means, but I just mentioned that here to tell you that there must be something a little bit non-truthful going on if it's sort of equivalent to RSK, at least in a special case. You have a question? If this is taking us too far, we'll won't answer it. But is there any significance to the decomposition of the Catalan number into 2 plus 3 or any 4? 2 plus 3 or 84 plus whatever the general answer is, is that going to be something? Well, in a way I hinted at that because to say that the Q Catalan number is a cyclic sieving polynomial for this action means that the entire orbit structure is in some way encoded in that Q analog, which the Q analog I'm talking about is just take the product formula and Q apply every term. And so that means it's an extremely compact way of writing down the entire orbit structure. Now, the exact. Structure. Now, the exact you have to do a little bit of something to extract the composition that you're talking about, but it's there. So, maybe that's the best answer I can give. No questions? Okay, so that's two of the three lattices, and they have the same dynamics. And then, more recent work of Emily Barnard, but maybe building on Nathan Reading, explained how any Explained how any semi-distributive lattice L has a way of defining row motion on that semi-distributive lattice L. And what is the row motion for a semi-distributive lattice? Well, I think this was mentioned already maybe by Thomas, that semi-distributive lattices have labelings of their edges by join irreducible elements. If I have one thing, if I have, let's say, one thing. One thing covered by another, then I label that edge by, I hope I got this right, the minimal joint irreducible that I need to join this with to get that. So here, for example, that would be B. Okay, and then this is a really nice labeling of these edges because the following things are true. Every element is determined by its set of down labels. So if I just tell you the down labels are B and C, there's only one thing that that's true for, it's E. One thing that that's true for, it's E. It's also determined by its set of up labels. The only thing with B and C as its set of up labels is A. And moreover, the set of up labels and the set of down labels are the same, which then gives rise to a bijection from the elements of the lattice to itself, where I send each element with a given set of up labels to the unique element with that set of down labels. So, for example, A has up labels B and C, so it's set to E. And then here, you know, B has. Here, you know, B has D as its up label, then D has D as its down label, and then D has C as its up label, and C has C as its down label, and C has B as its up label, and B has B as its down label, so that's an orbit of size 3 here. I think it's checking out. And so, Emily also showed that for the total. That for the Tomari lattice, what we get, again, is nothing other than Creverus complement, at least in the sense that, again, it's equivalent. The orbit structure is the same. There's a bijection, there's a way of viewing the elements so that they're non-crossing partitions, and then the action is crevarous complement. Questions about that? Let me mention also the work of Hugh Thomas and Nathan Williams, which expressed the tomorrow. Express the Tamari lattice row motion via, again, these kind of local involutions, toggles. I think it's not the case that every semi-distributive lattice row motion can be described using toggles, but because the Tamari lattice has some other nice properties, maybe it's trim or something like that, then we do have a toggle description in this case. Yeah, that's their paper, Roll Motion to Row Motion, which is another pretty good name. Make sense. So if you want me to give you a grade on every pun you've done. Every pun you've done, I'd be happy to do that. Okay, so that was the first part just about dynamics. Maybe I should actually keep going at a reasonable pace. In section two, we're going to switch gears, and we're just going to talk about plain trees and some statistics on plain trees. And, okay, so if we count plain trees according to their number of leaves, we get a nice refinement of the Catalan numbers, which are called the number. Refinement of the Catalan numbers, which are called the Narayana numbers. So the K and Narayana number, NK, is the number of plane trees on n plus 1 nodes with K leaves. So N3, 1 is 1 because there's one plane tree on four nodes that has exactly one leaf. So a leaf is a terminal child, right? A vertex which has no children. And again, I'm drawing my roots at the bottom, so the trees are growing up. So these three trees have two leaves, and they contribute to the Leaves and they contribute to the count for n32 equals 3. Okay, the Narayana numbers, just like the Catalan numbers, are very classical, and there's an explicit formula for them in terms of binomial coefficients, parts of binomial coefficients. And from this explicit formula, which can be proved in many ways, for example, like inclusion-exclusion, I think, maybe like a Lindstrom-Gesselviano-type argument. I don't know. There's a lot of ways to arrive at this formula for the Nariano numbers, but one thing you notice from them, which is maybe not. But one thing you notice from them, which is maybe not completely obvious, is that n k is equal to n n n plus 1 minus k. So that the numbers are symmetric. In other words, I mean, it's kind of trivial. I mean, it's not so interesting in this case, but 1, 3, 1, that sequence is polyndromic, right? And that's true for the Narayan numbers in general. Okay, so that's kind of interesting. Let me mention that. Let me mention that the way I describe it here is in terms of plane trees, but we can also use dick paths equivalently. So there's a well-known bijection from plane trees to dick paths where I kind of just traverse the exterior of my plane tree, say, you know, going, I don't know, clockwise around the plane tree from the root. And every time I walk away from the root, I take an upstep. Every time I walk towards the root, I take a downstep. Under this bijection, Under this bijection, the leaves of the plain tree correspond to the peaks of the dick path, the places where I go up and then down immediately. So equivalently, the Narayana numbers count the number of dick paths with a given number of peaks. But the question is, why is the peak statistic on dick paths symmetrically distributed? I mean, the fact that the number of dick paths with sort of the maximal number of With sort of, you know, the maximal number of peaks is one, and it's also the number with only one peak, and so on, for all the possible numbers of peaks. Well, I mean, one way to kind of explain combinatorially this symmetry is to define an involution on the set of dig paths which exhibits the symmetry in the sense that it sends a dig path with k peaks to one with n plus one. peaks to one with n plus one minus k peaks. And the Lalangel Prevores involution is an involution on the set of dictators which does this. Again, I'm not kind of writing in words the description of this procedure, but let me kind of show and explain this picture. So I draw my original dict path here in blue, and then at every double upstep, the junction between a double upstep, I draw a A dashed line emanating, you know, at sort of 45 degrees downwards. And at every double downstep, I draw a dashed line meeting at the junction going 45 degrees that way, I guess southwest. And it turns out that these dashed lines will meet, and where they meet is the locations of Locations of the valleys of a mirror image dick path in a unique way. So there's a unique way to draw a mirror image dick path whose valleys are exactly at the locations where those dashed lines meet. And that kind of pairs up the places where there are not valleys with places where there are valleys in the image. Yeah, question. How do I know which dash pile is supposed to fair with which dash pile? Yeah, that's a good question. It's just the first one is fair. The first one is paired with this, you know, I think you just do it in kind of a stack where you, you know, first in, first out, or something like that. Yeah, I don't know. I'm sorry, I have a better description of it written somewhere, but the ETH dash in that direction means the ETH dash in the other direction. Yes, that's right. Yeah, it's just it's actually yeah, yeah, exactly. First means first, second means there's n it's not even that complicated, you know, yeah, exactly. It's not even that complicated, you know. Yeah, exactly. Just like a second. Okay, so again, I'm not focusing too much on the definition here, but I'm just saying there is a reasonably natural involution you can define on the set of dick paths, which exhibits the symmetry of the Narayana numbers in this way. Panyushev, in his study of anti-chance of root posets, kind of independently came up with this involution and also explained the connection that it's kind of related to row motion. Kind of related to row motion. And then in some work with Mike Joseph, we kind of further developed this. We showed a way to write this involution as a product of toggles, for example, just like rotomotion can be written as a product of toggles. And we did some extensions to piecewise linear and birational realm. But okay, anyways, so it's an interesting evolution, which maybe I should mention. Okay, so here's the main connection to row motion. So, the Le Man Carvares evolution conjugates row motion to its inverse. So, in other words, they kind of form a dihedral group action together. So, like if you think of row motion as rotation, you should think of this involution as a flip. So, that's a dihedral action. Okay. Continuing. So, it follows So, it follows immediately from the fact that the Narayana numbers are symmetric that the average number of leaves among plain trees with n plus 1 nodes is n plus 1 over 2. Because if I pair each dick path with, say, its image under the little on Cripper S involution, the sum of those number of peaks is n plus 1, and so on average, the number is n plus 1 over 2, which this is a nice average fact. A nice average fact. Here's another interesting statistical average. Among all plain trees on n plus 1 nodes, the average number of leaves at height 1 is 1. Okay, so I have a picture of this average here. So a leaf at height 1 means a leaf which is a child of the root. So this tree, for example, has three leaves at height 1. This one has 1. This one has 1. And these have none. So the average will be 0 plus 0 plus 1 plus 1. The average will be 0 plus 0 plus 1 plus 1 plus 3 divided by 5 is 1. And you get that same number 1 as the average, whatever n for your Catalan number is. And I learned about these least statistic averages from Lou Shapiro, who's an emeritus professor at Howard, my institution. And he showed me that it's not too hard to prove them, for example, using generating function arguments. Plain trees behave very well with generating functions, and you can attach all kinds of statistics to them. And yeah, so. To them, and yeah, so these are nice problems. In fact, I think they might have both been like problems in the mathematically or something to show this and to give nice proof. But the question is, can we explain this average, average number of leaves at height one, in a way similar to how we explained the average number of leaves being n plus one over two combinatorially using the Lalan curve verast. Now, the thing to notice is that, you know, this. Now, the thing to notice is that this statistic is no longer symmetrically distributed in any way, so we can't just do it exactly the same way. But the point that I, okay, so now where I'm going to connect back to the first part of the talk is by saying that sort of dynamics will help us explain this average. Questions? Okay, so how is dynamics going to help us explain statistical averages? Well, this is the homomissy paradigm of Jim Proff and others. Others. So, what is homo messing? Maybe you've heard this term before, but let me define it for you. So, here's kind of the definition. So, let's let x be some collection of combinatorial objects. Let's let phi be an invertible operator acting on that set of objects. And let f be some statistic on that set, like number of leaves or number of leaves at height one. We say that the statistic f is homomesic. The statistic f is homomessic with respect to the action of phi on x if every phi orbit has the same f average. So if I look at any phi orbit and I look at the average value of my statistic f on that orbit, it's the same number independent of which orbit I chose. So just as a check, let's think about what this means in the case when the invertible operator phi is an involution. So if phi Is an involution. So if phi is an involution, then to say that the average is the same for every orbit is just to say that f of x plus f of phi of x has to equal some constant for every element x in my set. Because x and phi of x together form an orbit. Maybe they're the same, maybe it's a fixed point, but that doesn't matter. All of those orbits have to have the same. Those orbits have to have the same sum. And so this is saying exactly that phi combinatorially demonstrates the symmetry of the statistic f, if phi is an involution. Let me give you some more examples. For example, if x is the collection of binary strings with a0's and b1s, and phi is just the rotation map, then the statistic f, which is the first letter of the string, either 0 or 1, is going to be homomesic with respect to the action. With respect to the action, with average b over a plus one. So, on average, no matter what orbit of rotation I'm looking at for binary strings, you know, I have b over a plus b of those are going to, you know, a b over a plus b chance of seeing a one in the first position, just because it's symmetric under rotation. And so, the homo messy paradigm was introduced by Jim Propp and Tom Ruby, and has since been explored throughout. Explored throughout algebraic combinatorics. So, let me talk about some row motion homomesses. So, Pam Yushev conjectured, and Armstrong, Stump, Ben Thomas proved, that the anti-chain cardinality statistic is homo messic for row motion acting on the order ideals of the triangle poset. We can rephrase this in terms of sort of dick paths and their peaks by saying that the number of peaks statistic is homogeneous with respect to the action of row motion. With respect to the action of row motion on dick paths of length n with the average that we mentioned, n plus 1 over 2. So here are the two orbits of row motion acting on dick paths that we saw before. And, you know, these two, which form an orbit, have two peaks. And so on average, they have two peaks. And here we have three peaks, two peaks, one peak. On average, this orbit has two peaks. Is it clear what the homomessy means? Is it clear what homomessy means in this case? So notice that proving homomessy is a lot, you know, stronger than saying just the average is n plus one over two. It's saying that we can partition into many orders. At least, you know, if phi is an operator which has a small order, then this is a kind of a stronger result. And again, it says that the statistic is distributed nicely in some way. By interpreting GICPAS as 3-to-1 avoiding permutations, where the number of peaks at height one statistic becomes the number of fixed points, Anbaum and El Zalde. And Baum and El Zalde proved another nice homomessy result for row motion, which is that the number of peaks at height one statistic is also homomessic with respect to the action of row motion on dick paths of length 2n with average 1. So let's see that again in action. How many peaks at height 1 does this dick path have? 1, right, just this one. And same for this. So on average here, we have one peak at height 1. One peak at height one. And here we have three peaks at height one, zero peaks at height one, and zero peaks at height one. So in this orbit as well, we have on average one peak at height one. And that's true for every row motion orbit of dick paths. Okay, any other questions? So again, maybe there's this nice way of viewing dick paths as 3 to 1 avoiding permutations, and then the number of peak statistic is the number of fixed points, so that's another way of looking at it. And yes. Way of looking at it, and yes. So if you have k valleys, I'm sorry, if you have k peaks, you have k minus 1 valleys. If you think about it, there has to be a valley between every peak, so it's very, yeah, it's easily translated. Oh, at height one, you're saying. I don't know. That I'm less sure about. You have to be a little careful. But okay, you can often convert from peaks to values though. Okay, so the Fuser. So, what I want to propose as a problem is, of course, a generalization of what I've talked about so far. And there have been many generalizations that have been studied. Without going into details, let me mention that things that people have looked at a lot are other types. So in the context of Coxeter, Catalan, combinatorics, all of this stuff with Catalan numbers can be generalized to W-Catalan numbers, where W is some finite Coxeter group. And that has been explored a lot. In fact, all of the work that I mentioned, a lot of the work that I mentioned. The work that I mentioned was in that more general setting. I didn't, you know, I'm strong and Thomas Paper was about arbitrary root systems. Another generalization is to higher realms, piecewise linear, birational, and so on. Those are buzzwords that, like, again, Jim Prop and a lot of other people have worked on a lot. I'm not going to mention those at all. The generalization I'm talking about is different than either of those. So that's all I want to mention. And in fact, it's what I'll call a FOS extension. Okay, so what are the Foos Catalan numbers that give The Fus Catalan numbers that give the name to the talk. So you can just, okay, so we have one integer parameter mn, which is like the index of our Catalan number. Now we introduce another integer parameter, m. And then with respect to these two, we can define the Fuss-Catalan number Cmn to be this thing in terms of binomial coefficients. Not obvious at all that this is an integer, but I guess one thing to check is in the case m equals 1, this does reduce to the usual Catalan number. Does reduce to the usual Catalan number, although maybe not written in exactly the same way that I had before. But it's true that just like the Catalan number counts many things, the Fus-Catalan number counts many things. It's an integer that has a lot of combinatorial interpretations. For example, Cmn is the number of M plus 2 angulations of an Mn plus 2 gon. So just like the Catalan number counts triangulations, the Fuss-Catalan number counts quadrangulations, pentangulations, and so on. Pentangulations, and so on. So, this is the case m equals 2, n equals 3. We're counting quadrangulations of, I think, an octagon. Yes. Yeah. Okay, and I again stole this picture from somewhere. So, citation missing. But there are 12 of them, and you can check that this formula works. Okay, so this is not a standard term, but let me use the term m plane tree to mean a plane tree all of who To mean a plain tree all of whose nodes have a multiple of m children. So here, m is equal to 2, and what I want is that every node has an even number of children. So this node has 6 children. You can have 0 children, of course, via leaf. You can have any multiple. So it's not like M Airy, right? That would be like having M or 0. This is just a multiple of M. Okay, and again, there's an interpretation of the Fus-Catalan numbers in terms of M-plane trees. The number of M. In terms of M plane trees, the number of M plane trees on Mn plus one nodes is the Fuscatland number C Mn. And here I'm showing there are 12, you know, two plane trees on seven nodes. I didn't repeat, you know, there's four that are isomorphic to this, there's two that are isomorphic to this, and four that are isomorphic to that. Okay, and the same generating function arguments that established the averages I was mentioning before can also be used to prove some nice statistical Can also be used to prove some nice statistical averages for these M-plane trees. Because there's, yeah, they behave, you know, generating function is not too hard to write down for these. So, for example, among m-plane trees with mn plus 1 nodes, the average number of leaves is given by this formula, m over m plus 1 times mn plus 1. You can check in the case when m is 1, this reduces to 1 half n plus 1, which is what we had before. And this is just a check in the case of m equals. Check in the case of m equals 2 and n equals 3 that that average really is 14 over 3. And maybe for number of leaves at height 1, we get an even nicer thing, which is just that the average is always m, independent of n. So just like we had 1 as the average every time, now the average is just m. So here, the average number of leaves at height 1 is 2. Okay. Again, proof by example. Questions about the meaning of these? Questions about the meaning of these statistics? Okay, good. Again, so it's, you know, exercise to prove by generating functions. But I want a proof that's kind of along the lines of what I talked about before. So here's the proposed problem, which is to extend the DIC path row motion human messes to the spoos-Catalan setting. So in other words, define a natural operator acting on m plane trees with mn plus one nodes, for which both of these statistics, the number of leaves and the number Statistics, the number of leaves and the number of leaves at height once are homomessic. Again, if we just talk about any operator at all, well, that's kind of boring because we could put them all in one orbit together and that would be trivial, right? So we want a natural operator. So in particular, what we could ask for is one that has a small predictable order. And for reasons that are, I could explain, the best order we could hope for is basically this one, m plus 1 times n. 1 times n. If you want to see why that is, it's because there's an n plus 1 in the denominator here, so we have to have that appearing somewhere. And the n can also be explained similarly. Okay, and in fact, I have a guess as to what this should be. So there's something called the M. Tamari lattice, which I think some of you have looked up. And it's a semi-distributive lattice again, and it has Fus-Catalan number many elements. They can be described in different ways. They can be described in different ways. These are sort of sequences of numbers subject to some condition, but you could also talk about dick paths of certain kinds or m angulations or whatever. And Thomas M. Williams conjectured, and Colin Defont and James Lynn proved that the M to Mari lattice, well, because it's semi-distributive, it has an action of row motion the way that I described coming from that edge labeling. And the row motion action has a really And the row motion action has a really nice order. Its order is m plus one times n, which is what I said we should expect for those homomessy results. So it's very likely that this is the right operator for our problem. And then the problem is just to kind of find the correct bijection to these m plane trees and explain why the homomessy happens for this m-tamari romotion. Okay, I should stop here. I think that was a warning. So thank you very much. What other questions for Sam? Good question for me, someone missing from the picture, is a dual-product manoeuvre. Because actually, I think the way you extend the prototype is you find something in the dual-produ manoid corresponding to one of your objects, and the brain manoeuvre exists. And the brain monoid exists in the whole time, so then you get maybe the way you expand the dual-brain monoid. Yeah. You mean like to get the non-crossing partition lattice as an interval in the dual brain monoid? Further than the numbers, the number of symbols of a given length, the brain monoid. I mean the crevass in pollution, which has a complement to the gaffer element. The Yeah, maybe I. Commercial is just a conjugation by the catheter element. So once you interpret something as something happening in the brain manual, it's kind of obvious how to extend to the path about. Okay, yeah, yeah, that's a good point. I think I should have mentioned this as well. So the Nariyana numbers, they count dick paths by number of peaks, but they also count, they give the rank, the ranks of the non-crossing cognition lattice. So 1, 3, 1, we see here. And in that sense, the curved rust complement also proves the symmetry of the non-crossing. Proves the symmetry of the Narayana numbers. But I think there's kind of two worlds, right? There's the non-crossing world and the non-nesting world. Maybe I got them backwards. And, you know, the interpretation I'm talking about is like anti-chains in the root postet by cardinality. That's more of a non-nesting world phenomenon. So it has a somewhat different flavor. I agree that if we interpret it, you know, things in this non-crossing world, maybe it's. In this non-crossing world, maybe it's smoother to go to other types, but it's just, yeah. So it's a slightly different problem, I think. I don't know. Did that address maybe, I will look at the brave monetary. It's a good idea. Yeah. The dual brave monetary. This isn't a precise question, but it's striking to me how this Bogosh operation on semi-distributive parallelism. Operation on semi-distributive lattices, and low-list operation on distributive lattices, are defined in ways that sound really similar. Oh, I should have mentioned this. If we specialize to a distributive lattice, the semi-distributive lattice remotion is, I mean, it is the remote. Okay, maybe I should just think through that first. So, the way to think of it is the things that I can toggle into my order ideal are the things that I can toggle out here, and those are the up and the down. Toggle out here, and those are the up and the down labels. So it's really, it's not a deep observation or anything, it's straightforward if you think about the labeling. But I should have said that, sorry. Just a question about the vertical, because that's familiar. Maybe in the next slide. How do we get from the completely filled in triangular postet to the first one in its orbit of three? Good, yeah. So, um Okay, so to define row motion of the full order ideal, I take the complement, which is nothing. I look at the minimal elements, that's nothing. And I look at the order ideal they generate, and that's still nothing. And so that goes to nothing. So that's, is that explaining what? Or you're talking about in terms of DIC paths? Yeah. Yeah. So the dig paths would be. So the dig paths would be, this is the dig path that goes up to the drive directly. It should have three steps. Sorry. But I think you just extended it out further. Yeah, so it's a little. Okay, I'm doing a bad job drawing it, but this one is the one that's all the way, and this one is, you know, up, down, up, down. Up, down. Okay. Does that make sense? Yes. Yeah. I actually have trouble myself. Yeah. I actually have trouble myself with, even though this should be an easy translation of drawing the dick path on the order ideals. So I usually just stick to the order ideals. The land privas and pollution, it sounded like we had non-nesting partitions. So if we drawings of the the the the same dashed lines for the red uh For the red uh the red path, we have another non-nesting partition. Um so uh is this like the equivalent of the Crevalas complement for the non-processing partition, but only non-nesting partitions translated on fashions? Well, something I should say is that, I mean, this is an involution. I didn't, I should have emphasized that. So if I do the same from the red and I draw dashed lines, what I will get is the blue, and that's like maybe a somewhat non-trivial click. Maybe a somewhat non-trivial claim. And so I would say it's not really the same as Privorus, because Preveras squared is rotation and this is identity squared, so it's kind of different. But my final point is that for non-crossing partitions, there is a way to draw some arcs that well for non-nesting, but you don't draw all arcs. And then the number of arcs of the top element. On the top element and the number of arcs on the bottom, sum to n or n minus 1. And here is just the same thing happens. The number of dashed lines corresponding to the blue and the number of dashed lines corresponding to red is sum up to Okay, maybe I don't understand the the n non nesting partition non-nesting matchings that you're talking about, or not nesting matches. Or not necessarily. And so I was wondering if that's related to this information again. But do I want to say? There's something, yeah, we looked, there's a I think something like, yeah, I can point out a paper where we can talk about something that goes with the so just like okay, maybe the way to say it is like this, just like there's something which which Which conjugates grow motion to its inverse, there's something which conjugates Pervarus to its inverse and is an involution on the non-non-necess, I mean, the non-crossing world. We called it the flip map. It can be defined in terms of like C and omega and W naught and okay, so but I can't remember the exact details, but I think there is something along those lines. Maybe better than those, but yeah, I can uh so one way that you can I think what this is if you're So one way that you could kind of think about this is if you're viewing this as like a non-crossing matching, what you were, I suppose this would be not great compared to like a non-crossing matching of human things. If I believe what you were describing was corresponding to sort of like a reflection across that non-crossing matching. And what Rovacuation is doing is it's sort of it's a reflection across a non-crossing matching, but there's a shift of like one term basically. Bottom cover else and we should say that I think. I just wanted to say that I think credits that involution on the non-crossing side is really good to me. Okay, great. Yeah, and I don't, does it have a name that you would give it? Simeon involution? Okay, then that's a good name for it. Great. I'm just wondering if Nathan Williams gets a chance to grade the button in your title. I was hoping for something like that. I get to turn off the recording. I do have a question. So I have one question from Montcalm. And namely, so the first one is related to Thomas McCamer's talk, actually. So you gave three families of Catalan objects. And so Canari is Mari, standardis, the glattis of Iqbal and glattis on unpassing partitions. So the first question is, and then you show that the raw motion of these three different families is the same. So the first question for me is, so there is a way to go from the Tamari lattice to non-crossing partitions lattice. Partitions in lattice and taking the correlated order. My question is: if the raw motion of the tramarilla is transported by this
