The first speaker of this morning is Lynn Mosa. She's going to talk about two limit and two terminal objects are two different. Thank you. Okay, so thank you for the opportunity to speak and also for the invitation. I'm really glad I could be here and know more about this field. So as you might be able to tell from my title, I'm less of a fusion category theorist and more just a category theorist. And so I will start my talk with a disclaimer. My talk with a disclaimer, my categories will not necessarily be there. So, today I want to talk about joint work with Kingman, and let me start with some motivation. So, as we probably all agree, universal properties are really important in mathematics to make many constructions. And a large part of this universal construction comes from that of a limit. Comes from that of a limit. And so this is what I'm going to focus on in my talk today. So first let me remind you what's a limit in one category. So a limit of a functor from I to C is a pair and lambda of an object. Adding C and others that for all other objects in C, there is an induce map, radius pull, which goes from the set of morphisms from X to L to the set of cones which submit X over F. And we ask that this is an isomorphism of categories. Of categories of sets, free. And so, what does this map do? So, it takes a morphism in C and then it maps it to this morphism followed by the limit cone, right? Sorry, cone means representable functions or no a con is a natural transformation from the constant from the. Transformation from the constant functor to f. Yes, sorry. Okay, and so delta x for me is just a constant. And so what does this tell us? It tells us that for every cone of a f, there is a unique f such that this cone is equal to that composite, right? Okay, so but now this is a first definition, but maybe it's not a convenient one. And for example, sometimes categorical structures can be weaker. So sometimes C is not straight. So for example, it could be an infinity one category and then And then this definition is not super convenient to make because it's really hard to define what this map is doing because composition is only defined up to a homotopy and then all the coherences are hard to encode. And so we would like another characterization of limits that we can import to that higher setting. And so for this there is a theorem which says that a limit of f is equivalently A terminal object in the category of tunes over F. And so let me remind you what this category is. So this category has objects Has objects, pair of an object in C together with a p. And then the morphisms from x kappa to y mu are going to be the morphisms in C from x to y such that the following diagram commutes. Okay, but now also in some cases limits are more structured, right? So for example you might have heard the terms weighted limits or co-limits or lax limits or lax co-limits. And so these are all two categorical limits. And so what we are interested in So, what we are interested in this tool is first to define two categorical limits, but this was already done by experts in the field, and then trying to understand how such a statement could also hold for two categorical limits in order to be, for example, able to also impart this to the infinity setting and maybe get something like infinity two limits. And so, let me give you some examples of the categorical limits. So, for example, if I start with a functor from C cat, then I can compute its rotonic construction, and this is the Laxco limit of that functor. So, the rotonic construction of F is its last quadratic. Another one is if I start with a two monad, then the category of algebras of that monad can be computed as the lux limit of the association. Of the associated functor from the three two monads to monad. Sorry, the two categories, three on the monad to two categories. Does every funder between categories have a limit? Sorry? Does every funder between two categories have a limit? No. I mean, if your target category is too complete, yes. Okay. Okay, so. Do you have a notion of taking the closure of a category by someone using this notion? So let me start by defining what two limits are. So first a question is what is a two category? So two category is simply Category enriching categories. And so we have objects and then we have home categories between any two objects. And so in these home categories we have both objects and morphisms which are called morphisms and two morphisms. And two more reasons. And so in particular, my two categories, they have strictly unital and associative compositions, but I believe that all the results I will present today should also hold in the weaker setting of by categories. And so then we can define two limits. Find two limits. So two limits of a two functor is a before a pair and lambda with L an object in C and a lambda a cone. Maybe this cone has is a two natural transformation now, uh such that for all objects X and C, For all objects X and C. So we have this simap from morphisms from X to L to cones with summit X over F. But now this is a category, not a set anymore. And similarly, the points, they also form a category. So now this is a map of categories. And so we can ask this to be an ideal of categories. Sorry? Not the green ones, of course. I will get to it in a bit. So there are some notions that you could make. This is the stricter one. Yes. Also, yeah, your category is strict. Yes, yes. But I think you could also do it for by categories, but it's just more annoying to do, so we can feel it constraints. Yeah. So, so, okay, so let me. So we have. So we have this map, which takes us before a map to the composite with the pole. But now we also have an assignment on morphism which takes a two-cell to the whiskering of that two-cell with the limit code. And so, because we have an isomorphism category, it's an isomorphism on objects and on morphism. So, this tells us that for every cone, there is a unique morphism such that that cone is equal to that composite. And then, also a second one, which tells you that for every morphisms of cones, there is a unique two-cell such that Such that this morphism of cone is equal to this was carrying. And I will call this maybe univ1 and univ2 because we have two different units of property. And now to answer your question from before, there are variations on this notion of limits that we can do. So one of them is like, is that visible? So, for example, you could talk of a by limit, and here you could replace this by an equivalence of categories instead. Or you could also do lax limit, and this would require us to ask that the cones are lax natural transformations, and something like this. And you could do lax bi limits by doing mischief. My limits by doing mischief Is there a similar property for two limits like this? Like the the one control limits? Yes, um this is small as the one limit universal property, right? One limit universal property, right? And then you get to separate one. And I wanted to give an example of the two limits. And let's do the C plus one, the two categorical products. So first we have first universal property, which tells you that every time I have maps from A to X and A to Y, then I get a unique map into the product. A unique map into the product, right? But then now we also have a second unusual property which tells you that every time I have a two-cell from A to X and a two cell from A to Y, then I get a unique two cell from A to the product. So there is more compatibility. More compatibility of the units of property than before. Okay. So now the question that I raised at the beginning of the talk is are two limits equivalently two telenial objects in a two-category of codes. And so let me first tell you a bit what these terms mean. So first an object in a two category is two terminals if the unique map for all objects, the unique map The unique map from the category of morphism from X to T to the terminal category is a nitrogen. And again, you can weaken this definition and talk of a bi-terminal object instead by asking this to be an equivalence. Okay. Okay, and then the two category of points is gonna have. Is gonna have the same objects as before. So objects will be a pair of an object X in C together with the point. And then the morphisms, I can also pick the same as before. So there would be the morphisms. So, there would be the morphism in C such that this is equal to this. And then I also have two morphisms and And so this will be the two cells in T such that again the whispering of that two cell with the cone at Y is equal to the cone at X. X. But now we already have a problem because if we look at the data of this category, we don't see any of these modifications between points. Because the only ones that we see are those which are the constant one. And so there's no way that we can retrieve the full inertial property of the two limit just looking at this two category. So it does not see the This morphism of the And so, in particular, so now if you want to compare two limits and two terminal objects in this two category, then uh we can see that a two limit will be a two terminal object, but then the converse uh does not hold. Does not hold. And so with Clay Klingman, we did some really small counterexamples showing that this was not the case. And then you could tell me, oh, but what if instead I looked at a lax version of that slice and maybe instead of just having this copytice triangle. That I had before, I fill it with a modification. So this would be a possibility. But now the problem is that actually it's even worse situation because if we compare two limits and two terminal outlets in that black slice, then actually none of the two directions are true. And so we also have counterexamples. And so we also have counterexamples for this. In your black slice there, is that modification convertible? No. You could do a third version of this, like by doing sudo instead version, and like ask this to be invertible. And then there's a pseudo. And then there's a similar story with bilimets being vitaminal in the pseudo dye, but not, the compass again does not hold, so it's not even a problem of sweetness. And then, I mean, we've lacked stuff like it won't be related at all. If you started instead of two categories and two functors, but with bi-categories and coding functors or whatever, would you expect something to be different? Because the reason I ask is just because since every bi-category is equivalent to a two category, but not every, even though you try to strictify both categories, not every single functor can be strictified to a strict two functor between those. Not without some kind of cofibrancy condition. So that's why I asked. No, I think it's all the same because. No, I think it's all the same. Because um so these statements are are homotopical, so like you could make them in a homotopy theory of two categories, and we know that homotopy theory of two categories is the same as by categories. So yeah, I would say the same story fails. And in particular, we have it for Infinity 2, which by category is a special case of. And so yeah, I think because of that it will also play. Anyone can see um okay so um how do we uh fix this? Um okay, maybe I w want to just give a proposition. Want to just give a proposition first. So there is a case where two limits and two terminal objects coincide, and it's when the category C has tensors by the working morphism. So the category which has two objects and a morphism. Then we actually have that two limits are the same thing as two terminal objects in this two categories. In this two category of quotes. And the same holds for bilimates. So if you do bilimet and biterminal in 2. Okay. And so now this is not the general case, but in particular it's the case of the cat two category of categories. So if you just want to compute a limit in the category of two categories, you just need the first universal property. You don't need the second one. You don't need the second one. And for the general scheme, what we can do is pass to a double categorical setting. It's you have a nodion like functors from one to C X Y is isomorphic to mass. To maps and see from x tens of one. So like you have an object that's worth it. And so let me tell you what's the double category. Sorry, I missed something. Are you saying that having tensors with ones that already gets you into the double category so? Or is this just two different? Or is this just two different terms? No, every tensor of rate one tells you that the first universal property implies the second one. Okay. And the preface is really. I don't know. Maybe I should just start. Like, so if you assume you have the first universal property, then you know that you have an isomorphism like this. On objects, and then you want an isomorphism on morphisms, and what you do is like you notice that your morphism are the same thing as quantum into CSL. And then this is isomorphic to objects like this. And then you can use the universal property on objects for this. Okay, so how much time I have left? How much time I have left? I will try to give the other characterization of limits. So, double category is a minimal category to take. So, in particular, in the double category, we have objects, morphisms. We have two types of morphisms between objects, which are called. Of morphisms between objects, which are called the horizontal and the vertical morphisms. And we depict them like this. And then we have also two dimensional cells, which are called squares, because they have two horizontal and two vertical abundants. And so in particular, every two categories can be seen as a double category. Can be seen as a double category where the vertical amorphisms are all trivial. And so now what we can do instead is characterize two limits as double terminal objects in a double category of tools. And so for this, let me tell you what's a double terminal object. So now we have again two different unions of property, double double terminal one. So for every object in the double category, there is a unique horizontal morphism. And then for every double corner, But ecomorphism in the double category, there is a unique square to the identity at the square. And then we can define a double category of code of two functions and let me call it uh Let me put it with the double error. And you will have the same objects as before. The horizontal morphism will be the same morphism as before, where the triangles commute. But now, as my vertical morphisms, I can have all the so first I need the summits to be. So first I need the summits to be the same, and this will exactly be this two-cell, these modifications of points that I was missing before. And then the squares will be from X will be the two cells from X to Y. From X to Y such that a certain diagram could use. And so now, if you upput what the first universal property in this double category tells you, you retrieve the first universal property here, and the second one will give you the second one. And so as a consequence, we have a theorem that tells us that two limits are the same thing as double terminal objects. Double seminal objects. And this is due to Grandi Simpari in the strict case. And with Twinklingman, we did a version for bilimits and pseudo functors. So two limit of f is the same thing as a double terminal object. In this data category, of course. And so again, there's a bilimit version, as I was saying. So you just need to plug in weaker notions everywhere. And then you need a pseudo version of the labs version. Sorry? Because they're also allapsed. Yeah, but like again, it won't be related to Again, it won't be related to two limits in the correct way. I mean, not in this sense, at least. Lax two limits are not yet in the sort of terminal in some double code. So I think if you take last, then there will be no relations between. Okay. For the same reason that the counterexamples before where I were beginning. And just some further results. So, the first thing is that with Slay Klingman, we actually did not focus on bi limits, but actually we did more general biorepresentability. And so we have theorem that a two-functor is bi-representable if and only if a certain double category has a terminal object. Then we've Then with Marcus Sarazzola and Paula Perbugo, we did this actually for more general enrichments. And so we have this story for V categories where V is partition. And last thing, with Nima Kazlik and Martin Arbrovedi, like Martin Above. We also did the infinity stories. We define infinity n limits using infinity 2 and what the infinity n limits using physical expressions. And yeah, thank you very much for your attention. Any questions? Yes? So there's like two ways to think like so you said if I happen to be tensored over the interval, then the old story that I thought was true actually is true. Yes. Is there a sort of sharp relationship between, like, is there a story that relates being sensitive to the interval and this double construction? Is it like a nice or is this just too like? If I'm tensored over the interval, was somehow the double category something that I already had? So, yeah, so what we showed actually is like if you have a double category which has tabulators, they are called, or cotabulators, I never remember one of the two. So these are like more or less like double limits of the vertical morphism, and you can think of them as some sort of tensors if you want. Then we have that double terminal in A is the same thing as two terminal in the underlying two categories. And when when the category C that you start with has tensors, then you can show that this like this category has actually also these tabulators. Then these study liters, and then you can kind of like follow this story. And in particular, the underlying horizontal two category of this is just like the first one that I put on the floor. Like the two category. I don't know if this answered end limits require like higher analogs of double categories? Yes. And so the And so the so if you think of it in double categories, you know, just single objects in categories. And so we took single objects in infinity categories. So for the number three, it's like double is just one dimension and minus one dimension. So one dimension and nine dimensions? Like what is how? Yeah, it's like we work in a good model of infinite and minus one categories, and then you take simplicial objects in this. And then you can look at the signal of. And then you can look at the single objects design of double infinity and minus one categories, and then your infinity categories would be sort of still one vertical composition and then minus one and horizontal compositions. Oh, don't think I can count. It should double n minus one, so there should be two n minus two, yeah. Any more questions? No, that's uh thanks, Speaker.
