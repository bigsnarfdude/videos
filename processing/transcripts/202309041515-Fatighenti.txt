Okay, so first of all, I would like to thank you all, the organizers, for inviting me here. That's really an interesting and beautiful place. And also, it's my first time in China. Hopefully, not the last one, of course. So, okay. The title pretty much explains what I'm going to talk about. And, of course, I'm going to define all the notions which are needed in order to understand the state. Needed in order to understand the statement and the result of this talk. And the first thing I have to say is that myself, I'm not really an expert on this topic. It's something I just started to work on very recently. People started with a question of Iran O'Brady. And I will tell exactly later which question was and how it was answered. But I think it's a very interesting and beautiful subject. So I hope that in the end I can convince you that it's a subject worthwhile. Okay. So, what is the aim of the source more like really broadly? It is to use this concept of modular vector bundle on a particular variety in order to produce samples of either theory. Well, you know, it's a really ambitious aim of the course. Okay. Of course. Okay, so what's the main idea? Well, of course, we all know that in order to produce an example of a percalera, a pretty successful strategy has been one of constructing modules of stable sheets on, for example, K3 surfaces or ability. Okay. So I think with this audience, there is no need of reminding you this for the subject. But of course, let me tell you that this is a quite successful way. And of course, one is tempted to say. And of course, one is tempted to say, well, maybe one could try to do the same on higher-dimensional hypertension varieties. So instead of doing this, for example, on a K-3 surface and crafting a modulus based on stable sheets on K3 surfaces, that's an example, one may do the same on a procedure. But of course, there is a problem that in higher dimension, constructing such modulite space is very complicated. So maybe. So, maybe stable sheaves are not the right notion, and one should somehow restrict this notion to consider a stricter class of sheaves or vector bundles, whatever. And so the idea of modular sheaves goes exactly into this direction. So, I'm going to give you the precise definition of modular shifts in the video I mean two, but before let me tell you that this is a theory which is maybe started, I don't know, around 20 years ago or something with the ideas of. 20 years ago, or something, with the ideas of Berbitsky, and then, of course, it was developed by many other people, including Steven O'Grady, Mark One, and then Telemann, and other people, which I'm going to quote later on. So, it's definitely not a new thing, but it's kind of rapidly expanding. Okay. So, what is the idea? So, we want to work with modular shapes. Okay. But before working with modular shifts, But before working with modular shifts, let me tell you that the idea is to consider shifts on a percolor, such that if we consider the projection of f on x, this guy here deforms along with x to all deformations of x. Formation of X. Okay? And so we should consider this kind of shifts. And via theorem, accelerated theorem by Bitkim, this impact can be checked. This condition in terms, I mean, this can be checked using the authomological condition on the discriminant of that itself. And this condition, which I'm gonna And in turn, this condition implies modularity. Okay, but you know, I think it's time for me to give the exact definition of what does it mean to actually be modulated. Let me do that. So, as far as I know, this definition is given by Kiranograd. Okay. And suppose that X is an uppercayler manifold of dimension to n. And suppose we consider f, which is a portion of Consider F, which is a portion of free coherent shift on X. Okay. Then we say that X is modular if there exists a rational number. If there exists a rational number, which we call the F and depends only on F, okay, such that for all classes in H2, then we have user quality. Well, this guy here, of course, is the mobile bogo model of this. And maybe I will define the discriminant now. And we recall that the discriminant. And we recall that the discriminant is nothing but the second shared class of the endomorphism bundle of F is equal to a homological. Is equal to a homological expression. So R here is the rank of F. Okay. So it's equal to two times the rank minus the second term class of F minus the square of the Fertile plus of F is another constant, which in turn. constant which in turn is equal to minus 2r okay so we can take this as definition of modular shift and as you can see in general this can be quite tricky to check okay if we do not put any other example any other sorry computation Here? No, I don't want the square. You're absolutely right. Sorry. Of course, I wanted the square on the C1 and then I called it twice. Okay. So you can give other definitions in terms of maybe the Verbitsky component if you wish, but I'm not going to use the full definition, which is this one. Which is this one, but I'm going to use another characterization which applies when x is of k-tripsotype, and by this I mean when x is the formation equivalent to the real square of two points on a k-triste. Okay, so when this happens, This happens. We have a condition which is much easier to check, in my opinion. So whenever x is deformation equivalent to the inverse power of two points on a hitter surface, then f is modular. Then f is modular if and only if the discriminant is just a multiple of the second shared class of X. You can find all the definitions in a series of work by Kiran, Kirano Gredi, which maybe the first one is about 2019 and the second one in 2022. It doesn't change, so all pretty good, okay? Right. So there are a lot of things behind this concept that I'm not telling you because I want to get straight to the point of this work. But if you're interested, I mean, there is really a lot of interesting things to learn and to discuss about. Okay. And then again, if you trust this philosophy, these modular shifts did the right. Modular shifts be the right one to consider, or you know, one of the possible right versions of shift to consider if one wants to consider to construct example hyperfederance model basis on higher dimensional. Right, so you might be tempted to ask me, okay, so you gave us a definition, but I mean, are in fact any meaningful examples that in fact are covered by this definition, and there are some. Definition. And there are some. Okay. Oh, it's just rational now. So William Wood. Okay, so let me give you some examples. Okay, so maybe there. Okay, so maybe that you have an example zero, in which if you take an equiper, then the tangent to x equals filler, the tangent value to x is modeled. But for some reason, this is not really useful for our purposes. So let me give you two examples which are more. Give you two examples which are more meaningful for the rest of this and for the rest of this one. In order to do the first one, so let me call this example zero. So let me give you two other examples which are like really closely related, which I'm going to discuss in a few moments. So in order to start, to do this, let me start from A smooth cubic four. Okay, so of course, as we know, if we start from a smooth cubic four fold, we have a very well understood and nice way to, I mean, we have many ways to attach to it an ever-Keller manifold. Maybe the first one is to consider its variety of lines. And so this is. And so, this is in fact an accuracy of dimension four, which is the formation equivalent to the L B square of two points on a K2C. Okay, so of course, I mean, if we know a bit about this guy here, you realize that this one admits a very natural embedding inside. Inside the minion of two-dimensional subspace in a six-dimensional vector space. Okay, that's because this is where the lines in P5 live. Okay, but in fact, we can do more. We can say a little bit more about this. And this is going to be very important also. In fact, You can write down X as the zero locus of a general global section of a globally generated very nice vector boundary on the graph magnetic. So, since this guy is going to come up quite often, you will follow. Is going to come up quite often in what follows. Let me remind you a little something. So, on the Rosmannian, for example, 2, or you know, K for what matters of Bn, you have two very natural vector bundles. So the first one is the so-called tautological. So over the point, you know, P in the Graves Mannion, you have the corresponding K-dimensional subspace that defines the point. Dimensional subspace that defines the point. So this one for me is of rank two, okay, in general, and has no section, just to fix convention. Then you have exactly V6 in the middle. And then you have the rank, in this case, four pushed one. Okay. And I mean, it's a pretty standard fact that you can describe the variety of line in this way. And in this way. Okay. Okay. And in this case, we have a rank two vector bundle and a rank four vector bundle on the inverse machine. And you can consider the restriction of U and Q to the episode. To the atmosphere. You might be wondering, like, if they're modular, both modular, what neither are modular, blah, blah, blah. And the answer is that this guy here is modular. This is not. Okay, so as the standard example for the purpose of this talk of modular vector bundles, Of this code of modular vector bundle, you can consider this guide here. Okay, so this is a rank four vector. Okay, nice. And well, let me do another example, which is not so far in some sense. And there is a motivation for it, which I'm going to explain later. But of course, there is another famous model of Heperkeler. Low pipe per kilor, which can be constructed from Grandmanian geometry. And this one, I mean, this example originally by Arnu and Mondonaghi, maybe 35 years ago or something. And then there is another example of a percalor using Rathmannian geometry, which is this case discovered first by Claire and Ardo Bouville. This time to start from the Gradmanian of six-dimensional subspace of a 10-dimensional vector space. The tree was really a typo because first you can attach to it a funnel writing which impacts the injunction pretenses. But let me just consider this guy here. This once again. Here, this once again is deformation equivalent the field square of two points on a paper surface. And once again, you can consider Q and U on the Graftmanian, and you can restrict them to Z. And also, in this case, Q has rank four, and also in this case, Q is modular. And also, in this case, Q is modular and u is large. Maybe let me just mention that also in this case, that admits a nice description. Let me call it maybe new. And also, in this case, you can get new as a nice section of a nice. Okay, so I gave you two quite famous examples of Eperkeler. And I gave you two examples of modular vector bundle. And in fact, Let me quote a result, a couple of results by Kiran already, once again 19 and 22, that generalize these examples. And the result is, in fact, it's quite long and technical, like it goes on, there is a long list of numerical conditions. On, there is a long list of numerical conditions that goes along, goes on for a couple of pages. So, let me just sum the results up for you. So, he was able to find the result of existence and uniqueness. Of modular vector bundles on heterkelar deformation equivalent to the Hilbert square to the Hilbert and Hilbert scheme of endpoint on IKP surfaces under certain, let me say, complicated Say complicated, maybe long, not complicated. Numerical conditions, numerical condition on the rank of the vector bundle, on the invariance of the percolor, and so on and so forth. And if x is in fact the Alperkiller constructed that variety of line as in the example before. And with a rank of F4, the Kirchhan class is just the Plug-Plarization, and the discretion of X is exactly equal to the second shared class of X. Then F is exactly isomorphic to the example that we considered before. So the quotient bundle restricted points. And same for the bar bottom equation. Okay? So in these cases, I didn't just give you. Just give you two examples, but you know, with these fixed invariants, these bundles are in fact mixed. Okay. If you pick an hypercaler of Kitrian type and you impose a long set of numerical conditions, Huron proved, let me say in an abstract way, that you have exactly one and only one modular vector bundle, plus, if you specify those numerical. But if you specify those numerical conditions in this special case, these are the vector bundles you actually learned out. Okay? I don't think it's instructive to write down all these conditions because they're really, really long. And it really depends like, okay, if this number is congruent to one mod four and this other number is congruent, blah, blah, blah. Okay, so this is very cool, right? Yes. Not a priori, but in fact, I will ask stability every time. So maybe I will write it down. Yes, yes, yes, absolutely. In fact, if, like in the definition that we had before, stability was not required, but here it's in fine. Yes, sorry. Yeah, sorry. Okay, but you know, these examples are good, but they do have a little problem. We have no moduli. So the examples are rigid in the sense that their self x1 is zero. Okay, so everything is good, except that you cannot look to construct positive dimensions. You cannot look to construct positive dimensional examples of azeda using this vector model. So, of course, of course, what is the thing? You would like to find more examples, possibly non-rigid examples, right? In order to do that, In order to do that, another notion which is closely related to modularity has been considered, and that's the notion of an atomic sheaf. And in fact, it's a little bit more restricted. So if a sheaf is atomic, then it's a material model. And then again, there are many people who work on this. Let me mention just a few. Let me mention just a few. Okay, so consider the atomic fields, which I don't want to talk about too much about them now, but let me Now, but let me say that atomic implies modular. And in this case, we did get some positive results, at least partial. So let me mention a recent theorem by Bottini. I believe it is from last year, or something closely related to it. Or something closely related to it. Okay, so once again, consider a network heller which is the formation equivalent, the L by square of two points, two square on a k. To point two little bit square on 83. Then it was able to construct table atomic hence modular vector bundle That depends on 10 mobile more than zero. Not only this, but also with this key property. Of an isomorphism between the second wedge power of the first extension space and the second extension power, which in turn implies that the deformation functor is smooth, and which in turn implies that at least in a neighbor of f, this model x state is smooth. This model excites more. Okay? And not only this, but in a special case, it was able to construct at least an open set of a moduli space proving this modulo X space to be birational to the To be rational to the 10-dimensional example of a particular biograde. Okay, so as far as I know, I mean, I haven't speaked with Lesio Boutin in the past three or four months, but I don't know if he managed to pass from birationality to isomorphism. So maybe some of you know more about this. But you know, it's already a very good result. Okay. So this is more or less the So, this is more or less the status of the art if excluding source. Then you have a sorry it's a complicated construction. And I do not remember the details, but I think it starts from the generation of the cubic. Generation of the cubic portfolio, and then it will generate a singular cubic portfolio and pretty badly singular, if I remember correctly. And then you use a construction. You know what? Frank, I don't remember, but I'll check it out later. But anyway, it's a yes, it's on archive. Okay, so it's Okay, so it's something it should be an ideal shape. So, and then you take some transform, and I mean, it's not a if you ask me a simple construction to say in a few lines, okay? On the other hand, I would like to present more simple construction. No, no, no, no, no, no, it's in fact 10 to 2. So it's what? 45 dimensional. I think there is some formality result involved in this. So the obstruction space is probably should be quadratic. And then this should give you the local smoothness. But it's only local. local not local okay I think you can construct a symplectic form a regular form which is symplectic in a neighbor of F it should be some trace map probably I mean there is a trace map in both I think that's it I think that's it. I'm not sure about this. I think you should ask Alessia. I don't want to tell you something which is not some result of mine and not entirely sure. But still, that's an interesting construction, and you should check this down. But I want to answer a much more bad equation. Can you produce somehow, in an easy way, more examples of non-rigid modular vector bundles? And the answer is yes. In fact, much more, more or less all of you, you know, how many as you want, as many as you want. And the philosophy is much more closer to what I already started telling you before, which is using Radmanian geometry. Okay, and this is. Okay, and this is kind of the moral of the story. More precisely we want to modify a bit. Of the radius vector bundles. So, the idea is those vector bundles were like quite pretty good examples. They just like moduli. Okay, we do a little bit of tweaking around. And then we got some vector bundle which was as good as the gravity's one, but we folded it. Okay, and in fact, the idea is really naive. And it's not either that. And it's not either that technologically advanced. So let me start from the variety of lines on a Google TB for fold. On a good cubic forefold, and a greatest vector bundle, let me call this E using this notation was in fact defined or if you want identified after rhythm of freedom with the function prestricted to x. Okay, so in particular is the restriction of an homogeneous vector bundle on an isomogeneous variety. So the idea is very basic. So the idea is very basic. Take some modification of this guy using some standard tool, restrict it, and check that everything works. And everything works. But let me tell you the details. So the idea is to apply some sure functor to Q On G26 and restrict the next. Okay? So if you know a bit about representation theory, I mean, not really that much, you know what a sure functor is. If not, well, you start from a okay, in general. Okay, in general, so the equivalent of starting with a G module, in this case, G would be GLN, okay, B and lambda a partition, and consider this representation, which I call the associated Schur representation, Schur lambda. Okay. Okay, and if you apply this construction to vector bundles, so for example to the topological vector bundle and to the quotient vector bundle, you get that on the Gradman of three-dimensional vector status, the irreducible homogeneous vector. Homogeneous vector bundles are exactly those of the forms applied to the quotient times, well, tensor, from sure functor applied to the topological. Okay? And these guys here are very easy to deal with. I mean, if you really don't know what this guy is. If you really don't know what this guy here, you should think, for example, as the symmetric power or the exterior power. But there are, of course, many more examples. Or the tensor power, dual, etc., etc. This is a theorem which is very, very famous by Borel Weilenbot. I'm not going to tell you the theorem in full generality. Let me just mention a consequence of it. So let A be as above, so of this form denote with lambda simply the concatenation of the two partitions, okay of G R A B N. Then one of the following occurs. I mean, exactly. One of the following So, either this bound will have no comology at all. Okay. Or there is this a unique non-zero homology group. Is different from zero, and in fact, it is equal to. And in fact, it is equal to a certain representation of n and gamma tilde and l are determined uniquely by gamma and n. So, the whole point of this theorem, I mean, if you know it. Theorem, I mean, if you know it, you already know its power. If you don't know it, it basically tells you everything about homogeneous vector bundle and homogeneous time. And the whole point is that this procedure is algorithmic, so you can really do it. I mean, you can actually put a piece of paper and write down some position and get an actual result quite easily. And the point here: can we produce vector bundles, modular vector bundles, which are stable and non-rigid using this construction above? And perfection. Yes. Oh. Well, before telling you an example which do work, let me tell you a simple example which do not. Well, a simple example which does not work. Just to tell you that it's not like, okay, every bundle will work. So, if E, okay, so from now on, X will be always the variety of line on a cubic portfolio, and E will always be the quotient respected to X. So, if you consider The symmetric square of X. This is modular, one second stable, but still reached. Okay? So not every example is a lagx. But then on the other end, there is. There are many. So let me tell you about them. Let me let me tell you about them. Let me use a notation here. And in general, for a vector bundle F. A vector bundle f, let me denote, for this is a notation with n zero of f the sub vector bundle of traceless endomorphism. In other words, If you write down the endomorphism bundle, as and for equal, you can decompose it as the direct sum of the traceless part and the trivial line part. Okay. And note in particular there For an eye for Keller, if i is even, this guy always contains this guy all, I mean, this guy always contains h i of x, which of course, if i is even, is not zero. So now that I've given you this notation, let me tell you the theorem. Well, one theorem. So suppose that X is, of course, as before, the variety of line on a cubic and E as above. You know, either the symmetric power doesn't work. The symmetric power doesn't work. Try the wet power. So consider the second which power of E. In other words, the second wedge power of Q restricted to X. Okay. Maybe let's assume that X is generic in its public space. Okay, then it is modular stable and not reached. Let me compute, let me write down this activable So, if you consider it the homology of a bridle part. So, for p equal to one and three, this is hydromorphic to the third. And three, this is isomorphic to the third wedge power of this dual. This is equal to c for p equals two, and zero otherwise. And of course, using the decomposition above the Okay, you get this full-dimensional thing. So the X2 is two, the tracelet part is one-dimensional, and the H1 is 20 dimensional, given by this very simple object. Okay, so this is the first example. I'm going to give you other examples later on in this talk. I think I have maybe. Uh, lower maybe 10 mil 15 now between 10 and 15. Okay, so let me just uh okay, so this is a rank six vector bundle, okay, and also its Bernstein class six times the blue. Six times the fluker polarization. Okay. And it's globally generated, and it has the number of sections you would expect, which is wedged to OBCs. So since I haven't got much time, let me not write the whole churn character, but let me tell you how do you check all the requirements which are needed. Okay, so because you need to check three things. Well, first the modularity, then the stability, and finally you have to. And finally, you have to check these numbers. Okay. So let me do modularity first. Okay, so I'll do a check module. It's not complicated at all. So suppose you start from At all. So suppose you start from a vector bundle or maybe the coherent shield of Rancar, a new projective variety. You play around with the splitting principle and another standard tool when you do churn classic computation and so on and so forth. And so on and so forth, and you get that the discriminant of the p-power wedge of A is equal to the discriminant of A times a coefficient, which is zero. Okay, okay. Okay, so final computation, not sequence simple. Yes, yes, local, yes. But this is part of our work in progress by here. So I'll tell you after this. You after this, so and I want to highlight that this is not a special case for the wet power. In fact, you can probably cook, I mean, you can cook up seminal formula for symmetric power or probably for every sure function that you can think of. Okay, this is nothing really complicated at all. So, in that case, this number in our case, so for f as above lambda p. Lambda P is that. Okay. So modularity is done. Nothing really complicated. Stability. Well, the whole point is that if X is generic, then the bundle Q restricted to X is mu stable. And then there is a result which says that if X, sorry, if this bundle is mu stable, then its wedge power is polystable. Table like generic, but it's also simple. Also, stability is not a problem, and then of course you have to check them the real thing, which is this computation. I don't have much. Computation. I don't have much time, so let me just tell you how to do this, okay, without giving you many details. But I can tell you if you have small course. So, the whole point is that we can use something which is called Little Woodrichardson formula. Okay, to compute the decomposition in irreducible factor of this bundle times its dual, so the endomorphism, only to six. The actual partition are not really important here, but just to tell you, it's not that complicated. Okay. And then, of me, to compute the homology of the restriction of this guy, you have to compute the homology of this guy restricted, plus this guy restricted. Plus this guy restricted. The Kushal complex. Okay? Because I told you before, like 45 minutes ago, that the variety of line could be described at the zero output of a section of a very nice, homogeneous, irreducible globally generated vector bundle. And this meant, in particular, that you know how to resolve the structure shape of x. The stack or shivable or X. You have this complex, you can spread it out with this factor. You do a lot of computation, and then you get your results. I mean, these computations are not easy, are not trivial, but absolutely doable. You can do it if you want. And let me tell you, they are really, really doable. So, this is how you prove it. But then, since I have five minutes left, more or less, three, five, five inputs, let me tell you that, you know, this is not a general case. That you know, this is not a general case. Sorry, this is not special exactly that we're out because you know, once you have this example in mind, why not continue? So, for example, I tried another case, so I try to always on the same percolor. You know, since I already had the modularity lemmat end, why not take another watch too? Do not take another watch too, and this one is still irreducible on the worst manual. This is, uh, I mean, you're not expecting this in general, but it happens in this case. If you're curious about this, this is in fact more fake too. This is a bundle which has rank 15, but of course, the stability lemma still applies, the modularity lemma still applies, and the x table is still. Next table is still really interesting. So let me call this a theorem. So everything as before A is stable modular It's a still 20 model, okay? But what's more interesting is that if X2 is 190 dimensional, And if you like binomials, you do, which I do like, you recognize immediately that this guy here is this which two, this choose two. And in fact, you can actually prove that these two space are isomorphic. So, this as a representation is actually isomorphic to the wedge two. Of the H1 of the traceless end of this. Okay, so this is a very similar situation to work in this case, and even in this case, you can use this to get local smoothness. Okay, so let me just finish with the time. Okay, two samples. First of all, you can continue doing this. You can continue doing this on and on if you want. You will always find examples of vector bundles which are modular, stable, and with a certain number of moduli, a certain obstruction space with a certain dimension, and so on and so forth. I just didn't want to continue finding numbers with it after a while. It's a little bit repeated. But of course, these two examples are very interesting, and you might wonder, okay, so. Interesting, and you might wonder: okay, so is there, in fact, an hypercaler involved in this? And I mean, if Iran you know, gave his quote here, he would have probably talked about this. And he's working on understanding the situation. I think he has a pretty good intuition. There is a relation with 10, the Hilbert sensor 10 point on a K2 surfaces, but there are many things still here. Many things feel like people and uh Yesterday. And the point is: okay, so he has a whole way of interpreting the situation here. Of interpreting the situation here, and let me say that at some point he asked me, Okay, this is all very nice, but do you also have examples of vector bundles on, say, Hilbert square of K3 that in some way do not come using Machiavell correspondence from some of box product on the K3 separatist? And the answer is yes, we do have, I do have a strategy also for this one, and it still depends on the multiple. And it still depends on finding outline. So I think that's pretty much it for this book.
