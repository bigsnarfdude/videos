Thank you very much, and you for all the organizers. And so the title of the conference is New Trends from Classical Theorems. And I will try to present some classical theorems and some new results. So hopefully it will match. And then I am the first one to state the famous theorem of Helly, and probably there will be many talks. Halley, and probably there will be many talks on that. But since it was published exactly 100 years ago, let me put it up. So it was published in 1923. And so this is the finite reversion. So we assume that there are n sets in Rd which are convex. And they have the property that any D plus one or fewer of them has non-empty intersection. Then the intersection of all of them is non-empty. And of course, we all know it very well. So this is the starting point. So, this is the starting point. And now, the question: all right, is it fine that the intersection is non-empty, then all of them have non-empty intersection? But for example, if we are interested in applications or algorithmic aspects, then we would like to find a point in the intersection. And then Halley's theorem, even though it guarantees the existence of a point, it is impossible to find a single point. So, what can we do about that? And that is the goal of the whole topic. The goal of the whole topic is to make the theorem somewhat quantitative. So, now what do we mean by quantitative? Well, so we can think of the intersection of any d plus one of them being non-empty. We replace that by being large in some sense. And so, can we come up with a version that provided then the intersection of any d plus one of them is large, then the intersection of all Then the intersection of all of them is not too small in some sense. And now it will be the question: what do we mean by large and what do we mean by not too small? But can we guarantee such a version of Halley's theorem? And most of you know the answer that this is impossible in this form. So here the original Halley number is d plus one. And it turns out that the most that we can hope for is 2d instead. hope for is 2d instead of d plus 1. So now I just replaced the d plus 1 by a number k up there. And so the question is there such a version that if we are given n convex sets in Rd and we know that the intersection of any k of them is large in some sense, then the intersection of all of them is not too small. And the question, what is the best number for k? And well we can sort of Well, we can sort of turn it upwards, this statement, and formulate the dual statement. And if we know that the intersection of all of them is small, then can we find the k of them so that the intersection of this k is not too large? This is exactly the dual of the statement of all. And now this will be the formulation that we are going to talk about. And here is an example that shows that we cannot hope for anything better than 2D. For anything better than 2D. So let our 2D sets be half spaces. And one half spaces is this blue, the other one is this red, and so on. And these half spaces intersect in a small cube. Okay, so the intersection of this small cube, this orange cube. And we can make this cube arbitrarily small. And now if we take these 2D convex sets, then we see that the intersection of any 2D minus one of them is Minus one of them is actually unbounded, it will be this infinite strip. Yeah, and if we if we leave out any of the of these half spaces, then the intersection of the rest is going to be such a strip, and the volume of that is infinitely large, the diameter of that is infinitely large. So, in the ways that we want to measure it, it will be albitritally large, even though the intersection of all the sets is a tiny cube, and we can make this cube as small as we want. We can make this cube as small as we want. The cube can shrink to a point. So, this shows that Helly's theorem with d plus one cannot hold in such a quantitative way, and the best that we can hope is this guarantee with k equals 2d. So, that's the question. Can we come up with a quantitative version of Pelli's theorem with D plus one replaced by 2D? All right, so now let's current pages and So now let's turn pages and then there's the cla- there was the classical theorem of Helly, and this is the classical theorem of quarter theory. All of us know it. If we are given a set now X in Rd, and we are given a point in its convex hull, then actually we can find at most D plus one points in X, we call a set Y, so that X is in the convex hull of Y. Namely, if we know that a point is in the convex hull, then we can testify it. We can somehow find the smallest. We can somehow find a small subset so that it is in the convex hull of that. And so, the sort of variant of it is what happens if we don't only require that x is in the convex hull, but we require that x is in the interior of the convex hull. Can we find a few number of points so that x will be in the interior of the convex hull of those few points? And here it turns out that again, we cannot do that if we keep d plus one. Do that if we keep d plus one. And we have to replace d plus one by two d. And this 2d is the best possible number. Because if we take the vertices of a cross polytope and we take the origin, then surely the origin is in the interior of the cross polytope. But if we leave out any of the vertices, then the origin will be on the boundary of the convex shallow of the remaining points. So we cannot hope for anything better than 2d. And so this is Stein's theorem that indeed it is possible to find a set with cadency at. To find a set with caddinity at most 2d, so that x is in the convex hull of this 2d. And now it might seem suspicious that here we have 2d, and on the previous slides, we had 2d as well. And it turns out that there is indeed a very strong connection between these two. And now, if we reformulate this statement, Stein's theorem, a bit, then we can, of course, shift everything so that this point axis is just So, that this point x is just the origin. And now, what does it mean that it is in the interior of the convex cell? Well, it means that there's a small ball about this point that is continuing in the convex cell. And now I can rescale. So, here I can assume that, well, x is in the interior of the convex cell, so 0 is in the interior of the convex cell. And by scaling everything up, I can actually assume that the unit ball is contained in a convex cell of x. And so, this is the reformulation of Stein's theorem. So, we have a point. Of Stein's theorem. So we have a point set in Rd, and we know that the unit ball sits inside the convex hull. Then we can find at most 2D points so that a ball of some small but positive radius sits inside the convex hull. Okay. And now the question, the natural question comes up. Can we make this somewhat quantitative as well? Namely, now this radius, this positive radius depends on x. Radius depends on x. For different sets, for different sets x, we have different radii. Can we come up with a uniform bound on this radius? Can we come up with a uniform bound? Well, of course, this bound will depend on D, but we don't want to depend on anything else. So can we come up with a positive radius depending on D so that this statement holds? And that was proved by Janos and Imre and Kaushowski in 1820. And Ymre and Kazzovsky in 82, that there is such a positive radius. There exists a constant R of D, depending only on the dimension, so that if we have any set with this property, that the unit ball sits inside the convex hull, then we can find at most 2D points so that this small ball of radius R D sits inside the convex hull of those. By the way, Imre cannot be here, but he sends greetings to everyone. But he sends greetings to everyone. So the bound that they proved was d to the minus 2d, and they also mentioned that actually we can get something of order d to the minus d over 2. Well, roughly d to the minus d over 2. And so here is the picture. So we have x, this set of red points. We have the unit ball inside the convex hull. Then we can find The convex hull, then we can find now just four points y, these orange points, so that the smaller ball sits inside the convex hull of these four points. So that is the quantitative version of Stein's theorem. And no, no, no, no, I will come to that. So this is a very weak bound, and then I will come to that in a second. Okay, so a very, very good question: like, what can we say about the order of magnitude of this radius? Radius. And then using that theorem, so using the quantitative Stein's theorem, the trio proved the quantitative version of Halley's theorem in two different ways. So remember, for the quantitative version, we somehow wanted to measure the size of the intersection, and there would be two ways for measuring it now. One way to measure is the volume. So, is it possible to give a volume bound? To give a volume bound, so this is the volumetric estimate. So there exists a constant v of d, depending on only the dimension. So that if we have any finite family of convex sets in Rd, and we know that the intersection of all of them has volume one, then we can find at most two d of these sets whose intersection has volume at most this number v of d. And this v of d depends only on the dimension. So this is the quantitative version for the volume of For the volume of Herist theorem. And there is also another way to measure the sets, and that is the diameter. And so instead of the volume, if we measure it by the diameter, there is another constant, data of D, so that the same statement holds. So if we know that the intersection of all the sets has small diameter, let's say diameter one, then there is a sub-film of size 2D so that the intersection Of size 2d, so that the intersection of these 2d sets has not too large diameter, and not too large, we mean at most this data of d. Okay, so they managed to prove these two results, and then the bounds that they had for the volume is d to the 2d square, and for the diameter, they proved that the diameter is essentially 2 over this r of d. R of d was this number in the Stein's theorem, and that is order d to the 2d. So that's the So those are the bounds that were proven 41 years ago. And so question: can we improve on these bounds? All right, so these are very beautiful proofs, provided that we know the Steinitz theorem, the quantitative Steinitz theorem, then it's very nice to get the quantitative diameter and the quantitative volume theorems. And then we are just going to go over the proofs because The proofs because our proof is quite similar to this. So we are going to assume the Steinish theorem. So that is somehow the black box. That turns out really to be the crux of the argument. And now assume that we know this. So we know that property that if x contains the unit ball in its convex hull, then we can find a subset of kinetic muscle 2d so that a ball of radius rd sits inside the convex hull of y. Convex hull of y. All right, and the first step is, so now we are going to prove the diameter theorem, and the first step is to reduce the case from general convex sets to closed half spaces. And we can do that because we can write each of these convex sets as an intersection of closed half spaces. And then we have this big intersection of all the half spaces. And if we find 2D half spaces, then it will essentially work. So this is the first important step. And so we have a Step. And so we have a number of half spaces, actually, a finite family, so that their intersection is a bounded polytop P. Okay. And we assume that the diameter of P is, let's say, at most one or exactly one, we can also assume. And this is our goal. We want to find at most 2D half spaces so that their intersection has diameter at most that of D. And now, well, we know that the diameter of P. Well, we know that the diameter of P is one. So if we take any point of P and shift it to the origin, then any other point has distance at most one from that point. And now that means that if we take the unit ball about the origin, then it must contain this polytope. So by a translation, we can assume that the polytope sits inside the unit ball. All right, very good. But so now somehow we would like to use the quantitative Steinish theorem, which talks about a set which contains the unit ball. A set which contains the unit ball, and now we have a set which is contained in the unit ball, so it is a natural idea to take polars because it will just change inclusion, and so that's what we do. And then when we take the polar of p, then it is going to contain the unit ball. Very nice. And the important property is that we had these original half spaces, they intersected in this orange polytope P. Now, when we take the polar, then the vertices of the polar. Then the vertices of the polar will correspond to the facets of the polytope. So now we wanted to find 2D facets, I mean 2D half spaces. Now, when we take polars, we want to find 2D vertices. And then we see that that is exactly what we have up there in the quantitative Steiner's theorem, because that guarantees us to find a small number of points from a big set of points. So this is the picture. So we have this p-polar, the green polytope, and it contains the unit ball. The unit ball. And of course, we just apply the quantitative Steining's theorem, which will give us at most 2D vertices of the polar, so that their convex R contains a small ball of positive radius. This R of D that is given by the Steining's theorem. All right. And now, what do we do? We take polars again, we go back to the original setting, and then P prime, this the convex hull of these 2D vertices contain this. The convex half of these 2D vertices contain this small ball, so the polar is going to be contained. Well, it's a huge ball, but still a bounded radius. Yeah, one over R of D radius. Very good. And then we just see that, well, actually, when we selected these vertices in the polar setting, it is really selecting these half spaces. So we found at most 2D half spaces so that their intersection sits inside this big ball. And if it sits inside this big ball, it means that the diameter is at most twice the radius of that ball. Of that ball. Okay, so very nice and transparent argument. And now we had the bound for R of D in our Steining's theorem, the black box, and that gives us an order D to the 2D estimate for this radius. So the diameter of the ball. So this is once again, this is the proof. So we started from the intersection of these half spaces, which was this orange polytope. We know that it is contained in the Contained in the blue unit ball. Then we take the polar, it is this green polytope. Then we select a few vertices of this green polytope, that is just the red vertices, this P prime. It doesn't contain the unit ball anymore, but it contains a small ball of radius r of d. And then we take the polar, we go back to the original setting. Well, then this is going to be this intersection of the blue half spaces. And this blue polytope is going to be contained in a really ball of. In a radio ball of radius one over Rd. So that's the that's the proof in a picture. All right, and now what happens for the volume? The volume essentially we apply the same argument. So until then, there is nothing different. And so remember for the quantitative diameter theorem, we had to shift this piece so that it sits inside the unit ball. Sits inside the unit ball. Now, when we want to estimate the volume, we are going to be a bit more careful. And we notice that when we are estimating the volume, the proportion of the volume is affine invariant. So we can apply an affine transformation for P, and we are going to apply an affine transformation so that P is in John's position. That just means that the ellipsoid of maximum volume inside it is the unit ball. So that is John's position. And John's Position and John's theorem gives us a characterization of this position, but we are not going to need anything of John's theorem, only this thing, only this property that P can be sandwiched between the unit ball and D times the unit ball. And that is the only thing that we are going to use from John's theorem. And actually, if P is centrally symmetric, then here instead of D, we can write square root of D. But so if we apply a good affine transformation, then P can be sandwiched between. Then p can be sandwiched between a ball, I mean the unit ball, and d times the unit ball. So it is sitting in between these two things. And that's that means that when we take the polar, then of course p polar is going to contain the ball of radius one over d. And then again, vertices of the polar correspond to facets of p, which correspond to half spaces in k. And once again, we just apply this quantity with Stein's theorem. We just apply this quantity with Stein's theorem for the polar. We select a few vertices of the polar, two at most 2D vertices of the polar. And again, we are going to have that when we take the polar of that thing, then it really corresponds to 2D half spaces. And their intersection is sitting inside that ball of radius D over R B. And now we can estimate the volume of that. And, well, it sits inside this ball of. Well, it sits inside this ball of this radius, then Bd sits inside P. So we can actually estimate the volume of that from above by the volume of P. And by the volume of P was just the volume of the intersection of all of the half spaces. And then we get this bound that the volume of this, the intersection of this at most 2D half spaces is at most this D over R D to the D times the volume of the intersection of all of them. And that gives us a bound on the gives us a bound on the proportion of the volumes and that is exactly what we want where we had this d is at least d to the minus 2d and this is the estimate that we get for the volume d to the 2d squared it is really huge but so once again what was important here is that p can be sandwiched between the unit ball and the ball of radius d when we take polars and we have p polar sandwiched between the ball of radius one over d and Between the ball of radius one over d and the unit ball, and then here we select again a few vertices, then we have to multiply that radius by r of d and then again going back by the polars we have this double estimate. Okay, so and this is this is the picture. So once again we start with the orange polytope. We take the now we know that the orange polytope is sandwiched between the unit ball and D times the unit ball. D times the unit ball, when we take its polar, now it is going to sit inside the unit ball, but it is going to contain the ball of radius one over D. Now, when we take a few vertices, at most two vertices of that, it's not going to contain the ball of radius one over D anymore, but it is going to contain R of D times one over D times the unit ball. And then when we go back with the polars, then this blue intersection is going to be containing this huge, huge, huge ball, but still about. Containing this huge, huge, huge ball, but still bounded radius. And that's the proof. Okay, so question that Oleg already asked: can we do any better? And in the 82 paper, Janus and Porter formulated the conjecture that the optimum bounds should be: the radius is one over the square root of d, the volume should. The volume should be d to the constant times d, and the diameter should be constant times square root of d. And so these are the bounds that they proved. And these are the conjectures. And actually, these are the conjectured best estimates. And we are going to see that indeed, this is the best that we can go for. So this was 82, and then there was really no improvement. And then there was really no improvement for like 34, no, for 34 years. And then Nosori managed to prove, Mattel Nosori managed to prove, who is not here yet, but he is going to be here, that for the volume bound, d to the 2d estimate false. So remember the previous ones for d to the 2d squared. Instead of that, we have now d to the 2d. So much stronger. And also he proved that. And also, he proved that the value conjectured by Janos and the others is the best possible. So, you cannot prove anything better than d to the d over 2. So, this should be the optimal. And then Bratitikos shortly after modified his argument a bit and he managed to decrease the bound to d to the 3d over 2. And also, Bradigos came up with an estimate for the diameter, and that is a polynomial estimate. And that is a polynomial estimate. Remember that the diameter bound of baryon others was d to the constant times d. And here this is d to the constant, d to the 11 over 2. And that was improved by Ivanov and Nassau d to d to the 3d. And they also gave a simpler proof for the volume bound, which is a worse estimate. It is d cube instead of d to the 3d over 2, but the argument is much simpler. And they proved that for the diameter, the They prove that for the diameter, the value conjectured by Anisha and the others is the best possible. So, square root of d is the best possible. You cannot have anything better than that. And so, for the quantitative Steinist theorem, this year, this spring, Ivana Van Nassen de Fubbisha preprint, in which they prove d to the minus two. Okay, so here the optimal estimate would be one over square root of d. So, d to the minus one half. And so, this is the best that we know. And so, this is the best that we know at the moment. So, this was the state of the art. And now, what we are going to prove is we are going to give a simple proof for the optimal estimate on the quantitative volume theorem. And for the diameter bound, we will prove an order D square bound instead of the order D cube bound. But again, the same simple proof. So, here, sorry, so here this. So, here, sorry, so here this one over scale of B is the best possible. And just a two words about generalizations or relaxations. There are many ways to relax this problem. And one way to say that, well, I'm not interested in the intersection of exactly two D sets, but what if I'm interested in the intersection of constant times these sets? And then Rositikos proved that, well, with that relaxation, we get a bound d to the three half for the diameter. And if we also assume that the sets are symmetric. We also assume that the steps are symmetric, then we get this square root of d, which is optimal. And so, this argument is based on this parsification result in John's theorem. And then Pablo and Ion, they also proved fractional versions and further relaxations. And they proved the estimate for substrings of size constant times n, but n is the number of sets. And also, they proved colorful and discrete versions. So, the quantity diameter theorem. So the quantity diameter theorem and so on. So there are many related results. So this is the theorem that we prove that for the volume bound we have the previously optimal bound by versatility and for the diameter bound we have d square bound instead of d cube. And besides the improvements, really the important property or aspect is that the proof is very simple. Very simple. And so, this is the main lemma that seems a bit strange at the first sight. And this is an improvement of this approximation theorem by Ivanovan Nassodi. And so, this will be our sort of black box. We will prove it, but remember for the quantitative diameter and volume theorem, the main tool was for the quantitative Steinitz result. And this is sort of what replaces that. So, once we know this lemma, then So, once we know this lemma, then the proof of the theorems will be fairly simple. So, let's read it. So, assume that we have a convex polytope with this strange property that there's a positive constant lambda, so that Q is contained in minus lambda times Q. Okay, now if that holds, then we can select at most 2D vertices of the polytope so that their convex hull, well, I wrote it in this way, but really it means that the convex hull. Way, but really, it means that the convex hull contains a small negative homotic copy of the original polytope. So, somehow we can approximate Q with the convex hull of relatively few vertices of Q. And now one looks at this lemma and then asks, why would it be useful at all? Why do we have such a lambda or how can we find? But the good news is that actually, if we assume that Q is in John's position, then just because we said that Q is sandwiched between the two. That Q is sandwiched between the unit ball and D times the unit ball. Then we actually see that this is contained in minus D times Q. So it means that if Q is a convex polytope in John's position, then this condition is automatically satisfied with lambda equals D. And then we can just apply this theorem with that. And well, so it doesn't only work in the case when Q is in John's position, but also if Q polar is in John's position, then the same argument works. And if Q is in John, Q. And if q is in q polar is in John's position, then again the same criterion holds with lambda equals d. So actually, we can apply this lemma in these two cases, and then this is a corollary so that if q is either q or q polaris in John's position, then there exists at most 2d vertices so that their convex hull satisfies this property. So, in other words, minus one over 2d squared times the original polytope is contained in the convex hull of these few vertices. Max L over these few vertices. Okay, so the proof of the lemma is again a sandwiching argument, but now for John's theorem, we sandwiched the polytole between the ball and the unit ball and the ball of radius D. And now we are not going to sandwich it between two balls, but we are going to sandwich it between two simplices. And what will be the two simplices? So for John's theorem, we started with the ellipsoid of maximum volume inside the polytope, and then we proved that, or And then we prove that, or it can be proved that the polytope doesn't reach out from the transistor unit ball. So we are going to do a similar thing. So we have this polytope with this property. And now, notice that it ensures that the origin sits inside the polytope, because if it didn't, then there would be a hyperplane which separates Q and minus one times Q through the origin. Okay, so we have this property, and therefore, this implies that the origin sits inside Q. And now we are going to consider simplicities. Simplices, these red simplices, which have one vertex at the origin and the vertices from the polytope. Okay, so really triangles in the plane like that. So one vertex is fixed at the origin and the other two vertices are moving in the polytope. Really, we can assume that these other vertices are vertices of the original polytope. And we want to find the maximal volume simplex among these. Okay, so let S be. Among these. Okay, so let s be the maximum volume simplex. Then, of course, we see that these vi's must be also vertices of the original polytope. Okay, and now notice one thing that so now s is this maximal area triangle. And now it means that, well, we cannot change v2 to have a larger volume or a larger area. We cannot change v1 to have a larger area. Now, what does it mean? It means that, for example, for v1, if I want to move v1 to any other point, it means that I cannot. Point, it means that I cannot move it out from this lab between the two parallel hyperplanes, which are parallel to this phase through origin and the other vertices. The same thing goes for V2. I cannot move it out from this slab between these two parallel hypertensions because otherwise I would have a larger area or a larger volume. And now, if we do it for all the vertices, it means that our polytope is going to be contained in a parallel to the section. Palotope. Intersection of these slabs will be a parallelotope. So this is what is written here. And let's call this parallelotope to be T. Okay, so T is this whatever gray parallel tope. And just by the property that the volume of S is maximal, we know that the polytope is contained in this parallel to because otherwise there would be another simplex which has larger volume. And if you want to parametrize, then this is how we can write this parallel to. This parotope. All right, and now we can include this phthalotope in another simplex, this purple simplex, which will be a shifted homotathic copy of minus s. Okay, so just look at that. S was this red triangle. We take the opposite and then we scale it up so that it contains this parallel to. And if we want to be formal, then this is S prime. This is this larger simplex which contains the This larger simplex, which contains the polytope. So it's a homototic copy of the original simplex. So this is our sandwiching. And now we see that because the polytope was contained in T, it is going to be contained in this S prime simplex as well. And so it is quite similar to the setting of John's theorem. So remember, in John's theorem, we sandwiched the body between the ball and the unit ball and the ball of radius D. Here, we sandwiched the body between a simplex and the translated copy. And the translated copy of minus d times that simplex. So again, the proportion between these two things is d, just like in John's theorem. Okay, and now our goal is to find at most 2D vertices of q whose convex satisfies this property. That is our goal. So, how are we going to find these 2D vertices? And that argument again goes back to the paper of Janus and the others. So, let's take this. So let's take this simplex, and now it had a space of the simplex opposite from the origin. And now we take the centroid of that face, that facet, and let's call it U. And now what we do is that we are standing at U, and we look at the origin, and we take this ray through the origin. And we take the opposite half-line of that ray, and now that is going to hit the boundary of the polytope at some point, and that point. Some point. And that point is called y. Okay, so y is the point where this ray exits from the polytope q. And now, well, it hits the boundary of q, it hits it in a facet, and therefore, applying Carathiero's theorem in d minus one dimensions, we see that y is in the convex hull of at most d points, at most d vertices of that facet. And now that will be our candidate. So we take the original d vertices of that simplex plus these d. Vertices of that simplex plus these d vertices of this facet. And we take the convex half of this, and this will be q prime, and we are going to show that this works. Okay, so this is what is written here. And so this is our goal that this is indeed working. Now, why? Well, so first we know that this segment between y and u is contained in this new polytope q prime, and therefore it means that the origin is in q prime. The origin is in q prime. Now, the origin is in q prime, this facet of the simplex was in q prime, so the whole simplex is in q prime. Very good. So, s is living in q prime. And also, this original condition of the lambda q is in minus lambda q. And we have u pointing q, which means that minus u will be in lambda times the polyto. But if we look at minus u, then, well, that along that ray, the point of exiting from q. Exiting from Q was also a point of Q prime. And that means that minus U will be lambda times Q prime. And that is the important step. And so now we have the polytope is contained in this parallel to which is contained in this large simplex S prime. But S prime was just a shifted copy of minus 2DS. Actually, that should be minus DS. And then we can just continue that. continue that s is contained in q prime and u is contained in lambda times q prime and if we put everything together then we get the estimate that we want so this is minus lambda plus two times d times q prime so so really this sandwiching is the essential part and so this is what we prove now the lemma now how can we get the theorems for the volume and diameter estimates so for the diameter estimate again we are Diameter estimate again, we are going to start the same way. So we assume that we have only half spaces and we assume that the intersection of them is in John's position. Now we have seen that if it is in John's position, then we can apply our lemma. We apply our lemma for the polar. So once again, we want to select a few vertices of the polar, which will correspond to selecting a few half spaces. And then by the lemma, we have that the polar is containing minus 2d squared times the convex hell of these few vertices. Hello, these few vertices. And now, going back, it means that we really selected at most 2D half spaces. And we have the property that the intersection of these atmosphere spaces is contained in minus 2D squared times the intersection of all of them. So, this is just the original lemma. And now, because of this containment, we have that the diameter of this set cannot be larger than the diameter of that set, which means that the diameter intersection of this atmosphere. intersection of this at most 2d half spaces is at most 2d square times the diameter of the big intersection and that is exactly what we want okay so this is the d square instead of the d cube now for the volume we have to be a bit more careful so this is our goal so once again we do the same selection and we we want to prove that this volume estimate holds and now this is the step where it is important that we actually included That we actually included a parallel tope in this convex hull because when we are going to take the polars, then we can take the polar of this parallel tope and the origin, and then we can apply the volume estimate for that. So this is what we have. So one over two d squared times the perilotope was contained in this convex cell. Now we take the polars. It means that the polar of this convex cell is contained in another peril to. In another prototype. And the important thing is that: so, here, what we would like to do, we would like to give an upper estimate for the volume of this polar set. And now, because of this containment, this gives an upper bound for the volume of the prime polar. And on the other hand, we can relate the volume of this pherotope to the volume of the simplex. Namely, the volume of the palotope is just 2 to the d times d factorial times the volume of the simplex. Just because we know, like. Simplex, just because we know like how the paradox of the simplex looks like. Okay, so first of all, so do we have an estimate for the volume of the simplex? So remember, this was the maximum volume simplex contained in P, and we have estimate for that. If P is in John's position, then there is a simplex with volume at least that much, and that is the Dworesky-Rogers lemma. So we have a lower bound for the volume of S. And the other important ingredient is that if T is centrally Ingredient is that if T is centrally symmetric, then we have an inequality for the product of T and T polar, and that is the Blashka-Santo inequality, which gives us an upper bound for this product. And so we can just put these two things together. So this was the containment that we had. Now we know that the volume of t is expressed in terms of the volume of the simplex. We also have that from this inequality, we will have an upper bound on volume of t. An upper bound on volume of t polar in terms of volume of t. We just divide across by volume of t and we just put everything together. So here there is a volume of t from Lashka-Santalo, then we just replace it by volume of s that we know. Now here we apply the Duresky Rogers lemma, which gives us a bound on the volume of s. And we put everything together. And I just want to leave one volume of the unit ball there. And it turns out that it is the order of d to the 3d over 2 times. Order of d to the 3d over 2 times the volume of the unit ball, but we know that the unit ball is containing p because p was in John's position, and therefore we get that the ratio between these two things is at most d to the 3d over 2. And that is what we wanted to prove. So this is the optimal volume estimate. So now remember the conjecture is d to the d over 2 in general. And now I just want to conclude. So remember, this was our corollary that was coming from the That was coming from the lemma: that if we have a convex politop which is in John's position, or its polar is in John's position, then we can select at most two vertices of it with this containment. And our conjecture is that, well, instead of one over d square here, you can probably write one over d. And if we manage to prove this theorem, then this would imply the sharp estimates for both the quantitative volume. Estimates for both the quantitative volume and the quantitative diameter theorem. But notice that this is very strong. So this would mean that the Steinitz, the quantitative Steinitz holds for essentially a constant radius instead of... So we know that according to the conjecture, the best radius is one over the square root of d. On the other hand, we have an extra information, namely that these points form a John's decomposition of the identity. So somehow we would need to prove a stronger version of To prove a stronger version of quantitative steins for a smaller set of points, but so this would imply the optimal bound. So, this is one way to prove it. Well, let's hope that we have one week. Thanks for your attention. And one more very important slide in Spanish. I think we can tell one or two of these questions. First of all, uh can we say you go by some edits or like change matrix? Because all as I just show your proof, this engravium can be the same. Well, I mean if we if we have an ellipsoid then of course we can just apply an affine transformation now for for general metrics the problem here is that it is essential. The problem here is that it is essential that we have this duality between taking polars. And when we have the unit ball inside, then we know that, well, if k is continuing in the ball, then the polar is going to continue in the ball and so on. So we can just move vice versa. Now, for general metrics, I am not so sure. But it's definitely one thing to look at. thing to look at but yeah yeah yeah absolutely yeah yeah yeah yeah i'll think of this how about about this version if we have uh instead of a volume you have a number of points so so like the discrete version this hit version yeah so you proved some some pablo proved some some theorems for the discrete case but i want to know some uh tony and style yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but but yeah, so these methods are very, very much continuous here, I would say that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so this proof is not, I don't think it is going to summation. Maybe you can do some we use polytops, maybe you can find some not not for for grids, not for related to the market. Yeah. The other way around, probably your method is, yeah, maybe. But now I don't see a direct way for doing that because here, so everything here was really containment in a ball or containment in a simplex. That was the crux of the argument. And now when you have only like a finite number of points and you want to count it, then I think this Duanion type discrete versions will be much more useful. Yeah, yeah. We can ask them later, but let's thank again.
