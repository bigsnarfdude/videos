Then, the aim of this talk is to present some results on NOSMUTA analysis that I have obtained in collaboration with Claudia Nor Alves and the Silva. In particular, I want to present here an Osmoot version of the classical. Of the classical and Functon theorem results for C1 functionals defined on reflexive Banach space. We was able to extend these classical results to circuit-type functionals. And this is the aim of this talk, to present these abstract results and to give you some examples of application of this abstract theorem. Abstract theorem. Then, in the last years, of course, the study of nosmut analysis in a wide sense is a topic that was considered by several mathematicians, also in relation with several applications that naturally arising studying some physical models. Okay, I am interested here on a special class of On a special class of nosmut functionals that are called in literature sulking functionals. I will be more clear later what I mean for sulking type functions. I want to point out here that the main result that I want to present during this talk is based on the paper that I wrote in collaboration with Claudia Noral. Collaboration with Claudia Noralbes and Da Silva, and that will appear in AZII in control optimization and calculus of variations. Some of the methods that we used along our proof are based on some abstract topological arguments that you can find in this monograph that I brought recently in collaboration with the In collaboration with Patricia Pucci from the University of Perugia. Then, essentially, this is the two references that I want to mention here at the beginning of this talk in order to give you the possibility to understand more about these abstract results. Then, let me start with some classical factors. With some classical fact about Funton theorem. Okay, so in a classical and quoted paper, Bash studied this abstract theorem that in some sense say this. If you have a C1 functional that has a correct geometry and you assume also that a symmetry assumption on this functional Assumption on this functional, then under a suitable geometrical condition, you can ensure the existence of infinitely many critical points of this functional defined on a reflexive Banach space. Then, the crucial assumption for the classical Fontaine theorem is the reflexivity of the Banach space, the geometry of the functional, and the symmetry assumption on the functional. If you have The functional. If you have all these three assumptions, you can ensure the existence of at least a sequence of infinitely many critical points. And this is essentially the results of Barsch and Willem. I don't want to be more concrete about the geometry of the classical Fronten results, because it's a little bit involved. because he's a little bit involved, and I don't have time to recall you this classical results that, of course, is almost no in the literature on this subject. Okay, starting from the Bach theorem, many authors are interested, study the existence of infinitely many solutions for functional defined on a Banach space X. And to apply these abstract results to concrete situations in order to obtain the existence of infinitely weak solutions, for instance, for suitable class of analytic problems. Then, of course, you have also a dual version of the classical results of the Funta theorem. Then, in the literature, in the classical literature, you have the classical results of Bach and Willen and also And we learn, and also the dual version of this classical results. And under different geometry assumptions, you have the existence of infinitely many critical points. Okay, in 1995, Bash and Wu Leng studied the existence of a multiple solution for a Diricre problem involving convex non-linearity by proving a dual, more general version of the. A more general version of the Frontan theorem. Then, the existence of infinitely many critical points, I repeat again, is essential in order to have infinitely many weak solutions for several classes of elliptic problems. For instance, the classical Dilecre problem. Some years later, Batcam and Colling established a full-time type results for an indefinite functional phi of class C1, making Of class C1, making use of the tau topology introduced by Kranceski Salkin and proving a suitable extension of the classical Bursko-Ulam theorem by using topological arguments, in particular the grid theory methods. We emphasize that by arguing as Sulting and the Coal for a critical Akina San Koi by Copling and Wang are able to prove a more first result obtained by batcanti for the functional phi. Field. Finally, some fontant type results was established in Zoo, in a paper by Zoo, without the compactness Palisme condition as a meaningful consequence of this existence of infinitely many solutions for some class of non-linear Schrodinger equation and the declared boundary value problem. And the declared boundary value problem without the classical assumption of the Ambroset Tirabinovitz super quadratic condition on the non-linear data. Then you had a several extensions, all case, with some different arguments about the topology that you considered obtaining these results. I won't point out that. Point out that a crucial point here is that the functional phi is of class C one, but it is possible to study also the existence, for instance, of infinitely many critical in the Nosmut setting if phi is not of class C one. Then the question is: Is it possible to obtain a generalization of this classical result? Of these classical results to the Nosmut setting. For instance, in this direction, in the locally Lipschitz continuous case, these results, the extension of the Fulton theorem to this new contest, has been done by DAI. I want to be more clear later about this fact. However, you have a good machinery here that can be used in order to obtain. That can be used in order to obtain several generalizations, several directions of the abstract results of Bach and Willem. For instance, I want to mention here the classical theory of Clark and Chang about locally Lipschitz continuous functionals. As is well known in literature, you have, for instance, the Mountain Pass theorem that can be also proved in this new set. Neuron spectrating, and also in this case, you can prove an analogous version of the Fontan type results. That is exactly the results of DAI. Here, we are interested on the Sulking-type functional case. In particular, I want to be recall you what is a Sulking-type functional is just a functional defined in our setting in a reflexive. Our setting in a reflexive Banach space X that is a sum of two functional phi and psi, where phi is of a class C1 depended on X, and P C is a convex lower semi-continuous functional that is proper. It's that psi is not identically equal to plus infinity. Then, a functional of this form is called in literature a Sulking type of. A circing type functional. And the main idea is to prove the font and type result as well as the extension, the dual version of the font and type theorem to this class of no smooth functional. This is not exactly obvious, and this is exactly the the results that we have obtained in collaboration with Alves and Alves and the Silva. And I want to be emphasize the problem that I repeat again: is it possible to prove a full-type theorem for type functionals? Here, there are a lot of problems that you can encounter if you try to obtain these results. Not permit the classic geometry in the pure local Lipschitz case, that means psi is zero and the first term phi is locally Lipschitz, the results have been done by die, as was the dual of the Fontaine. Why is necessary or of Or of interest to study this argument since you can try to obtain application of these abstract results. Let me emphasize, for instance, that G and Sulking study the existence of infinitely many solutions for this kind of Schrodinger equation that you can see in the equation one, requiring that the potential D is continuous. Is continuous and the coercive. Then, by using a suitable version of the Fontaine theorem, you can try to attach this problem requiring a suitable assumption on the term V and that appear in this equation. And this is interesting because it is exactly the starting point that. Point that we have first when we try to obtain the abstract theorem in order to solve exactly this toy model. Okay, you have indeed that energy function associated to this function is given in equation two, and you check solution in a suitable sobo space that is a subspace of. That is a subspace of H0, H1, Rn, that is exactly the space E that is defined in the following way here. Okay, you check infinitely many solutions, and we emphasize that depending on the choice of V, the functional J0 may or not made to take the value plus infinity in A, and in particular, J0 is not of a class C1. Moreover, as made in Albes. As made in Alves and Moraes, Alves and G and Squacina, and also Sulking, studied the energy functional J0 and proving that this functional can be decomposed as a sum of a functional of a class C1 and of a functional that is convex lower semi-continuous that you can call J2. Then the functional J0 that govern J0 that govern this toy model is a sucking type of functional. And if you have a correct fundament type results for this class of functionals, you can obtain the existence of infinitely many solutions. Okay, in order to prove the main results, their main results Finally, a careful analysis of this deformation lemma ensures that the font and minimax level are also critical value of the functional J0. functional J0. For the sake of completeness, we point out that a k-point along the proof of g and sulkin is given by the smoothness of the energy functional j0 when the integral, the energy integral that you consider are taken on smooth bounded domain omega in Rn, that is, more clearly, that the functional, the energy functional of the The energy functional of the problem is of class C1 in H1 omega, where omega is a domain bound domain of Rn. This assumption is crucial in order to attach the problem following the strategy on G. But we don't want to use this local regularity of the function. We want to obtain Want to obtain in some sense different results by using the Nosmut version, a suitable Nosmut version of the Fontan type results. Again, I repeat that this problem was also studied as an application in the paper in collaboration with Alves and Dasilba. In this paper, a complete and positive answer to problem Q1 is given by proving. One is given by proving an osmotic version of the classical Barch theorem for Sulking-type functionals. The answer then is yes, you can prove a Fulton-type theorem for Sulking-type functional, but in order to do this, you need to introduce some suitable topological arguments in this new setting, and in particular, a K-point is to prove. A K-point is to prove a suitable equivariant version of the deformation lemma proved in the classical results by Sulking. For this, we introduce a notion that I don't have time to describe completely here, but this is a notion of amissibility. This notion is crucial in order to study the action of a topological group that act on That act on the energy function that you consider in the new abstract theorem that we want to prove. And I point out that this notion of G invariance, this new notion that we use in our paper, gives us, in the classical case, in which the action is exactly the action of the Exactly, the action of the Zeta2 group on the energy functional, exactly the same antipodal action that is considered by Sulking in the classical version that he studied. Then, in some sense, this notion of geomissibility is the natural expansion of the Sulking type condition in this new setting. Condition in this new setting that we want to consider. Okay, I repeat again that you need in order to obtain the abstract results in the Nosmut version also a different notion, a different geometry. And then I can introduce this geometry and hyperfunctional. That is good in the sense of the topology, and you also have a correct geometry. Then, the functional under this topological and geometrical arguments admits the sequence of infinite theoretical level values. Okay, you have this extension and you can apply these abstract results to different problems. Results to different problems. Also, the dual version of the font and type results can be done with a lot of problems that naturally appear in the proof, but it is possible to do this. For instance, a key point is to obtain an HAINS generalization of the classical Haynes results in this setting. Okay, I don't have time to describe here this. Trying to describe here the theory that I used in order to do also the generalization of the dual version of the Fontan type results. I want to just point out here that you can prove by using this abstract notion the existence of infinitely many weak solutions for this class of elliptic problem given in P1. You have a differential influence. P1, you have a differential inclusion. I don't want to describe here exactly the problem because I don't have time. You also attach the existence of infinitely many solutions for a problem P2. And also in this case, I not want to describe the problem, but you can use the new theorem in order to obtain the existence of infinitely many solutions also for this problem here. And at the end, I And at the end, I also point out that the main results can be used also for the one Laplacian in order to obtain the existence of infinitely many solutions for problem P3. All these are given in the main paper. Some observation here, a possible line of research that we are currently studying in collaboration with ALVES is to start. With ALVES is to study some results in which we are able to remove the reflexivity assumption on the Banach space in which the energy functional is defined. This will be essential in order to treat some problems that naturally appear in the literature. Okay, I don't have more time. Then, thank you for your attention, and I hope that the results. That the results that I present to you was of interest. Thank you.
