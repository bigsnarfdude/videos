from Institute for Process Engineering, and he's going to talk about pseudo-particle modeling from reactions to reactors. And the floor is all yours, Professor Gay. Thank you, Mayank. And glad to have this special opportunity to speak here. And today I talk about kind of simplified molecular dynamics. The molecular dynamics model called pseudo-particle modeling. And I have been done for many years, but there are some recent progress. And it is more related to chemical engineering, but in fact, it's also applicable to many different areas. So I'll start with some general background. So in chemical engineering, we have In chemical engineering, we have typical multi-scale, multi-level structures. And for this, we start from the electrons and finally end up at the whole environment. So usually we have good understanding at the quantum molecular dynamics. That is the quantum molecular dynamics of the particle and reactor level, but in many cases, we do not have enough knowledge about what in between. So, this is as put forward by Professor Chinghai Li, that these are the meshoscales. And in fact, this work is more related to the meshoscale between the molecules. Meshoscale between the molecules to the particles. So we can imagine we have, for example, in many catalytic processes, we have this kind of porous particles. And in these particles, we have many very complicated power structures. And the diffusion, the reaction, and fluid flow in these power structures. These power structures is very complicated. So, we need some new method to explain this behavior. But in terms of the simulation methods, we find there is a big gap between the models available and the things we actually need to do. So, for example, we have certainly many. For example, we have certainly many microscopic methods like molecular dynamics, and we have different softwares. But usually, it's computational cost will not allow us to go beyond 10 or dozens of nanometers, and the corresponding time is also around nanoseconds. Around nanoseconds. And on the other hand, we have the CFD methods, and it's hard to go down to the micro range because of the breakdown of the continuum methods and also because of the number of the cells we need. So, how we can fill this gap between the nano to the macro range where we can do that. Range where we have very strong coupling between reaction diffusion and fluid flow. So, we need a kind of method that can host the lack of scale separation in this range. And there is also, that means we have very strong dependence of the properties like viscosity, diffusion rate on the scale and structure of the. On the scale and structure of this range, and also we have the very clear non-linear effect like non-Newton effect and the slip at the wall, and also non-equilibrium effect, like the isotropic behavior. So, we need some kind of new method. So, in terms of simulation methods, this is a kind of summary and from the Summary and from the mathematical models to the algorithm. And we find that basically we have two kinds of methods, the continuum-based, no matter you are dealing with solid mechanics of radium mechanics, and the discrete methods like the molecular dynamics at the micro scale and discrete element methods at the macro scale. Method at the macro scale, and there are many variants of it by cost-graining or stochastic processes. But finally, in terms of the computational algorithm, we actually have three types of algorithm. One we call the particle-based, it's like ranging, and then we have the lattice or matrix-based, sorry. Sorry, it depends on what kind of schemes we use. And like last sportsman, we have very simple ones, but traditional CFD method usually needs global communication when you have parallel computation. So it's not a very trivial method. And but we noticed that although in many cases discrete methods have higher computational cost, but it also have very good properties in terms of computation. One is we call the locality. So when you use the particles to present a free flow of the solid material, then you need only the local interaction between the particles. Local interaction between the particle and its neighbors, and so this means you can have a very extensive scalable parallel algorithm. And also, we have additivity. I mean, when you have the interaction between this pair of particles, then you can also process another pair of particles because they are falling. Because their forces are additive. So, this is a fine-grained parallelism. So, this is also good for high-performance computation. And also, the good thing is for different particle methods like MD to DPD, LBM, or DM at SPH at different scales, we actually have very similar. We actually have very similar algorithms. So, and you can develop some DM method model based on MD software. So, this is good for the software development. And so, in this background, we try to find some new methods at the molecular. New methods at the molecular level to cope with the nano to macro scale range. So in this regard, we noticed that for the molecular dynamic simulation, we actually have two kinds of models. One is so-called soft sphere models. We use time-driven synchronized algorithms and this algorithm. This algorithm is very scalable, as I mentioned. You have the locality and activity, but the problem is for dilute system, for example, our gas molecules in normal conditions, actually, this kind of time integration is very time-consuming and the steps are really, really small compared to its Small compared to its free flight distance. So, also, it's not accurate enough because we still need some potentials to numerically integrate these potentials. And another kind of method is so-called hard sphere models. These kind of models are actually event-driven and asynchronized. So, it can have So, it can have very accurate machine accuracy for the collision between these particles. And it's also efficient for the dilute case. But the problem is not so scalable. Usually it's n log n complexibility, but in real case, for parallel computation, it's usually square root n. So this is not a very good thing. Very good thing. This is mainly because the computational algorithm is like this: you need a big global tree to schedule all these collisions between these particles. So once you get the latest one, then you need to update the whole tree because you will have many events invalid, and then you need to update it. Need to update it. So, this kind of algorithm you can imagine, it's not so scalable and not easy to parallelize it. So, the basic idea behind the pseudo-particle modeling is we try to combine the virtues of these two kinds of methods, the hard sphere and the soft sphere. So that means we try to To use this traditional soft sphere model for the displacement of these particles, but we use the hard sphere model for the collision between these particles. And so this is the collision model, it's a hard sphere, and this whole time evolution is basically solved. Basically, a soft sphere model. So, with the combination of these two kinds of models, we actually can first we can enlarge this time step for about 100 times for diluted gas. And then the neighbor of these particles will decrease to about 10 and About 10, and so it's also a great speed up, and also the operations involved is very simple. So, it's also a decrease of the computational cost. So, altogether, we may be three, maybe four to five orders faster than traditional molecular dynamics. And it can also keep the machine accuracy for the in terms of. In terms of energy and momentum balance. So, this gives us the possibility to simulate a large system. But the problem is how we can map these kind of models to the traditional MD models and map to the real gas or flight properties. So, then we also use the numerical. Also, use the numerical simulation method. So, we just explore the whole parameter space of these models. And then, with this computation of the effective properties, we actually can finally reach some correlations that can map the properties of these pseudoparticles to the real hard sphere model. And you can see for a very wide For a very wide range, we actually can have a very good mapping between these two kinds of particles. And this is in terms of the compressibility. That means the equation of state can be well described and also for the self-diffusion and also for the effective shear viscosities. their viscosities. So that means we can, we actually invented a kind of pseudo-particle in the machine, but we can map these properties to the real world. So this is the basic idea. And we can also play with these pseudo-molecules to introduce the reactions like this type ABC, the traditional Reaction types are all available in this case, and we can generate some new particles in our simulation. For example, in this case, we can decompose this A into B and C molecules, and then they can also evolve to interact with each other, and then leaving each other. Leaving each other. So, this is also possible for the reactions. And with this fundamental, we can implement it at high large scale and for high performance computing. This is the collision between these particles to because we may have multiple collisions between these particles, so we need kind of status. Kind of stochastic method to resolve the collision order. And actually, we are just using different order in turn to keep the anisotropy to keep the isotropy of these collisions. And when you have long chains of these collisions, we will process these chains in parallel and randomize the collision between these. The collision between these particles in these chains. So, this gave us close resemblance to the real hard sphere model. And we also need to use parallel computing to reach high to reach large scale. And this is basically a domain. is basically a dominant decomposition method. So you need to exchange the information of the particles at the boundaries and you can use the simple shift model of the message passing. So this is also good for the so-called heterogeneous computing like the use of CPUs. Of CPOs and the GPOs together. So actually, the collisions between the particles can be processed on the GPUs in parallel. And you can also use this method with very complex boundaries. So we can use the static particles to construct a boundary, but it's not efficient. And then we also introduce some. And we also introduce some geometric boundaries. And finally, if you need to go to very complicated structure, you can use the triangles and using the traditional mesh-based method to generate the boundaries. So you can also, you are not necessarily using just the spheres, you can also use these elixir particles and to mimic like. To mimic like the larger molecules. And we also need to introduce some inlet and outlet conditions for these particles. So this is similar to molecular dynamics, but also have its own features. So for example, in that region, we will generate some kind of Generate some kind of particle for a certain distribution and impose some flow flow in this area. So you can then driven these particles through this computational area. And in the outlet part, we also introduce some PID control mechanism to control the velocity and the density in this outlet region to make. Let region to mimic the conditions in the downflow stream. And with this, you can see this kind of stimulation animation. And this is you can see the deformation of a liquid nanodrop in this gas flow. And in fact, this kind of computation can be This kind of computation can be implemented in parallel and using the CPOs and the GPOs for this liquid part and CPOs for this gas part using the pseudo-particles and also hard spheres together. And we also can use this so-called multi-level skin invert. Multi-level skin invert vertex list to reordering these neighbors of the collision of particles. And with this, we can also increase the performance by about 40 percent. And this is also another technique to speed up the computation. We can overlap the computation and data. Computation and data communication for each process. So the middle part is computed and the boundary part is in communication. And then you change these tasks so you can get high performance at very large scales. And to validate the speed of this method, we can experiment with different scales. Experiment with different scale simulations. So, traditionally, with hard sphere, with hard sphere model, we have this kind of behavior. So, you increase the scale and the computational speed, the time is actually increasing. And in our case, we use just the pseudo-particles and the hard sphere model together, and we can keep almost this efficiency consistent. Consistent. So, this is the performance, and we can also experiment with some traditional high-speed flow test using this single particle to reproduce the shock wave around it. And you can see these different drag coefficients is comparable to the experimental earlier. Comparable to the experimental correlations, and you can also reproduce the fluid flow. And another test is you have this gas in this chamber. And then if you open the door here, then this gas will shoot into this vacuum chamber. And you can see the number of particles in this vacuum chamber. And these are the simulation results for the different methods. And you can see. The different methods, and you can see our method is closely really close to the most radius hard sphere models. And next, I just talk some about the applications. So one thing is we can, from macro scale level, we can reproduce the reaction near an active site and And it's coupled with the diffusion. So, one of the very interesting discovery is that we used to imagine that around a single active site, you have this very stable concentration distribution. This is predicted by the traditional continuum method. Even if you consider the fluctuations at the micro scale, this should be something like this, the blue line. This is the blue line. And what we actually obtained is this red line. You can also see the animation here. You have very significant concentration fluctuation at this active site. And this is we called a kind of coupling between the diffusion and reaction. Because when you have the reaction here, then you will generate the product molecules. To the product molecules, and these product molecules will actually hinder the diffusion of the reactants into this active site. So then there is alternation between the reactants and the product molecules. So this is kind of large fluctuation. So with this, we can explain the behavior very clearly. Hear it very clearly and also more accurately than the traditional continuum-based methods. And if you have two this kind of sites, and it depends on what kind of reaction is happening, if you have the same reaction at these two sites, then you will find if these two sites are closer, then the yield is The yield is increasing because it's decreasing the computation between these two sites. And if you have this sequential reaction A to B to C, then you will see with the increase of this distance, you will see the lower of the Of the conversion rate. So, this may be a good idea to optimize the distribution of the active sites for catalytic design. And so, actually, you will find this kind of optimal parameter range for the coupling of reaction diffusion. And in this ranking, you can have the best performance for the catalysts. And there are more completed cases we can address. And because of time it, I must maybe speed up the presentation. And another thing is you can deal with really zero structure like the zeolite. The zeolite catalyst and to see the coke deposition process. And for short, you will find two kinds of behavior. One is the coke deposition will decrease the performance of the catalyst just gradually. And for the other is that Other is that you have a plateau first and then decrease very quickly. So we can now explain why, because for this model, actually, the coke deposition is random and but it directs very fast and it will block these cells very quickly. But the number of blocked cells is increased gradually, so you can see this gradual behavior. But for this But for this case, you have very uniform cock distribution. And so you can see the cells are blocked gradually, but at a critical size, you will decrease the diffusion very significantly. So you can see you have the plateau here and then decrease very quickly. So with this simulation, I can explain why there are such Explain why there are such behavior. And the second direction for the application is how we can optimize these power structures. So if you have, you were given a certain volume and you need to make a full use of this volume, then we have two choices. We can construct a very long and thin channel, or we can We can construct a very short and wide channel, and you will find that with these different channels, you actually do not have the good performance. So you can see this is for here, and this is for here. And actually, the best performance is obtained when you have a certain aspect ratio at this point. So, this is a very simple case for the Coupling of the reaction and diffusion at the macro scale, but you can go to more complicated cases. And if you have blocked, you block one end and if you block the middle of the channel, then you get a similar different performance, but for different shape of this. Different shape of these channels. And then you can go to more complex cases like this T shape or cross shape. And you also have this best point. And if you go to this more complicated cases, you also have a best point here. So in fact, you can experiment with a real catalytic particle. Catalytic particle, if you have the capability to measure all its power structure, then this can be used as the boundary conditions in our simulation and we can reproduce the whole flow field, include the concentration distribution, include all the reactions inside and outside this particle. So then you can experiment with different particle structure. Different particle structure shape and also the pulse structures to find which is the best one for this coupling. And in fact, we have some experiments for some specific materials and you can see with different pore size you can have this is not a good case you cannot have much reactance inside this material. Inside this material, but this is much better. And also for absorption process, and this is for this kind of structure, you can only absorb the material, the gases at the outer layer. And this is for almost the whole particle. And the third direction is just for the nano systems. So we can So, we can simulate the nanoflow and the macro flow using this molecular scale method with much less computation. So, for example, we simulated a droplet in nano channel using the gas for the PPM for the gas and for the liquid molecules. And you can see this kind of behavior. So the liquid droplet is deforming in this channel, and you can see different flow regimes when you have different driven velocities. And you can also see how it can interact with a nanoparticle here. So sometimes it will just penetrate this droplet, and sometimes they will just then over. Just vanilla the particle. So, and this is kind of interaction between the particle and the gas in animation. You can see the movement of these molecules and these gas particles, that is the solar particles. So, if in extension, we can also use this method at larger scales by parallel computing. By parallel computing, we can simulate the, for example, the optimization of the liquid jet in a chamber. And also, we can use this method to simulate some turbine machine for the integration of its fields. And also, you can see here this computational This is the computational process and how these liquid particles will be break up under the fluid flow. So this and also it's possible to simulate very high speed flow like the entering of the vehicles into the atmosphere. Into the atmosphere region. And in this case, at the surface of these materials, you will have very high speed. And it's not good for the traditional CFD or MD method, but it's possible for the pseudo-particle method. And we can reproduce the, for example, the temperature distribution near this. Distribution near this wall, and it's where you have a very large aerodynamic effect, and so it's necessary to understand this layer more clearly. Finally, But but in the moment of the other masking now makes the masks um it's passive stuff. Can you put it in chat that his uh you've lost the connection with him? He's trying to connect back, I guess you are muted. You are muted. We can't hear you. Can you hear us? Okay, is that okay? Yes, now it's okay. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. I just and yeah, so this will kind of it stopped at the mask where you actually were talking about the droplets with the personality. Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, so I go back. Okay. So another potential application of this pseudo-particle modeling is for the filtration of nano aerosols because at different scales. At different scales, you have different interception mechanisms for this. Professor K, we are not looking at your computer screen. We are just looking at your camera. Okay, please share. Okay, I need to share my screen again. Yes. Sorry, I cannot see the the button again. Maybe I have used up my time. Is that a problem? I don't know. I just connect, but it's I almost end up with my presentation already. Maybe just I stop here. So, okay, okay. Let's see if we have. So, let's see if we have a couple of questions from the audience and then we'll call it a day. Yeah, sorry, I cannot show you the slides again. Yeah, that's fine. Thank you, Professor Geifer. It was a really, really wide array of applications that you are working at the Institute of Process Engineering. Let's see if we have some questions and comments from the audience over here. Hello? Okay. Well, in that case, it is quite early for you. And then Quite early for you, and then we are reaching also towards the last end of the day. But thank you a lot for sharing the kind of applications you're working on. And we'll definitely pick up on some of these interesting ideas. So let's close the day four of our CMO Birds workshop. Really, really wide range of topics. And tomorrow, it is a mix of industry as well as one time. As well as one talk from Luke Deke, which is a very fundamental one on mass transport transfer, as well as momentum transfer at the interface of atmosphere and sea surface. So thank you all for participating in this EMOverse workshops. This is the close of day four, and I'll see you all tomorrow morning. Take care. Bye-bye.
