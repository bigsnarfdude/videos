Thank you, Carolina, for the introduction and for the invitation. It's my distinguished pleasure to be here, to attend this very nice conference with so various topics and diverse and in such wonderful place. I took inspiration from yesterday's talks and I prepared a very last minute slide that will give you an overview of the activities we're developing in the numerical group at the Numerical group at the University of Louis-Normandy in France, Department of Applied Magnetics. So, our main job is to develop numerical codes, optimize high performance computing, that means parallel, based on mathematically sound methods that can be used to solve realistic problems coming from different fields of application. And you have here the three main fields of application. The three main fields of application of our work. The first one concerns classical fluid mechanics. That means we develop solvers to solve Navier-Stokes equations with application mainly in studying vortical structures in classical fluids. And recently, with colleagues from Italian, Estonia, and Brighton, UK, we published a book about the vortex units, the mathematical models, plus the numerical verification of these models. Of these models. If you add to the Navier-Stokes equation an energy equation and in particular an enthalpy equation that can take into account the liquid-solid phase change, we end up with a system that can simulate the ice formation or the ice melting, which is unfortunately a very timely topic today, but also phase change materials. Phase change material nowadays used as passive. Is used as passive devices for thermal regulation and also to store green energies. You know, the problem with green energy is not how to produce them, but how to store this energy. So take solar power plants. They produce energy during the day. This energy can be used to melt these materials and during the night, where of course there's no energy production, we recover some energy from We recover some energy from these materials, which become again solid. So, this is a very interesting application. And finally, the third field of application, which is more in line with the title of the workshop, is numerical solvers for superfluid, and in particular for quantum turbulence in superfluid helium in Bose-Arts and Constantine. So, we have been developing solvers for different types of the Solvers for different types of the Gross-Pitevsky equations, and we did a huge simulation of quantum turbulence, as you'll see in my presentation. So, today I will tell you the story how to conciliate two different worlds. This is very difficult nowadays. The world of classical fluids with particular vertical structures and the world of superfluids with very strange creations. With very strange creatures, which are quantized vortices. And this work was done in the framework of the Qt project, so quantum turbulence exploration by high-performance computing. And the presentation I'm giving today is a joint work with Mark Etienne Brachel, who is a migrant senior researcher at CNRS at École Normale, two postdocs, Zen Tong Zhang and Joe Sadaka. Zhang and Jose Hedeka, and a former PhD, Viktor Kauf. So, this program gathered five mathematicians and five physicists, and there was an interesting interaction and collaboration between the two fields. And the results you'll see here, this coupling between non-stocks and gross PTISQA, which is the first model, to the best of our knowledge published in the literature for this coupling. In the literature for this coupling, you'll see that it has ingredients coming from mathematics and also from physics. Okay, so when thinking about coupling classical fluids with superfluids, the central notion that you have to consider is the notion of vortex. And the meaning of a vortex is different in classical fluids and in superfluids. In classical fluids, I think Classical fluids, I think our brain has integrated some intuition of the notions of velocity, pressure, and maybe vorticity due to everyday experience and everyday encounters with vortices. Some of these encounters are very nice and very pleasant. The Bow River Falls nearby. Some of them are more traumatic, tornadoes, hurricanes, siphons. But our intuition tells us that. Tells us that in such vortices you have low pressure in the center and a high rotation around the vortic. But our brain didn't integrate the main governing laws for this kind of flows, which are the Navier-Stokes equations, and in particular the turbulence that these equations can generate. These are two main problems unsolved nowadays in mathematics and also. In mathematics and also physics, characterizing solutions of Nadius-Tokes equation and also solving the problem of turbulence, which is a very important problem for our existence. So if you put together classical vortices, you have here a very scholar simulation that was published with colleagues from Sorbonne in a book called Computational Projects Solved with MATLAB. What do you have to? Lab, what do you have to see in this simulation? That even thought you start initially with vortices of the same size, due to the viscosity, which is the main ingredient in this flow, finally you end up with vortices of all scales that will fill all the range of scales in the flow and all intensities. So, this is a main hypothesis in Hypothesis in the theory of turbulence. So the vorticity, which is the curl of the velocity, will occupy all scales and form a continuum. Another ingredient is the viscosity appearing here in the dissipation term in the momentum equation. If the dissipa if this viscosity goes to zero, we obtain the Euler equation that will be used as a hydrodynamic analogy for superfluids. Analogy for superfluids. When we go to superfluids now, we have a different view of this notion of vortex. If we take a very known and classical superfluid system, which is the Bose-Einstein condensate, obtained if you bring a gas at very cold temperature, ungodly cold temperature, around nano Kelvin, when this gas, although the atoms of the gas will behave as one, Would behave as one, and this system admits a macroscopic description by the complex wave function. And of course, the Schrodinger or Gross-Pitowski equation that will describe exactly this system. We have an hydrodynamic analogy for this system based on Madeline transformation, and the model square of the wave function is the atomic density. Atomic density and the gradient of the phase will give the velocity. And you have here an example of a simulation of BC with a single vortex line. This is an ideal surface of low density. So we can easily identify vortices with these lines where the density vanishes. And of course, if you draw the phase, you have a phase discretion around the vortex. The problem is that in this hydrodynamic and In this hydrodynamic analogy, the velocity is singular, and the singularity goes as one of r if you go to the center of the vortic. Another particular characteristic of the quantized vortices is that the circulation has quantized. It has only integer values of the ratio h over m. And you remember this was not the case in classical fluids where you could have. Where you could have vortices of different intensities, different circulations. If you put together quantized vortices, you obtain quantum turbulence. It's also called super turbulence. And you see here in this movie that if you start with vortices, these vortices will never change the size and will never change the circulation. They will remain. Circulation, they will remain always the same, but they interact strongly, and this kind of turbulence is also called tangle turbulence. And these are analogies with classical turbulence, and this is still a matter of debate in the community. Now, we have the picture of classical vortices, the picture of quantized vortices. Let's put them together. And this is the problem in helium. Superfluid helium, which is obtained at cold temperatures, but not as cold as VC, around 2 Kelvin. And you see here a visualization, this is experimental, not numerical, of vortices in a rotating container of helium. And you see that these vortices, quantized vortices, are present in the flow and are embedded in. Embedded in classical flow. So the difficulty in superfluid helium is that the two phases, the normal fluid and the superfluid, coexist. And the model of the two fluid derived by Tiza and then formalized by Lando was at that time a little bit heretic because the main hypothesis behind this model is that the two flows have. Flows have velocity fields that are completely independent. And we'll see that the two flows will communicate, will interact only by the existence of superfluid vortices in the superfluid fracture. So the difficulty in describing helium comes from the mixture of these two phases and also for Also, for the large span of scales present in the flow. So these quantized vortices are very tiny vortices of the size of the atom, of the angstrom, 10 to the minus 10. And the dimension of the container is 1 meter. So you have a range scale going to 1 to 10 to the power 10. So you can imagine that numerical. Can imagine that numerically it's impossible to simulate such systems. So, as always, we have to make a compromise in picking a model. And at this very end, of course, for temperatures that are higher than the lambda temperature, around 10.17 Kelvin, of course you have the established stock descriptions. There are a lot of people working on classical turbulence. This is numerically at least well known. Numerically, at least, well known. If you go on the other end, so very cold temperatures close to zero Kelvin, you have a description that is reasonably good by the Pitovsky equation. Even thought, as a matter of debate, if the GP is, well, a good model for helium. It's a good model for BC, but not exactly for helium. So the question we addressed is what model to be used in the To be used in between two. So for intermediate temperatures, where you have non-negligible classical and superfluid fractions. Let's go through these models. So super turbulence, you had an idea how to deal with this, and this was done by the pioneer work of Caroline Noor, Marie-Cabide, and Mac Pachet in 1997. It's a long time ago. It's a long time ago. So, recently, we rediscovered this topic and also addressed it from the high-performance computing point of view. And we publish new numerical benchmarks for quantum turbulence based on the Gross-Pitaevsky equation reading here without trapping potential in this case and periodic bounding potential. If If you want to couple the two phases now, superfluid and classical fluid, one of the basic ideas was to say that, okay, for the classical fluid, this is a viscous fluid. We take navigators, no problem. For the superfluid, this is a fluid without viscosity. Because the hydrodynamic harmology of the GP equation is the Euler equation. Going through some hypothetical. Going through some hypothesis, of course. And let's couple Navi-Stock's equation for the classical fluid, viscous, with the Euler equation for the non-viscous fluid. Euler equation also has been studied for many, many decades. This ends up to the HBBK model, Holvinen, Vekarevich, Kolatnikov model, which is in fact the Which is in fact the coupling of two Davius-Tox type equations. You have the n flow, which is the normal flow, and the superfood flow. You have here incompressible flows, so divergence-free velocity fields, with momentum equations, which are the same, and the coupling is through a friction force. So, the novelty of this method is to derive a phenomenological friction force. Friction force that will make interact the two fluids. Of course, we have a viscosity for the normal fluid and no viscosity or very low viscosity for the superfluid. So what's the idea behind this model is that all these vortices that I underlined the fact that they play a major role in this coupling were averaged. So we consider that all vortices are parallel, it's a bucket. Our parallel, it's a bucket. We take the average, and you have an omega, which is a coarse-grained superfluid vorticity. And this omega is the main ingredient in the expression of the friction force. This is physics, this is phenomenology, you can't fight against. So, we publish also a paper about the high-order statistics and intermittency of this model because what is interesting. Model because what is interesting with this model is Navi-Stocks type model. So, all theories of statistical turbulence can be applied to this model. But the drawback of this HVBK model is that all the superfluid vortex part disappeared. So, how to take it into account? Very recent models coupled vortex filaments. Coupled vortex filaments, which will represent the superfluid flow, put Davi-Stock's equation. So, the starting idea of this is that what's important in superfluid fraction of the flow is the vortex interaction. So, if you take the Pier-Sagal law, Pius-Sagal-Laplace law for the vortex interaction, you have most of the physics coming from the superficial. The physics coming from the superfluid. Now, how to couple these vortex filaments with classical Nagwist-Tok's equation? And these are very recent models published by physicists in UK, France, and Japan. These are the two main groups working in this. And the novelty is that, okay, you take a vortex. This is a tiny superfluid vortex with vortex filament matter. With vortex filament methods, you can represent this because zero thickness, the velocity, is singular on the line, and this vortex is transported by the classical fluid, the air in this room, by example. How this would interact with the normal fluid? There were several models, one-way or two-way coupling, and the most elaborated model would consider that there is a slip velocity of vortex time that is the resultant of the Resultant of the counter current, the difference between the normal and the superfluid velocity, but also by the fact that there is a vortex induction of other vortex filaments of the filament, and this attraction will result in the slip velocity, which is the difference between the actual vortex line velocity and the superfluid velocity. And the superfluid velocity. And how to find this slip velocity? Just write in the equilibrium of forces acting on this vortex filament. So the magnus force and the friction force. So after several pages of algebra, you end up with the exact formula for this slip velocity. And once you have the slip velocity, you can use Have the slip velocity, you can use it then in the Pio-Saval law to add the transport of vortex lines by this kind of model. Once you have the dynamics of vortex lines, you can couple this with the Navier-Stokes equation by this friction force coming from the HVPK model. And the difficulty of this model is that this friction. Of this model is that this frequent force, this is a continuous equation, here you have a discrete model for vortex filaments. You have to distribute this around the vortex line. So there are some adjustment parameters to distribute this along the singular vortex line. So what we did, the idea of our new model is very simple. Vortex filament method, it's a nice method. Method, it's a nice method. Biosavalapath. What's the drawback of this method? Of course, there are single elements moving in the fluid. You never have vortic nucleation with this model. You have to manufacture vortices just to put them into the flow. You have to set up some models for the vortex recognition. We've seen that this is a complex interaction between vortices. Between vortices. And if you take the GP equation instead of the vortex filament method, you can have the full dynamics of these vortices. So what was the idea of the new model we developed is to use the GP equation to move the superfluid and use the physical phenomenological method to couple the two. Method to couple the two fractions. So from the GP equation, we solve GP equation with splitting methods or whatever methods you want to use from Yakuta. And from the GP equation, we extract the velocity field and we try to define something that is close to the vorticity in classical fluids. So the idea is to identify vorticity. So, the idea is to identify vortex filaments. Once we identify vortex filaments, we can use the phenomenological method used in vortex-line nanostox coupling, apply the equilibrium forces to determine the V-slip, and then we have to do the two-way coupling. So now the difficulty of our new model is to modify the GP query in order to move vortex filaments with the exact V slip velocity. V-slip velocity. And then once this is done, the coupling with the Navy-Stokes equation is done as in HVBK using the friction force derived in this model. Now, step one is extract vortex lines from the GP field. So we have the wave function and we define the velocity. As we saw in previous slides, this velocity is singular. This velocity is singular because we divide here with the atomic density, which is zero at the point etc. Of course, you can regularize this definition of the velocity. And also, since we use a spectrum method, we can inspect a filter in order to have an omega defined or vortex line that takes the value of 1 at the center of the vortex and then decays very quickly to 0 for long distances. Long distances from the vortex line. Once we've done this, we have an identification of the vortex line and we can define the velocities we had in previous slides, the countercurrent velocity. Once we have this, we apply the equilibrium forces as in vortex line, Navier Stocks models, and we derive analytically. Analytically, an expression for the sleep velocity. So, this was not very complicated. The most complicated step was how to modify the GP equation to move vortices with correct velocity and also with the correct physics. And this was the major input from physics and from Martin D. Marché, of course, because he said. Because he said that we have to take care because we have a velocity, but if you decompose this velocity on a component along the line and a component perpendicular to the line, you have to be careful which part of the velocity will remove energy from the GP equation and which part of the velocity will conserve energy. And these two components of the velocity will correspond to friction force, one power. Friction force, one parallel to the countercurrent that will introduce dissipation, and one normal to the countercurrent that will not introduce. And the mathematical part was to select from different models around the GP equation and the Gibbs-Morlando equation the correct ones that will reproduce this physics. So the original GP equation, we are just multiplying by. Equation, we are just multiplying by i with two sides to have a more compact presentation. If you want to add dissipation in the GP equation, just add a real number here to i. It's well known, this kind of equation used as a combination between real time dynamics and imaginary time dynamics. It's dissipative GP equation. Non-dissipative GPA equation, you add an advection term here. An advection term here that is the Galilean transformation, if you want, of the G equation. So you move the superfluid with this advection field, and this is equivalent by changing the gradient to a convective gradient. And this is used in Gisborne-Lando-type equations with the difference that here we have a non-dissipative and here we have a Gisborne Lambda. A Gizmel-Lando dissipative equation or a dash GP equation. So we selected this kind of GP equation for the component of the velocity that will not dissipate energy and this one for the component of the velocity that will dissipate energy. So we have a velocity with a real and a complex part, and this is our velocity that we introduce in the GP. Velocity that we introduce in the GP equation by changing the gradient in a convective gradient. Alpha beta is just non-dimensionalization of the GP equation, taking into account the different constants present. So we end up with the GP equation that is the original one with a dissipation term that is introduced to remove sound waves. Remove sound waves. I will explain you one. And also with the Lagrange multiplier, because we modified the GP equation to have some dissipation, but the conservation of mass was not guaranteed. So the Lagrange multiplier was introduced to conserve mass. And this eta d is the dissipation that we introduce here to dissipate sound waves. Sound waves. What's the idea behind this? Is that the exact hydrodynamic catalogy of the GP equation is the compressible Euler equations. So in GP equation, you have sound waves. And if you couple this with Navi-Stock's equation for incompressible flows where there are no sound waves, you risk to have a lot of numerical noise. So to remove this, you add some dissipation when the GP equation. And the GP equation to remove these samples. So, this is the beast that we solve spectrally in a solver combining the Navier-Stokes part, this part for the GP equation, and global time integration using a room deputy map. So, it's Fourier spectral. And the very last step, very classical, in Navier's talks. Very classical. In Lavier-Stokes equation, we introduced this source term, which is the friction force, which will couple completely the two systems. So the first test is the evolution of the dipole in a system coupling the two fluids. You can see here that the two vortices that will form the dipole, finally, due to Finally, due to the interaction with the classical fluid, here you have the vorticity in the classical fluid, will join and finally will annihilate, which is not the case if you consider just the GP equation. This is the dipole, this is periodic domain, will move forever. If your solver is correct, conserving energy, no dissipation. And this is a very interesting case that we used for the validation of the code. We used for the validation of the code and tuned a little bit the three constants, the only three constants that we have in the model. So the first one is this epsilon used to regularize the velocity field, of course, and the impact is not so important. The spectral cut, again, to have this vorticity going to zero far from the vortex line, and this we Vortex line, and this we check that it has a physical meaning because the spectral current is one over the healing length, which is the dimension of the vortex. And of course, this dissipation, because as I say, we'd like to develop mathematics to deal with the actual physical problems, was taken from the dissipation tables for helium measured experimentally. So, this was the first. So, this was the first validation, and in the 3D validation is the evolution of vortex stream. So, we have here the two pictures: the vortex streams in the GP equation. You see that this will move forever. And in interaction with the normal fluid, you have this triple vortex ring structure appearing with two normal vortex rings surrounding the superfluid vortex, which was in black. Which was exact, and this is well known, and this was a final validation of the method that the correct physics was reproduced by this one. So, I will conclude saying that this is the first attempt to couple GP and B stocks equations. There was one in nineteen ninety eight by Coast, but was the case of compressor G P equation and without mortices. And without vortices. So, the advantage of this model is that we don't have assumptions for the nucleation reconnection of vortices because this is already included in the GP equation. It was validated for known cases. We have a numerical card high-performance computing for this system, and this opens new research paths since different results for content treatments can be Content treatments can be also revisited using this method. So, if you want to see the details of this model, as I said in the introduction, it combines mathematical and physical considerations. We have a paper published in 2023 in the Journal of Computational Physics. And if you feel passionate about this exciting investigation field, which is quantum turbulence, Investigation field, which is quantum turbulence. We recently organized a workshop in Cardèse, Portugal, which is a facility of the CNRS in France, similar to this, but different landscape near the sea. And we have a web page where very nice talks are presented in PDF and all the let's say uh specialists or contributors from physics, mathematics are presented in uh in the MS work. That in the end this one. Thank you very much for your attention. Are you interested in loading well as you've seen for now it's just exploring uh something that it's Something that is fully sound. But this is the first step. The idea is to look mathematically at the equation to see if there's a mathematically sound way of coupling Navier stocks. So general challenge is how to couple fluids described by Navier Stocks and fluids described by GPUs. You've seen that with a lot of phenomenology because Lot of phenomenology because we wanted to be aligned with the models used by the physical computers. Because superfluid helium is very important for practical application. It is used to cool supermagnets, by example. And supermagnets are used everywhere. I think we had a picture of a device in chemistry using who was the child. And in In super accelerators of particles. You have huge magnets and superfluid helium is there. So, just to put it right, turbulence is something that nobody wants, but unfortunately we have it everywhere around airplanes in everyday life. Tuperturbulence also is present in superfluid helium used in application. Tuperturbulence is not present in BEC. Is not present in BEC. It has to be forced. Now, in BEC, you have a few voltages, very well, highly controllable system. If you want turbulence, which is a domain of investigation, of course, you have to force to have turbulence. So it's not a natural state of these kinds of fluids. That's why we have to move fast, but it opens new research directions for mathematicians. For mathematicians, but this part because it's also a console part. Any questions? Thank you for your talk. Are there situations where the normal feed and the CBR feed exchange particles and you work this is not to my knowledge. I'm not a physicist. But there's a situation indeed where you can think that Can think that the normal fluid is not anymore described by Nadi's concentration, by Boltzmann. That's why, at a certain point, there could be an analogy with BC where you consider the non-condensed fraction, where the particles are the same nature. But here, in a superfluid here, you have the particles, and you have this, the superfluid, it's kind of excitation. Excitation with rhotones and photons. More difficult than considering that this is a particle distribution, this is a particle. Wait, then you kind of already answered the question. So I completely agree that it's logical that you want to quick model. So for me it would be interesting if uh can you see something which goes beyond uh um beyond what people can describe with the simple analytic fluid model without slowing the Nabius thoughts and cross-petatsky patients. Or, on the other hand, you would have to actually change the basic model, like we mentioned that including the coupling that you need to improve. Well what is more important than the market? Yeah, yeah, well, the answer would be complicated because this field of quantum turbulence is not new. It started just after the war and there were several models. The two-fluid model was published by Tita during the war and formalized by Landon just after the Second World War. Well, what we tried, we're modest. So we tried here just to remove some of the assumptions based on phenomenology. That's it. So just replacing the vortex filament with the G C image. Now there's a huge debate because our model doesn't apply to the whole scale of the system, of course. Just something that will consider the physics around the vortex lines. So The vortex lines. So, our box you've seen here is a very tiny, tiny box in a container of one meter. Now, this is saying, wow, this is nice to study fundamentally, but if you want to use it for practical applications, it would be very difficult. So, I don't know if I answered your question, but we're doing what we can and step by step. Where's the pointer going?
