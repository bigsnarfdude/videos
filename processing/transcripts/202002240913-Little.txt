This is a joint work for a class of people and some of them are actually in the band. So if you have more questions, please feel free to ask them. So today this is our group from Hafi and Wearable and Advantable Technology Group. And again, pretty much everyone is there except me. This is Chipper and Jacob, myself, Garway, and John. And what we would like to do is actually get the taste of the Get a taste of devices we use. So, we pretty much always put them on ourselves and see what those provide. And the work I will be talking about is actually led by Juloui Deep, who graduated this last year and who's currently part of the digital medicine at FIFA. So, this work has been activated by Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, which is one of the oldest studies. Which is one of the oldest studies of aging in the US. And in this particular analysis, we use 415 BLSA participants with seven consecutive days when we wear this device ActiveWatch, which is shown over here, which is primarily used for the SIP assessment. Because what it does is it has event buttons, so it would report light on, light off, for those of you who are familiar with the sleep activity research, as well as it has a light sensor. As well as it has a light sensor, so you could use a light geometrical confirmation of the lights on, lights off, events, and things like that. And essentially, what we did, we look at this data primarily because there is more or less validated sleep assessment periods which we could extract and estimate. And, you know, working with BLSA, we have a core group which interested multiple questions. There are multiple questions. So for example, Jane Ferchrak was present in Pan. She's really interested in physical activity and the age-related changes in physical activity and how physical activity, you know, associated with different diseases. Longitudinally, and Adam Speer, who's my collaborator, also who's working a lot in DLSA, is interested in sleep and understanding longitudinal changes in sleep analysis or kind of the definition. So essentially, Decrease it. So essentially, when you have seven days of activity profile, we could conceptualize this as three essentially domains. You have domains of sleep, which is shown here in red, domains of physical activity or wake time, which you could quantify across multiple issues representing physical or motor activity. And here it's shown in blue, as well as the surfading ethnicity, and essentially how stable your 24 to 24. 24 to 24 hour cycles, and you could quantify those cycles as well using antigraphy. And this is more representative of the 24-hour, full 24-hour cycle, and how you roll by this 24-hour cycle to the next 24-hour cycle. So conceptually, you might think if you have a specific outcome, in our case it was a gate speed and longitudinal changes in the gate speed, we were interested not only thinking of how physical activity might be. How physical activity might be related to the geek sleep, but also how sleep and zircon rhythmicity, but at the same time, you know, like sleep and zircon rhythmicity and physical activity, well, might be interconnected and it could have a lot of cross-dependence. So the question is how to try to model these domains jointly where in the situations where we have a representation of each of the domains with multiple summaries. So, and this is the summaries. And these are the summaries which we extracted. And again, I'm not going to go into details, but essentially, you could think about the total volume of activity, activities spent in the different intensities, such as moderate, vigorous activity. You could look at different indices of fragmentation. The same thing can be done for the sleep. You could see how fragmented sleep is, how many wake vowels you have, what's the proportion of time in bed you spend sleeping actually, and things like that. And finally, for the circadian retreat. That. And finally, for the circadian ethnicity, you could look at the functional principal components as a sort of a way to think about your overall 24-hour pattern. As well as you can look at the very well-established and oftenly used features such as IV and REDIC, which is intra-date variability. I always confuse IV and IS. And the relative amplitude, and you can look at some other features. So essentially, you could expand this list, but the question. So essentially you could extend this list, but the question is how you would handle things together. And again, conceptually using this Venn diagram representation, you could think about is it possible to extract variability or information, or variability as the representative of the information about physical activity domain, which is separate from the circadian ethnicity and sleep, and identify this joint variation. And essentially what we did, we applied the Jive approach. You know, the JIDE approach, which stands for Joint and Individual Variation in Splane, which originally was proposed by Locke, Eric Locke, and his group, I mean, and the group from North Carolina. And essentially, there was a lot of work doing different versions of Jive, like Anvil Jive, etc. But when we were writing this paper, that's what we used. And the main idea is essentially to think in terms of the tool sets of the score. Of the two sets of the scores, and the first set of the scores is shared or joined set of scores, which is denoted here by gamma genetic. So, you know, like capital D in Altis, this is just three domains. So you have, for example, sleep, features corresponding to the sleep, features corresponding to the physical activity, features corresponding to circadian ethnicity, and then you have common or joint force, which is denoted here, gamma j. Which is denoted here, gamma j, and then there is domain-specific features. And then there is an algorithm which you can perform, and essentially you decompose. In our case, what you get, you get this decomposition, which essentially is very similar to, in its conceptual thinking, to the principal component analysis, where you say, look, I'm just going to use three principal components. I'm going to use five principal components which capture, say, 80% of the capability. So, in this case, you have not only So in this case you have not only joint principal components, but you also have for each specific domain you have its own individual, so-called individual principal components. So in our case we've got the structure which just corresponds to the three joint principal components, three principal components which is individual to physical activity domain, four principal components which is individual to the sleep domain, five principal components which is individual to the circadian arithmetic domain. Kinear ethnicity done. And what it allows you to do is essentially to say, okay, so first principal components, which is the joint across, although it's a joint across three domains, but we see that 75% of variability is explained by features from the physical activity, and essentially the rest is explained by the circadian atmosphere, and sleep is not really contributing to this one. And on the opposite, you know, a second principal component, which is a joint principal component, comes from the sleep, and the rest. And the rest, pretty much, is the circadian technique. So there is this param going on. And there are actually, you know, the JI versions which look at the specific combinations. And I think Irina Gaiano, who's actually at Bunk, proposed one of the versions which looks at these specific combinations of the domains. And again, there's a lot of details. There's a lot of details, so and probably it's very small. Your screens are not gonna go into this, but you could think about this, you know, the type of interpretation in terms of like, okay, so physical activity, physical activity dynamics, how much, what's the structure of the physical activity variability. And essentially you can show in our case, you can show that approximately 70% is explained by the joint variability, and most of the rest is the individual variability. Variability, and there is some residual variability which is pretty tiny. And then for the sip, we actually see that half of the variability can be explained by the joint, and then half of the variability is explained by the individual. And finally, for the circadian atomicity, we see that it's actually the joint component that seems to be slightly less important. And what we do is, I mean, again, the main goal is essentially to say, look, are you Essentially, to say, look, I have a specific outcome. And in our case, it was a gift, and we adjusted for age, gender, BMI. And then we include the principal components for the joint, for critical activity, from the treat domain, and from circadian ethnicity domain. And essentially, you know, one variable, you can look at the R squared as the total amount of information you explain through different variables. Variables, and if you just include A, gender, and B, my, adjusted R square is approximately 0.24. And then when you include the principal components, which is actually by construction, orthonormal, and you could normalize them to have variance one, so you could translate it beta the efficiency sort of to the contribution to the R squared. So we see that essentially, you know, a second principal component from physical activity domain and the first principle component from the Domain and the first principal component from the skip domain contribute quite a bit to the explaining variability in the g skip. And this extra explaining variability, when you do all components, is essentially at 0.1 of the total in terms of adjusted R square. And approximately 0.03 is obtained by the second principal component, and the first principal component from sleep, and the second principal component from physical activity. And second physical component from physical activity. And of course, the interceptability, like what they mean. So when we went back and kind of looked back, like what the features are loaded on these principal components, essentially what was very interesting actually to see that it actually was fermentation of physical activity, which essentially was what was the principal component for physical activity, and fermentation of sleep, which was a principal component. Of sleep, which was a principal component one for the sleep domain. So that was very interesting. It was actually one of the first things we saw that when the fragmentation of sleep, fragmentation of physical activity kind of have this mutual effect on the outcome. And again, gain speed might be not necessarily something you would think would be related to the sleep, right? So that was interesting. And I plan to cover multi-level drive, but I don't really have time, so I'm just gonna. I'm going to pause and maybe answer questions. And I'd all be happy to make the slides available through whatever the online service there. Thank you. Any questions for Vadim? Can I just ask a question? Sure, please. So, this is assuming you have 24-hour data, so it's assuming, right? Yes. Yes, and it also assumes you have 24-hour data, and also you have some way to estimate sleep and separate the period of sleep from the period of waiting. And it's all coming from one sensor. They they don't wear ESGs or anything from the side. Right, right. So, it's coming from this one sensor, so definitely there is a limitation of how well. That there is a limitation of how well the sensor estimates physical activity, and alpha was more important, probably how well it estimates C. But we followed kind of the golden standard and accurately estimated C. So there were like two scorers who estimated C periods and used skip diagrams on the top of the light sensor, from the top of the event button. So it kind of gets you a little bit better estimate estimation of the periods, at least of time of the impact. It's beautiful. Really lovely framework. Thank you. Anybody else? So, who's our next speaker? Tammy, you have it here on the computer? All right, I'm gonna follow online because this is online option, so please make sure don't forget to share your video or stream. And I wish you everyone a great time and ban. Sorry to miss you. Sorry to miss you. I think that's enough.
