I already started, sorry. And maybe we can also start. Okay, so yeah, let's start then. So, okay, so it's a great pleasure to have Rafael Kricorian. Please go ahead. Okay, so thank you very much for the invitation. And also, I apologize for this. Late beginning of my talk. Okay, so in any way, I'm going to talk about almost reducibility of quasipyroidic symplectic cocycles. So this will be a joint work with Arto Ravila and Yipan. Okay, so I'm going to, so first, so I'm going to talk of a topic which might be useful for study. Which might be useful for studying quasi-periodic Schrodinger operators on strips. So, by this, I mean that, so on strips, so I didn't put what it is, it's basically Schrodinger operators on Z times a finite interval of Z. And so it amounts to, at least for some of these models, to study operators. Operators of the form, so which are very like quasi-periodic Renninger operators. The only difference is that, so here it acts on L2 of sequences with values in R to the power s. And so to a sequence Un where Un is an element of R S, of the S dimensional vector space, real vector space, you associate U n plus 1 plus Un. associate u n plus 1 plus u n minus 1 plus v of x plus n alpha u n. So v is a potential, but v is a symmetric matrix. So alpha as usual is some irrational number. So v is a map periodic with values in the set of symmetric matrices. So that's what we want to investigate. In fact, I'm not going to talk Want to investigate. In fact, I'm not going to talk a lot of these operators. So, as usual, when you look at the eigenvalue equation, hu is equal to eu. So, here is a real number. So, you can write this equation under this form. So, u n plus 1 un is obtained from u n un minus 1 by multiplying by this matrix. So, e here is the energy. The energy, I is the identity matrix, S by S. So V is the symmetric matrix, and so you will have this form. And so if you want to, yeah, so just maybe one thing is that this matrix here is, so the so-called Schrodinger matrix, in this case, in the general case, is a symplectic matrix since it satisfies transpose of S times J times S. of s times j times s is equal to j where j is this symplectic is this i mean the matrix giving the symplectic structure and so if you want to study this eigenvalue equation basically it's enough to understand products of symplectic matrices of this form and so i guess now i'm going to stop talking about operators Going to stop talking about operators. I'm going to shift to the study of cocycles. So, to study these products, you have to one way to proceed is to study the corresponding co-cycle. So, maybe I'm going to make some reminders on co-cycles. So, a quasi-periodic co-cycle, so I recall the general definition, so it's a map from a D-di-di-di-di-di- From a d-dimensional torus times a group into itself. And so if you are given x and y, you can associate x plus alpha and a of x times y. So a, where g is here, so is a group. Alpha is some element of these torus that I'm going to assume minimal, which means that the That the orbits, every orbit are dense. So n alpha is dense on the torus. And A is a map from the torus, the D-dimensional torus to the group. And I'm going to assume that it's of class CR. So the group here will be in general a Lie group. And the class of regularity can be, so goes from zero to infinity, and it can be, and in fact, it will be. Be and in fact, it will be later real analytic. So, this is the definition of a co-cycle. And so, what's the link with what I've said previously is that if you iterate this map, alpha A, which is here, you have the following thing. So, the nth iterate of this map is again a cocycle. And now on the And now on the base alpha, you've got n alpha, and on the fiber a becomes a fiber product a of x, a of x plus alpha, a of x plus n minus one alpha. And I'm going to call this a subscript n of x. And so this is the same thing as what we had here when we were making products of these symplectic matrices. Well, so one, yeah, so what are examples of cos cycles? So relevant examples of cos cycles are the simplest one. So the case where G is a billion, so it can be R, Rn, so non-compact, or it can be compact, T, T N. You can have also compact groups. So for example, SO3, you can. So for example, SO3, you can have also SU2. So the study of co-cycles with values in SO2 are useful when you want to understand quasi-periodic excitations of contrum two-states atom. It can be SL2R, and then you introduce disco cycles when you study cosiperic Friendly operators on Z. It can be the simple. On Z, it can be the symplectic group, and that's what we shall be interested in in this talk. And so it comes when you study the Schrodinger operator on strips. Just to say one thing is that also the study of quasi-periodic cycles with values in the symplectic group are interesting when you try to understand the linearization of the linearization of a symplectic dynamics in the neighborhood of a quasi-periodic invariant torus. These are tori that come from Km theory in Hamiltonian mechanics. You could also consider a G to be a group of diffeomorphisms or whatever. But here basically in this talk I'm going to concentrate on the case on the symplectic On the symplectic group case. And I'm going to mention to take two other examples, which are SU2 and SL2. Basically, this would be the examples we shall be interested in. Okay, so our aim here is now to understand these products. So I'm giving you some map A from T D to G. So D will often be one, in fact. So I'm giving you a map A from T D to G, and I try to understand. D to G, and I try to understand these quasi-periodic products. And to do that, there is one important notion, which is the notion of reducibility. So before introducing it, I'm just recalling that if you have two co-cycles, alpha A1 and alpha A2, you say that they are conjugated if there exists a map B, which goes from T D to G, so which is called the gauge transformation, such that A2 of X is B of X plus alpha. x is b of x plus alpha a1 of x b of x to the minus one so this is a conjugation relation so like a real one i mean sorry you are given two diffimorphisms alpha a1 and alpha a2 and you are just saying that these two diffimorphisms are conjugated it's really a conjugation relation just that the conjugacy has a slightly particular form because here we've got a zero Particular form because here you've got a zero, it's a zero b and so more concretely you can write it like that. And you said that a cocycle is reducible if it's conjugated to a constant cocycle, which means that one of the two maps, for example, a1 here, is a constant. Okay. And then in that case, of course, it's very useful because if you want to understand the fiber. The fiber product or equivalently the iterates of alpha A, you just have to compute something which is B of X plus n alpha. Then here I've got A0 to the power n, which is in principle, it's something which is easy to understand, the x minus 1. So if you know a 0 and b, you can say that you completely understand the dynamics of alpha A and you completely understand the fiber products A of x, A of X plus alpha and so on. X and of X plus alpha and so on. Now, the point is that in general, co-cycles are not always reducible. And so there are several reasons for that. So I'm going to mention some of them. So one of the reasons is a topological reason. So for example, if your group is not simply connected, and if the map A goes from T D to G is not homogeneous. Goes from Td to G is not homotopic to the identity, then a cosycle, and the cosycle A will not be homotopic, will not be reducible, because otherwise it would be homotopic to the identity. There are other reasons. So, for example, the topological reason appears in the SL2R case, so SL2R, or even the symplectic group. So, the pi one is different. pi one is different from is not is not trivial it's z in fact so now you've got the important things are the arithmetics of alpha so it might be a problem to prove reducibility even in the simplest case where g is abelian so if alpha is lovelian you can find examples of non-reducible cocycles Examples of non-reducible cocycles. There are other arithmetic obstructions to reducibility that are more subtle and you cannot view them like that. But basically, for example, in SL2R, if you've got a rotation number, if the rotation number is not Diophantine with respect to alpha, your cosycle will not be reducible. But this is more difficult to see. You got another type of reason. Other types of reasons which are related to dynamical degree. So, I'm going just to give an example. So, let's take G to be SU2. So, SU2 is a simply connected group. So, if you take a loop, a path, a closed path on SU2, you can always contract him to a point, just because SU2 is, in fact, topologically, it's the S3, the three-fifth. S3, the three sphere. And now, if you take, for example, a cocycle A of X, which is of this form, take a diagonal matrix, which is on the diagonal, you've got exponential 2 pi i dx, exponential minus 2 pi i dx, and d is some non-zero integer. Then you can see that this A will not be C1. Be C1 reducible, at least. It's just due to the fact that if you look at the iterates of A and you take the derivative of the iterates, you will have a growth of the derivatives which is linear. And this is not compatible with irreducibility. I'm sorry, when you say rotation number, do you mean Johnson-Moser rotation number? A fibre rotation number. So, do you mean Jones or Moser? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Exactly. Or Hermann, it's the same. And it was introduced by Hermann and Johnson Moser. But so here, so okay, so and this for SL2R. So here I'm dealing in SU2. In SU2, you don't have rotation numbers. In SU2, you don't have rotation number. You don't have fiber rotation number. But so, still here in SU2, if you look at this co-cycle, so this co-cycle cannot be conjugated to a constant one. And it's very easy to see, that's what I wanted to say. So, you've got, for some kind of system, you've got obvious obstructions to reducibility. And there is a fourth one, which is related to non-uniform hyperbolic. uniform hyperbolicity so for example if g so it has a meaning when g is not is not compact for example sl2 symplectic groups gln these kind of things and then so by non-uniform hyperbolicity i mean positively upon exponents and the system is not hyperbolic not uniformly hyperbolic so i'm not going to give a definition but basically so this is related to the positivity of the lyapunov experiments Punof experiments. Okay, so this is the you have four obstructions to bear reducibility. Now, you often want to, so if you want to avoid in some sense these obstructions, you can introduce weaker notions of reducibility, or I would say different notions, depends how you see things. It depends how you see things. And so basically, there are two of them that are very useful. So the first one is almost reducibility. So a co-cycle alpha A is almost reducible if you can find a sequence of gauge maps, Bn, such that 0 Bn conjugated to alpha A conjugated to 0 Bn inverse converge, so this sequence converges in the CR topology. In the CR topology to some constant cosine. So reducibility corresponds to the fact that to the situation where Bn is just one at B. And in this case, you allow sequences and Bn can explode. And then in this case, you've got this almost reusability. So it's a very useful notion. You can define this notion, by the way, for. Define this notion, by the way, for other kinds of dynamics, for example, spherical dynamics or whatever. But I would say that the first instance of this notion of almost reducibility is in the theory of quasi-periodical cycles. It was introduced by Hokandeliasson. There is another kind of weaker notion of reducibility, which I call rotation. I call rotation reducibility, which is just the fact that you want to include in some sense these examples, the dynamical degree, examples given by the dynamical degree. In some sense, you want to include them in the notion of reducibility. So I'm going to say vaguely that I'm going to say that the cocycle A is rotation reducibility. Rotation reducibility, rotation reducible, if you can find a conjugation B, which takes A to a cocycle, which takes its values into the rotation group SO2. For example, if you are in SL2 or so it will be or by extension. So in fact, the terminology is not very good, but in SU2, I will say maybe if it's conjugated to ED. And of course, you can. And of course, Raphael, may I ask a stupid question? So, why did you say that linear growth of the derivative already implies that it cannot be reducible? What if it is reducible to a parabolic co-cycle? Yeah, because I was in SU2. So, in SU2, you don't have to. Okay. Yeah, I should have said that. So, basically, it was okay. You will see. So, you've got these obstructions. And in fact, In fact, so now I'm going to state some classical global reducibility results before stating them in the symplectic case. So first I'm going to say something about the SU2 case and I'm going to illustrate these preceding things, in particular this dynamical degree thing. So So some years ago, maybe 21 years ago, even more, so I threw the following theorem. So if you take, you assume that the group G is SU2, and the claim is the following. There exists a full measure set of rotation of translations, alpha on T such that whenever you fix alpha in this set, the set of Sets the set of A, of smooth A from T1 to SU2 for which alpha A is reducible is dense in the smooth topology. So which means you fix alpha in this set RDC, which means recurrent Diophantine condition. But it's a full measure set. So you fix alpha. And then you take some A, alpha, which is smooth from T1 to SU2. And so you can make arbitrarily small perturbations. And so you can make arbitrarily small perturbations of A so that alpha A becomes reducible. In fact, what you prove is a more precise result. So there is a number, which is some integer number, which is called the dynamical degree, such that if the dynamical degree of zero, of alpha A is zero, then alpha A is Then alpha A is almost reducible. And if D is not zero, then alpha A is smoothly conjugated to E D. And E D, I remind you, are these people. So the kind of the obstructions to reducibility we had introduced here. So what is the dynamical degree? I'm not going to. Is the dynamical degree? I'm not going to define it now. I'm going to define it later in the simplicity case. It's basically this D. So it's, so you see, if you look at the growth of the derivatives of the nth iterates, so I said it grows linearly. And times something. And the something is D, or 2 pi D. And it has to be an integer. An integer. So, in fact, so you can define in you can give a proper definition, which is not difficult in that case. So, and so you've got, you can define the dynamical degree. If this degree is zero, the cosycle is almost reducible. And otherwise, it's C infinity conjugated to this. So, I'm going to say obstructions because I used to say obstructions, but I'm going to say maybe this model. I'm going to say maybe this model at least E subscript D. Okay, so this was in the SU2 case. Now, in the obstructions I've mentioned, there was this last one, which was the non-uniform hyperbolicity obstruction. So, how can you, in some sense, if you want? So, basically, you want to make a statement about reducibility and you want to avoid this. want to avoid this non-uniformly hyperbolic obstruction. And so there is a way to basically avoid it in some sense, which is done by the use of Cotany theory. So it would be possible in the case where G is equal to SL2R or in the symplectic case. So Cotany theory is due to Cotany and the extension to SP2SR was formed SP2SR was formalized, I would say, by Disheng Shu, students of Artur. Van Do wants, in fact, in Cotany and Simon, you can see also there is a paper, I don't remember when, but by Cotany and Barry Simon. So basically, I'm just, I'm not going to give the full Cotany. Basically, I'm just not going to give the full Cotany theory, just what we are going to use. So, the idea here is the following. So, you take your Cocycle and you add, I'm going to describe it in SL2 or SP symplectic case. So, you take your Cocycle and you just add some parameter, R theta, theta, R theta. R theta is a symplectic rotation. And you look at the Yoga cycle. At the Yoko cycle, you look at the projectivized action or the projective action of this co-cycle. In fact, more precisely, you look at its action by homography on the Frank Array health plane if you are in SL2R or on the Siegel health plane if you are in the symplectic case. So, in that case, so in the SL2R case, you just take the action by homography. So, you've got a Take the action by homography. So you've got a matrix, and the matrix acts by a two by two matrix, and it acts by homography on the Poincaré half plane. Basically, you can do the same construction, just you've got homographies with matrices, and you can make let them act on the Siegel half-plane. So I'm not going to define what is the Siegel half-plane, but basically, you replace. Half plane, but basically you replace numbers by symmetric matrices. That's the game. The same, you've got the Poincaré metric. You can define Poincaré-Siegel metric on the Ziegler half-plane exactly by doing the same thing, basically. And the idea is just a real number is a symmetric matrix, a positive number is a positive definite matrix, and so on. Metrics and so on. And if you have this, so the main result that I'm going to use, in fact, is the following. So for it's the following. So for every theta in R, either your cocycle alpha r theta A is non-uniformly hyperbolic, or the cocycle is L2 rotation reducible, which means that Which means that you can find some L2 conjugation that takes your cosycle R theta A to a symplectic rotation. So this is why I said here L2 reducibility. In fact, it's L2 rotation reducibility. So this is the way Cotany theory enters the game. And the point is that when I said here how to get rid of the I said here how to get rid of the non-uniformly hyperbolic obstruction, it would be the following. So, basically, so either you are non-uniformly hyperbolic, and so basically, in fact, you are happy because you've got OCLA, that's a theorem that gives you some kind of structure. You've got positive Lyapunov exponent, which in general is difficult to prove. And if you are not in this situation, you are in the L2 rotation reducible situation. Situation. A situation which is close to which is more attractable if you want to prove reducibility results. So by the way, so for example, I'm now going to give an example in the SL2R case. So this is a theorem we proved with Arctura in 2006. So again, you fix alpha a recurrent elephantine. Fix alpha, a recurrent Diefentine number. You take A, a map which is from T to SL to R, homotopy to the identity, which is smooth or real analytic. And then you add this parameter R theta. It could be also, you could look at the Schrodinger matrices, but here I'm going to look at that. And then the theorem is that for almost every theta, you've got a dichotomy either. Theta, you've got a dichotomy. Either you've got non-uniformly hyperbolic, non-uniform hyperbolicity, or sorry, Ravian, maybe the formal theorem is wrong. The formal Kutani theorem is either positively exponent or rotation duciple, right? It's not a non-uniform hybrid. You're right, you're right. Positively, you're right. And in the in the Right. And in the second theorem as well. On the next. But here you're in SL2. No, the second theorem is right because it's right. Say it's reducible. Says reducible. Okay, right. Okay. It doesn't say rotation. Yeah. Yeah, thank you. And so this kind of dichotomy. So basically, This kind of dichotomy. So basically, positive. So here I said this because it's just to because it's a little bit more precise than just positive Lyapunov exponents. So by the way, so we proved this result to finish the proof of the Oberi-Andre conjecture, but now it's Vetlana and Ilyakarsovsky have another proof. And I just want to mention also, you can also give some version for. You can also give some version for the case non-homotopic to the identity. But in that case, you've got many other kind of phenomena that appears. So I'm not going to mention them. But just to say some this thing, so you've got in the SU2 case and in the SL2, we've got basically reducibility results. And in the SL2, it's modulo positive. Positively upunaff exponent systems, something like that. In fact, in the SL2 case, you can be a little bit more precise. So, in some sense, L2 rotation reducibility implies almost reducibility. And if you have some further information on the fibers rotation number, then you've got reducibility. Voila, and so basically, it's this thing. This thing, and now we're going to go to path to the symplectic case. So, basically, can you expect similar results in SU2 or in SL2R? Because you see in that case, so the symplectic group, so it's the natural generalization of SL2R. And like in the simplect in the SL2R, the pi one of the symplectic group is Z, like this. On the other hand, On the other hand, like in the SU2 case, you can find cocycles which are homotopic to the identity but have some non-zero dynamical degree. In fact, it's just due to the fact that the maximal compact group of SP to SR is isomorphic to US, the unitary matrices. So for example, you see if S is equal to 2, you'll go at U2, which means SU2, basically, here. SU2 basically. Okay, so I'm just going to mention also that, like in the SL2R case, you can define a fibre rotation number in the symplectic case, which is the fibretmasloff index. I'm not maybe not going to use it, but I mention it. Okay, so what I want to say is that basically maybe you will have a mixture in the general symplectic case. General symplectic case of difficulties that you find when you study the SL2R case and the SU2 case. Maybe before I'm going to define to say what is the dynamical degree. So let's take a co-cycle. I'm going to assume it's analytic because it will be more convenient. So let's take a real analytic system. Kinetic system and assume that it's L2 rotation reducible. So, assume that we can use Cotani theorem in the symplectic case. Then what you can prove is that you can find some B, which is L2, which is a, in fact, it's the map which make this rotation irreducibility. And there exists a D, which is L1. Which is L1 from the circle to the Lie algebra, SP2SR. And if you look at, so you take the cosycle A, you look at AN, which is the nth iterates, you take the derivative, and so basically, so an to the minus one partial derivative of an is the derivative of your thing. Of your thing, and you divide by one over n. So this is conjugated to some d of x, which lives in the Lie algebra. And the point is that this d of x, all the d of x here, they are all conjugated. When they are defined, they are all conjugated together. In fact, what you can prove is that these d of x are conjugated to rotation matrices, infinitesimal rotation. Matrices, infinitesimal rotation matrices, which has some periodic city property. So, more here, let's assume that chi is equal to one. Exponential of D is equal to the identity. It's a kind of quantification of this dynamical degree or quantization. I don't know. Okay. And so basically, it's the generalization. Of this, of this dynamical degree, which is basically the model you should have in mind is this one. Okay, so the theorems. The theorem, so I'm going now to state some results. So, first, I'm going to make some assumptions on alpha just to avoid problems. I'm going to assume that alpha is of bounded type, which means that if you take the Gauss map, g of x, which is fractional parts of one over x, then the iterates of alpha under the Gauss map. Under the Gauss map are bounded. So the first theorem is that if the dynamical degree is equal to zero, then alpha and if alpha A is L2 rotation reducible and has dynamical degree zero, then alpha A is almost reducible. At least in GL to SR. Now here there's a small problem to go from GL to SP, but. To SP, but so I'm going to say almost reducible. So, do you only prove it for bounded type or not? In this case, no, in fact, in that case, no, you don't need bounded type, you write not in this case. I will need bounded type for the D different from different from do you have some Dieuphantine condition Here you need maybe a Diefen time. Just the fact that, in fact, at some point, what I'm just saying is that here you can reduce by randomization, you will be able to reduce to a local situation when d is equal to zero. And then you can apply a local result. And in general, it's better to assume that alpha is there sometime. Otherwise, maybe you have to think more. So I don't know, in fact. But here there is a But here there is a slight problem about GL, SF, SP, but it's almost reducible in some group. So this is the first case, D is equal to zero. And so as I've said, basically D let's assume here, so I wanted to formalize it to have the general form, but basically assume that D. General form, but basically assume that D. I'm going to assume that D is integral valued, basically. So it can be zero or not zero, but so it takes discrete values. So in fact, so as I've said, so this D lies in some simple, so in the in the Lie algebra of the Of the maximal compact subgroup of the symplectic group. So we can put this D in some maximal torus. And I'm going to introduce Z of D, which is the centralizer of D in the symplectic group. And in this case, I'm going to give the following definition. I say that D is regular, or that the cosycle is regular if Is regular if the centralizer of d is equal to t, which just means that basically if you take a matrix which commutes with d it, so assume that d is diagonal. And if you take a matrix which commutes with d it has to be diagonal also if you complexify so this is the notion of regular so in this case the map A is not homotopic to the identity But so in this case, if alpha A is L2 rotation reducible, and if alpha A has non-zero dynamical degree and regular, then alpha A is conjugated to disco cycle E D. So here I put a different form. I'm going to assume that chi is equal to one here. So exponential D, which is exponential dx plus something which is linear. Something which is linear and D and C commute. So basically it's in SL2 case we will have the same phenomenon and also in SU2 case. And then you've got, so what is more difficult to study is the non-regular case. Regular case, but here I'm going to stick to the lower dimensional case, so sp4 in fact. And so here I'm going to assume that A is in SP4. I'm sorry, it's not A, it's A is a smooth map, is a real analytic map from. Real analytic map from T to SP4. And the point is that, so in the symplectic case, I'm going to assume. So if I, let's say, let's put it like that, is that even if A is homotopic to the identity, the dynamical degree of alpha A is not necessarily zero. So it's a little bit like in SU2. You've got a map A, it can be homotopic to the. It can be homotopic to the identity, like in SO2, but the dynamical degree is not zero. And then, so here the situation is a little bit more complicated, but basically, so if you take some alpha A, which is L2 notation reducible and isotopic to the identity, then alpha A is either almost reducible, so basically you could reduce to the constant case. To the constant case, or it's almost rotation reducible. So, by this, I want to say that you can find a sequence of conjugation Bn that takes your cosycle A close to something which is of the form exponential dx plus Cn. Cn commutes with D, and so this goes to zero in the smooth topology. So basically, if I state the results, so depending on, so if you introduce the notion of a degree, so we've got basically two cases, so D is equal to zero, and then alpha, so and you always assume that alpha is L to rotation reducible. So if D is equal to zero, it's almost reducible to constant systems in the regular case. It's Regular case, it's conjugated to model systems of the form exponential dx plus c. And in sp4, if you assume that a is homotopic to the identity, so you are either almost reducible or almost rotationally reducible. So the thing with this theorem is that here you don't have, you don't need in the second theorem, you don't need an information on. You don't need an information on D, because of course, to compute the dynamical degree is not, you can define it, but to compute it, it's not completely obvious. So, here, what you can say is that you just have to know that your cosycle is isotopic to the identity. So, L2 rotation reducible is given by Cotami theory, and so you've got this result. So, boy, so to summarize, so in this case. To summarize, so in this case, for almost every theta, now if you take any A which is homotopic to the identity in sp4, then the cosycle alpha r theta A is either non-uniformly hyperbolic. In fact, so here it's wrong. It's either it has positive Lyapunov exponents. So NUH here should be some exponent is positive, or it's almost reducible, or it's conjugated. Or it's conjugated or it's almost conjugated or almost conjugated. So here, no, here it's true, or conjugated to EDC. Here, why you can go from almost rotation reducible to conjugated to the model is because, in this case, in sp4, you can use the fact that you've got a Maslov index. Index. And the Maslov index is a kind of rotation number. So the Maslov index doesn't give you enough information if you are close to a local situation, to the constant case. But on the other hand, if you are close to this EDC, then it gives you some information. Well, so basically, that's the results. That are, in some sense, quite similar to the SU2 case and to the SL2R case. And that, of course, you have to deal with difficulties from the SU2 case and from the SL2R case. Now, I'm going just to say some words about the proofs. So, the proofs are based on Km and renormalization. So, I'm just going to recall quickly what is Km. Call quickly, what is Km. So basically, Km helps you to understand situations where your cocycle is close to a model situation. In general, this model situation is when you are close to a constant. This is classically the way you use KEM. From time to time, you want to understand to be able to perform some KEM theory when you are close. Km theory, when you are close to these systems, exponential dx plus, they are not constants here, it's got some x parts. And so I put this in red because in general, it's difficult. You need something else. You cannot perform like that scale here. Some other features of KEM is that what is the aim of KEM is you take your A, it's close to some model situation, and by some Model situation, and by some conjugation, you want to take it closer and closer to a model situation. So, if the model is constant and A is close to constant, you want to conjugate it closer and closer to constants. If it's this model, you will try to conjugate closer and closer to this model. So, in general, when you try to do that, you've got some obstructions, which are of arithmetical nature in general. Of arithmetical nature in general, small devices. And you always face more or less loss of regularity, which means that here you're going to define some inductive scheme, and this scheme should be quadratic. It should be something like a Nashmoser scheme. On the other hand, what is renormalization? It's a procedure that allows you to that allows you to. That allows you to reduce a global situation, which means a non-perturbative situation, to a local one, a local perturbation. Just that the in general, if you want to be able to have a nice randomization theory, you need this L2 rotational reducibility, which is given by Cotany theory. So in general, you need this in order to be able to work. In order to be able to work. And then there is this whole language of, so what is randomization? It's basically, I'm not going to describe it into details, but it's some kind, it's an action of GL2Z on commuting pairs of cocycles that you normalize in some sense, that you rescale and normalize. I'm going to say what it is later. So just to give a little bit more details on. Just to give a little bit more details on KEM. So when you are close to this, so I'm going to describe the situation where you are close to this model systems. So we've got A, let's say it's this model plus a perturbation, and you want to find a conjugation that takes you to a similar model plus a smaller perturbation. So when you do that, you want to, you have to solve. You have to solve some kind of linearized equation. And just to give you the flavor of the equation, it's something like that. So it's not exactly this, but it amounts to this. For some integer z and real number lambda, you have to solve a homological equation, which is this function of x. You want to write it under this form. You want to find y and gamma. Y and gamma. And gamma, you want it to be as simple as possible. But in general, we cannot take gamma as equal to zero. In some situations, for example, if L is equal to zero and if alpha satisfies some Diefantine assumption and lambda also, you can from time to time take gamma is equal to zero or constant. But in the general case, what you can have is gamma is a trigonometric polynomial of the grid. Is a trigonometric polynomial of the Greek n. So when you so the problem is that when you perform this kind of conjugation, the new perturbation that you got here is not small. It's not smaller. The new perturbation is something which is of the form the obstruction that you have here, plus something which is quadratic with respect to this perturbation. With respect to this perturbation, so it seems to be quadratic as it should be, but due to this obstruction gamma, it is not. So, the scheme is not quadratic, and so you won't have a good KEM scheme. So, the only way to be able to perform a nice KM scheme here is to be able to prove that this gamma here is small. In fact, this quadratic is small or quadratic in this. So, this is for the KM aspect. Is for the KM aspect. So, how are you going to do that? So, to do that, you're going to use this renormalization. So, I'm just going to give the form of the renormalization. And in fact, I'm just going to define the one-step renormalization. So, this one-step renormalization is defined as follows. So, you take a co-cycle alpha A, which is L2 rotation reducible. Rotation reducible, and you're going to define a renormalized cocycle. So it will be a quasi-periodic cocycle, and it's defined this way. You take your co-cycle alpha A, you put it at some power, which is one over alpha, fractional part, integral part of one over alpha. You multiply it by one identity, and then One identity, and then you make this kind of conjugacies where h so where lambda alpha is rescaling and h is the normalizing map, which means that it satisfies this relation. H needs not be periodic. It's just defined on R. So when you have that, that so you take your cosine, so in practice. So, in practice, what do you do? You take your cocycle alpha A, okay, you make some small delation, and you try to find a good H, so normalizing map, so that you've got this relation. In principle, it's not difficult to do. The only thing is what is more delicate is to choose the good H, but to find one H is not difficult. And it's not difficult because you're not requiring H to be. Requiring H to be periodic. But once you have chosen some H like that, if you take this formula, then you have defined a new Cocycle, which is so defined on the circle. And this is your new Cocycle. And this is one, the fractional part, the new alpha is fractional part of one over alpha. This is the randomization operator. What you can prove. What you can prove is that if your L2 conjugated to constant, when you, so it's not exactly this, but you can perform long strips of long steps of randomization so that you reduce your system alpha A close to a situation. And the local situation will be either you're going to produce a cosine. Either you're going to produce a cocycle which is close to constants or to these models, EDC. So, this is the first step. So, you use renormalization, and so we call this deep renormalization. It means that, in fact, you perform many steps of this, just that the H is chosen at the end, in fact. But I'm not going to explain this. Explain this. Just what I want to say is that if you perform this renormalization, this deep or long renormalization, you end up either to a cosycle which is close to a constant, and then you are happy because you can apply local almost reducibility results that are available when you are close to constants. Or you converge to this model. And then this is the problem because here, as we Problem because here, as we have said, if you want to apply Km in this neighborhood of the models, you have to prove that the gamma here is small. But the point is that what you can show is that this renormalization operator, which was defined here, in some sense, is hyperbolic. Hyperbolic in the sense of In the sense of hyperbolic diffomorphism. So it's a stable and unstable directions in some functional spaces. And so the systems for which you cannot perform Km steps, they correspond basically to the unstable manifold of this fundamentalization operator R. So what now you say is that if your cosycle had Cycle had some parts on the unstable manifold. I'm not stating the thing correctly. So, since the iterates of the co-cycle under the renormalization operator are bounded, because we know from here that renormization converges to this model, you know that the cosycle that you are dealing with lies on the stable manifold of R. Manifold of R. But stable manifolds of R are basically encoded by these kind of equations with gamma is equal to zero. Basically, you can prove this way that gamma, in fact, is quadratic in the perturbation. And so you can apply your KEM scheme. And so that's basically the strategy of the proof. And so to And so to, if I to say differently, so you want to you want to prove the theorem. So first you use randomization to reduce to some kind of local situation, meaning either you are close to constant systems and then it's okay, or you are close to these kinds of abstractions. And in this case, you try to perform some KM scheme. But the KM scheme has some problem because Scheme has some problem because when you want to do it, you've got some obstruction here. But by using the fact that the renormalization operator is hyperbolic, you will prove that in fact this gamma is basically zero. It's quadratic, in fact. And so you have a good KEM scheme to prove the convergence in something like that. Something like that. Well, I'm finished with this and I'm late. I'm sorry. Thank you. Are there any questions? Are there any I know that you cannot translate it directly, but is there anything for the Lubille numbers? For the Louville numbers. So, the Leuville numbers in symplectic, they are resulting in SL2. So, basically. So, the question, for example, is here. So, in SL2, so imagine that you're in SL2. When alpha is a Luvi number, Is a Luvi number you can play with some trick which we call the cheap trick, which is basically the following. So, um, to say that alpha is Louville in some sense is to say that alpha is equal to zero, basically, or is very small, because alpha is very close to a rational number. And in some sense, if you iterate, or if you renormalize, or whatever, you can assume that. You can assume that alpha being p over q is the same as alpha being equal to zero. But you see, when alpha is equal to zero, when you want to solve this equation, you can play the following trick. You say, okay, if alpha is exactly zero, this is just a classical conjugation equation that you can solve. And then you remember that alpha is not zero. And so you put alpha. But the error you make when you do that is alpha times. you make when you do that is alpha times the derivatives of b prime of b and so playing this way this this kind of trick you can have some um some kind of results and this is the cheap trick thing the problem is that in this case you can probably you cannot use gp because mass of index that cannot define Cannot define and cannot determine the dynamics. In the simple active case, no, it's not possible. Right. So, this is, but here it was just in the SL2 occurrence. And so, this is one thing. The other thing is that when alpha is Louville, there is another trick that you can play, which is which was done basically by Jiang Gong Yu. Zhang Gong Yu, Hu Chizu, which is to try to use Floquet theorem. So here is basically the same kind of idea. Alpha is basically rational, so you can pretend that it's better. You can see that at the level of differential equation is better, because then you've got a periodic system instead of a quasi-periodic one, and you can try to use Floke theorem. Yeah, so to Yeah, so to put it shortly, yes, you can do things when alpha is Louvillian, but in SL2. In simplectic case, it's more difficult. And I don't know. I think maybe in your first theorem, the conjugate can be in syncretic group. I think you can use the clouds. I think you can use the clouds result directly. Your first almost visibility. Yes. Yeah. So, but you want to prove that it's almost visible in SP2SR? In principle, it should be possible, but you see, there are some problems in principle, it's possible. But the point is that in the symplectic group, you've got so for a basically you need a Jordan normal form for symplectic matrices when you try to prove this kind of results for almost reducibility. For almost reducibility, yes, but you already proved this one, but she proved it when it's reducible, I guess. And it's not exactly the same thing. No, no, no. She has another paper, strong almost reducibility. And she can preserve the structure of the group. Okay, thanks. I'm going to check. Yeah, this. Okay. Thank you. Have a look at the Thank you. Have a look at the paper. Thank you. So next talk starts in 20 minutes, 19 minutes. Well, the talk starts at two thirty, okay. So what indicated for I mean that's the photo for an in-person thing. Okay. But this photo was not really under photos. Um printed charge a little bit. I think hearing the point on the outside.
