But here not directly relevant. Yeah, so I think I will mention where you are relevant. But not in the context yet. Sorry. So I thought about the names. And let me briefly introduce these collaborators. Chen Cheng Wong is a colleague in China and working on spatial memory recently and also on this free boundary problem. Started like Like, if I remember correctly, 2019, something like. I think I started discussing this topic with Mark in 2018, something like that. So he joined after one year, made some effort, I will record here, the first published paper. And my colleague Mark Luis here, and of course we know he is at his hometown, Victoria, beautiful city there. And I joined a PhD student, 24. Xuan Shifong and current PhD student, Lu Lei Chen, she transferred from the University of Miami. So, probably some of you know that, at the US visa issue, so she transferred to your birthday. So, she's well trained in PDE stuff at Miami there. So, I think it's good to involve her. And she will I will report her work a bit in the last part, but just the simplest case. Actually, we have uh I will mention that a bit more complicated case, but I will mention that a bit more complicated case, but maybe here it's good to show you some very simple case as initial discussion. And my former PhD student, Yuri Seomani, you may see his name in some talks. He had his THD thesis on the habitat degradation, destruction, and fragmentation. So from the last year of his THD study, we have Study, we have collaboration with Paul. Bo is the airport, big online. So we have heard something from her talk. And of course, we made some efforts in theory or try to connect it to the data. And we saw the data from both talk, but not the theory part. Excuse me, how this slide is super annoying. Yeah, I know. I don't know how to do that yet. How do you turn this out? Yes, I'll try it, then I'll ask the question. I'll try and listen. Okay, so maybe it's Flashin, I can spend uh one more minute uh on the person here. So uh please bear with me because uh Yuri is seeking a tenure track faculty position this year and next year. And he's a postdoc at Oxford and this is his second year postdoc there. So he's looking for a tenure track position in the near future. He's a very has been a very He has been a very good or excellent researcher in PDE modeling and analysis. And now, recently, he is working on the cognitive movement and the modeling and analysis. So, relevant to some talks here, like Louis. Forgive me if I forget some important talks on that topic. And I think, in my view, he can be a good colleague if you have him. He's a very responsible person and independent and. Person and independent and highly self-motivated in research. So I think he's a good colleague to have. Let me come back to the topic here. So we have seen, I think this will save me some time because we have heard a lot from this workshop about the classical so-called Steven condition, right, or Steven problem for ISML team. And if we look at the original physics book, it's beautifully derived for the ISML team, right? For the ice mail team, right, at the interface of water and ice. And we have seen another one, like also from Felix, Halo Shaw problem, also from Felix. So both from Felix. So I don't even go deep on this one because we have seen a few talks at the same time. And we have seen a lot of applications of this one in biology. So, including Avner's work on wound healing, on tumor modeling, cancer modeling, those words. And we have seen a lot of And we have seen a lot of talks in this workshop. I cannot remind you all those talks, but I learned a lot from those talks for this topic. Of course, you're a huge literature. So I cannot, again, forgive me if I don't put so many papers here. There's a lot of papers relevant. And a lot of effort in this direction. Also, mathematically, a lot of effort in this direction. And sometimes challenges, sometimes maybe standard. Strategies, sometimes maybe standard, depends on which purchase we are looking at. And of course, there are a lot of applications for rebounding. And one thing I mentioned because Yi Hong Du and his collaborators, I put one paper, a lot of papers they did for the Stefan condition. And also the non-local version of that. I think the non-local version of Stefan condition gave similar results. Just it looks non-local. You have some integral, yeah. Now we have some integral here, but similar results. I think qualitatively similar. Dismatically slightly different. And they can show this kind of dichotomy. So I believe at least half of the participants here are familiar with this traditional stuff. So you have spreading or vanishing, like all those cases. And of course, they can extend this to the double boundary, but you can imagine double boundary. Boundary, but you can imagine double boundary, just this side, this side, and this follow the same step connection, similar rebounding conditions. Okay, so we're curious about this speed of moving front, which is a constant compared to the minimum speed of traveling wave. And that's always interesting to see this because that's the original question I asked Mark in twenty eight eighteen, I think. I said, Okay, why don't you use the free boundary? That's okay, at first glance, if you talk about free boundary, it seems more realistic. About free boundary seems more than stable because when we have the traveling wave, it's a very popular method to discuss species innovation. So you can have based on the speed of wave speed, right? To say, oh, how fast can you make? But we feel uncomfortable is there's some tail there at infinite time. But of course, Mark said, oh, okay, it's a good approximation anyway. At infinity, you have something there. It looks a bit weird, but I think just. Weird, but I think you just say, oh, that tail is small enough, it's a good approximation. So that's Mark's statement. So I said, oh, if we have the free boundary, oh, it seems better, you have to cut off. Because that's the reality, right? You have the boundary until we are. Like the boundary of the city, it's not that infinity. But this can be a good approximation. Advantage of this traveling web is I think it's still easier to analyze than whatever free boundary. Whatever free boundary. Whatever free boundary is proposed, still not that easy. So it's not easy. Numerically or by mass, right? So there's some advantage there. Yeah, so I'll get into the free boundary classical and go back to that. Of course, you can have something like double boundary, like three boundary. Yeah, so that's a bit of motivation. In my mind, I just have some imagination, say, okay, why Okay, why the stable condition also works in here does the colour, right? Why it works that works well, of course, for ice milk, right? Perfect. But here we just say, oh, can we have some improvement? We miss something. Because I just feel free boundary may be not that free because that's probably leads to Mark's statement, oh, traveling wave or free boundary or look similar, right? Similar, why you make this traveling or free boundary. Free boundary. I think can we make free boundary more free? Like you have more choices, right? And can we do a bit of beta? Of course, the initial idea was very complicated, but I saw this beta. We started with a simple one. We lose attention if we propose whatever cognitive movement, like in your Hagen stuff. If we develop those for the free boundary, it's just a mess, okay? Just a mess. So maybe it's better to start with some. So maybe it's better to start with some even toy model, but a bit better than the classical one. If we have a little bit more battery in the free boundary, that may help to get the attention. And if we can connect this to the state of condition, that would be even better, have some connection. When the model is too complicated, maybe it's a bit off. I think we can do that, but just I don't pretend that here. I just bring that up. Okay, it can be very complicated. This. We have biologists here, they always have, okay, toy model, okay, we can do much better. Yes, that's true. So, one motivating example is this. It's kind of a cartoon picture. I just brought this by hand in PowerPoint, I think. So, if you have food or prey, sufficient food in the habitat, right, and the prey that they should expand their range. Expand their range. It's kind of not reasonable. So, next few slides, not for this model, actually. The last part will be something relevant for this. Again, that's a simple model I present here. That's not a published, I'll present a simpler version. There's a discussion here. Yeah, so let me see what else I want to say. So, next few slides will be a single species model. And the idea comes from something like collective decision-making. Like collective decision making, it sounds like. So, if we have a group here, how we make decisions together. So, that's we think it's probably more reasonable, right, to determine we should expand our CT or shrink our CT. But not occurring at the boundary. So, that's definitely when it's dependent on the boundary what's going on. So, that's again perfect for ice melting, but maybe not how we make the decision, not like that. So, that's a rough idea of the modification. So, of course, this non-local white is different from the non-local version of steven. It's different, even qualitatively, quite different. So, we take the following conceptual ideas for this so-called plenty decisions. Ideas come from social science, including functions. So, especially like the third one. So, the rate of boundary shift is determined by the weighted population inside the range. Both expansion and attraction. Both expansion and detraction effect are small for the population, far away from the boundary. Okay, that's assumption. That's assumption. Maybe not right. Okay, so we assume that's true. And the weighted kernel includes repulsion over short spatial scales and aggregation over long spatial scales. Third one sounds reasonable, right? If we are getting too close, if we stay together with our parents, we may have some conflict. And there's some kind of repulsion. Of republishing. So now I'm in North America, my parents in China, so relationship is much better. No conflict. Okay, we try to aggregate. So that's the rough idea. Yeah, too far away. So you will have some aggregation. You try to aggregate together. It's possible. But if we, even two brands, say, too close, stay every day together, they have some repulsion. That's the idea we use in this model here. Model here. So you can see the free boundary is the h prime equals this. Of course, if you want to write as similar form as the stem condition, it's okay. Put a negative sign in the front. That's fine. Just change the signs, which is two standard functions. It's okay. So either way, it's okay. Okay, it doesn't matter. You put a negative sign inside or outside. So here we have, we can see the key thing is this so-called this weighted kernel. Omega as subtraction of this omega 1 minus omega 2. And we say this. Minus omega 2. And we set this up, this order to make sure, okay, there's some crossing for these two curves. So, which means we can get either positive or negative of this curve. And I think, if I remember correctly, these functions also come from some social science stuff. Just borrow the functions. Try to describe the so-called collective decision. Of course, every is approximation. Okay. So, okay, so So, the C2 has to be positive or? Yeah, so this C1C2 alpha1 alpha2 all positive. And we'll put the order to make it sim cross. And of course, we have sine switch for 7 and integral also possible to have sine switch, but it's harder to determine the sign of the integral, of course. Nature, right? Depending on area between the two curves. And a number two I don't need to repeat. Okay, I already mentioned that. So repulsion or aggregation, right? Aggregation, right? And if we look at this integral here, this one determines really how this free boundary moves, like expand or stream. So if we plot these simple curves omega 1, omega 2, then we can roughly see the shape and when this omega positive, when omega negative, it's easy to determine. And of course, again, it's not easy to determine this because it's u times w, this omega, sorry, not w. W, this omega, sorry, not W omega, then this integral positive or negative. So we need to calculate this positive area, negative A area to see it's positive or negative. It's harder to determine. But this sign of this one is important because that determines we have range expansion or shrinkage, right? So that's an important thing. Oh, stabilized. Stay there, it's at the same size. Yeah, so one connection we show here, the step condition is a spatial limiting case. I think it's interesting to show this, at least we see some connection with classical. Please, we see also some connection with classical starfly theory. So, when the step condition works, right? And yeah, so we can show this as a limiting case, the step condition. It's already published. If you are curious, you can read the paper. And put them together, you get something like this. Looks like this. It's simple enough, but still not that simple. Finalized still can be, some parts can be still. Can be some parts can be still challenging. And yeah, so now I want to mention: we discussed, Thomas, Margaret, and I discussed, tried to derive this guy from the Hitchin equation, from the absence or presence of diffusion. And yeah, we had a lot of note. Sorry, I didn't have time to add something. So we can get something maybe similar from adhesion equation to this form, to this non-local. Non-local or free boundary form. So that gave us some, you can say some derivation for this form before we started with the conceptual ideas. So I think that's good. If anyone has interest for the connection, feel free to talk to me. I don't put that here because it's not published and not really done. Just had some write-up derivation, try to connect this to the history. And we can show local existence and uniqueness of solutions. Yeah, so those are the standard way of post-ness we can show and not have. Okay, this plan not hard. We have standard conditions to show the local existence, uniqueness of solutions. So I guess it's similar to like a K-1 taxis model. So global existence, right? You can show the global existence of solutions. So normally we have this kind of bounding. Have this kind of boundaries, right, to guarantee that. Because if we have blow-up, then we don't have the global existence like some chemotherapy models. We need conditions actually to guarantee no blow-up, right? So here, and the long-term behavior, we need a ridiculously strong assumption that we cannot show. We need to assume this limit exists. In stable connection, that's not a problem. That's monotonous. So it's given for free, so those aren't switched. Free those I switch. So this that's everyone knows right. It's just give known for free, right? But this one, no, we don't know. But this one exists or not, we don't know. So if this one exists, we can have this card. And more interesting thing is we can show this steady state solution. So we can have the stabilized steady state for boundary and the population. So that's something interesting. And I think the proof is only challenging here. Only challenging here. We need a very strong category. Channel here. We need a very strong condition, like exceptional light. Okay. I want to comment that we don't need this strong condition. Okay. So we should be able to weaken this, but that's the first version we got to make this proof work at least. So there's some... The idea is the ace absolute line, we try to put this the kernel at from like zero to so it's how to explain h bar minus epsilon to be high enough, close to a constant. Enough close to a constant, so we can make this inequality work. So the other side we have the control on the kernel. So we just try to make that work. I think it's hard to explain here by words. But if you have interest, you can read the proof. And you will see why we need this connection. But in reality, this connection is too strong to make a biological sense. Okay, maybe two strong out of the biological interest. So we try to simplify or weaken this condition if possible. So at least here we should see a trichotomy like vanishing balancing more spreading. Yeah, so some challenges like the sign switch of this derivative of the free boundary so that we can now use the comparison principle. So basically the existing methods in statement condition fail to do anything here for this one. So that's uh challenging. And uh yeah, that that's paper there like two years ago. There, like two years ago. And numerically, also challenging. Maybe first by show here is okay, but later on, like a high-dimensional space will be more challenging to make it work. And we can see, okay, due to time limitation, I just quickly go through the figures. Okay, I won't get into more recent stuff. So, C1 is the parameter before the first expansion function. So, if C1 is larger and a larger, So, if C1 is larger and larger, we can see, of course, that benefits the species. So, we can see the when C1 is small, then we have the shrinkage of the habitat, right? So, range shrinkage, stabilize, but extinction of the species. Or we can have the similar for the free boundary here, but persistence, right? And steady state. Or if CY is even larger, we have the right expansion and stabilized. Or we can keep expanding like a tremendous wave like that. Like a channeling wave, like that case. And we can calculate the spreading speed versus those key parameters in that kernel function. So we have those four parameters, C1, C2, R1, RPA, 2, to see the monotonicity. And if we compare the initial location of the free boundary, if it's small, then we have the distinction of the species. Or if it's larger, then we have some expansion and the existence of the species. Similar effect on this. Similar effect of this initial population by distribution with low, high, similar to that H0. And we can test the free boundary over different initial positions of free boundary. If it's low, then we have increasing, or you can say range expansion. And when this is not larger, then we may have sometimes increasing, sometimes degrading. Increasing, sometimes degrading, right? So we have the range vintage here. And of course, the last two cases, if we compare them carefully, you see, it seems like this one stabilizes at some value and this one just keep decaying, like keep decaying, at least it's not even larger than this one. Yeah, so which I don't understand, okay, how what's the behavior of the free boundary over time as you study from different locations of the free boundary and uh And we can deal with this double round spreading. And of course, mathematically similar, right? Because just both sides, right? And it's interesting, we want to see how this, because you may have more possibilities, right, for the habitat, right, or the share or the range, right? Large or small. So we have some mass part, and here just show simulation. We can have symmetry case, but the symmetry case, they are similar to the Similar case, they're similar to the single of reboundary, right? And if we have the double-free boundary both sides, then we can have something like more possibilities, right? So we can have shrinkage of the habitat and shifted to the right. And this cause extinction in this case, right? And C1 larger, we have this kind of, oh, this one looks like uh something Mark proposed for the habitat shift, right, according to climate change, something like that similar to that form, right? But we don't have that mechanism here, right? But we don't have that mechanism yet, but just as a free boundary driven, just shift to the right with the same size, right? Same size of the habitat. Or if you have expansion, shift to right or just expansion of both sides. Okay, so let me get to the still have five minutes? Yeah, okay, good. So we'll quickly finish this. So this is unpublished. I think Mark just got this draft this morning. Yeah, yeah. So we have some unfinished draft. Okay, on two. Unfinished the draft, okay. Um to to discuss the kind of uh two-dimensional case, but simplify it because we have three sides fixed, but one side is a real free boundary without any symmetry, assumed. It's random shape, right? The reason we do this, the motivation is a few slides later, like this finger shape, right, from Simon Evans' paper and his collaborators, like 31 years ago. So they had this reporting thing, and the idea is. Thing. And the idea is: can we show this without assuming any periodic function? Because it's cheap. If you have a periodic function in space, periodic function in time, you may easily make some oscillation. But if you don't assume any of those, it may be harder, right? It's just the model-driven. So that's the original idea. And we made some effort in the past two years. Yeah, so it's very slow, okay, very slow. It's over two years, this one we studied. Okay, so I don't have time to go through this, but uh rough idea similar. But rough idea is similar to the single species one. This one is more, it's much easier to make a mistake. So I think I will collected a few versions of this. I think Mark and I don't remember Thomas studied this or not. No, we haven't talked about this. We haven't talked about. So I think Mark and I discussed in the beginning a bit about this. Then we have some productions, but this rough structure is similar. And the idea basically is the same. Collective decision by taking. Here basically the same. Collective decision, but here just two dimensions, you know, we can have all kinds of mistakes. So, what is the boundary? How does the boundary? Normal direction? Oh, this is just the numerator, right? I mean, the free boundary is HD. So, do you define the normal velocity or this one is the same as the single species one. We just have the integral of the kernel integrated. So, you define the upward velocity? Is it normal to the pre-boundary? Oh, I know your question. Before it's one-dimensional, right? So now it's the whole shape, right? The whole shape. Yeah, so the idea is, yes, you can say normal vector toward out toward, right? Something like that. Okay, that's a good question. So before it's a scalar, so it's much easier, just a single function. It's a multiple variable here. Yeah, I I'll try to post this on archive Try to post this on archive soon, maybe a few days. So after Mark read and we proofread that, try to publish and after that. So you can read this just if you are curious about details. As I present this here, so maybe I want to show it anyway on a kite because it's public anyway. Okay, so we can show some serums. Okay, so a quick go-through due to the time. So some local star, right? Time, so some local staff, right? A global staff, so same parallel as the single species case, right? And the long-term behavior, and unfortunately, we cannot show the state state. It exists, but we cannot show. Okay, so numerically, we can show that the state state satisfy some elliptic equation, blah blah blah. So that will be calculated, can be calculated numerically. So we can show this looks like finger shape, but still not convincing because this one is for the t goes to infinity, something like without a proof, without regular proof, just numerically shows. Rigorous proof. Just numerically shows possibility like this chair. Yeah, so more efforts made actually on this to show this real solution. Okay, don't assume any periodic function because just in case, if we should, for example, assume initial function is periodic over time, then over space, that's not fine. Because you just force this to occur. It's not fine. So we want this pattern to be generated by itself, by the model itself, without assuming any periodic function in time or space. So that's what we do. So that's what we did, and that's making this story a bit harder. So it takes actually a long time to get this finger shape. So we cut off the beginning portion. You can imagine, we started from the flat over space. So then it evolves. So over a long time, finally can get something like this uh finger shape and still not stabilize. Actually we don't know the final result. It's it's really keep oscillating over time or just stayed state, we don't know. So it's not clear. Date, we don't know, so it's not clear. But at least we can show the possibility of the finger shape without assuming any periodic function in space or time. So this is time equals 39 and start time equals 40. It looks like always finger shape, but actually we cut off. Okay, so time, we just show from 38, I think. And don't plot the beginning portion because that will hide this portion. You cannot see that. So just cut off the beginning portion for the transition. So this looks like we have a long transition or whatever. This looks like we have a long transition, whatever. This one here. Sure, this pattern we expect to see or to get. Of course, you can argue not always will get this, yes. Depends on the parameters, all those things you choose, right? So in nature, it's the same. Not always will see that phenomenon. So here's some conditions. Okay, so one minute I can finish this. So I don't put the real model for this one, I put a toy model for this one. Because again, we cannot finish this. Because again, we cannot finish this within two years. I think we need at least two more years to finish this. So, the idea is from the original motivation: okay, so if we have food available, crate available inside, outside, right, call this predator negative edition for the range expansion or shrinkage or whatever, the habitat range they need. So, that's the idea. Yeah, so here's the toilet model. Okay, that's the simplest model we can put. This guy just okay, simple enough. This one, even not collective decision, this one simple enough. Even not collective decision. This was simple enough. Okay. We should expand or shrink. Depends on food available inside or outside. They say, oh, if inside more, then I don't need to expand. I'm extreme bit. So if you have more food outside, I need to getting out. Should expand the range, right? So this makes the story too simple? I know it's too simple. Actually, we have the collective decision version of this, which is ridiculously complicated. Because the kernels, something like that. Because the kernels, something like this before, will depend on those resource availability, or you can say, maybe per unit or per capita resource availability, those things. So you have a lot of involvements in those kernels, not just simple as a single species for this case. And we have those, okay, we have those. But we started with this simple one. You can easily argue, okay, it's not that correct, but we just assume the creator is simple enough. Just say, oh, which side? Just say, oh, which side has more foot? Simple enough to make a division. And obviously, this one we use like Stefan form, but you can put the negative sign inside, you can switch the order, it doesn't matter. Because the idea is similar, right? Stefan connection is negative sign in the front because the gradient should be the opposite, right? Gradient. So it's similar, opposite gradient. But if we mimic the single species one, we can put negative sign inside. Yeah, so okay, I don't show you any proofs that it's in progress and this is a list where we have done okay, so we are continuing okay continue this work so still we are business also including like energy estimates of those global existence abundance of resolution local stability in progress so we have done most of this in progress and and much more I think in the calm and I And we have a lot of simulations already. I just picked one. Okay, pick one from Elay. I think Elay did maybe, at least he showed me maybe 10 simulations. So I chose one as an example to actually here. So if we change the alpha, okay, what's alpha? It's kind of intrinsic growth rate of the prey. So okay, imagine, even we don't do any simulation, we know if alpha is larger, that would benefit the whole community if the growth rate of preys is larger. So that's obvious here. So of course, yellow means high. So, of course, yellow means higher density. So, that benefits the whole community. And, of course, the focus is on the pop, not on the population. The focus is on this black guy. You can see that. So, this black curve here is the boundary for pre-data. So, they're from zero to this pre-boundary here. And, of course, outside of this boundary should be zero for pre-data. And that's the case. Okay, the blue is zero. Blue is zero. So, that's the case. And, of course, pre. And of course, pre available everywhere. Okay, here we go. So we can see that it seems like, okay, for this scenario, at least, this simulation, the boundary of the pre-data shift to the right and the more flat, become more flat, right? So, of course, the reading is probably, oh, you can see more, they can pretend more playoff side, right? So from that single, that simple development of the model, that will drive it out, right? If we really put the collective decisions, it's not that simple. The collective decision is not that simple. Okay, it's not that simple. So again, so if you have any interest in this direction, feel free, we can discuss. Private play is okay, I can share anything I have for discussion, it's fine. And the public play, this one, I still hide something, the real model. Let's put the toy model to show, okay, we've tried to make effort to have the predator play case, right? And the predator determining their habitat range. So that's. Range right so I think that's the end. Thank you very much for your attention. Yeah, for this one-dimensional case in the beginning, you had these periodic range expansions. So expand and settle and expand. Is there like a hoff barfocation underlying or are you looking for that? Good question. Mark asked another question as well. We don't know. So we didn't do any analysis on that. So, we can do any analysis on that, what's the possible patterns for this edge, right? So, yeah, so we have zero idea, so we didn't do any biodiversity or anything on that. So, that's possible, but we just don't know. Even the equilibrium, we had a hard time. Yeah, so so the next step we have so far we have no hope, yeah. So far, yeah. Can I follow up on that? Can I follow up on that? I noticed the same thing. I was going to ask the same kind of question. There's sort of a you you have a length scale built into the boundary condition. How far back into the kernel, the distance. So so do does that have any connection to the length scale that you see for the uh the periodic uh increases? Yeah, so that's that's I think all guesses that's possible me candidate. But we can upload that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's good boundaries. So it looks like the at some point the free boundary is moving too fast. So the predator is catching up and then burst. Yeah. Have you used the mu as a restricted? Interesting. I was just curious about two things. One is, in the one species model, can you characterize biologically what is contributing to the balance that gives you the fixed boundary position that does not expand or contract? What is creating that tension that holds the population boundary in place? Okay, good question. Yeah, so that's actually the conditions for the status data to exist. Data to exist and that guy to be stable prime. And that is not answered because the conditions here are ridiculously strong, let's say not relevant even to biology. So if we really want to tell this story to biologists, it's hopeless. Because we need to get close to section nest recognition for the steady state. No, you can't say that, but this one just gave possibility. Yeah, but the conditions are not biologically low. Yeah, but the conditions are not biologically relevant. That's the condition that guarantees that. Yeah, it guarantees that. It's a strong. Yeah, so the second question I want to, or the second comment I want to make, is that you're... With regard to the wildebeest fingers, which I thought was really, the fingers in nature are not going to be stable. They're going to be dynamic, protruding the protection. So looking for a stable-fingered solution. Fingered solution biologically is not something you're going to be able to see a lot of dynamics. Yeah, this is what I said. This one is not relevant, but it's an evolution relevant, time evolution relevant. So it keeps changing. I think these are the right form. Yeah, that's the right form. Because that's time and on the top right, that's time with the right space. So if you're getting these fluctuations. And actually, in the paper, this one deleted. So, Mike, you don't see this paper. So, this is you don't see this figure. So, this figure is not in the paper yet. Sorry, I just show the steady state here. Yeah, so in the paper, we have this to show the tingle shift. Could you explain the moving boundary condition in the two-level shock? Uh you mean the model? That has H prime in it. This one or previous one? No, this is the one. Where is the condition for how the boundary moves? This H prime, right? Partial H, partial T. Second line. Second line, I think, yeah. So you're assuming that H is always a graph of X. Oh, yeah, that's an assumption. So that may be wrong. That's an assumption. So we're making Law, that's an assumption. So we'll make it okay. We got maybe H not a function. Continuity of fingers, it seems like the H could just develop discontinuity. It's like some of these transitions are really, really sharp. Oh, very steep, right? Yeah, very steep, yeah. So I was wondering if you want to do something like a normal direction to the boundary, but that's not what you're implementing here. Yeah, no, that's harder, so that's why we chose this version. Okay. This question. Okay, I think Benson seems to have something to do. I totally agree with you. It should be the normal one. If you look at your picture of animals, the next slide, at some point, they don't really see that there is a particular direction from the world. I think the point is really mathematical features. So I think that people studying water wave, they have this kind of a weight routine. If I remember correctly, we started with normal vectors, and there's some issue mathematically trained to this version simpler. Yeah, sure, I know. So I know the normal, that one is more realistic, I think. Got some normal color parameter, which is derivative in the environment. So with the wildebeests, they have some actual directionality. In other words, they're following what the environment is doing. So they have some directional aspects. Some directional aspect. It's not just a diffusive movement, it's a directive movement that possibly keeps them. You had something that says, you should go this way because the grass is greener in this direction. The wildebeests found that, I think. There's an additional term for literature. So I I'm not I I know the model's too hard already. I'm not saying you should try putting it in. No, it's all about the dimension, I think. With the actual wildebeest, you probably have something like that probably not. I think with the wildebeest, like, I've heard different stories about this famous lion, but there are predators out there, and so the wildebeest don't want to be separated from the herd. And so, there is a sense of wanting to accomplish long-range aggregation, but also short-range propulsion. So, I think that type of term is. That type of term is the right kind of biological term. That's all I'll say. I'm not disputing. No, no. That's correct. There might be some other stuff there. Yeah, and there's also Zagrasskis and stuff, and so they move up. And interestingly, there's work showing that, I don't know about the robot bees, but zebras at least, respond to non-local information. They see rain falling in the distance. Rain falling in the distance after it. Additional things. There's a bunch of additional stuff that's going on. I'm not saying try to do it. I'm just saying there's other things going on. I mentioned that one because we had this discussion about non-orkal information. It's a very attractive problem. I heard in King of the Attractive problems. I heard inputting about it through things. Yeah. The point is still we try to start with symbol if possible. Oh, yeah, this is scraping.
