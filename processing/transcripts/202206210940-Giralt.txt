Co orbital motions to L3 in the restricted planar circular QBAD problem. Thank you. Sorry. One moment, there is a message. No, there is not a message anymore. Should I talk? Okay. So, yes, I'm going to be speaking about the language. So, yes, I'm going to be speaking about the Lagrange point L3. And the work I'm going to present is a joint work with Inma Valdoma and Marcel Guardia, who are also from UPC in Barcelona. So, I'm going to begin by stating the problem. So, is the, okay, the title you can achieve, but restricted planar circular three-body problem. So, a very easy version of the three-body problem. So, I think all of you know a lot about it, but restricted, very quickly, restricted one of the bodies we take to be mass zero. Bodies we take to be mass zero, planar, so all the bodies move on the same plane, and circular, we know the motion of the primaries, which are the other two bodies, which we assume to be circular motions. And the idea is to study the motion of the third body, the massless body, and we denote it by Q of t, which is its position in function of time, and P of t, which is its momenta in function of time. Therefore, we are on a four-dimensional phrase space. And we also, as is classically done, we normalize the masses to be one minus mu and mu, the masses of the primaries. And the idea is we're going to follow a perturbative approach that is. Going to follow a perturbative approach that is taking the mass ratio to be small enough for our computations. And the thing is, when we take the limit case, which is mu equals to zero, we are, it's like the primary p doesn't exist. We are on a two-body problem, but we know how it works. So very easy. So the classical way of dealing with this is taking a rotating framework that is an axis of coordinates that moves with the primaries and let them fix. And when we do that, this system is more. This system is modeled by a Hamiltonian autonomous system, which we can express like this. And we can exploit it into parts: H0, which is the part independent of the mass ratio, and which corresponds to auto-body problem. It's integrable and we know how it works. And then mu H1, which is a perturbation. And the thing is, this perturbation is small when we are far from collision, which is the collisions are the things that are dividing on. Are dividing on the formula. And yes, the classical result again: the system has five critical points, which are called Lagrange points, L1, L2, L3, which are saddle centers, and L4, L5, which are center centers. And the idea is to study L3, which is a saddle center, and to study some of the dynamics surrounding L3 and its invariant manifolds. So, okay, first of all, L3 is one of the maybe less studied points because it's quite far from everything from the primaries. From the primaries. But there are some interesting dynamics on this point. And one of the dynamics that have been studied, it's about these horseshoe-shaped orbits, these that are called horseshoe-shaped orbits. These are orbits that encompass L3, L4, and L5. You can see one of them represented in red. And the interest of these orbits arose first when modeling the motion of co-orbital satellites. And Janus and Epimetheus is one of the most famous ones. And here are some works that deal with these orbits. And also, And also, one of the interest of the dynamics of L3 is that the center-stable and center-unstable manifolds of L3 act as boundaries of regions for effective stability around the Lagrange points L4 and L5. And you can see some of these on this paper of Simososa Civanter in 2013. And also, it's been seen that the invariant manifolds of L3 are able to create transfer orbits between different objects of the system. And in the case of the restricted plan. And in the case of the restricted planar circular three-body problem with the from its small primary to L3, and also in a more complex case, which is the b-circular for body problem between the primaries of the system. Okay, so L3 is in what is called mean-motion resonance with the primaries. That is that if we are taking the original correlative axis, the L3 moves with the same period of the primaries. Of the primaries, and it's also called co-orbital motion. And it is known that mean-motion rationales play an important role in creating instabilities. And our D is to study the instabilities that L3 can create. And we expect maybe in the future to do an analysis of the invariant manifolds of L3 can be applied to other mean-motion resonance on the problem. Okay, so to study chaotic dynamics on celestial mechanics, it's a Celestial mechanics, it's been done in different settings. So, some of the analytic results has been mainly done in two different settings, which is in the vicinity of collision orbits, which worked by Meckel, Volotin, and Mackay, and also close to parabolic orbits, which is all the works that Teresa presented yesterday. And our idea is that our case in L3 is different. So, on these two previous slides, So, on these two previous cases, these two previous settings, well, these two previous categories, the unperturbed problem presents some form of hyperbolicity. And the difference here is that in the case of L3, the hyperbolicity is given by the small perturbation of the system. Therefore, to deal with it, we have to capture it considering an integrable average Hamiltonian. I will talk a little bit more about this later. So, okay, that was the stating. So, now I'm going to present the I'm going to present the main results that we have obtained regarding L3. So, first of all, yes, L is very easy. L3 is a cell-centered critical point. And therefore, it has a one-dimensional stable manifold and one-dimensional and stable manifold. So, I represent the stable by green and then stable by red. And this is a projection into a position plane. Remember, we are on a four-dimensional phase space. Therefore, this is solely two-dimensional. We are missing another two-dimension for the momenta, but I'm going to represent all the pictures. For the momenta, but I'm going to represent all the pictures for only for the position, just to visualize a little bit. And our goal is to study the homoclinic and chaotic phenomena that are around L3 and its invariant manifolds. Okay. So the ideas that we're going to follow to deal with these ideas is to follow the ideas of the splitting of separatist phenomenon. So I'm guessing all of you know a lot about this, but I'm going to introduce a About this, but I'm going to introduce very quickly the classical approach of dealing with the splitting of separatists phenomenon. So, in the classical ideas, we have a periodic orbit, which is on the picture on the left represented in black. And we assume that this periodic orbit has a stable or stable manifold that coincides, forming a separatrix. And the question is, what happens with these stable or stable manifolds when we add a small perturbation represented by epsilon? So, one of the nice things is that if we are able to see that there exists That if we are able to see that there exists transversal intersection between the stable and stable manifolds, we will be able to construct a smell's horseshoe around the periodic orbit and to prove the existence of chaotic motions. And the classical way of dealing with this, with the classical approach of dealing with this problem is one of the classical approaches, using the Moan-Kari-Melnikov method, which very roughly gives you a formula for the distance between the stable and unstable manifolds. And it's a symptotic formula, which is given by this epsilon, which is the small parameter. By this epsilon, which is the small parameter multiplied by m, which is the Melikov function, which depends on different parameters of the system, plus terms of further smaller. Therefore, if you study the Melikov function, you can have an idea of how these stable manifolds behave for small values of epsilon. Okay, so that's the classical approach. So this is what we have obtained regarding 2L3 using these ideas. So we have taken three results. First of all, we have taken what we call the breakdown of the stable. What we call the breakdown of the stable and stable manifolds. The idea is we have obtained an asymptotic formula to compute the distance between the stable and stable manifolds of L3 at a specific section for small values of mu. And this was our main result. And using this result, we have obtained other things that are interesting about the three. The second one, which is omocinic connections, we have studied if there exists or there are exist connections between the stable and stable manifolds of F3 for different values of the Of L3 for different values of the mass ratio, and also we have studied chaotic motions around L3. And the way we have done this is by studying, we have looked for transversal intersections between the stable and stable manifolds of certain Lyapunov periodic orbits close enough to L3. So this is all the three results, and now I'm going to explain them very slower on the next two slides. So first for the first one, which is because we have Which is because we obtain a formula for the distance between stable and stable manifolds. So, first, just the setting, we need to focus. We're going to focus. Notice that L3 has two branches of stable and stable manifolds. We're going to focus on the upper branches, which is the branches that are on the superior part, but the lower branches are symmetric, so that's no problem. And we're going to compute a formula for the distance on this section sigma that we have there. We can choose any section, but this works well. Section, but uh, this worked well, so we set to that. And uh, notice that um, we are on a recall that we are on autonomous systems and the stable and stable manifolds are one-dimensional. Therefore, either the manifolds completely coincide or do not intersect. We cannot find transversal intersection because we are on one-dimensional manifolds. Therefore, even if we're studying this, studying this formula for the distance, we don't need directly to chaos. As I said before, we have to study the stable, stable. To study the stable stable manifolds of periodic orbits close enough to L3. Okay, so now it's the result. This is the formula that we have obtained for the distance. So I'm going to go quick, very slow with this formula. So first of all, QUS and PUS are just the first intersection of the invariant manifolds with the section sigma for the unstable and the stable manifolds. Q is the position and P is the momenta. And the idea is if we subtract them, for small values of P. them, for small values of mu, we get this asymptotic formula. So first term is cubic root of four, that's a number, no problem. Then we have mu one-third, which is a small, because mu is small, it's a small number. And then we have this exponential minus a divided by the square root of mu. a is positive therefore this exponentially something minus very big and therefore this is an exponentially small term it's much more smaller than mu one third and then this is all multiplied by And then this is all multiplied by a constant theta plus terms of order logarithmically smaller than the rest. So there are two constants important in this formula. One is the constant A. So what we have seen is that we are able to compute this formula, this formula, this constant. And this constant is actually given by this integral here. So this is a finite integral. You can compute it with any integral method that you want. And it's roughly 0.177. And the nice thing is that this. And the nice thing is that the expression that we have obtained for A, it agrees with the numerical computations done by in these words by Joaquin Fon in his PhD thesis in 1994, and also again computed by Simos Susa Silo Enter in 2013. So that's it. And then the second important constant in this formula is this constant theta there. So this constant theta is very different from the constant A. It corresponds to a Stokes constant. Therefore, it does not have a closed formula. Therefore, it does not have a closed formula. And notice that if this constant theta is, if this constant theta is zero, then because this is inside the parentheses, this asymptotic formula doesn't give us that much information. But if we are able to see that this constant is different from zero, we are able to tell that for small values of mu, the distance between the stable, stable manifold, they will be exponentially close, but they won't be coincident. This distance won't be zero. This distance won't be zero. And what we have been able to see is that to study this constant, what we do is to study the inner equation of the system to get more information. And studying this, after obtaining this inner equation, we are able to, by numerical computation, to see that theta is approxim 1.63. It's not the best approximation because dealing with exponentially small things on the computer is complex. And the idea is that in the future, we'll be able to implement some computer assistants. To implement some computer-assisted proofs to be able to obtain a rigorous estimate for this constant and to say with more certainty that it's not zero. It doesn't seem to be zero, but it would be nice to prove it more rigorously. Okay, so one of the important things of this formula is this exponentially small term that we have. This is what is called a beyond all orders phenomenon because if you expand the stable and stable manifolds into a Taylor series in mu, you will know all. Move, you will not be able to detect this difference. And that's why all the classical perturbative methods do not apply on this problem, and that it requires more work to obtain the asymptotic formula for the distance. And in fact, if we try to follow the Poincaré-Melikov method that I present before, what we obtain is the following asymptotic formula for the distance, which is okay. But when we try to compute the Melikov function, we see that this Melikov function is exponentially small. That this Malikov function is exponentially small with respect to the square root of mu, and therefore, this deliving term is much of the distance is much more smaller than the rest. And this formula doesn't give us that much information as it is. And why this happens, it can be seen really clear if you compute the eigenvalues of L3. So L3 was a style center. So we have a positive and a negative real eigenvalues, which are the first ones here, and a positive and a negative purely. Here and a positive and a negative purely imaginary eigenvalues. And what you can see is that the saddle eigenvalues, they have this square root of μ multiplying at the beginning. And the thing, what happens is, is that we have the eigenvalues at different time scales, and this is what leads us to a singular perturbation problem. And the idea that Terry commented yesterday too is that we have these rapidly rotating dynamics given by the center, the coupled with this slow hyperbolic behavior. Hyperbolic behavior. And what is that is this is known as exponentially small splitting of separatrices phenomenon. And what happens is that that's what makes that invariant manifolds to be exponentially close to each other with respect to this parameter square root of mu. Okay, so now to give some ideas of what are the difficulties of these problems, when we deal with a perturbative approach, the first thing that we do is just analyze the unperturbed system. Is just analyze the unperturbed system, but the thing here that it can be singularly clear on the eigenvalues: if we take nu equals to zero, um uh L3 L3 remains, but the stable and stable man equals of L3 collapse into a circle of fixed points. You can say the intelligent values, if you take mu equals to zero, you have zero, zero, plus and minus i. And yes, therefore, we have a very degenerate and perturbed system and. Degenerate unperturbed system, and our way of dealing with that is to we need a new better unperturbed system to work with, specifically a one with a saddle center point and separate addresses. Therefore, we have to apply a singular change of coordinates to obtain a new first order. And this change of coordinate, very roughly, is consists on a blow up on the yellow section between the stable and stable manifolds. This is a section of order square root of. Um, for their square root of mu. And if we do that, we obtain a system like this, which is this new Hamiltonian, these new good coordinates, and also scaling the time. It corresponds to that. So we have a new first order given by two Hamiltonians. We have a split in two. And first is HP, which is like a pendulum-like Hamiltonian, which has all the information of the saddle, and HOS, which is the first order of the center part. First, the first order of the center part, which is quite easy, is quite easy, and all of these coupled with a small perturbation of order mu one fourth. And yes, so the part the oscillator part is quite easy, but the part that gives us a little bit more problem is the pendulum-like Hamiltonian. And you can see if you compute it, that it has this Hamiltonian has two Mognet connections or separatories that can be here seen in blue. And the idea is that to obtain the constant A, remember the constant A. Constant A, remember the constant A, which was here on the exponentially small, you obtain this constant A by studying this unperturbed system, by studying the separatrix of this system. So this constant A is derived from the values of the complex singularities of the time parameterization of the separatrix. Okay, so this was our third result. Now the idea is using this result to obtain different behaviors that we can see related to L3 and its invariant manifolds. L3 and its invariant manifolds. So, the first one is these homokinetic connections. So, first, a little bit of setting. We have two branches for the stable and two branches for the unstable. We call the ones that initially surround L5, we call it by upper branches or plus. And the ones that initially surround L4, we call it by minus. So, we are studying two different types of connections between these branches. First, what we call primary homoclinic connections, which are connections between the upper. Which are connections between the upper branches of the manifolds or the lower branches because they are symmetrically the same. And then we study two what we call secondary mocha connections, which are connections with one of the upper branches and one of the lower branches. For example, so connection with the stable positive, stable plus one, with the unstable minus one. So first, we're going to talk a little bit about primary mocking connections, which is quite Uh, which is quite direct, it's just a corollary of the formula we have obtained for the distance. So, if we are able to assume that this constant theta is different from zero, we see that actually they do not exist primary connections between the upper branches. And because of symmetry, we can obtain an analog result for the minus branches and see that actually they do not exist primary mock connections between the stable and stable manifolds of L3. So, that this was only a corollary from our theory of the distance. And now what requires the. Of the distance, and now what requires a little bit more work is to see these secondary mechanic connections. So, there is this conjecture by Barabes Mondelon that they saw numerically that it seems to exist a sequence of mass ratios, of mass ratios mu, such that there exists this type of secondary mechanic connections. In the case in the picture, we have, for example, the stable upper branch connected with the unstable lower branch. And what we've been able to prove using our formula for the Using our formula for the distance between stable and stable manifold, is that again, if we assume that the constant theta is different from zero, we are able to see that actually we have actually to prove that there exists a sequence of mass ratios, such that for these parameters, there exists secondary mokinetic connections. And in addition, we have begun an asymptotic formula of how this sequence of mass ratio actually looks like. So it looks something like this. We have this square root of eight. We have this square root of 821, which is actually the first order of the eigenvalue of the Saddle eigenvalue of L3. So this is just the Saddle eigenvalue. A, which was our constant that appears on the formula for the distance divided by NP. And then for small, for big values of N, we can see that this asymptotic formula holds and it gives you for which mass ratio there exists these homoclinic, secondary homoclinic connections. Secondary hemoclinic connections. Okay, so that was all about our second result. So, and our third result is just to prove the existence of chaotic motions near L3 and its invariant manifolds. So, first, by the Lyapunov center theorem, we have that it's a classical result. There exists a family of Lyapunov periodic orbits surrounding L3, which are represented there on the top picture in purple. And the thing is, we denote them by this. thing is we denote them by this p rho and we use rho to index each uh periodic orbit so we take rho equals to zero we will have l3 and when we keep increasing rho we keep increasing the hamiltonian energy level of the periodic orbits and we can this way we can classify the periodic orbits that's the idea so uh to prove these chaotic motions what we do is study lyapunov periodic orbits close enough to l3 so it uh which choose one um which are really close to l3 Which are really close to a three. And these periodic corbids will have two-dimensional stable and two-dimensional unstable manifolds. And the idea is to look for transversal intersections of these manifolds by comparing them with what we know, which is the stable and stable manifolds of L3 that we already have studied before. So the idea of how to look for these transversal intersections is geometrically, it can be seen very, very easily, which is as the following. So again, Which is the following. So, again, like we did on the stable manifolds of L3, we choose a section, for example, the section sigma, which is the same as we used before. And we want to see what happens for each value of rho. So if we take rho equals to zero, we are on the setting that we had on the beginning. So we have stable manifolds are one-dimensional, therefore we have two points there, which is the intersection with the section sigma. And we know that they are exponentially close to each other, but are not the same. That's what we proved before. Are not the same, that's what we proved before. The thing is, if you keep increasing this row, you keep getting these two-dimensional invariant manifolds, and which it can be seen that they are topologically something similar like circles. And if you keep adding, they keep increasing the circles, and it will get to a moment, to a moment which this called rho equals rho minimum, where these stable and stable manifolds will touch, will have a quadratic tangency between them. And if you keep adding, if you keep increasing this value. Add if you keep increasing these values rho, you will have transversal intersection between the stable and unstable manifolds. So we have geometrically can be seen quite clearly that there is a range of values rho, but for which they exist these transversal intersections. So this is the idea, and now put it, if you put it in words, is this theorem here. A little bit more confusing than the pictures, but so again, it just there exists this, first we have to assume that the constant theta is different from zero. That the constant theta is different from zero to see that stable and stable manifolds do not coincide. And for the value values of mu, there exists this function rho minus and rho max, for which there exists transversal intersections, if you are on the range between rho minus and rho max. And if you are on the at least there exists at least two transversal intersection, because there were the two of the circles that intersect. And then for rho equals to rho minus, there exists at least one quadratic. They exist at least one quadratic tangency on this energy level. And what we have also seen is that we have given an idea of how big this value of rho is. And the thing is that these values row, they have to be exponentially small, mu two-thirds exponentially small with respect to the square root of mu. They are one bigger than the other, but they are exponentially small. Therefore, these, I'm going back. This, I'm not going back. This range here that we have, it has to be a range very, we have to select periodic average exponentially close to L3. So we don't know what happens when we get farther from L3. And with these ideas, we've seen that we can construct, because we have terms and intersection, therefore we can construct a smell-Horschu map in a neighborhood of an exponentially small tubular neighborhood of the main manifolds the FL3. And because we have a quadratic tangency, now this is what we are actually. Now, this is what we are actually trying to look: is that we should be able to construct also a new house domain. And okay, so now that was all. So just to conclude, I'm going to make a summary of what I have obtained. So first, we have obtained an asymptotic formula for the distance between the stable and stable manifolds of F3. This was the thing that was most time consuming to prove. And it's sum it up in these two first. Sum it up in these two first papers. And then on this third paper that we're working on, it's well, it's the paper where we use this formula for the distance to obtain these results. So we obtain the not existence of primary mocclin connection and the existence of secondary mocclin connections for certain values of the mass ratio. And also we prove the existence of chaotic motions close to the invariant manifolds of L3. And yes, the two first papers are on archive. Papers are on archive if someone wants to look at them, and we are working on the third paper. Um, yes, I still have time. Yes, okay. So then after proving this, one of the questions, the immediate questions is to ask about what happens with arnold diffusion. So in our case, Arnold diffusion corresponds to a drift in angular momentum. So the thing to prove. The thing to prove in carnal diffusion, we have a lot of difficulties to see that. So we say future work, but it's a very hard problem. So long term, very long-term future work. So the difficulties that come from trying to study Arnold diffusion on this setting are, well, there are mainly two that we know of. Probably there are a lot of more. But the first one is that we have to prove transversality of the invariant manifolds for a large range of Lyapunov periodic orbits. Remember that. Periodic orbits. Remember that on here we have studied the intersection transversally, but for a very small range of periodic orbits. So we will have to expand this result to prove transversality for a much range, a bigger range of Lyapunov periodic orbits. So in this case, we cannot compare them with the one-dimensional L3. So we will have to do more work to obtain some results about transversality in this case. And also, one of the other This case. And also, one of the other problems that we face on this setting is that we have too low dimensions. This setting has too low dimensions. It's a two degrees of freedom setting. So we don't have enough dimensions to prove to possess Arnold diffusion. So the idea we have to consider another setting, like for example, the restricted planar elliptical three-body problem for small values of eccentricity, or also the restricted spatial circular three-body problem will be some possible option. So the idea is. So, the idea is that our work that we have done can be seen as a first order for higher dimensional models. But again, this is a very hard problem with very long-term future work, but just to comment it before finishing. And yes, that's all. Thank you for your attention. Ah, okay. There are questions, and I'm gonna repeat them. Yeah, the first question is probably will be enough attention. So, the second I speak very quickly, I'm sorry. The second neo-mobile turn or therefore they are yes, I haven't said it. They have to be on a first turn, after round. Second round, yes. All of them are in the second round. Yes, yes, you cannot turn around like good. not uh turn around uh like going and going to l4 and then l5 and then connecting the result that we have is only for first round it can well second round yes and my second question is if you take other periodic orbits far away from the origin far away from the saddle point okay yes the problems looks more difficult or or I mean do you think in this potential is more answer in this case? I'm guessing yes, but I have no idea about you will have to repeat everything you've done for the one-dimensional of L3 with these periodic orbits. Because the Lyapunov exponents are more for all the periodic orbits? I don't know. I haven't looked at it. I'm guessing yes, but without having any. Without having any intuition. I'm yes. I haven't, well, yes. I don't know if I repeat the question. Okay, thank you. Yeah, I have no intuition. I have a question. The symptomatic response of the distance between the stable and the stable mental you have these two constants, A and C. Yes. And you have an estimate of these two constants, but you don't know. Uh, yes, you really need to have a precise uh estimate, or you just need the theta is the non-zero. Uh, see the question, okay. Yes, uh, you are asking if uh I need a precise estimate for theta, or just to know that it's not zero. Uh, I don't I only need that it's not zero, yes, and it's not depending on mu or anything that it's a constant, not uh and you cannot prove that it's not zero soda. Not theory. So, analytically, analytically, no, there are no res well, there are some results using resolution theory about to prove this type of things, but it's very difficult. In some special cases, using CNN, you can say computers or in the end of course. Yeah, so he said that Katinski is a computer assistant group. Yeah, so I repeat what Tere said, which Repeat what Tere said, which is there are some results to find this inner this stokes constant, which use some symmetries of the problem, which we're very specific. And in general, we cannot prove that it's any information about it. But using computer-assisted proofs with Macie Kapinski, we are trying to obtain some estimates for this constant to see that it's actually not zero. So how does this formula that you put in Foreman one compare? That you put in theorem one compare with things that you obtain by doing brutally the Melnikov method. How this formula compares? I mean, is the Melnikov method? I mean, can you prove that the Melnikov method is correct? Prove that the Melnikov method is incorrect? The Melikov method is incorrect. When you're doing the proof analytically, you see that there are values of we haven't computed the Melikov. We haven't computed the Melikov function actually to see that it's not equivalent. But when you work, when you do all the analytical proof, you see that there are of these exponentially small terms, there are terms that come from the Melikov function and also terms that come from the perturbation. So when you're doing the proof, you see actually that to obtain this first order, you get terms from this Melikov function and terms from the perturbation that goes after. So we haven't computed. After. So we haven't computed, but yeah, it doesn't give the first order for sure. Okay, another question. Okay. What kind of missions can you study in the neighborhood of L3? Because it's behind this. So on and so on. Okay, the question is: what kind of emissions can you model with these with the L3 points? I don't know if there is any emission in L3 because it's quite far from everything and it's behind the sun. Yeah, the nice thing that has L3 in terms of, well, one of the nice things, it's this thing that it seems the center stable center stable manifolds of L3 act as boundaries for regions of Of L3 act as boundaries for regions of stability around L4 and L5. So, this is the thing that they give you: a region where all the stability and L4 and L5 happens. But about missions, I have no idea. There is this work that's doing now, Angel Jorvan, Begonian Nicolas, but this is on the bicircular for body problem. And they use that they have transfer orbit using L3, the variant manifolds of L3, they have transfer orbits between the primaries, and they use that to prove that there exists. And they use that to prove that there exists a connection for asteroids to go from the moon to the earth things. So, this is the applications that I've seen on kind of a special, but yes, L3 is very far away with better technology, maybe. It's very important. Space missions, L1. L1. Yeah, L3. Even far. Yes. Yes, I'm not an expert on that. I know that there is. I'm not an expert on that. I know that there is the results, but they focus more on L1 and L2 because it's easier to get there to L3. Okay. There are no more questions. We thank Margaret. We will continue in five minutes. I speak really, really quickly.
