To do that. But I can at least acknowledge the people that did this work. My graduate students, Kit, Lewis, and Laura. They're the pictures. I'm in front, so you don't need to see a picture of me. So that's a picture of me teaching in my dinosaur costume. That's a lot of play. Although I have a new idea for a costume this year. We'll talk about that a little bit later. There's going to be some audio participation in this talk, so stay. Participation in this talk, so stay on your toes here for 7:30 p.m. talk. So, I think Paul summarized it best as kind of what we do as experimentalists: a lot of it is really just kind of poking things with a stick. So, today I'm going to be talking about some of our work, poking things with sticks. You know, it's very tough acts to follow with tissue talks we had earlier today with the Todd and Fred. But this is going to be another tissue talk. It's going to be a tissue talk about the spinal cord. Talk about the spinal cord and our adventures in poking a spinal cord. And the reason we care about poking spinal cords or why we're doing this is that my lab makes scaffolds for regenerative medicine to implant into the spinal cord. And understanding what the mechanical environment and how it changes when there's an injury is super important when we're doing this fancy 3D printing and other approaches that we have to try to regenerate the damaged nervous system in the spinal cord. The damaged nervous system in the spinal cord. I wanted to give a quick shout-out first. This is some new work that I haven't really talked about yet, but it's one of those things if you're really excited about it, you can't stop talking about it. So we have this way of 3D printing hydrogels. We collaborated with Jordan Miller, formerly of Rice University, on the photo cross-snippable hydrogels. And what we started to do was to incorporate clip chemistry. Incorporate clip chemistry into some of the photo inks so that we can 3D print whatever kind of cool topology we want. Here's just like a simple vascular bifurcation. And then we can put in peptide motifs spatially heterogeneous, wherever we want to put the peptide, you can. So here, like if you want to have a cell binding motif, like an RGD or some kind of like cell cell motif like AVD. So this is a gel where we have RGD that's RFP labeled in the bulk of the high. RFP labeled that in the bulk of the hydrogel, and then we can align inside with a motif to mimic lamin. So we can do lots of cool stuff. It's so shameless, but we had to do it, making the RU for Roan University. So we did like one peptide in the R, another peptide in the U, and they're like inter, you know, interspersed. I felt so bad asking my student to do it, but at the same time, I was like, we've reached that point of, you know. Point of, you know. But yeah, it's really cool stuff, and we're using it a lot for blood flow. I'm going to talk a lot about blood flow today. So here's a video. And so we're showing that depending on the stiffness of these scaffolds, we can get them to pulse with pulsed blood flow. And so it's just a lot of neat stuff. And so what we're doing with the spinal cord work is that we are making scaffolds with channels in them with peptides that we think are neurogenic. So we can get access. Are neurogenic, so you can get axons to grow through them. And that's a picture of what you see here. So we have a label motif that will bind to the axon growth cone, and we see some axons penetrating. So that's kind of where all this is headed is making scaffolds that have the right mechanical properties with this EVID approach. So let's get into it. The spinal cord is just like a weird, strange tissue. And things only get weirder after an injury. There is no cause. There is no collagen type 1. You think, like most ECMs have fibrillar collagens, the spinal cord does not. And when you have an injury to the spinal cord, most often it's a contusion injury. So if somebody has an accident and breaks the neck, the vertebral bone will push into the cord and you'll get this almost like a bruise in the spinal cord. And what happens is that you get this, it's called liquefactive necrosis. So the tissue inside the So, the tissue inside the cord actually liquefies and forms a cyst. And that cyst over time will progress. So, you have this almost liquid state that over time will get softer, and then I'll show in a little bit that it actually gets stiffer. And so, it's a very dynamic mechanical environment that we're trying to understand. And this is showing some of the stuff going on. There's lots of proteoglycans. We heard about agracan earlier. There's definitely a lot of agrican, a lot of hyaluronin. And when you have And when you have an injury, you get certain kinds of proteoglycans, sulfated proteoglycans, will come in and will prevent the axons from developing. There's been a lot of great work, you know, standing on the shoulders of giants, so they say. So Moenenberry had a fantastic study looking at AFM of a cord after injury. And he went out to about three weeks. So this diagram, the blue that you're seeing here, is softening. The blue that you're seeing here is softening, and so he's showing at the injury site, you get the softening, and as it progresses, it gets a little bit more diffuse. You see a lot of vimentin that starts to form in the injury, so your ECM changes, and other people have shown this. And it's kind of a weird effect because you think of like an injury, especially in like a dermal tissue or elsewhere. And when you have an injury, generally you get stiffening, so the tissue gets stiffer. And it does in the spinal cord too. And it does in the spinal cord too, but not before it gets softer. So this all kind of shows, or what's been done before, is always looking at like a day past injury. So what we wanted to do was to figure out what's happening in the minutes to the hours in the shorter time frame. Good question. How do you get in there with an AFM? Being a surface technique. So do they slice it somehow? They do, yeah. So he probably, actually, it's a good question. He probably, actually, it's a good question on how they did that in the paper. Yeah, these are coronal sections, so I'm guessing they have to get it out, cut it, and then tap. Coronal is like the cross-section in that plane. That means it's a different sample than on those different days. Yes. That's right. So our plan to look at the short time frame injury response was to use bovine spinal cord. Use bovine spinal cord. So, thanks to a great partnership or history that Paul has with a butcher in rural South Jersey, I have infinite access to as much spinal cord and blood as I want. So you see the blood that we have here, and you see the cord. And we've gotten very good at perfusing whole blood through things. We use citrate, and that slows down the coagulation. And that slows down the coagulation process. And we can get things to flow for a really long time before they start to flop. So I'll show a video here. So this is blood labeled with Evans Blue. We have our little homemade pump. It's our amino controlled, and it can control the flow rate. And so you see the Evans Blue blood enter into the anterior spinal, main spinal artery in the anterior side, and then it kind of branches off into all these tributaries. These tributaries. And so we wanted to have perfusion. We thought perfusion would be important because a lot of these injury processes might be mediated by breakdown of this blood-spinal cord barrier. So we have the tissue in a scenario that we think is going to be realistic. I mean, it's not in the animal, obviously. But it's something that it's approximating. It's really the closest we can get for an ex-vivo model. How do you ensure there's no injury in the extraction model? So that's a great question, Fred. And they actually invited me back to the killing floor recently. And it's really amazing what they do. They take like a chainsaw and they literally just go right down the middle and then pull the cord out. So what we do, we take that cord and then we take the Dora off of it. So if the Dora is disrupted, the Dora is like. Is disrupted. The Dora is like a collagen, like fibrous layer that goes around the cord. So if that's damaged, then we don't touch that part of the tissue. And usually, like, if there is damage, we won't be able to get good cannulation into the artery too. So that's another good indicator. I had my wife was on vacation like two weeks ago, and I had my boys with me, and they asked me again to go to the killing floor. I was like, maybe not this time. All right, so. So we saw surface level. We wanted to make sure that the blood was actually perfusing the parenchyma of the tissue. So we took some blood and we put like two mega-Dalton fluorescent dextrands. And on the outside, lots of fluorescence. But you can see these penetrating arteries coming. This is the white matter. And then what's really going on, a lot of cool action here is the gray matter. There's a very high rate of blood flow in the gray matter. Of blood flow in the gray matter. And so, and it's not like larger arterials either. If you look, this is a higher magnification image, you can see these are like capillary scenel vessels. So, it's interesting as advertised, we wanted to start poking on it. So, we have a Kibron tensiometer that we stole from Paul's lab. Paul's lab, and we perfused it. The black dots here are control. The colored ones are just different samples of an injured animal. The injury that we do is we have a spherical and dead force with our collaborators at Drexel. So, not much going on, right? There's no real trend. There's no softening. We went out in some cases to like three hours. I don't know what this break in the data is. I don't know what this break in the data is. Maybe Lara had to take a break. I mean, it was poking that many times, it must have gotten pretty intense, but she's like an all-star of a grad student. So she got a ton of data here, but really, no, you're a little bit disappointed, because it didn't make sense to me or it didn't seem logical that you would not have any effect in the first three hours. Like to have something get injured and then stay constant for like six hours and then, because we know after a day drops. Because we know after a day it drops, but we thought we would see something sooner, and it was weird that we didn't. So, the idea that we had when we kind of went back to the drawing board on this was that the way this Kibron probe works is it's basically just a little, imagine like a paper clip that's hanging on a very delicate spring. And as it goes down, it's unloading that spring. So, the only force that's really pushing down is the weight of that clip. So, it's very like low, small indentation depths. Low, small indentation depths. And every diagram that we ever see of cysts forming in spinal cord, it's always in the middle of the cord. And when we do our surgeries at Drexel and we can play at our scaffolds, they will contuse the cord in the animal, and then they will inject in the scaffold in the center of the cord. So even though you're hitting the cord on the outside, it's the inside of the cord that undergoes this liquefaction process. So we thought maybe we're doing this with a tensiometer, we're not indenting the tissue enough. We're not indenting the tissue enough to see this softening that's occurring inside. And as Christoph pointed out or helped me point out, is that with Moenenberg, when they're doing AFM, they're doing coronal sections. So they're getting into the tissue to show that softening. So, you know, we poke things. Let's poke it with something else. So this was how we were doing the injury. We had that spherical indenter. So we were getting force deformation curves from this indenter. From this indenter. So I thought, hey, why don't you measure using the Hertz equation for a spherical indenter into an elastic half space? Why don't we just back out an elastic modulus from that when you injure it and then wait 30, 60 minutes and see what happens? And when we did that, we do see a decrease. So the light gray here is cords that we injured and then tested 30 minutes later. And the black is a cord that we tested. And the black is a chord that we tested initially and then evaluated an hour later. And you see a pretty substantial drop in the elastic modulus. But there's an issue. When we were using the tensiometer, we were getting values of like 5, 6, 7 kPa. When we use the indenter, we were getting values of like 40 kPa. So let's take a moment to talk about the Hertz model. Moment to talk about the Hertz model being used to test or to evaluate biological tissues. And really, when I say talk about, that's what I mean. So even just slowing down the rate of the indenter, it makes sense, right? You have viscoelastic tissue, so I said, why don't you indent at 2 millimeters per second? Lara was indenting at 6 millimeters per second because she wanted to match the force that we were seeing or that we were applying to the animal. That we were applying to the animal. So we weren't using six millimeters per second for any measurement reason. So I said, why don't you slow the thing down and see what happens? And then when she did that, the modulus dropped down, not quite to what it was with the Kibron, but it dropped down quite a bit. So looking at this, the Kibron is like a cylindrical thing. So we use this relationship for the contact mechanics. The indenter and really AFM, usually, right? The AFM tip is a. Usually, right, the head femtip is attached to a spherical probe, usually, looking at cells and tissues. So we use that relationship. So I had this idea actually this morning. I want to make, I thought, so I was trained as an aerospace engineer when I was an undergrad, and we learned a lot about dimensionless scaling. So, you know, you think about like when they test a Boeing or some airplane, they, you know, put it in a wind tongue. Plane, they put it in a wind tunnel and they match the Reynolds number of what it would be like for an actual plane. So I thought, you know, like the Kibron is a different scale than the indenter. Like, why don't we have some kind of dimensionless parameter? So I made a number. I was inspired. Jean-Francois and I were having a conversation about fruit number when we saw the waterfalls. So it's really kind of a cheap rip-off of a fruit number where we have a gravity term. Where we have a gravity term multiplied by a probe diameter. Take the square root of that and divide it by the rate of indentation. And I plotted the modulus that you got for, I calculated this dimensionless number for the six millimeter per second, two millimeter per second. This is the tensiometer. And this is an example for an AFM. So we've measured it with AFM before. We get very low, like 100, 200 pascals with an AFM. Pascals with an AFM. So we use the rate of indentation with the AFM. That's for a one micron spherical diameter. And we see this really, I don't know, if you plot on a log-log scale, it's like a straight line. So do you guys think this is a good idea? So my idea is that when you report any kind of indentation data for a viscoelastic solid, you should report this number. Why gravitational? Yeah, why don't you? Why not? Yeah, why do you why not? Because No, I know, I know, but I can't think of anything better to make it dimensionless. Oh, but it shouldn't really play a role. It shouldn't what? The weight shouldn't play a role. No, I agree. But like I said, I couldn't think of anything different. Acceleration, you know, different acceleration of the problem. No, because it's indented at, well, assuming constant rate of indications. But it stops, it has to stop. I don't know. Do you guys like this idea or no? Can we get like a raising hands? This is like an okay thing? Alright, well I didn't consult Paul before I want to do this, but if you guys do like this, I think we can call this Jan May number as an homage to my postdoc mentor. If you guys don't like this, I consult with him first. So if you hate it, Paul, then we could change the name. But anyway, it's just something that I. But anyway, it's just something that I think as a field we should probably start to think about because people report these indentations. Christophe mentioned it last night with indenting a shell for the cell membrane. It's just Hertz is not a good model. And you see people now do it with no spherical tip at all. It's hard to match values because it's really not, this assumption of an elastic has space is not a good one. So I think this. So, I think this might not be the best way to overcome it, but hopefully. It doesn't look like it's the problem with the half-space, though, because even your large tip is not as big as the small. But it's tall, so it's. But it's tall, so it's maybe getting I think it's the assumption that you have an elastic thing, that you're indenting. It's like it's my idea. I mean, okay, someone's costing you about it, but if you wait long enough, does it keep creeping? If you bring down your needle or your indenter, but then wait. Does it settle exponentially? Yeah, I mean, it doesn't, well, for our stuff, it doesn't come back to its original. It doesn't go back to like zero force. Oh, so it stays embedded when you pull the thing off? So it stays indented when you pull the thing off? Well, if we did that, if we indented either a Kivron probe or that big indenter or even an AFM, I guess we've never tried that. But if you indent a certain level, you'll get exponential decay in the force. But that decay doesn't go all the way down to zero. No, no, it shouldn't. That means it's elastic. Well, that would mean it would be viscoelastic, right? Inelastic, you wouldn't elastic, it wouldn't change. At zero frequency, it's in elastic. It doesn't creep. Creep is a different thing than force relaxation. Creep is a different thing than force relaxation, though, right? Creep is you have a constant force and you're seeing it deform. Yeah, so it would just creep the force lower and lower. It does. It exponentially decays. So it does force relax, and that is a viscal acid pattern. I just want to throw out an idea. I'm sorry if it's not cool, Paul. Well, so it might be relevant to this, but you're patiently measuring some uniaxial strain. You know, strange. But, you know, a bunch of people have measured the shear modulus in CNS tissues. And then there's this interesting phenomenon that, depending on which measure you do, if you measure the frequency dependence of a piece of brain or spinal cord, you never reach a plateau. The G prime is on a log clock over like maybe four or five orders of magnitude of frequency. G prime is just continuously going down as though it really is. Going down as though it really is a liquid, but it's a liquid on a time scale you never access experimentally. But in between, there's no plateau? I mean, if you come from high frequencies, does the plateau often then maybe keep pretty? Nope. If you just, if you go from like, I mean, the plot I'm thinking of is if you go from 100 hertz to 10 to the minus third hertz, if you plot G prime versus frequency, a lot. Prime versus frequency. On a log, log plot, you just get a straight line. And if you do it with other tissues that have collagen, you don't. Then you do get this plateau. But with these things which don't have a collagen network, you never get that. It's just always getting soft terms. Do you remember what slope that is, though? What's the power law? And also, the tissue could be decaying, too. Like, this tissue really starts to decay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. If you don't know that. But anyway, moving on. So get back into the nitty-gritty here. So we did a test where we didn't perfuse. So we did a test where we didn't perfuse the blood through it. So it's the same thing. We injure it, and then we look 60 minutes later. Black is being perfused, gray is not being perfused. You can see you do not have as much of a reduction in the elastic stiffness over time when you're not perfusing it. So I don't know what's going on. So we asked, we did some, I asked my asked Lara to do some Evans Blue to see if Evans Blue is getting out of the vessels after an injury. Of the vessels after an injury. It's not like the most groundbreaking finding to say that the barrier, the blood spinal cord barrier, breaks down after an injury, but that's what we see. So after an injury, the blood spinal cord barrier, it should keep Evans blue in, but you can see it's getting out of the vessel after an injury. I don't understand whether it's like some kind of inflammatory process, but why that would weaken the matrix. I don't know what's going on. So, this is all very new data. We just took this. This is all very new data. We just took this this week. So, fresh off the presses. So, that's kind of our next step: is to figure out why perfusion matters. So, do you have any ATP source or basically nutrient or anything without blood perfusion? So, it just sits in like an artificial CSF bath. So, is there anything like Ragamortis, where bios and actin are binding up? I know, because we did studies for a previous thing. Studies for a previous thing where we kept it in that artificial CSF for eight hours and it had no change in myelin and laminin and all these features. So, if there's glucose in the blood and everything's popping out. In the blood, but I was thinking about the case when you stop the blood. Then it might just run out of it and not on that time scale. Well, not on 60 minutes. We know though that if you've not if you don't have it in that artificial CSF, it will start to like just become goo. Start to just become goo. Yeah, the spinal cord tissue does not tense out. Okay, so that's kind of the end of that story. That's all new stuff. Lara did that. She's just been here for a year, so really just a fantastic job that she's done. So that's kind of that story. So now moving on to kind of the next step in my story. So we want to be able to do this in vitro. We want to be able to model or mimic this dynamic change in stiffness. We want to do it in vitro. Stiffness, we want to do it in vitro. And several years back, when I was crashing in Paul's lab, he was mentioning this idea of magnetoreology from a colleague that he works with in Latvia. And magnetoreology, I guess, traditionally was for like fluids. So he was saying, though, that you could get these effects in the hydrogen. So there's a lot of benefits of using a magneto or magnetic approach. Magneto or magnetic approach. I know other approaches people use are a lot of photochemistry or other things that are slow, oftentimes irreversible. We wanted something that you could almost instantaneously change the mechanical properties. So this is some magnetoreology. We have this really fancy setup where you can control the magnetic field with a, it has a temperature feedback, so you can keep things at 37. So, you can keep things at 37C. And this is work all done by Steve Kit, who's now making more money than me in industry. He made a good move after he graduated with his PhD. But he would have been a great postdoc if he did. What he did was he took five microglocollagen hydrogels and he put in different weight percents of carbonyl iron microparticles. And so, this, the blue, yellow, and red is showing the different levels. The blue, yellow, and red is showing the different levels of magnetic field that he applied. That's overlaid here with the T prime and G double prime of three different weight percentages of the carbonyl iron. So for 10 weight percent, that's like extremely high. So that's like the collagen gel looks completely black at that point, completely opaque, you can't see through it at all. But you can get some ridiculous increases in storage logics. Modules. So, with a field here of like 400 millitesla, it goes up to above 30 kPa for a 5 nicromil Hodge trail, which at its equilibrium after it polymerizes, it's like maybe 400 to 500 Pascals. So it's almost like a two-order of magnitude difference that you can get. I will say we never use this for our stuff because my bend on it and what I wanted to take and run with it was to use this to have cells in it. So we wanted to see as So we wanted to see, as this is a, we want to use it as a cell system to change the mechanics of a cell-seated hydrogen. And cells don't do well with 10 weight percent. But they do fine with lower weight percents, and you can still get some pretty substantial changes. Now, I'm going to go. I'm not a physicist. Nobody's ever accused me of being a physicist or a theorist or not even that good of an engineer, but I'm going to try to go into some of the theories. I'm going to try to go into some of the theory. This is all courtesy of Dr. Can you pronounce it, please, Paul? Javas. Okay. Yeah, I don't know Latvian. Just the way it's working. Yeah, that's right. So this is theory that we worked with with him. I figured this, I don't ever get to talk about this when I present this data, so find, oh shoot. All right. That audience participation thing. So I don't ever get to talk about this. So, I don't ever get to, but this is a good venue, I feel like, to talk about this. So, the way this theory works is that you have a magnetic permeability, and what this equation is showing is that the magnetic permeability is a function of the deformation tensor. So, we have our magnetic permeability of the deformed gel. This is the undeformed gel. A1 and A2 are constants. Here's your deformation tensor, product of delta, all that good stuff. For an incompressible, this is assuming. This is assuming incompressibility, so if you assume incompressibility, then this drops out of the equation. This term for the stress as a function of the magnetization and the magnetic field, that comes from a lot of magneto-reological fluid theory, where the cross product of the magnetization and the magnetic field, you have that Levi-Savita term, because this Term because this is all in Einstein notation, so that gets it into regular tensor notation. And so this is the shear stress as a function of the product of the magnetization and the field. We assume linear shear because this is being done at like 1% strain in a rheometer. The shear stress becomes a function of, since we have our We have our shear strain here that's linear. We plug this in with this term and we get an equation for the shear stress that is a function of the magnetic field. Then we can relate the storage modulus back to the shear stress, and we get an equation that is quadratic for the magnetic field. So this is really matches PDMS really well. So this is a graph showing PDMS. Showing PBMS. This is its storage modulus as a function of field. And it fits that quadratic equation that Andres has come up with really well. Collagen and fibrin, not so much. They don't have quite as much of a quadratic fit. It's more linear for those hydrogels. So we wanted to show on a rheometer that we could image beads on whether the That we could image beads on whether the presence of a magnetic field would be able to change how much particles are moving as we try to deform the gel. So we have three different levels of constantly applied shear stress, and then we calculated or we measured the deformation of fluorescently labeled magnetic particles inside the gel for these three different stresses. And you can see that with the magnetic field on, there's a pretty substantial reduction in how much the beads are moving when we're. How much the beads are moving when we're trying to form. This is basically a creek, right? Because it's a constant stress and the gel is deforming a certain amount with time. This is one meg per mil salmon fibrin that we use this. We have this idea of whether or not beads are applying a pre-stress to the network. So, if you can imagine you have these magnetic particles, and in the presence of a field, they're going to form dipoles. Of a field, they're going to form dipoles. And if you do this in like water, the magnetic particles will form lines along the magnetic field lines. So we wanted to see: is this effect that we're seeing when we apply a magnetic field, is it these particles try to move in the lines and deforming the fibers and thus applying the pre-stress? So, what we did was we took two and five micromil collagen hydrogels. We imaged them before applying the magnetic field, which is in Field, which is in cyan, and then magenta is when we apply the field. This is pre-polymerization, this is post-polymerization. So this gel hasn't become a solid yet. This one has. And you can see that before it polymerizes, the beads do move when you apply a field. But after it polymerizes, those beads do not move between before we apply the field and after we apply the field. What's the scale bar? Scale bar there is. Scale bar there is 20 microns. So the idea here is that the particles are not applying any pre-stress that we think, and that they are basically entrapped in this field so that when you try to apply the shear to the fibrous network, those fibers are kind of running into particles that don't want to move. So we wanted to see how cells would respond. How cells would respond to this. So we took spin muscle cells in a 5 microml collagen, 1 microml hyaluronin, and 0.5 weight percent magnetic particle hydrogel. So without the field, the cells could move the particles as they interacted with their matrix. And then when we applied the magnetic field, those particles formed less. So it's this idea that, you know, even on a macro scale, we see less B. Even on a macro scale, we see less bead movement when we're applying a bulk shear. But this is a cell, on the scale of a cell, you also have the same effect that it's harder to deform the matrix when this magnetic field is applied. And we want to, so, you know, still this idea of whether or not this is related to pre-stress, we've used all different kinds of matrices to show that this effect works. So I've shown collagen, I've shown fibrin. Collagen, I showed fibrin. What I wanted to do was take really high molecular weight HA, uncrossed it. So it's a viscous fluid. And we put in five, well, it's a concentration of five mc per mil. We put in two different weight percents of magnetic particles, and we like jacked up the field. So we got to one Tesla, so a very high field, and you can see that the storage modulus, you can get an actual storage modulus in these discus hydrogen. In these viscous hydrogels. So, if pre-stress really was the way that this was working, you can pre-stress a hyaluronic fluid as much as you want, and it's not going to start acting, not going to start giving you a storage modulus. This effect, though, we see it. So we see the hyaluronis start to act, they're start to have a measurable storage modulus. And we think it's because, again, these large network of polymers now have to try to move past these. Now we have to try to move past these magnetic particles that are in the way. And we showed that we could actually get cells to spread in one of these liquid on-cross link pyloron and hydrogels when we had the particles and field applied. How am I doing, Veronica? 40 minutes left for questions now. She's in. Okay. Real quick, we want to see how long it takes for cells to respond, so we did some calcium imaging. And so, this is just cells and collagen. These are just muscle cells, so they're just kind of constantly undergoing this membrane depolarization. We did that with the collagen hydrogel with magnetic particles in it. And I don't know if you're able to see it, or it's kind of hard just looking at it now, but we do an off-on-off cycle. And then we measured what's the transient, the calcium transience, when the field is on versus when the field is off. And this is on a scale of three. And this is on a scale of three seconds. So the field's off for three seconds, it's on for three seconds, and then off again for three seconds. And we measure a significant difference in how quick the calcium gradient or transient is in cells. So it's this idea that you're stiffening the matrix and cells on the scale of seconds are responding to it in just the way they're handling their calcium. It's almost like an immediate response. So this is a longer-term study. This is a longer-term study, and so we have kind of three conditions. We have a magnetic field applied with no beads, we have beads with no magnetic field, and then we have both a field with beads. We see that in this case, when there's a magnet applied but no beads, the cell is able to spread. This is 11 hours, this is 22 hours. So, spread, still spread. This is no field, but beads. So, the beads don't inhibit the spreading. And then we have the field applied with the beads. And then we have the field applied with the beads, and the cells are unable to spread. You can imagine it's like you see that a lot with people that do the peg hydrogels, where it's so stiff that the cells can't actually move and spread. And we're seeing the same effect here when we stiffen hydrogel. I'm sorry, like going away too late. And then the last thing, so this is quantification of that, showing the cell area, cell shape index, which is like a fancy circularity spread area. This is 11 hours. This is 11 hours. This is 22 hours. Alright, and then that will just finish up there because, so we did the aptaz, but if you want to talk to that about that, you can ask me later. Acknowledgements, all the grad students and some undergrads in my lab, people in Paul's lab, and It's like Fisher, Ying, and Julian do all the animal work. And I want to acknowledge some personal acknowledgements too for letting me come out here, my kids. And this, I know it's weird seeing you. And this, I know it's weird seeing you holding a beer, but this is my idea for those of you who saw Barbie for my costume. It's nice I get the idea, like, you know, they're at home, like, you know, Nina, my wife, has to take care of four kids while I'm gone, so I'm very appreciative that I come and do all these fun things and meet all of you. So that's it. So about the uh magnetic the effect of magnetic fields. So I think you're saying that the gel has to move past the particles as you sh form the gel. Are you saying that the magnetic field is trapping the particles at particular locations? I think so. Or not so much that, or more they're resisting motion relative to one another. So as you're trying to deform the network of fibers, those particles are in a state that they're resisting moving. They're resisting moving because they don't want to. So, the idea with the here, I'll draw on the chalk for it. So, if you have particles that are like this, right? So, if you have like your positive, negative, like then they'd be attracted to one another, right? But if you have particles where you have plus, minus, plus, minus, like that, they'd be repulsive to one another. I don't know. I mean, just that's my fault. I mean, just that's my thought. Do you have another thought as to why there's... If I sheared the network around, why wouldn't both of those pairs just keep the same relative motion and be removed? Oh, you know what I mean? A homogeneous field, right? A homogeneous magnetic field. Yeah. I don't see why the particles would somehow be trapped. So you're saying relative their motion relative to the hydrogel versus relative to like just some stationary spot in space? Spot in space. Well, I thought you were sort of arguing stationary because we were saying that the gel would move fast enough, right? Yeah, so I guess I was thinking that, that they'd be relative to some point in space they would not want to move. They'd be trapped by a magnetic field. But your picture, but what does happen is this effect goes away at very large strains. So could there be something happening if you move the particles less than one body length? One body length, then you are always putting them in, you are preferentially putting them in something that is more repulsive than attractive. I can see the point if you just randomized it. If you sheared it, you just get another random distribution. Well, the B positions look pretty random. Yeah. If the problem is fluid, they form lines. And they line up. So that's what they want. That's the lowest energy state. Right. If there's nothing stopping them, that's what they want. If there's nothing stopping them, that's what they would have. But this interaction is just a strong resistance, no. No, they differ. No, no, no, they want to be in line. I forget the ratio, but they differ. It's a stronger attractive interaction. So if you actually average over all orientations, you get an F attraction. They just have to do it. Just iron, so they just respond with magnetic field. Are they fixed or if they're fixed? They would rotate if you change the field. If you like change the orientation of the field, they would rotate. So I think goose will be stronger. If you have just an iron particle, you can induce the dipole. That's right, right. But if they're next to each other. If they're next to each other, they repel. Yes, because they would repel. If you have them this way, they would repeat. But then how does it work with the hyler? I mean, so for me, the thing that really gets me over the hump with whether or not it's like a free stress on a fiber is that it works with liquid it works with a viscous liquid. It works with a viscous liquid of like a really long chain polymer. Well, it depends on the storage. The storage model is way higher than what you would expect. Zero frequency is fine. Yeah, I agree. The storage of the bottom is top. But anyway, I just I I'm still puzzled by what magnetic field is. But the forces are peak anyway, right? Okay, one test not a big field. One test is pretty sizable. Yeah. Tesla's pretty sizable. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, the machine only goes up to like one and a half Teslas, so that's uh, yeah. I mean, I didn't really think of it. I guess I was thinking they were fixed in space, but I could see what your point is, that they're really just fixed relative to one another. And so if the whole gel performs here and spoiling some whiskey, I don't know. Probably. Yeah, we can talk.
