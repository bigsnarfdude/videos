Sorry. So we have Jacinta Torres talking to us about atoms in charge of the electricity. Yeah. That's right. So, alright. Let's start. So I'm going to talk to you about some joint work, mostly with Leonardo Patimo, but I will also mention some joint work with Manchek Duenga and Tomás Gerber. And let's just get started right away. So the, oh yeah, so I'm going. So the, oh yeah, so I'm going to start with some kind of historical overview of why one should care about this stuff. And then in the end, I'll give you some small like math content thing. So we'll start with a complex and simple D algebra and two dominant ways. You can always think of SLN and partitions, but keep in mind that the talk does say B on type A, so that's the case for which most stuff is known in this case. Most stuff is known in this case, like for this problem. Alright, so we take d lambda mu to be the dimension of the mu weight space of b lambda, which would be the simple representation for g of highest weight lambda. Bless you. And yeah, and mu is dominant, so we have two partitions. Two partitions in type A. And then we consider its Q analog, which is called the Koska-Fuchs polynomial. What does this mean? Well, okay, in particular, it means that when you substitute q equals to 1 into k lambda mu, then it gives you back your d lambda mu, which is also known as the Koska numbers. And this is also the definition of the Koska-Fulk polynomial. Polynomial, this PQ is some form of cost of partition function. And I'll say no more about that, but I will just give you some different incarnations so that you will see how these polynomials appear kind of in different scenarios. And this is all type independent, even though it looks like type A. It looks like type A. So the Koska-Fuls polynomial are changes of basis coefficients between the Shur polynomials and the Holy Tul polynomials, of course in Taipei, but also in other types where you would have to migrate to the affine Heke algebra to make these computations make sense. And they are also, this is representation theory, so they also appear as junk polynomials of the Polynomials of the Berlinski filtration. I just wrote down the polynomials just to let you see what it looks like. They are, yeah, so that's it. And there are also Kasan-Luksi polynomials for the extended affine Hecke algebra. So from these two last incarnations, you can see that these polynomials have positive coefficients, and this leads one to formulate the following big open problem. Big open problem to find that positive combinatorial formula for k lambda mu of q. And what does that mean? So it means that you have a set, which I have conveniently named V lambda mu. And this is a terrible typo, so it has the cardinality V lambda mu. Sorry. Okay. And a map which assigns. And a map which assigns to each element of V lambda mu a positive integer such that you can express your Koska-Pulspoly novel in this way. And okay, so we call such a charm a charge statistic after Lascoux and Schuzzen-Berger who solved this problem for type AN. So this means for G equals SLN. And they did this quite some time ago. Some time ago. Okay, so now let's see some picture of what they did. So this is like an interlude. So just you know how to do the chart statistic here. I would use the same permutation as before. You can compute it for any word of the semi-standard young table, but I'll just do this one. So you start with one and you label it by. You start with one and you label it by zero, and then you have to go like you have to find two and three and so on. So if two is to the right of one, you don't do anything to the label and you just leave it the same. And if your next consecutive number is to the left, then you add one. So one and then one, two, three. Two and three. And then you add them all up together. So three plus one is four, plus two is six, seven, eight. Okay, so this is the charge of this word. Right? Okay, and so this is a nice picture of some fun fact I Some fun fact I didn't know, I think it's kind of fun. That if you take half of the crystal of the adjoint representation in type A and you look at the strings, like all the way from the top to the bottom, these are all permutations. Then the charge of the corresponding word of the tableau that you have here is, well, they're like complement. They're like complementary in some with the descent of the corresponding thing. And also, like each... Yeah, so these are a number of descents and each path in there is like a representative of permutations which have precisely that. Precisely that set of designs. So that's kind of funny. I don't know if anyone knew that, but I discovered it recently. I thought it's kind of cool. Okay, so that's like chart in type A. Lots of nice things about it. And now let's go beyond type A. We still have some minutes. So let's see. What is known? So, okay. Okay, this is just another interpretation, and I wrote it there because it's in terms of crystal operators. This set B lambda mu is going to be like the weight mu elements of a crystal V lambda. And last school at Lairk Tibor reinterpreted the charge of type A in terms of crystal operators. There was like a big hope, according to Peter Littlemann, he told me, yes, everybody thought that this was great because then you could. Thought that this was great because then you could generalize it to other types, but it didn't really work out. Okay. Later on, Lecober made a conjecture in type CN in terms of Kashiwar and Akashima tableau, and then we proved it, but only for like one row, and it was 40 pages. 40 pages. So it's a pretty complicated conjecture, and I mean, some of us have seen today some cashier and cashima tableaus, so they're kind of annoying. And the conjecture is very, very tricky. And the proof, like for that one row, is like we found a really nice way to reinterpret the conjecture. And in general, like we, okay, we honestly we haven't worked on it more. Okay, so. Okay, so Lambda is a coupet's formula. They also have a completely different formula for what are called the generalized exponents in type CN. So these are k lambda zeros. And these are in terms of king tableaus. So they are like different tableaus. And until recently there was no crystal structure on them. If anyone understands that crystal structure, I'd be really happy to talk to you, because I don't understand this paper. On this paper. Next. So now it's like Hatimo did something super cool, which was he reproved the combinatorial charge statistic by Las Couches and Bergère. In fact, he reproved the Claire-La Couti-Bones one, which is the same. And he did it by translating the problem of finding charge into the affront-Grossmannian, which is, okay, basically, it's like how I wrote it here: a charge statistic can be determined. Here, HR statistic can be deduced after finding some atoms, which is a slicing of your crystal into pieces which are like crystals, but they just have multiplicity one. So that's an atom. And with those, one can define swapping functions, which mimic combinatorily something called wall crossing or hyperbolic localization. Localization. And the approach, so the set he like proved a bunch of things which provide a setting for which one can do this type independently. However, the construction of atoms and therefore also these functions is not type independent. So this needs to be done like case by case. So far, it's not really clear if this is going to be like a great If this is gonna be like a great success, but it's the only like really set up for finding a solution somehow. So we have a statistic for type C2 with atoms and swapping functions and so on. We have a charge statistic and we have something called a pre-atomic decomposition for type CN. For type CN and something like that, that's what I'm going to talk to you about: what the idea behind constructing this slicing of crystals. But, okay, I'm not going to give you the exact chart statistic today because it's late. But we have one, and I'll tell you if you want to know more about it. But the cool thing is how to find these. Find this stuff, these splittings. So now let's kind of waver away from this, and I'll tell you some cool facts that we discovered about crystals, which might seem super, super kind of basic. And it gave us some map that we had found while constructing this static splitting type C2, and we can generalize it to type CN. Okay, so. Okay, so we take three crystals and some element of one of them. Okay, this J, just take it because we're going to take some crystal operators later. And so we take A in A such that A is the lowest weight in A, B in B, such that B is the highest weight, and we take And we take the weight of the A tensor B to be zero and um A tensor B is the lowest or equivalently highest weight bracket in A tensor B yeah, because it has weight zero. So, okay, anyway, we consider the flip map, which is just that, like, would you just That, like, would you just swap B to the other side? And then the lemma says that this is a crystal morphism. So that's it kind of. So if fj of c is not zero, so if it's defined, then when you flip fj applied to this element, then you get this bunch of equalities. And similarly for ej. So, okay. So, okay. You'll see why I've made all this stuff in a second. And, okay, so the corollary is, I'll just say like in one sentence, that one can find actually an isomorphic image of C inside of B tensor C tensor A given the condition. Given the conditions of the previous lemma, and this implies that if you have a Lie algebra of type A or C and you take the highest root called theta, then the flip map induces some embedding of crystals which looks like this. You embed B lambda into B lambda plus theta. And basically what you do is the following. So I'm gonna just show Is the following. So I'm gonna just show you for type A. I'll also show you for type C, why not? So for type A, let's say we have type A n minus 1. So our tableaus are filled with 1 until n. And let's say you take just any old tableau there and you concatenate here this column one until n minus one and then here you just concatenate one box with n. Concatenate one box with n. Okay, if you take the charge of this tableau, it's actually just one plus the charge of this one. And okay, that's a cool observation, which is kind of really obvious. But this is, that's the embedding, okay? And in type CN, you can do this. So if you know Kashimar and Kashiman Davlov, oh, sorry, well, you can this. Oh, sorry. Well, you can. This is cancer product. But maybe I'll just write it like this. So for Cacially Ware Nitrocema Tabulos, it's like this. You put a 1 and a 1 bar. And here the highest root is 2 omega 1. Here it is omega 1 plus omega minus 1. Yeah, and okay, and how to construct this decomposition? Since the idea is that you take The composite sense the idea is that you take the image of B lambda into B lambda plus theta and then you take the complement. And the complement is going to be like the first pre-atom. For type C2, we found something more, which was take the pre-atoms and then make embeddings of pre-atoms, take complements there, and there we got the atoms. So far, for type CN, we only have this map which produces some pre-atoms. They're pre-atoms because they don't have multiplicity one, but they're only. Have a multiplicity one, but they're like better. Okay, and then this is just saying that the previous embedding G increases the known charge statistics by one, but this it mostly refers to the one we found in type C2. In type A, it's pretty clear, right? And I don't know, I feel really good about this idea of this map. I think it should exist for all the crystals, and you don't. For all the crystals, and you don't need to have these crystally conditions, this flip map. Like, I think it exists in all the types, and we have some examples of this, but this is related to string polytopes. And we're just starting to think about this. Okay, thank you. Yeah. Yep, so you focus that both lambda and you have to be dominant. Do you know what happens just even in type A with the Costco-Folks polynomials when mu is non-dominant? Like, do we have an analog of charge in those cases? Oh, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, I have no idea. Yeah, cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Well, since you have done for type-C, uh IP? Yes, it's very sad. I mean, so wait. So, I mean, I think the map exists in all the types, but not like this. Okay? So this is super nice because you just... It's so nice. You just write down this map and it's given by this flip map and you can show that it's compatible with the crystal structure. It doesn't work because the longest root is just omega 2 for everything else. So you can't decompose it like that. Does this flip map come is it related to this map by Enriquez Kem myself? Flipping the temper vectors in a 10 percent than a password? No, because that's um that's the commutator, but it's used inside the fusion, right? It's like you flip and then you apply the super thing. So this is part of that. Okay, they're not the same. They're not the same. And then how does your Christian then also have a paper? Yeah, that's that's what I mentioned at the beginning. Like his oh, you mean like like his charge? Oh, you mean like like his charge statistic for his other charge statistic? Yeah, yeah, but this is but this is not for Kosko-Flut polynomials, no? For the for the one-sum um this is you also slide for the weight multiplicity? Yeah, these are the weight the yeah, these are the weight multiplicities. And I mean he does have this favor with the weight. Maybe we take away the material.
