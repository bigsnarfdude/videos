Thank you for the introduction. And I would also like to thank our organizers for arranging this workshop and kind invitation for me. I'm sorry that my visa is still under process, so I cannot be there in person, but I'm still very honored to have this chance to give a talk today. Talk today. So, today's talk is based on joined works with Professor Yi Hong Du and Dr. Wen Jing Yi. This talk is divided into three parts, which will cover some previous works, the epidemic model with three boundaries on the different kinds of diffusions. So I would like to first mention the biological model. Would like to first mention the epidemic model that we have studied for this time. It is one of the fecal oral transmission epidemics called cholera. The chain of the infection of cholera can be roughly divided into several steps. So the bacteria cause the vibral cholera. And our bodies, when we when we our bodies when we drink or eat contaminated food or or water or food once inside it grows in our small intestine and then it passes out through phases which can contaminate the environment or water again spreading the bacteria to other people so it So, it is still one of the most threatened infectious diseases in this world. So, in 1973, Capaso and Pari Fantana, they used this ODE model to model the cholera epidemic, sorry, happened in Europe in 1973, and they used ET to denote population density of Population density of bacteria and time t, and use weight t to denote the population density of effective humans and time t. So, for the coefficients, this A11 is a natural death rate of the bacteria, and this A12 is the growth rate of bacteria contributed by those effective humans. So, this A22 is the death rate of effective humans. Death rate of effective humans that died of the earth from this kind of disease, and this GU is the effective rate of humans. So here this effective rate of humans GU is assumed to satisfy two conditions. For example, it is continuously differentiable and it's zero when there are no bacteria and it's strictly increasing. Strictly increasing of the bacterial population, and also this term is strictly decreasing, and this inequality is assumed to be satisfied. So, for convenience, we can show there is an example for this kind of JU. Then, the authors obtained a threshold number R0 and show that when they and show that when this R0 is less than one, then the solution pair goes to zero as t goes to infinity. So the epidemic disappears. But when R0 is greater than or equal to one, then this solution pair approaches the pair U star with as t goes to infinity and then the infinity and then the epidemic persists. So this U star V star is a unique positive equilibrium of the ODE problem one and it is given by these two expressions. So however in the special movements of this problem of the bacteria and effective humans Bacteria and effective humans in this problem have been ignored, which is not realistic enough. So if we net UXT VXTP, the densities of bacteria and infected humans at space location X and time T, respectively. And also, if assume that the bacteria move in space following the Brownian motion law and Motion law and the movement of effective humans is small and is ignored. So the previous ODE problem become this reaction diffusion system three. And this system was investigated by Professor Wang and Zhao in 2004. They investigated the traveling wave solution. Traveling wave solution of this kind of form that satisfies this problem for and these two boundary conditions. So they found out that there exists a unique positive six star such that for every say that is greater than or equal to six star, the This problem has a monotone traveling wave solution collecting the zero and the equilibrium. But when C is greater than zero and less than C star, there is no such wave solution. And also, the spreading speed was determined by Sime and Professor Zhou. They showed that. So they show that this star is the asymptotic spreading speed of the epidemic. So the epidemic region in this problem is in the whole space R, but in reality, we know the region is often finite. And so it's important for us to know. It's important for us to know how the region evolves in time. So, Professor Du and Professor Ling introduced the free boundary problem to solve this kind of shortcoming in feature KPP problem in one dimensional space. So, following their approach in these two works, they considered the free boundary problem. they considered the free boundary problem of the of the previous of the previous system three as as shown in this problem five so this gt and ht are the moving boundaries and h prime t g prime t are the free boundary condition specially called the stefan condition and the mu rule And the mu0 are positive constants, and h0 is the radius of the initial population range. And the free boundary condition can be explained as that the expanding rate of the infection region is proportional to a linear calculation of the spatial gradient of population. Gradient of population densities u and way at its fronts. So, for this red boundary problem, we show that it has a unique positive solution defined for all positivity, and its long-time dynamics can be characterized by a spreading varying dichotomy. Dichotomy. So, more specifically, if vanishing happens, that is, the length of the population range is finite when t goes to infinity, and the solution pair will be zero uniformly in this population range. While for a spreading case, happens. Spreading case happens, it means that the population range will be the whole space R and the solution pair will be U star V star local uniformly in the whole space R. And this U star V star is the unique positive equilibrium of the corresponding ODE problem. Corresponding ODE problem. There are also criteria pretended to determine when spreading or vanishing will happen. So let this be the unique solution of the free boundary problem now. And recall that the threshold R0, which was given in the ODE problem. In the ODE problem, and they obtain when R0 is less than or equal to 1, the vanishing always happens. But when R0 is greater than 1, it will be a new critical length, capital L star, which is from the eigenvalue problem. And for and if the radius of the initial Radius of the initial population range H0 is greater than or equal to this critical length L star, then spreading always happens. But if H0 is less than L star, then there will be a positive mu star such that valishing happens when mu is in this interval and In this interval, and spreading happens when is greater than this star. So, here I would like to mention that this L star is from the eigenvalue provenance, and it only depends on the coefficients and R0 in this expression. But the smooth star depends on the initial data. So, when the spreading When the spreading happens, it is very natural to ask what the spreading speed will be for the moving fronts. So, we obtain that when spreading happens, and obviously, R0 will be greater than one. So, zero. Than one. So there is a unique C star such that the moving fronts Ht and minus Jt increasing linearly and the spreading speed is a constant C0 and it can be obtained from the associated semi-wave problem of the free boundary problem. So here I would like to mention some related works to this free boundary problem as well. When the diffusion of the effective human is ignored, the non-term dynamics was considered by Professor N Beik and Ling. And subsequently, the spreading speed was determined by Zhao Ling. Meant by Zhao, Li and Ni in 2020. Well, the previous discussion was actually based on the local diffusion, but in reality, we know that the movements of the agents and effective humans often contain long-range dispersal, like people take flights or trains traveling through countries. Trains traveling through countries. So it's a phenomenon that can be hardly ignored. And also, it can be described by non-local diffusion operator. So we replaced the Laflausian terms in the previous model by these two non-local diffusion operators. So these kernel functions can be roughly Can be roughly described as the probability of an individual moving from a special location X to location Y. So mathematically, we assume kind of functions satisfy this basic assumption, like it's continuous, symmetric, and non-active, and so on. Then we further Then we further considered the long-local version of the previous free boundary provenance, as it can be shown in the provenance six. So here we can say the Laplacian terms are replaced and also there is a non-local term in the reaction term, which is this one. So we use non-local term to replace that one. Term to replace that one because we assume we think it's more realistic. Sorry. And also, because in human society, the human wastes are the main resources for the bacteria. So it moves immediately from the specific location followed in the human. So we think this term will be better. It will be better described in Lan Local. And also, the free boundary conditions are changed accordingly. So this can be roughly described as the expanding rate of the front is proportional to the linear calculation of the odd flat. The alt flux. So here this kernel function kx also satisfies the basic assumption j. So for this unlocal problem, we obtain that it also has a unique solution defined for all positivity. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And for the long time dynamics, a spreading value chain dichotomy also holds for positivity. So the criteria for the spreading value dichotomy were also determined by starting its corresponding economic problem. Economic problem but what but the different part is between between the local diffusion and non-local diffusion is that the spreading speed it is finite if and only if this condition is holding for the kernel. The kernel functions j1 and j2. But when this condition is not satisfied by them, then the spreading speed will be infinite. And this case is called accelerated spreading. So for the accelerated spreading, we can show that for some We can show that for some typical classes of kernel functions, the rate of the accelerated expansion of the epidemic region. So first, I'll give some definitions of the dominating kernel function. We say J1 is dominating among two functions, J1 and J2, if there is a constant, positive constant C, such that J2 is less than. J2 is less than or equal to say J1 for all X in the whole space. So the first class of the kernel function, we assume it satisfies this one. The kernel function behaves like the absolute value of x to the power of minus alpha for a very large absolute value of x. Absolute value of x and positive alpha. So clearly, when we only consider the case for alpha is greater than one and less than or equal to two, because when alpha is less than or equal to one, then the basic assumption j is not satisfied. But if alpha is greater than two, then g1 hold and the spreading speed is finite. So, for the case alpha is in one is greater than one and less than or equal to two, we found that when spreading happens to the long-local problem for very large t, the moving fronts minus jt and ht behave like t to the power of one over alpha minus one when alpha is greater than one or and less than two when alpha is equal to To when alpha is equal to two, then the moving front will behave like t times non of t. So for the second kernel functions, a second class of kernel functions, we assume that the dominating one satisfies this one for very large absolute value of x and also for. X and also for beta that is greater than one, then we found that when spreading happens for very large t, the lung of minus jt and norm of h t behaves like t to the power of one over beta. So I also like to mention some other works that is related to this non-local diffusion problem. This long local diffusion problem. So, when the long-local term in the reaction term is changed back to A12A, Jao and his co-focus, they started the case that the diffusion of the effective humans is ignored, and they learned the long-term dynamics of the corresponding problem. Of the corresponding problem. And later, Zhang and Professor Du Ze considered a more general case based on this one. So this kind of non-local problem with free boundary was first considered by Tao and her co-workers on the facial KPP problem in 2019 and later. And later, Professor Du and Professor Li and Professor Zhouze considered the semi-wave problem and the spreading speed of the fictional KPP problem with free boundaries. So that's what we followed their steps to consider the epidemic problem. So it's all I want to talk about today, and thanks. About today, and thanks for your attention. And sorry for the coughing during this talk. I was sick recently and it's better now, but still, I'm sorry for that. Thank you. China is still quite early in the morning. What time is it? Yeah, yeah, it's five. I think it's almost 6 a.m. I think it's almost 6 a.m. Thanks for getting off so early. Are there any questions? One question. How do these power law kernels compare with the fractional Laplacian? Sorry? You mean the. You mean the the power law power law so jx near infinity behaves like x to the minus alpha so if you use fractional applaution there's a singular kernel but at infinity it behaves like a power two yeah Yeah, yeah. Now I'm not sure she understood your question, but my guess is that you perhaps ask if we change the j to the singular one so we have a fractional opposition. What happens? We tried to extend this non-local free boundary problem to the fractional Laplace case. Case. Oh, wow, but we had a problem using the existing techniques. We couldn't overcome the difficulty arising from the singularity. But very recently, we made some breakthroughs. We just had to try to use a new method. We had to use approximation to do it. And we are still working on it. Working on it for just a single KPP case, so not the same. And yeah, I will still work on it, but I believe for this spreading, accelerated spreading, the singularity will not affect you. And my guess is that, so for if alpha equals indimension one, I think it's one plus. S over two or two s or something perhaps would be signal if we haven't started to check yeah because in the whole line without the boundary condition you get exponential directly so that the boundary would really make a difference in this case. Yeah, it needs a free boundary slows down spray. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Any other questions? I want to check whether there are questions online. If there are no further questions, let's thank the Ron again for a nice thought. Thank you.
