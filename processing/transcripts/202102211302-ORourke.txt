It's just a card. And let me get it in front of the camera. And this is what happens when you open it. And I'll do it one more time. And now what I'll do is explain the mechanism behind that. Okay, you should see my screen there and feel free to interrupt me at any point. So this is an animation that I didn't make of the pop-up spinner, and it's useful to see here. To see here that it's a single piece of cardboard and with cuts in it, but there are no holes. And let me show you how you would make it. So if this is the card here, you cut these dashed lines and you leave these red and blue lines as mountain and valley folds alternating. Folds alternating. So maybe this picture is clearer. If you take the card and fold it in half, then you come down with scissors here, but you don't go all the way through. And these are all parallel. So to go back to here, the cuts all stop before they meet. And consequently, Consequently, through the center of this construction, it's not disconnected. So, again, this is a cut, then you have a mountain fold, valley fold, mountain, valley. So, along this strip here, it's not disconnected. And that's what we're going to concentrate on. This is mountain, this is valley. Back to the card here. Card here. Well, you can't see it so much there, but this is the picture. So I'm going to abandon this for a while and talk about the mathematics and then come back to the card. And this is not easy to, well, you can see you just have to make these parallel cuts, but you can make lots of mistakes here. But you'll see at the end, there's an easier way to do it. Way to do it. So I'm going to talk about linkages and in particular polygonal chains, which is just a chain of segments in space connected at joints. And the segments are rigid bars. They can't change their length. And the joints are usually, for example, this would be a universal joint. Here's one link. And the next link can take any angle. Take any angle, any point on a sphere surrounding that. That's called a universal joint. That's not what we're looking at. We're looking at revolute joints, which maintain a fixed angle. In this case, it's 90 degrees. Let's call that alpha. You can have, and it revolves around here. And so we're going to look at chains whose links are rigid bars connected. Bars connected up with a fixed angle revolute constraint. Sometimes this is called a dihedral motion. So if you take three links, you see here, and they're at 90 degrees, and then you can swivel one. And if you put a plane in here, you can think of it as like closing a door. And so you get a, you're changing the diagonal. So, you get a, you're changing the dihedral angle here. Now, the reason that I and my student, Nadia Ben Bernu, were studying this, is for protein folding. So, this is a model of a protein backbone of an amino acid, as a matter of fact. And it turns out it behaves like a fixed angle. A fixed angle linkage or polygonal chain. And the angle between the carbon-carbon nitrogen atoms is about 115 degrees. And it's the same here, and it's the same here, and it's the same here. It goes along like that. That's not completely accurate, but it's pretty accurate. And moreover, the connecting links, these yellow. Connecting links, these yellow, are all about the same length, about 1.4 angstroms. And so, and finally, this angle is fixed. And so there's a possible motion of revolute motion of these. So this is why we were studying fixed-angled revolute chains. Now, the molecular biologists like to understand how curled up a Understand how curled up a protein molecule is. And for that, they like to know what is its maximum possible length. And they call that the max span. And that would be the longest a chain could ever be end to end. That's called the max span. And so we try to understand how to compute the max span of a fixed angle chain. A fixed angle chain. And the theorem that I'm going to show you and prove is this: that the unique max span configuration of a unit 90 degree chain. So unit here means all the links are exactly the same length. And 90 degrees is what I showed you: is that each pair of links sharing a vertex makes a 90-degree angle. 90 degree angle. The max span is achieved by the planar staircase configuration. So, this is what I'm going to show you. This was part of Nadia Van Bernou's undergraduate thesis, a small part of that. This is what I mean by staircase configuration. It's almost obvious. This is 10 links, all the same length, 90 degrees. And this is the span, and in fact, the max span. And in fact, the max span. This is nine links, and so it's a little different. I'm only going to show you the proof for even number of links. It's a little bit harder for odd number of links, but still not that hard. And this is not a staircase. So, this figure will take me a little time to explain, but Time to explain, but this is a 90-degree chain, and the links are not the same length. So, this is not a unit chain, but it's a 90-degree chain. And so you have to imagine that it's free to swivel at every joint, but maintaining 90 degrees with the next link. And this is the max span configuration. And notice it's fundamentally three-dimensions, it's not planar. It's not planar. And over here is a top view. So there's a planar section here, and there's a planar section here that you're looking edge on, and then there's another section. So it's a kind of tricky thing. And this was the subject of her thesis. And incidentally, she went on to get her PhD pursuing the same questions. So the MaxSpan configuration is The max span configuration is quite tricky. But when you have unit length, it follows that theorem. In other words, if all the links are the same length. So what I'd like to do is show you how that's the case. And you can imagine, for example, this is a 90-degree unit chain, all the same length, all 90 degrees. Length all 90 degrees, and I swiveled randomly and then just connected the two endpoints. And the question is: is this the max span? And that theorem says, no, it's not, because it's not in a planar staircase configuration. This is definitely not planar. It's fundamentally 3D. And to go back, in reality, it is fundamentally 3D, but it turns out that with unit lengths, it's not fundamentally 3D, it's planar. Fundamentally 3D, it's planar. So now I'm going to show you the proof. And this proof is not what Nani came up with. In fact, I thought of it just preparing for this talk to try to simplify it and simplify it more. And that's why I'm not talking about odd number of links, but just even number of links. So look at two links together. Two links together. So they make a 90-degree angle. So there's one, one, and root two between these two. And if you could align all the root twos, you would achieve the absolute maximum that ever could happen because you can't stretch the root two from two of these. And the most you could ever do is align, in this case, 10 root twos. But I didn't align. But I didn't align them. I mean, I aligned them, but I lost the 90 degrees at the joints. So to go back here, this is a valid unit 90 degree chain, but it's not planar. This is not a valid 90 degree chain because it's not 90 degrees at every angle. It's not so easy to see that because of the perspective, but I think you can see, for example, this is not. But I think you can see, for example, this is not 90. I just made random spins here. But the point is that if you could ever get square root of n over 2, square root of 2 times n over 2, then you have achieved the max span because it can't be any longer than that. And now it's almost finished because take the first two links. Take the first two links, and here's the root two. And now imagine spinning the next two links at all the possible revolutes, making 90 degrees at the shared vertex V. And it's pretty easy to see that they only align along a line in one position, as illustrated. And so then you just repeat this over and over again, and you end up with a planar staircase. End up with a planar staircase configuration. So you get them again, this is the theorem: the unique max span configuration of a unit 90-degree chain is achieved by the planar staircase configuration. Okay, so does anybody have a question so far? Because I'm now going to return to the pop-up card. Well, first, I have something more to say. Just interrupt me if you need it. If you need it, so there's a stronger theorem here. Well, first of all, it works for both even and odd number of links, but it also works for any angle. In other words, the theorem is that if you have unit alpha chains for alpha being any angle up to 180, it could be quite small. The max span is achieved in the planar staircase configuration where you it's obvious. It's obvious what staircase means. So, this is a much stronger theorem and more difficult to prove. And I definitely haven't proven it for you. But still, this is nice because it shows that the key here is unit. Having the same length forces the staircase configuration to be the max span. And it's not the angle that matters. Matters, which is fixed for all these, it's the unit length. And if you go back to that figure that I had that was fundamentally 3D, then you can recognize that even though that was fixed 90 degree, it was not unit, and so it becomes quite more complicated. But anyhow, I only need the 90-degree result. So now I want to go back to here. Want to go back to here, and incidentally, I have to say that this application I'm showing you was discovered well after my student graduated. So this was not part of her thesis, which was focused on protein folding. But I showed you this picture before. And this is a 90-degree unit chain. You have this mountain fold, valley fold, mountain, etc. And it's planar when it's completely open. So you're seeing it in the completely open configuration. It also happens to have an even number of links because it meets in the center and it's mirrored over the two of them. So that that theorem I mentioned holds here that the maximum distance that you can get the left endpoint of this chain from the right endpoint of From the right endpoint of the chain is achieved when it's in the planar staircase configuration, which is what it looks like when it's completely open. So now let's call A and B the endpoints of that chain in the center of the card and C the middle. Then what you have is these mountain valley, mountain valley, but let's Mountain Valley, but let's see. I think I'll stop sharing and show this again. What you really need is to have this transparent so you can see, but it's all the chain is all squished down. Let's see. Maybe, well, I have, let me try this. Whoops, now I got messed up. Okay, I'll just go back to here. It's not completely evident from what I just showed you, but the whole chain gets curled up into this spiral. Spiral. And then when you open the card, you're pulling A from B. And you stretch it out so much that it must achieve the max span configuration, and so it must become planar. And so it must untwist. Let me try to illustrate that with Connex. So many of you. So, many of you know Kinects, they're very good for working with 90-degree chains because you can just put them together like this. So, at the center of the card, it's all folded up like this. And let's see if I can do this. And it's like I have A and B in my hands, and you open the card, and oops. Oops, it just broke. That can also happen with a card. Well, if you pull it, it forms itself into the planar staircase configuration in order to get as far apart as it can. So much for that demonstration. Okay, so now in some sense, that's my explanation for what's going on here. You have a 90-degree unit chain with A and B, in fact, just like a millimeter apart, and then you stretch them as far as you can. Them as far as you can, and this whole chain is forced to turn it to unravel itself into the planar staircase configuration, which is what it looks like when it's finished. Now, here is the absolute minimal pop-up spinner you could have. It's not very exciting. It just has these four links, but I'll show you. Um, but I'll show you what it does. This little animation I made when the card is closed, A and B are on top of each other. And this point, C prime, let me go back here, becomes between A and B. And then as you open the card, C prime starts to. C prime starts to swing and comes back to here. So it swings through 180 degrees as the card opens from 0 to 180. And I have an animation of this. Let me try to run that. Where's my animation? Oh, here it is. Well, this is the second slide I showed you, but it's worth looking at again. Maybe you can now see the chain all scrunched up and untwirling itself. But here's what I wanted to show you. Let's see, rerun this. So there's that point C prime. Let me do it again. Now, of course, this is a long way from. Now, of course, this is a long way from explaining from explaining the full effect. But this is just repeated with every two-link chain inside there where it spins with the card opening pulling A from. Opening pulling A from B, the whole thing must unravel, and that's the mechanism that drives this card. And some of you know Diana Davis, and she has made spinners based on these principles, but much easier. And here she's going, isn't this cool? And if you want to make a spinner, you might want to. Make a spinner, you might want to follow Diana's ideas first and only later try the one that I showed you. So, with that, I am going to stop, and I'd be happy to answer any questions. Thank you. Is there any question for Susan? Any comments? Awesome. Very interesting. The fact that this is actually seen in nature in some ways even more interesting. Yeah. What what's exactly the problem that you're looking for for the I mean the portrait? Portrait parts. So, what is the we were just looking at one very special question, which is given a fixed angle chain, how to compute the maximum span? And as I showed you, if the links are not the same length, it's not an easy question. It's a very difficult question, surprisingly rich. And it's only when the links are the same length that it turns out to be pretty easy. But when they're different lengths, it's very complicated. And linkages in general are very hard to understand. This is just a single chain, so it's much easier than most work on linkages. Is there any sort of when you say it's very hard? Is there any sort of complexity hard statement there? Let's see. I think it can be computed in either linear or quadratic time. So it's not that complicated. It's mathematically complicated. And Ilian Estrenu and Cyprian Borso eventually found a very nice representation that solves the whole thing. Um, but so I think one of the complications is that there, in general, there can be an exponential number of configurations that achieve the max span. So, you don't want to just list them out. You want to somehow zero in on what's really going on and exploit the geometry. I had a question, and I cut out a for a bit, so forgive me. Out for a bit, so forgive me if I missed this, but you mentioned how you were studying the protein folding before you connected it later to the Mac spinner. I was curious if you could say a little bit more about the story there. So how did you first hear about the Mac spinner or was it sort of an immediate connection for you or did it take time to? Well, that's an interesting question. Ruhei Yuhariya in Japan, who translated my book, Unfolding and Unfolding, showed me this pop-up synergy. Showed me this pop-up spinner, which incidentally, I should say that we don't know who invented it. It's some art student in a Japanese college invented it, and we have not, I've not been able to find out who did it because it's very clever and I'd like to give them credit. But yeah, then my student went off to work on her PhD and she was still working on this question. And so we were constantly in. We were constantly in communication, and then it just hit me. And so I started to apply it. Yeah. Thank you. Are there other questions? So the paper construction is just for 190 degrees. Do we have any other constructions? That's a good question. That's a good question. Yeah, because the theorem holds for any angle. Yes. So you could squish together. Yeah, I've never thought of that. That's a very interesting question. Yeah, there might be a, it may even spin faster if you, of course, it. Of course, it would be harder to make to construct. But that's a very clever question. I haven't thought about it. Do we have more questions, comments for the fabulous work that Joseph is doing? So, Jancoida, you have a question? Ricardo? Yes, I was wondering: do proteins have unit length junctions or connections, or are they different sizes, or is there a case? They are different sizes, or is there a case where they are unit? So the amino acid chain that I was looking at has almost unit lengths. They're almost all the same. However, that's not true for proteins in general. So there's a subclass of proteins where they're almost all the same length in the links. But this is molecular biology, which is well beyond my understanding. Well, beyond my understanding. So I just look things up and say, okay, then I can approximate this. Thank you, thank you. More questions? Joseph, this is the only place that we know that there is a connection with with your work, or maybe there are other other applications, you know, in physics, anything? You're not in physics, anything? Yeah, so I've worked on protein folding more directly. This became like a toy problem to work with an undergraduate, which turned out to be not such a toy problem, but I've also worked on protein quality with people who really understand proteins. Yeah, it doesn't seem, it seems that it might have some applications in. Seems that it might have some applications in physics. I don't know where exactly, but probably it can seem some applications in physics, you know. Well, the applications are really in biochemistry, and there's a huge amount of work on using even quantum computers to pull. They want to understand the shape of a protein affects what it can do. Affects what it can do. So the actual geometric shape because proteins interact with each other almost like a key going into a lock and turning it. And so the three-dimensional shape is quite important. And so, but what I was looking at is: what is you, if you stretch it out, what's it look like? In situ, it doesn't look like that. Very interesting. Very interesting. Very interesting. Okay. There is no more question. You can just close the pan for the next session. Is it the case that?
