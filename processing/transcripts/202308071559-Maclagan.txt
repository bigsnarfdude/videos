First this is I'm going to shoehorn some curves in near the end, but it's going to be well and that will depend a little on time, it'd be possibly more artificial than I hoped it would have been when I submitted the abstract. Let's just say I was overly optimistic that what would happen with the first month. And the other thing is Jetlag was kind of peaking about an hour ago, so if I start to fall asleep, I'm gonna get red so make you all do jump jumping jacks to wake me up. Jumping jacks to wake me up. But yeah. The other disclaimer is: this is a bit more, I guess in an effort to push technicalities under the rug, it's a bit more hand-wavy than I would prefer. So feel free to complain if it becomes too hand-wavy. If I'm pushing too that answers up a little bit. Okay, well, let's start. Here's the motivating question, which is. Which is what is a vector bubble of a tropical bright. Okay, so probably in this room we don't need to be convinced that tropical varieties are important, and we also, most of us are algebraic geometers, so we also don't need to be convinced that. So, we also don't need to be convinced that vector bundles are important, and we're 20 years into tropical geometry, we ought to have a motion. So, that's maybe the self-aware why we should care about this question. So, in some sense, the point of the talk is to sell you a definition that Phoebus Kahn, who was my postdoc at Warwick, and I are trying to sell at the moment. But it's sort of a work in progress and we welcome suggestions or nudges in Palestine. Suggestions or nuggets and colours should be changed. Before I do that, though, I should start by saying what do I mean by tropical since we're just the Monday. Well, we know that if I start with a variety, there's two things I could do. I could draw through a picture like this, or I could draw some sort of skeleton. I started with an elliptic curve, so I don't need to draw a chain of loops, but a loop like we saw in the last talk. Okay, and so I am going to. Okay, and so I am going to, for me, for this talk, we are talking about this feature. So, we're talking about embedded tropicalization. So, the philosophy is going to be we want to choose, if you have why you care about, you're going to choose an embedding into a Tauric variety so that the Tauric variety knows about you. Whatever that leads. So that normally leads, so for whatever question you care about, we can think about that. If you care more about this world, then you need to look at the work of, I think, since this is Grooves' conference, I think the philosophy is, I should describe this, as Gross, S. Martin, and Dimitri, who was the second two authors of this paper. The second two authors of this paper are Theory Online, though hopefully on a sleeping nuts, and so this is topical, this is thinking about vector bundles on vector graphs. And so I'll try and maybe say a little bit, though not a deeper, yet at the moment about the collection between these two books. Okay, so that's the setup. We're going to be thinking about tropicalizing in the event it sets. I have a sub-variety of a torus and a torture. Have a sub-variety, a rotorist, a torque, or rhetoric variety, and I want to put something on there. So, the first answer, here's the sort of naive answer, is a vector bundle on a tropical variety X is a space with With a map to X with fibers vector spaces or a particular vector space. I don't really like that answer though. I want to cross out vector space and write tropical linear space. So, for the people who are furthest from tropical geometry, I think one take-home message for this talk should be: somehow, from a tropical point of view, if you have something like a line, a plane, maybe you want to re-embed it into a bigger projective space and tropicalize there, and that makes you a tropical body space. So, somehow, that's going to be the philosophy. That's sort of something that we've known for a long time in tropical geometry, and it's going to be somehow hiding behind the. Hiding behind what's going on here. Okay, so that's a sort of a first answer, but I want a bit more. I want an answer that fits with tropical scheme theory, and I'll say a bit more about what I mean by that later. But I should be able to say some sort of locally fish. Okay, so an answer like this doesn't know anything about locally free shield. And the second thing I want is I want an intrinsic answer. So particular not just for chromatizations. So two examples to illustrate what I'd be. Two examples to illustrate what I mean by this. If you love matroids like I do, then you should think about this: the concept that sometimes it's good to think about the matroid rather than the linear space, sorry, rather than just the actual realizable linear space of how abstracting things to matroids tells us more about realizable cases. Or if we think about the previous talk, many people, people in this room, have spent hundreds, possibly thousands of hours thinking about chip. Thousands of hours thinking about chip firing on graphs because it sheds light on the original problem. So, somehow, these abstractions to these combinatorial models often will shed more light on what's going on in general. So, that's why I want something that's not just a statement of here's how we tropicalize, but here's something that I can call a tropical object and look, tropicalizations are examples. Okay, so that's what we want. So, let me start to tell you how we're going with that. So I think I should pause and get any questions, comments. Do I know what a tropical variety is at this point in the talk? No, because yeah, I'll give a I'll be I'll be more explicit in both. I guess you're going to tell us how the tropical linear space should vary as we move on. Okay, yeah, no, so far this is all sort of yeah, I promised hand waving, so far it's all hand waving, but I will go and I'm Power it's all hey waiting, but I will go. I will go down the wall. Okay, so the first example I want to think about is have my spaces be particularly concrete and easy from a tropical point of view, and that's the tropical toric varieties to start. So I'm going to start, and this will actually be most of the talk. So vector modules on tropical toric varieties. Okay, so just notation for me that my tropical semi-ring will be R bar, so that means R unit infinity with tropical addition minimum and tropical multiplication times. I think the specific details. I think the specific details are probably a little bit better. But I want you to remember that if we talk about an affine toric variety, so an affine toric variety, u sigma is going to be spec of k-android sigma dual intersect M. Okay, so here sigma is a rational polyhedral code. Polyhedral code. The dual is my dual code. They take the semi-group algebra. Semi-group ring takes back of that. And the k points, that means are going to be home. Well first we say as k algebras from my sigma dual intersect M to K. And I could rewrite that as home of semi-groups from sigma v intersect M. sigma v intersect n to k with its multiple, with the first one. Okay, so if I have a here, if I have a square bracket, listening, if I have a k algebra homomorphism from here to k, that's the same as just giving a semi-group homomorphism from sigma dual dissect n to k times. You should think about this as if you want a k-algebra homomorphism, the easy case from the regular polynomial ring, I just have The regular polynomial ring, I just have to tell you very much. Okay, so Kajibara and Sam tell us that their trop U sigma should be home and again as semi-groups of sigma dual intersect M into now R bar with null as a semi-group. As a second group, so this is now R unit infinity with tropical multiplication with which is addition. Okay, so I've just tropicalized in the sense I'll have turned the field into. Okay, so for example, if I have A2, so sigma is the positive authored, then drop u sigma, or that's r bar squared. R squared, if you give it as k squared, and as a picture, I would draw it like this. It's probably R2 with two lines of infinity of the point of the infinity. And then we can glue this all together as initial trope varieties. So we get a UA tropical trope variety. Okay, so my first answer now for what, well, first definition. It is going to be, so this is sort of without telling you the definition yet, what I mean by the skeep theoretic sense. I want to give you a sheep sense, so I would give you an algebraic definition. So a first definition, so a tropical vector button on trop x sigma Should be given our u sigma. Well, if we assumed that it's trivial already there, phi r b r, all right, I should have said that here. So the coordinate ring. So my coordinate ring normally is my semi-group algebra. So I just formally So I just formally take sigma v into sigma n. So this just means you know what the monobials are, make the coefficients be elements of the tropical semi-ring and add and multiply that one. So it should be sigma v intersect n to the n. So it should be locally trivial. This is some sort of notion of being locally trivial under the assumption that it's trivial already. Under the assumption that it's trivial already on my torrent charts. Okay. Seems reasonable. There is a problem. And that was observed by Jaiang Jung, Kalina Machaba, and Jeff Tolleford, which is under this definition essentially all vector bundles are direct subset like bundles. Are direct subs of light bubbles. So all such bundles are direct sums of bundles. So maybe if you've worked with a slightly more general setting, you have some severe in schemes in a sort of F-1ish world, but when you specialise it, which is, these are just mild generalities of thinking about tropical. Of thinking about tropical foreign varieties. And when you specialize into the setting, it becomes you, well, this is the fact and then this theory. So that's a bit of a problem, right? So, question. What is Xigma theory? So you've been here or this will be a Tauric variety. And so I think I said it, but I didn't write that my affluent Tauric variety is congluted. My affiotoric varieties can glue together to form an arbitratoric variety. So I'll write X capital signal that I need an actual torrent variety glued together and U signal that I've needed LIBON. Other questions? Yeah, so sorry, I don't understand quite this definition because, I mean, are they given by this power of reporting ring on the nose, or are you saying they're like. On the nose, or are you saying they're like isomorphic? Well, so for these guys, they'd say isomorphic to people. Yeah. Okay. I mean, but also, I'm not sure. You'd have to tell me what the difference between those sentences was. Well, like, what are the transitions that are allowed out of the web? That's a mixed sentence, right? Exactly. So, the transitions in this case, they want to think about a tropical book GLM. And so, this is essentially the problem. And so this is essentially the problem here. One version of a tropical GLM is essentially you tropicalize automorphisms of the torus. And so you get just the... I forgot to practice this, but I always write semi-direct products in the wrong direction. You do the permutation matrices with entries. So you get the semi-rig of permutation matrices where the entries don't have to be once. Which is whatever semi-direct problem. Which is whatever semi-direct product, I just need to block right away, but the awareness. So that is the tropicalization of the automorphisms of the torus. And yes, this is part of GLN, but it's somehow not enough. And so this is a problem that arises here. This is essentially, I think, where their problem comes from. Why they get this fact. What they're really discovering is that the only bundles are exactly. Those are attacking the stress of the platform. Why do the Taurus equivariant bundles from this Clearco data not show up here? Wait. Wait, maybe five bundles. That is essentially going to be the answer. Maybe a stupid question, though. Why isn't the problem the bundles directed to five lines? Well, Corax and Bumford would. Well Torix and Bumford would be very sad. So even on the first even I mean the fi the even on P2, right? The second most trivial Torik variety, we have in decomposable vector bug doors. Yeah. Yeah exactly. So there's lots of vector bug doors on Tauric varieties. And yeah, I guess it's something almost every Tauric variety most vector bug doors. Both factor by Dolphin will be both org. So this is somehow telling us, yeah, my rule for tropical geometry is if you get an answer like this, which tells you that where the answer diverges from anti-break geometry, this tells you the definition was wrong. You have to change the definition. Okay, so to keep group happy, we will say the second answer, and this is going to be the actual And this is going to be the actual one. You had to wait four lines, apparently, or by next. Maybe not. To be fair, I didn't know that going in. I thought it could have been five lines. Okay, so the second definition. Okay, so loosely, I want to replace R adjoint signal B intersect M to be M by the coordinate rings of a tropical mini space. Okay, so just for the experts, I'll just put I'll put things that are you're not meant to understand unless you already know the answers. Understand unless you've already known the answers. I mean something like this. Ignore that if it doesn't mean anything to you matters. And to actually get to the answer to Group's question, something, so this is tropicalizing torrent vectors. So, I should tell you what this means. Now, I've spent the last five plus years learning that you don't give the definition of a metroid in a talk. And I feel I'm about to go into a phase of my career now, the same way that Renzo talked about different phases of the mood, where I don't give the definition of a toric vector buggy in the talk. Because I've learned that this is not something that often communicates. So, let me give, I'm going to attempt a way of talking about it. Way of talking about it, and the experts can claim to be afterwards or could be bus. So, a toric or equivariant vector bundle f on x sigma. So, this is now for a moment not tropical. I've just used an orbital variety. So, I should have f to x sigma. F to x sigma where t acts will be on fibers. So I've got an action on the total space that's equivariant with respect to the projection and linear of the fibers. Okay, so as Rhouth alluded to, Kriaszko gave a coveratorial classification. Which is great, but can it is a little like but if you've never seen it before, it's a bit like seeing the axioms for a matrix for the first time. And so now I'm going to attempt to give you another definition and we'll see whether this works on. Okay, so again, we'll start with the hand maybe a bit loosely, but I'm going to, this is inspired by. This is inspired by work of Dorocco Diamosh and Greg, but Greg is pleased to disallow this presentation. So F has an equivariant presentation. So I'm thinking So I've got some sort of presentation of my vector bundle and it's equivariant, so these are all torus equivariant bundles. And what I'm going to get out of this is that there is going to be, exists an L coming from here, contained, so this is I equals 1 to S. This contained K to the S, so the K to the S. Dictated K to the S, so the K to the S is coming from here, and an action of T of my torus on K to the S so that the fiber over the identity of the torus is K to the S mod L and then the And then the fibre over other points of the torus, I'm just going to shift L around by my torus action. And then, if I want to go to the boundary of the toric variety, that's telling you what fibers look like on the torus. And somehow going to the boundary, I'm just going to take limits. So what's hidden in this, this is not a definition, it's more a conceptual idea of what's going on. What's hidden in this is that things are going to behave nicely on the lunch. So I'm trying to ship my Try to ship. Okay, just make sure K is a field and L is a linear subspace in the sector space. So where is this coming from? We're meant to be taking, you know, take appropriate stalks and quotient by P back some ideas to actually get my To actually get my fibers here. Okay, so what I get to do is K the S, the fibre over T is K to the S or T equals L and fibers over points in the boundary comfort points. So, the technical detail that's been pushed here is that when you take limits, this is going to make sense. So, what these conditions are. Okay, maybe to be a bit more explicit, because that's the version I'll generalize for, is that if f is going to be m tilde, the sheafification, and for the z to the For the Z to the number of rays of sigma graded module over S v the Cox ring of X sigma, which is just a polynomial ring in the number of rays. And if we're going to write And we're going to write M is the direct sum for J, S of D G mod sum presentation, which is the sum x L U I L I J E I j equals 1 quantity. So the point is going to be we have a z to the number of rays graded module over the Cox ring and this corresponds. Over the Cox ring, and this corresponds to an equivariant sheaf of mitoric variety. So, Cox gives us a correspondence between modules over the Cox ring and sheaves of mitoric variety. Gets the number of rays graded, it will be equivariant. And then if it has this structure, which I'm leaving out a few details, there will be a torque thing to add. An example to think about would be the tank. Would be the tangent bundle on P2. So N is, my Cott's ring is just the usual polynomial ring. I'm going to shift it by, well, I put it 1, but we could actually, we should really have a z cube rated here, which is implicit in what I wrote in here, plus y e2 plus z e 3. And this is really the Euler sequence that we were reminded of with earlier. So there's my O1 quotient in here. So this is going in the same way that we have your Euler sequence presentation here, eventually introducing this. Okay, so that's Tauric vector bundles. What you should remember is they're equivariant bundles on the Tauric variety, and they're given by sheaves on the On the sheaf is given by a module over the Cox ring that is equivariant, corresponds to Z to the Brayshaw. So somehow a very somehow a very monobial story here. And these Lijs are going to be these, I should say that these Liji, this is the Lj is in the L that was over here that we were optioned by. Google actually. Okay. Right. So the point is going to be that this tropicalizes. And this is where the difference is going to be. The thing I'm just erasing is that I want, is that this way we will see locally it will look like the quadrant of a top of the linear space instead of just locally actually. Doesn't look really actually a vector space. Okay, so this drop of the lights is so cocks of a tropical trope variety. I just take the Cox ring, which was a polyverbial ring. Ring, which was a polynomial ring. When you tropicalize a polynomial ring, you just change the coefficients to tropical, the tropical semi-ring, all operations to tropical operations. So far, so good. Okay, so trop my f, so if this was my trop, my f was given by a module like this. So trop F is given by the direct sum. Okay, the direct sum. It'll be cots of my cots semi-ring now. It'll be graded by some shifts. It'll be z to the de graded. And then I will have something like this as a tropical sub really. Okay, so this is the this bit I'm going to be making that. To be making that just more for experts. This is the GNC Refuser bent congruence. So the idea is when you quotient, so here we all knew what I meant when I said I've got a free module and I'm going to quotient my submodule. Okay, so there was no question about that. Over here though, this is now a semi-ramble. So this is a semi-module. When you push Semi-module, when you quotient by semi-modules, we don't just quotient the semi-module by a, we don't know what we mean to say quotient by a sub-module. So what you do instead is that you quotient by a congruence. What's a congruence? I just have to tell you which two things to identify in the quotient. And Jeff and Noah, John Sircuser, about 10 years ago now, gave us what has turned out to be the right definition for this context. I won't go into the details. I won't go into the details now, but just to say it gives me a way to take a linear space like this, or a sub-module like this, and turn it into a complex. And what is this? I've got something I want to regard as a sub-module. So here I've got for each Lj, so this should now be a tropical object. So this is a vector. So Lj, so this is the Lij is the. The Lij is the, sorry, is a vector of a value-rated vector. And for people who know what value-rated vectors are already, it's the tropicalization of the linear space L that we had earlier. Or if you don't, it's think about evaluated matroid for the purpose of this talk as the evaluation of the row space of a matrix. So if I have a valued field, I give you a matrix, I just take the set of vectors, I just, for everything in the row space, I take its valuation. The issue with tropical things. Tropical things or valuations is that you know it's not exactly additive, so you have to do more than just take the valuations of rows. You just might get more interesting. So these are the vectors of a value-rated matroid. Valuated matroids are generalizations of matroids into direct present vectors which somehow turn out to be the right thing for the squad. Okay. So that's the what I mean in some sense by the tropicalization for me. By the tropicalization. So I've now sort of turned around to give a definition, more intrinsic definition, though still maybe at approximately this level I've had maybe. So maybe I should pause for a few questions before then. Can you say what are the transition functions? Now in the second definition? So here, right, so I'm giving it to you globally. Here, in some sense, the transition functions are still going to end up being the In the tropical GLN, but upstairs, so it's okay. So, what you could think: here's one way to think about what we're doing by this approach, which is we're embedding by, we're somehow looking at the vector bug dog and saying, well, okay, just tropical GLN, just my tropicalization of automorphism to the torus is not good enough. But I actually don't, for this finite factor bundle with these finite numbers. Finite factor by door with these finite number of charts. I don't need that much more. I need a finite number of ways more. And what you can do is embed so that these all come as restrictions from your biggest space. So when I wrote things as PS1L, they'll all come for things of the Taurus here, upstairs. So it's almost like it's something. So it's almost like somehow you have to choose, it's almost like you're knowing in advance which transition functions you're going to need, and you're re-embedding to make them all nice to acquire once again. Can I see that? So given that F, I can also do module Grovener theory for F as the sheet functor I think. Is the data of that component? Wait, for this one I'm happy with, because I have to be a bit more careful there. I mean, well, you present it as a I mean, well, you present it as a quotient of the free. So, so, but does the does does the so I get a verner-type complex out of that? Does the C that's not something that I have yeah, it's not something like I needed to know yet. For an equivariant vector bundle gives a vector bundle, how many vector bundles do you see in this way? Do you see most of them, or is that a variant? It's special. I don't know, I don't know, it's worth other so well, how would you answer that question? But it's pretty special, yeah. So like on on Pn, um any Turing vector bundle of rank less than n splits? Of rank less than x, but it's not. Yeah, right. Yeah. Maybe that's going to be the wrong question, the wrong answer for the other point. I was going to try and get more. Sorry. So, yeah, torque vector bundles are very special. But they're more than torque, but they are. But they are, I mean, the total spaces are not torte varieties, though. So they're more general than the torrent varieties. So then I'm excited. But then this Bango bundle and this, then you see immediately they are not totally correct. Right. But, okay, let me give you a definition here. Carbon, which bundles we're asking about? Tango bundles this exceptional bundle. This exceptional bundle, so yeah. Like one fruit? So you have all those. So in the motivation, we had like the vector bundle that wasn't just a direct sum of light models. Oh, but that was the first one was the tangent bundle. And that is right there. Yes, that's me. So maybe there are plenty of interesting tour effective bundles and standpoints. Tori factor my doors and sale points like the tangent mic doors is a toy factor. So just because they are special, they're still important. It's interesting parts. Okay, so I'm going to talk about, say, a tropical chloric cake bunch F on tropic sigma is given. Is given by a valuated Metroid M and a set of vectors dg m z to the number of rays for each such that g is in the ground set of the matroid. Of the matroid. So evaluated matroids have underlying matroids. Matroids are combinatorial gadgets on a set, which we call the ground set. So that's some finite set. And so for each element there, I'm going to give you a vector. And then we get m is just going to be again, essentially rewriting this, g in g of m. In cox of tropic sigma justed by dg, and then I take the beam congruence of the sigma theta. And here this is going to be, so Lj is a vector of my matroid. And this is a homogenization, which will be a z. Yeah, these should have been Z's. I guess it's probably Z. Okay. And there's an equivalent definition in terms of flats. So those of you who do know the Fashion definition would expect a definition in terms of equivalent of chains of subspaces. That turns into the subspaces turn into flats of the spatroid. And you get there's a definition in terms of flats, which chains of flats, but that's flat. The massive effects of the spectrum. These papers by Cave and Mannon, were they. This is really, yeah, it's very related. They don't quite say the same stuff, but yeah. Okay, you're mapping the skeleton into the building with GLM. I mean, my perspective is always that I like to think about if we're saying tropical rather than this is that we wish that so maybe that's the same, yeah, that's the same. So maybe that's the same yeah, that's about the same the same the answer I gave to whoever asked the question before or the other statement someone and about the transition functions. I mean that's yeah, I'm taking just enough of the buildings. Can I answer Martin? I have your question. This modernization is uniquely determined by the value of it's it's the uniquely determined by the decays. The DGs. So I left out that way. So the DG, DG is a vector in the realizable case. This is just what makes it I such that G isn't j such that isn't E I J. So that's just a statement for people who recognize the criteria. That that is the modulation sentence, yes. The organization factors, yes. Okay. So, I think I said the so what can we say about this? Thanks again, as Khan. So, first, this is what I said. We want, this is sort of the intrinsic definition, where I said if I want to tropicalize this definition, I have a definition that looks like it tropicalize. I have a definition that looks like it propathizes. I'm pulling out the details, and then I'm saying, actually, why don't I just start with the value of Matroid and this against the data? So, first of all, there are non-realizable activities exist. So, I can take ones that are not realizable and get things that are vagabond. There exists a definition Of H naught of my vector bundle with which agrees with H0 for the tropicalization as long as you're careful on that. So H naught with rightness truck. I've been trying to avoid using color graphic E because on the board they look like sigmas, but this is a color graphic E. E equals H dot of E. We can say F. We can say if the matroid the E is chosen well. So that's saying, by this we mean the definition is going to be purely combinatorial in terms of the data of the matrix and the steep. So we get out of that, we get a definition for H0, and this will agree with H0 of the factor. This will agree with the vector bundle if you've paralysed it. So, one reason I said I wanted an intrinsic definition is that sometimes that can illuminate the classical case. And one way that's happened for us here is we can say with extra modularity conditions. On the letters of flats of my matroid, we can say all vector bundles on top P1 split. So that one, unlike the previous result, this is something we do want, right? We do want vector buttons on P1 to split. But you have to be careful, right? If I just wrote this down, you can write down things that satisfy this definition on P1 that do not split. And so, what you need is some extra. So, modularity is a condition on lattices. And it roughly comes down to the idea that subspaces, you know, the definition of this the the definition this the dimension of the intersection plus the spa the sum of two subspaces equals the the the sum of the dimensions. The sum of the dimensions. And that's not true for ranks of the elements in the last effects of a microid in general. So that's one of the things that you realize that you really did need it. So this modularity condition is satisfied in the realizable case. It's not true for all matroids. It's somehow just pointing out a little bit of what we in some sense this is not so surprising because the proof I mean the usual proof of the vector bundles of three once but it's also essential uses it. Also, essential users' experience. But it makes it a bit more sharply combinatory. Okay, we have so tropical vector bundles. I'll just say have cher classes, by which I mean we have a definition. This is slightly cheating because we're really lifting off the torrent vector button story so we can just make those definitions the same. However, However, one reason we care about it is there is a notion of stability. And so this is and then and then and then and we'll say with more modularity candidates. Boom, we get hardened our semen and join the unifiers. Okay, so we get a notion that we can say what we need for a vector bundle to be stable in this world, and you get the sort of filtrations you want, but again, you have to impose some more conditions on your lanes and plants. Okay, so that's my statement about Torrec vector but doors and the version here. So it's another moment to pause for questions. So would you say that Reich definition is vector modularity or without? Sorry, is with the right definition of a vector bundle includes impolarity conditions or just not? So there's actually, it turns out there's two different modularity conditions, and probably, well, possibly it does, it should, it probably should have this one. It's a bit, it's a bit, it's a bit weird. It's one of these, you know, it's a statement that says the rank of the meat of this plus the join of this plus the meat of this equals the plus, you know, it's some long lattice curving statement, and I think that one is probably correct. This one. This one, the one we need at the moment, so this one I'm happy with because what you know is true of the ballot. The conditions we have at the moment for the existence of hardened RSM filtrations, it's a definition that is true, it suffices to prove them, but it's actually stronger than the realizable one. So it's somehow, we know that there is some weaker thing that suffices, but I can't tell you what it is. So the right definition. So the right definition is not what we put here. That's somehow an adjective. I want to put a front of the vector through this sense to make it work. So would you like the definition to be exactly being the sizable ones? No, I think that's always the lookout, so this world. The Torik varieties, I think, even then, because I mean, it's your okay, here's a very interesting Toric variety by my point. So it's a Our point. So, for the point, what should have active bundle for each of the matroid or evaluated matroid? And we know that we should care, that we somehow know, whatever no means, that we should accept what matrix. So, definitely we don't we can't hope to have a definition well, we we can't hope to have a usable definition that only talks about realizable things. I think that's the distinction to make. I think that's the distinction to make. One of the other points, which I so the reason to have, there's two reasons to have an intrinsic definition of it. One, it can illuminate what's happening in general, and then the second thing is it gives you a theory that has a hope of being usable. Because this is your matroids have a fairly small axiom set. If you wanted to try and say what are the things you can get from tropicizing linear spaces, that would be sort of impossible in a certain sense. But I think the same thing generalizes together. But I think the same thing relies to here. If you keep that modularity condition, is there still. So if you include a bit in the definition, does the Dressian still have a universal bundle? Like if I took the toroid variety, if I took sigma to be the Dressian, and I take the toroid variety if you take the toroid variety Do I get a universal bundle from? Do I get a universal bundle? I that I do not get no. I would be very natural. Well, no. I think I have to think, but maybe that might have a... I think if I could give you an answer to that, I could answer what I'm going to tell you about the last 10 minutes as well. So I think the answer is I don't know, but I would hope so. Sorry, my point was just that it seems, I would worry that there's something. It seems I would worry that there's some tension between the splitting for P1. The universal one surely shouldn't have a much larger. Yeah, anyway. So this construction, how necessary is that your proposalization is true? Hold that for a moment. I'm going to write back in. We'll come back in a second. Yeah, that's cool. I'm going to answer your question hopefully for the next two minutes before we find otherwise. Faithful your drop-lisation of very nice faithful meaning. If they become isomorphic, were they isomorphic? Or do we not know isomorphic? I don't think I can tell you isomorphic. Okay, yeah. And I guess I should also say all of this is really tropicalizing presentations. It was really important. There was a choice here of a Was a choice here of a tropical idea space, it's a choice of presentation. It's a choice of a mate troid for the Troi factor monthly. And so, yeah, so yeah, the data are somehow rigidified by a presentation of the Troi Factor Month. Okay, so the question, I'm going to rephrase Rezo's question, is what about vector bundles on other tropical varieties? Probably most of you do not love tropic varieties. Most of you do not love Tauric varieties as much as I do, so maybe you have, maybe, for example, you care about curves or something like that. Okay, apart from these two, maybe okay, so the question is, what about vector models on more general tropical practice? Okay, so my answer is going to be to restrict from tropical toric vector points. So the idea is going to be if I have you, if y embeds into a toric variety and f is a toric vector bundle on x sigma, then f. Sigma, then F restricted to Y is a vector bundle on Y. So that's a non-tropical statement. And in some sense, these are going to be the types of vector bundles that people like to tropicalize. So we're going to just turn that into a definition first. And then I'll give, I think I'll just have time to give you one example to vitue it's not quite as content-free as you might be worrying at first. As you might be worrying at first. Okay, so I guess the first comment is to say all line models come in this way. Okay, so let's think about that. Well, let me tell you, if I have an ab, a very ab hole-line bundle, you embed it into projective, you use that to embed wire to projective space and then Space and then your line bundle isn't restricted to y of the height. Okay, so we're happy with this for line bundles. And the question is, well, and this is a question I don't know the answer to it, I'm welcome any help from the audience, is what is the class of vector bundles that come here where you get to choose X sigma, okay, in the same way that when you had your very ample Lie bundle, you chose your toric variety to be. Your toric variety to be the projectivization of the Linux series. You get to choose whatever crazy Tauric variety you like in order to try and make this work if it's possible. And it's understood that the boundary structure of Y needs to be pulled back from the third variety. What boundary structure of Y? Y is just your variety of whatever it is. Oh, but if you're going to tropicalize it, why is it? Right, right. Well, so the Y, that's going to give you, yeah, exactly. Yeah, your tropicalizing will be here. Exactly. So that's going to be my class. If you compare this to the gross market deletion version, they tropicalize vector bundles that are push-forwards of line bundles under some highlight cover. So, which is awesome. I think we also don't know what happening class that is. So, I think that's what it means. Somehow, understand at the moment we have these two copy constructions and understanding what they cover, I think. So you just write down what I'm just going to say, okay? So a tropical vector bundle, well, first of all, a tropical sub-scheme of a subscheme Y Of tropical Toric variety is good enough by an ideal I obtained a Cox ring, a Cox, tropical Cox ring, a Cox semi-ring that is local, that is. That is local, that is, well, hiding some technical details, almost matroidal, by which I mean the set of f s with f and i is the vectors of value weighted vector 2. So, this is a condition you could place on ideals in a polynomial semi-rig. Sometimes it is satisfied for all tropicalizations of ideals, but not for all ideals of the semi-rig. And these are ones, this is part of my program with Felipe Ricard to develop a scheme theory. These are the ones that we can prove behave more like the tropicalizations of things. Okay, so then a tropical toric variety. Okay, so then a tropical toric variety, so a tropical vector by variety of y is given by the restriction of a tropical to our vector bundle on x on the top x. On the tropics. So we write that as the tropicalization of F restricted to Y is trop F restricted to trop Y. So I'm imagining you've given me this data, or we now know how to tropicalize toric vector bundles, and I just restrict that. Doors, and I just restrict that to my subscription. Okay, so the natural question, to which I don't have an answer, I thought I was much more optimistic about the abstract, that I knew what to do for curves, than unfortunately I am today, which is why I thought this was an okay thing to talk about. What a curves got. There was P1. There has been P1, that's right. The most important curve. We all agree. It's really good. Well, actually, what's sad is the example I'm about to give you is P1. So you have to suspend disbelief. The only reason I'm doing this, though, is otherwise the algorithm gets too nasty. So you have to suspend disbelief that, of course, I'm about to tell you a vector bundle on P1, so it's nice. And pretend that secretly the P1 is a more complicated thing. I'm going to give you a P1 example, but you have to pretend it's more complicated than P1. Okay. So. Okay. So the questions were like which vector bundles arise this way. So the hope is, and this is where I'm putting more question marks that I put when I was writing my abstract. It we can reinvent. We can reinvent, and let me write it now: y is c for a curve into a larger toric variety to make things equate. So, I'm going to give you an example where this is possible. Of course, as I said, if you Possible. Of course, as I said, if you suspend disbelief because you better know it, it wasn't to start with. But suppose C was P1. And suppose I'm going to give you a sheaf of P1 by giving you a module. So my module is going to be C doing xy cubed mod x minus y times E1 plus X plus Y times E2 plus Y E3. Plus y e is it not known that that every vector bundle on a curve is a pullback of a torque vector bundle under Lymbetti? I stick a minute. Where is it? This would be true just because I can take my vector bundle, answer it with something highly animal, then I give the amount to the gross model. The gross model is to our amount. Oh, the gross modian is an out target. But again, if you can show it through the gross model. Yeah, if you can show it. Yeah, if you can show it for the show for the universal bundle. If you can show that the universal bundle on the Graphs Manian is the pullback of a toric vector bundle under some embedding vendor domain. So this is not... So that would prove it for all curves. Yes, that would be a problem. That would prove it for all codes. For curves, I think. I don't know. Sorry. Maybe I'll re-ars this for the problem session. I I tell the world that I can do a problem. Okay, let me have one minute to show you what would I do in the in this case. Yes, what I could do here is, well, this doesn't look with the form I wanted because these are not monomials. And so what am I going to do is I'm just going to make them monovials. So I'm going to re-embed So I'm going to reinvent C into P4 now. Also, P3, of course. XY maps to XY X plus Y, X minus Y, X plus Y. So now I write M as senior join X Y Z E U V. E u v mod just the equations that I just u minus x plus y v minus x minus y z cubed mod u e 1 plus v e 2 plus y e3. And now you look at this and you say, well, that's the restriction on the vector bundle on a sheaf of E3. So this is. So this is so n tilde is p tilde restricted to c for p being just correct x y u v cubed mod u e 1 plus v e 2 plus y e 3. This is not a vector bundle because when u v and u v and y And uv and y or zero if I were jumped, but it is a vector bundle apart from that. So this is a who defines a vector bundle on P3 takeable output. And now this is the, and now we have my original mod vector bundle that wasn't equivariably presented as the restriction of a toric vector bundle on my thread in this case. And so the question is. In this case. And so the question is: to what extent can we always do this? I think with the presentation, one thing that made this work was the presentation only had one thing. So when the presentation, when this is a one-dimensional kernel, I think we're okay, and we know we're okay for nine bundles. What more we could do? I don't know. But that's, I think, maybe that's a good point to stop. Thanks a lot. Are there any questions? What if your variety is a more a green space and you take now you have like some divisors right and this is giving you maybe some partial presentation of the cloud string and this gives you an embedding into a word for writing. Will that always work for you? So the sort of proper what the vector do you want to say does the vector bundle? Does the vector bundle? So, that gives you an embedding of your curve or perhaps higher-dimensional thing, I mean, because that would be boring, it's only P1, but perhaps your higher-dimensional thing into a direct variety. And will this, could you use this embedding perhaps for Maury Dream spaces to get the vector model you're looking for as a pullback? No, because the Maury Dream Space embedding of P2 into itself is P2. But I've taken a silly presentation of the Cox ring. Well, what do you mean by that? If I take the Voyager space, I mean, but I think generally if you say more dream space again for a torque variety, if your void dream space is a torque variety, that will be the, and we know that we need to be a big torque variety. So, what I'm saying here is, for instance, for P1, for the Cox ring, I could take the presentation like C, X, Y, Z, marginal. Yz module summarization. Yeah. Right? And that's what's then giving me an embedding into something bigger. Yes. Yeah. I mean, that's sort of the idea. I mean, well, you can see that's sort of what I did here. I took this presentation into featured sense. But yeah, I mean, that's what we're, so the question is, given the vector bug door, what is the right way to do that operation? If if it's possible. Oh, that's really possible. Comments earlier in response to Sam's question about the building, amounts of building? I didn't understand at the time. I was wondering if you could expand a little. I won't be able to. So Sam was talking about this paper of Chris Fannon from the other day where they reinterpret the clash of the data as in terms of backs to a building. And roughly, I mean, the way I can tell you the way I think about this, which is maybe not quite I mean, the problem with all of this is The problem with all of this is, so when I think about it, you've got this finite number of charts for your vector bundle. On each one, we have the idea of a basis for my vector space, and we're going to change it. When I do a transition back, I'm saying that I'm taking this basis to my vector space to this basis to my vector space. And that's kind of choosing two apartment that's for a building. You take the apartment chosen by this basis to the apartment chosen by this basis. Chosen by this basis. So in my story, I'm kind of picking out a finite number of pathlets that are all Y-VAC bundle C's. And they're saying, well, let's not choose a finite thing ahead of time. Let's just think about the tropic vector bundle in terms of maps to the building. But the story is always, transition maps are choosing different bases for a vector space. What we don't like from the tropical point of view is that we've really chosen a basis, right? We think the basis actually, you know, the We think the basis actually, you know, the botomia is better. We're messing with that botomic, right? I'm going to send x to x minus y at some point. And so, what I need is a language to talk about both of these at the same time. In some sense, buildings provide more way to think about that. I don't know whether that's the second answer is Cabe Ben and Tig's Portugal City the last few years. But sorry, what about if your brain is answering? Could you take like the cotangent line bundles at the workpoints? Well, line bundles are fine. Line bundles are fine. I mean, a question that I have asked all of the conformal blocks people for many years is were there conformal blocks, but there's our restrictions for that torque variety. But I don't know enough to think about that question. So, I guess underlying some of this is this idea that maybe only locally trivial family of valuated matroids over a fan is a reasonable thing that we should think about. What does locally trivial mean? Well, a vector bump. In the sense that Diane gave it to me. So there's a space underlying a vector bundle on the tropicalization of x sigma. If I fix a target. And now if you imagine sub-varieties of that character, if you treat it as an ambient space, you can projectilize it, then formally one gets interesting tropicalizations inside this kind of twisted thing. Is it reasonable to think due to should one expect like balancing conditions or Expect like balancing conditions, or just like old school products. Well, you can talk about, I don't know whether this is your question or not, maybe you can think about the total space of this, and this will be, I mean, locally it will be the tropical movie space by the Matroid across. So maybe that's what you, was that what you were thinking? So in that case, yes, yes. It's locally this matroid, the tropical movie space of this matroid. Well, sorry, not the dual matroid. The way I've written it is in the dual matroid. Yeah, it's like a question too, but. Yeah, yeah, question too. But yeah. So somehow, that was my one take-home message of this talk, in some sense, was when you see vector bundles where we think fibers should be a vector space, really we should think in the tropical world, fibers should be a tropical linear space. It's locally a product. Where does the transition happen if I have one matroid appearing here and one matroid appearing there? No, no, no, sorry, I don't want it. I don't want to think so. I'm choosing it globally. I mean, there's a matroid global. It global. I mean, there's a matrix global, and I'm only getting, I guess I'm only changing matrons when I go to the boundary when maybe if this disappears and my metro changes. So I'm only changing on the boundary. And I think the picture is like a family of valuated metroids, not a different matrix for each. So as these change, that's going to change the valuated metroid. And is this? And is this really depending only on the data of the bundle, or is this depending on some additional choice of a presentation? It's a presentation. Yeah, this whole story is tropicalizing a presentation. Absolutely. Yeah, so you could have different choices, but you'll get different stories with different presentations. But the theatrical presentation is fully intrinsic. But you know, there's a gap in their paper. So the matroid measured. There's not a gap in Kleashka's. No, no, no, but when you say the data, but the choice of how you extend this to a matroid. So Kleashka is giving me a lattice of subspaces, but extending that to the platform atroid, there's there are choices.
