Well, you will find that there are really many different reasons for the collapse. Now, since I have to talk about myself, let me make a commercial. You can also find a friendly, a mathematical friendly summary of these collapses in the first chapter of my book published a few years ago. Okay, I believe that most of you probably have seen on the web. Have seen on the web the collapse of the Tacoma Neros Bridge. If not, I recommend that you digit with Google Tacoma Neros Bridge and you will immediately see that unbelievable pictures. And by the way, the Tacoma Neros Bridge is not too far away from Banff, so you should be a little bit afraid if you live in Banff. Okay, so, but this is not an isolated event. What you see here is now you say, oh, this is spectacular. You say, Oh, this is spectacular. No, this is more or less what we this has happened many times. And in particular, there was immediately after the Tacoma Nero's bridge, there was a report by Amman Theodore von Kármán, and he's the only mathematician in the group, and Woodruff, the two others are engineers, who attributed to the torsional oscillations the main cause of the collapse of the Tacoma's bridge. Of the collapse of the Tacoma Neros Bridge. There is just one copy in Europe of this report, of this federal report, which is in ETH in Zurich in the library. And I had the occasion to have it. And then, of course, I made copies. But there is just one official copy in Europe. If you do not find it, you can look at this book by Scott. He's Canadian, so it's a kind of local author. He's an engineer, and he reproduces a lot of information. And he reproduces a lot of information about what happens at those collapse. But as I said, these torsional oscillations appeared many other times before giving a collapse. And as you may see, there are dates which are prior to the Takomaneros Bridge. Three of these events are in the 19th century. And one is this Matukituki suspension bridge, which I like very much because it was in New Zealand and it collapsed. Zealand and it collapsed in 1977. It's a small footbridge, but the same phenomenon was displayed, namely torsional oscillations which lead to collapse. So from now on, torsional oscillations are our enemy. Okay, so some questions. This is the motivation, but now there's something that we want to understand. First of all, why do they appear? So why do torsional oscillation appear? So, why do torsional oscillations appear in a bridge? Do we really have to expect them? And more important, is it possible to prevent them? Because this is the question. Can we solve the problem? Of course, today I will mainly speak about the second question, but before doing this, we have to ask another question. How does the wind insert energy inside the bridge? Because the wind hits the bridge. Because the wind hits the bridge, and already Navier knows about this phenomenon, but the full explanation, maybe it's not yet known today, but became only, let's say, at the beginning of the 20th century, precisely after the Tacoma collapse. So not more than 100 years ago. Okay, well, this now is well known, well established. And what happens is the vortex shedding. So we have a fluid which So, we have a fluid which hits an obstacle. This is the standard example. You have a fluid, for instance, the wind or the water or whatever, which hits a perfectly symmetric obstacle, in this case a disk. And so imagine this is a cylinder, so it's a pendulum which can go up and down. And when the wind comes in one direction, although this is perfectly symmetric, it goes around. Perfectly symmetric. It goes around and it creates these vortices behind the obstacle. And these vortices are asymmetric, even if the body is symmetric. And their asymmetry starts the vertical movement. Okay? Of course, in a disk, you do not see any torsion. So let's see what happens if we look on a bridge. On the bridge, what happens, imagine this is the cross-section of the bridge. So the wind comes in this direction. So, the wind comes in this direction, it goes around the bridge, there are vortices in this direction, and this starts the vertical oscillations of the bridge. So these are perfectly understood, these vertical oscillations. However, in the bridge, you have a torsional degree of freedom, because this plate can change its direction and not remain horizontal. So, there is also an angle of torsion. An angle of torsion which appears. Of course, you do not see it in the case of a disk or a cylinder. Okay, in fact, there is almost a one-to-one correspondence between
