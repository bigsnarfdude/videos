That we need to add to get a conjecture in positive characters again. It's as follows. You can find a variety Y of dimension greater than or equal to the transcendence degree of the field K plus one. And the variety is also defined over Fp bar, the closure of FP, and you also have a dominant. And you also have a dominant rational map from x to y, such that tau composed with a power of phi has to be equal to power of the Frobenius composed with tau. So we believe that one of the following things must hold when you're dealing with a field of positive characters. And this also, I mean, the third condition means that you basically have a quotient. You basically have a quotient. So you have a commutative diagram in the third case. Okay, so that's the conjecture in positive characteristic. So how should I go to the next slide? Oh, it's not yet. So I should mention that I actually forgot to mention that in the To mention that in the conjecture, you can see that we're dealing with a field K that has a positive transcendence degree, and here's what: so if you don't have that extra information and you just have you're dealing with the field F P, then, and let's say the domorphism phi is the Frobenius acting on X, then the first condition does not hold automatically, and so actually. So, actually, not even the forbidden. So, for any endomorphism of a variety defined over Fp, the orbit will be automatically periodic. So, the first condition cannot hold. And because of that, I mean, you can't get any extra information about the endomorphism that you're dealing with. So, you can't really hope for a conjecture like this if you don't have the extra information about the transcendence degree of K. So. So, yeah, so again, in that case, every orbit is periodic, so you don't really get any extra information that whenever you don't have the first condition doesn't hold. Okay. So, and here's a theorem. So, we have been able to prove the conjecture in the case of algebraic tori. So, this is a theorem that I have. I have with my advisor, Dr. Grigor Shiokov. So, we believe that the conjecture holds in the case of algebraic torus. So, if you have an endomorphism of GMN and you're working on a field of positive characteristic K, then so the only difference between this and the first conjecture is that the variety actually you get a quotient and this the map, the dominant map tau. The dominant map tau you get is from GMN to a connected algebraic subgroup of GMN, Y. So you get a bit of extra information in the third condition. So in the actual conjecture, we have any variety, but in this case, we can actually prove that you must have a dominant regular map from GMN to a connected algebraic subgroup such that that equation holds. The that equation holds, and again, everything so you're you have a subgroup that's defined over sp bar, and therefore you have the Frobenius acting on it. And in that case, you will have an equation like that. Any questions so far? So, let me just, so I mean, I know that the third I know that the third condition doesn't really, I mean, you can get more when you're dealing with the case of Iser Prey Torah, you can simplify the third condition. So an endomorphism of a GMN is basically just a translation composed with a group endomorphism. And the group endomorphisms correspond to matrices, matrices with entries in Z. And so another way of putting So, another way of putting condition C is just saying that the group endomorphism of your endomorphism file should correspond to this map. So it maps x to x to the power of a, and a is a matrix with entries over integers. And you can just say that if you put this matrix A in Jordan normal form, there are at least, so if you At least, so if you let d be the transcendent degree of k over fp bar, there are at least d plus one Jordan blocks in the Jordan normal form corresponding to eigenvalues lambda one to lambda d plus one, such that the nth power of these eigenvalues is equal to some power of p. That's another way of putting condition c. So these are equivalent things in the case of GMA. And I believe this is actually a very nice way of putting condition C. And this gives, if, for example, condition C doesn't hold, then you have a lot of information about the matrix A and that helps a lot in your proofs. Okay. So now let's just work with some examples. Let's fix a K, a field K with transcendence degree equal to one. Degrees equal to one, and let's let t be a prime number greater than or equal to three. So let's say that you have an endomorphism. Oh, sorry. That should be an endomorphism of GM2. Sorry. That's the type of thing. So you have an endomorphism of GM2 and it sends x, y to x squared y to the power of 4. So in this case, as you can see, so the So, in this case, as you can see, so the matrix of this endomorphism is just two blocks. One of them corresponds to the eigenvalue two, the other one corresponds to the eigenvalue four. None of them is a power of three, oh, sorry, power of p. Therefore, we can't really hope that condition c holds. Also, you can see that there isn't really a vibration that's left invariant under this endomorphism. This endomorphism phi, therefore, we believe that. I mean, we have reason to believe that there is a Zara C dense orbit, and indeed, if you just take the point t, then the orbit is given by t to the power of 2 to the n and t to the power of 4 to the n. And you can see that the second coordinate is growing much faster than the first coordinate. And because of that, you will have a Zariski dense orbit. Okay, so in this case, as you can see, Okay, so in this case, as you can see, the first condition holds and the last two conditions do not hold. So the second example is you have an endomorphism given by the action x, y goes to x, y squared. Well, in this case, as you can see, if you take the projection to the first coordinate, then the map, the map phi is leaving that projection map invariant. Projection map invariant, and therefore, because of this, there is a non-constant vibration that's left invariant under phi. So, the second condition holds indices. And because of that, there's no hope for the first condition. There are no direct details orbit. And due to a similar argument as the first example with the Jordan blocks and diagonal, condition C also does not hold. Okay, and that brings us to the third example. Okay, and that brings us to the third example. So let's say that you have, oh, yeah, let's finish the M3, but I guess. Sorry. So you have x, the action x, y, z goes to x squared, y to the power of p and z to the power of p. So in this case, you can see that if you take the last two coordinates and you just project the last two coordinates, you get the action of the Frobenius. Okay. And therefore, the third. Therefore, the third condition holds at this case. And the first two conditions don't hold. So there is no Zaracedex orbit, and also there does not exist a non-constant rational map that's invariant under phi. And you might wonder whether these conditions are mutually exclusive. And the answer is there. And the answer is they're not. So, and this is an example that showed that. So, if you have the endomorphism that maps x, y, z to x, y to the power of p squared and z to the power of p squared, you can see. So, again, if you projected the first coordinate, then you will get a non-constant vibration that's variant under pi. But if you projected the last two coordinates, you can find, I mean, you will find the action of the second power of the permits. And therefore, conditions B and C will hold at the same time in this example. And but again, there are no observations orders. So I should say that the... So if I go back to the conjecture, so if any of the conditions B or C hold in this conjecture, then there's no hope for the first condition to hold because they automatically imply that there are no Z R C dance orders. For example, if you For example, if you take the orbit of a point phi and you apply f to it, then you will get just one single point. And because of that, you will see that the orbit cannot be Zariski density. And a similar argument also works for condition C. So conditions B and C will be mutually exclusive from, will be exclusive from each other, but they're not really exclusive from each other. So they will. From each other, so they will somehow sometimes they will happen at the same time, okay? So, and so that brings us to this second theorem, and this is really a generalization of the first one. So, we have the same setting as before, although in this case we have, so the variety that we're dealing with is a split semi-abelian variety defined over FP1. Believe in variety defined over fp1. And I mean, the case of GM is really just a special case of this theorem. So we believe that the conjecture holds in this case. And the only difference is that you will get a semi-abelian variety instead of just a variety in the condition, in the third condition. So everything stays the same and the conjecture will hold for all space. Uh, for all split semi-WEM variants defined over FPY. Yes, there was a question in the chat. Uh, and uh, the question was: can you combine B and C into one condition? Say by allowing R to equal zero. Yes, I believe that's true. Yeah. Good observation. What is R? Sorry? R is the power of the forbadius. Yeah, so in this case, yeah, that's true. So in this case, we're saying basically r is a positive power. So we want the forbiddenness actually there. But I guess, yeah, if you let r be zero, then yeah, there's a problem with the. There's a problem with the transcendent degree thing. I mean, in the first in V, you know, the variety has dimension one. Yeah, so there is this extra information about the maximum degree. I mean, in some cases, B and C will be the same. I guess if the no, actually, no. No, actually, no. Yeah, because of the transcendence degree, it will think it's not easy to complain. It'll, I mean, it cannot be possible, but it will be graphic identity because of the transcendence to everything. Yeah, so it will create complications. And this is crucial, like this condition that I mentioned is. Condition that dimension is bigger than or equal to the transcendence review plus spawn. That's really, I mean, that's a key part in the third condition. But yeah, it was a good question. Okay, so before I get to the to our strategy for the next one, we're going to be The to our strategy for proving the theorem in the case of split semi-abelian varieties, this one over F-bar. I just want to start with some definitions. So, the first one is a term we associate to a certain type of matrices, and we call them NFP. So, that stands for non-no-frobenius power. So, if you have maybe a simple semi-abelian variety, and you let So by simple, I mean it's either isomorphic to GM or it's isomorphic to a simple abelian variety. And it's defined over FP bar. Then by L sub C, we denote the tensor of the endomorphism ring of C with Q. Then for any matrix A with entries in L sub C, we let we call A. We let we call A an NFP matrix if the minimal polynomial of A over Z has no powers of the Frobenius. So, I mean, all of the roots are multiplicatively independent with respect to the Frobenius. I mean, you regard Frobenius as an element of L sub C. And I should mention, I mean, this is a weird way of putting it, and I understand it, but. It and I understand it, but uh, so you could ask why don't I say that, for example, eigenvalues are multiplicatively independent, so that's that's pretty much the same thing. But the reason why I'm saying it or putting it this way is that the ring and the homomorphism ring of C is not commutative necessarily. So, if you're dealing with Gm, then it will be because it's isomorphic to the set of integers, but in general, But in general, it's not, and it becomes really difficult to define eigenvalues of matrices over. And I mean, it's the ring L sub C is actually a division ring, so it's a skew field, but it's really hard to define eigenvalues for these matrices. That's why I'm just putting it this way. Yeah, so. Yeah, so that's the first one. These will come up later in the talk, these matrixes. And the second one is reduced semi-abelian varieties. And by that, we mean a split semi-abelian variety that's isomorphic to a direct product of simple semi-abelian varieties. So, as you know, any simple semi-abelian variety will be isogenous to something like that, but not necessarily isomorphic. So, this is a Not necessarily isomorphic, so this is a special kind of semi-abelian varieties, split semi-abelian varieties. And so one key result that we will use in our proofs is the Muslim-Scanlan F structure result that describes the intersection of a finite regenerated module with a variety. Before I get to that result, which will be To that result, which will be a key thing, I just want to introduce the idea of F sets. So let's say you have a field K, a positive characteristic, and you have a semi-abelian variety G defined over FQ. And you let F be the Frobenius acting on G, the Frobenius in the morphism of G. And that corresponds basically to the map that sent X to X to the power of Q. To the map that sends x to x to the power of q and let gamma, which is a subset of g of the k points of g, to be a finally generated sub module. Okay. Then we let, so that by a sum of f orbits, we mean a set of that form. So it's just, so you have a sum of powers of the Frobenius acting on the elements alpha one to alpha f. elements alpha one to alpha f, so any power of rhenius acting on those elements, and then you shift it by a point, a gamma in the set of k points. And it has to be a subset of gamma, the finally generated submodule gamma. And so that's the sum of f orbits. And by an f set, we mean a set of that form plus a sub module gamma prime of gamma. gamma prime of gamma. So and by an addition, we just mean you add all the elements together. So basically you add the add two subgroups. So you add them together and you will get an asset. So this is what we mean by an F set. And so now that we have the definition of F sets, this is the result of Reinhards and from Scammon regarding the intersection. Regarding the intersection of a variety with a finally generated module. So it states that if you have a G, a semi-abelian variety defined over FQ, and you also have a soft variety of G, let's call it B, which is defined over K, which is a field of positive characteristic. Then the intersection, and also gamma is a finitely generated submodule, a ZF submodule of G. Of G, then the intersection is a finite union of F sets containing gamma. And this result is actually very useful because to understand, so I should say that in the theorem, let me just explain why this result will be useful. So in the theorem, the endomorphism is basically just a translation composed with a group endomorphism. With a group endomorphism. And group endomorphisms are for semi-abelian varieties, they're actually integral over z. And because of that, the orbits will be contained in a finitely generated module. So it's really good to understand the intersection. So the intersection of a finally generated submodule with the variety, and that helps a lot. If you know how the structure looks, it really reduces down the problem to equation, basically. Problem to equation, basically, to diphonine equations. So, if you know the structure, if you understand the structure, then it gives very useful reductions in the proofs. And finally, Okay, so some useful reductions that will work in general. So, for the case of the general conjecture as well, it suffices to prove the conjecture for an iterate of the endomorphism. So, you can replace phi by an iterate and prove it in that case, or you can replace the endomorphism phi with the conjugate. So, you take an automorphism of the An automorphism of the variety that you're working on, and you take the conjugate psi composed with phi composed with psi inverse. And if you can prove the conjecture for that, for that endomorphism, then it also should prove for phi. And in our case, so in the case of semi-abelian varieties in general, it's, as I said, the endomorphisms are compositions of a translate with Of a translate with a group endomorphism. And it's really useful to take that endomorphism side, the automorphism side, to be just a translation. And the reason is that if you do it, you can simplify the translation part of the endomorphism as much as possible. So in some cases, you can just get rid of the translation part altogether, but Uh, altogether, but in most cases, you can just reduce it to a simpler uh translation. So, it's very useful. This is a very useful reduction in the proof. So, these are two ideas that will be used in the in our proofs. And so, I should talk about the general strategy. So, as I said, the first theorem is really just a question. So, the first theorem is really just the Theorem is really just the special case of the second theorem and the proofs are very similar to each other. But as I said, there are two complicated things in the case of general split semi-obility and varieties defined over FB bar. The first one is that, I mean, we, the endomorphism ring of GM itself is very simple. It's just the setup. Simple, it's just a set of integers, but the endomorphism ring of a simple semi-abelian variety, as I said, is not really commutative. So that will create complications. And also, because we have different building blocks in a general split semi-abelian variety with different simple components, it becomes really harder to choose a Zariski dense. Choose a Zariski dense, choose a point with a Zariski dense orbit, for example. And I mean, the ideas are really the same, but choosing the point requires more care. So it's really a more delicate thing to handle in the general case. And the basic strategy in our proofs is we just assume that the is we just assume that the two the this sorry let me just go back so we assume that the last two conditions don't hold and we prove the existence of a Zorisky tensor and so that's the main strategy and so that's the strategy and I should say that you can Say that you can just reduce the problem to the case where you have an endomorphism phi acting on a reduced semi-abelian variety. And by reduce, again, I mean product, it's isomorphic to a product of simple semi-abelian varieties. And you can decompose the endomorphism phi as a product of endomorphisms acting on powers of simple semi-abelian varieties. Sample semi-abelian varieties. So you can decompose it as product of a normal present like that. And it really boils down everything to three extreme cases. The first one is when you have an endomorphism, a group endomorphism of phi acting on c to the power of k, where c is the simple summary of the variety. And the And the endomorphism here corresponds to a matrix that's NFP. So, again, let me just say it in simple terms: the eigenvalues of this matrix are multiplicatively independent with respect to the Frobenians. That's what we mean by editing. So, that's the first case. The second case is, again, you have an endomorphism of C to the power of K and the Power of k and the endomorphism, the group, and it's a group endomorphism, and it corresponds to a matrix like that. So it's just in Jordan normal form, and each Jordan block corresponds to a power of the Frobenius. So that's the second case. And I mean, all the complications regarding the Frobenius will be in this case. In this case, so that's the new thing that you will observe in the positive characteristic case, and that's why we have to handle it separately. And the last case is the unipotent part of the endomorphism. So you have an endomorphism by that corresponds, I mean, it's the composition of a translation with a group endomorphism that corresponds to a unique plotant matrix. Corresponds to a unique potential matrix. So that's the third case. And we should handle all these cases separately and then put them all together and say that the conjecture holds when you have a composition of these separate extreme cases. So, as I said, we always assume that the first, does the last two conditions do not hold? And then we prove the existence of a Zariski dense orbit. Or any questions? Okay. So, in the first case, remember the first case is when you have an endomorphism that corresponds to an NFP matrix. Well, it turns out in this case, we can find Zarsky dense orbits. And the way you do it is just you pick a point, X, with coordinates that are linearly. Coordinates that are linearly independent over the endomorphism ring C of C. If you do that, and then you use the F structure theorem of Mussa and Scammon, then you can just reduce the problem down to a very nice looking equation, Vikram Pane equation. It looks like that. Okay, so you have an equation that looks like that. So you have a power of lambda that's equal to. That's equal to sum of powers of the Frobenius. And this lambda, as I said, because I mean, I mean, the things that happened that appear here are basically just the eigenvalues of the original matrix of the endomorphism. And because this is an NFP matrix, these lambdas that appear here are multiplicatively independent with respect to the Frobenius. The Frobenius. Okay. And due to a very famous theorem of Laurent regarding the number of solutions of these equations, we know that this equation can only have finite, if it's non-trivial, then it can have only finitely many solutions. This is an equation where? On the endomorphism ring? So, okay, it's so you're thinking of Fc, so the coefficients are coming from the endomorphism ring. I mean, it's the Ring, I mean, it's the endomorphism ring tensored with Q. But that's the, yeah, it's in that ring, and you're regarding F as an element in that ring, and Lambda as well. But no, actually, Lambda doesn't have to be there. So Lambda is an extension, but yeah, F is there, and also the coefficients are also in there. And due to a theorem of Laurent, these equations can. Of the Laurent, these equations can only have finitely main solutions, and because of that, I mean, if they can have finitely main solutions, that will imply that the orbit will be Zarspass. Sorry? Yeah, we find that too many in R yes. Yes. So yeah, it really simplifies the problem, the structure theorem just reduces the problem to equations that look like that. That looks like that. So that's how you deal with the first case. You can find Zariski dense orbits. And the form of the Zariski dense orbits, I mean, the points that you choose are actually very nice. And you know how to choose them. Just take the coordinates and you let them be linearly independent over the norms of C. Okay. And so in the second case, and let me just remind you of the second case. Just remind you of the second case. So that's when you have the Jordan blocks that correspond to the powers of the Frobenius. Well, again, in this case, you can find Zariski dense orbits. And if you, so you have to pick the points a little carefully. I'm not just, I'm not going to go into the details of that. But if you do it, then you can just reduce the problem. Do it, then you can just reduce the problem down to an equation that looks like that. So it's a similar equation to the one that we had before, except that in this case, you have really the linear combinations of a power of the Frobenius times a polynomial. And again, the polynomials where we'll take the coefficients in the endomorphism ring tensor with Q. And so, and also, you want this. Also, you want this equation to have solutions in a set S, which is a subset of N, that has a positive upper asymptotic density. Okay. And so that's what the equation reduces down to. And due to a bound, which we were able to prove with Frigosh Pioka, Alina Ostofi, and Igor Schwarlinsky. And Igor Sporonlinsky, we know that these equations, so if that's the case that you have a subset S with positive density, such that that equation holds, I mean, that equation has solutions, then what that means is that those polynomials must be constant. They can't have a degree greater than or equal to one. All of them have to be constant. And that helps to reduce down the problem further. Problem further. So you can just reduce it to the case where, so remember those Jordan blocks, the Jordan blocks will all have size one. You basically just have powers of different veniers acting on different components of the split semi-abelian variety. So yeah, it looks something like that. So you have, so this is what the problem reduces down to. You have an endomorphism acting on a reduced semi-abeliarium. Acting on a reduced semi-abelian variety, a split semi-abelian variety. And so on each of these blocks, you have a different power of the Frobenius that acts. So L1 and LR are distinct positive integers that are, and the powers of the Frobenius are acting on these different blocks. And so this is as good as it gets. As good as it gets. And after this, it's really not too difficult to see how you can choose a Zariski dense orbit, how you can choose a point with a Zariski dense orbit. And I'll explain that in a second. So the way you do it is just you will take, so for each of these blocks, for each of these components, C to the power of KJ, which are defined over SP bar, you can just take a generic point over S p bar, let's call it alpha j. So let's call it alpha j, and you just put them all together. You take point alpha with these components, alpha one, two coordinates, alpha one, two, alpha r, and you prove that this will have a zero skid density. And here are some examples that show how this works. So, for example, let's say we have a morphism from GM4 to GM4. Gm4 to GM4, and it's given by the what by this action. So xyzt maps to xpyp zp squared and tp squared. So you can see that on the first two coordinates, you have the first power of the forbidius that acts. And on the second, on the last two coordinates, you have the second power of the forbidden. So the way you do it, the way you choose a point is you, and also the field that you're working with has transcendence degree two over F. has transcendence degree two over f v y. So you can just choose t1, t2 for the first coordinates and also t1 t2 for the last two coordinates. And then the orbit will you can prove that the orbit is RCS. And if you look at it, I mean the t1s that appear in the orbit will grow in different speeds and the t2s will grow in different speeds. And that's why the orbit will be sort of semi-s. Here's another example. So you have you have xyz t mapping to xpyp zp squared and tp to the power of four so here you have three different powers so on the first two coordinates you have the first power of the forbenius on the third one you have uh the second power of the forbenius and on the fourth one you have the fourth power of the forbidius that acts well in this case the orbit you can just choose t12 t2 for the first one and you can just t1 choose t1 for the last two coordinates and The last two coordinates, and that will give you. I mean, you're free, you can just choose T2, T2, or T1, T2, or anything. I mean, as long as you choose an element that's transcendental over F-bar, it should be good. So that's how you choose the orbits in simple terms. I mean, it might look very simple, but I mean, when you're dealing with the general case, the case of split semi-Abelian varieties, it gets a little It gets a little trickier to choose these points, but it works in a similar fashion. And finally, I said so there is the last case, which is the unipotent case. And so unfortunately, in that case, we're not really able to get rid of the translation part, but we can simplify it as much as we can. Simplify it as much as we can. And I mean, in this example, you can see that you have an endomorphism that says, I mean, you can see that this is the group endomorphism part is just, I mean, if you think of it, you can see that there's two blocks involved. Is it okay if I write up the board? So, for example, if we This is basically the group by the work is not that acts. But you can see it here. And so in this case, and in general, so you can just you can just take the box. Uh take these plots. Oh, sorry, take these plots, and so each and each of these will correspond to a coordinate. And you can just simplify the translation so that it only acts on these last coordinates. As you can see here, so you have x1, x2, x3, x4. You have no translation for the first coordinates, you just have x1 plus x2, and you have a translation for the last one. So you have beta one plus x2. Beta one plus x two. Similarly, for the last two coordinates, we have x three, x four maps to x three plus x four and some translation of x four. That's as good as as good as it gets. You can't really simplify it any further. I mean, in this example, but in general, it works the same way. So, what happens then if you have an endomorphism that looks like that, then it in this case, the dichotomy holds really. I mean, for the unipotent case, you either have an I mean, for the unit plotting case, you either have a zero-speed dense orbit or you have the endomorphism phi must leave invariant a non-constant vibration. There is no third condition in this case. And really what happens is if you have, if you know that these the coordinates of this translation are linearly independent over the endomorphism ring C, then you will be able to Then you will be able to find a dense orbit. And the way you do it is just you pick a point alpha whose coordinates are linearly independent with respect, I mean, to each other, and also with respect to these, to the coordinates of the translation. That's how you pick a Zara Sc point with the Zara Siddevs orbit. And so either that holds, either you know that the coordinates are linearly independent over the Are linearly independent over the nomorphism ring, or they're not. So if they're not, then you must, you can find two elements in the nomorphism ring such that, let's say sigma one and sigma two, such that sigma one of beta one plus sigma two of beta two equals zero. Then that lets you find, I mean, lets you define the rational function that you like. And the way you do it is as follows. You just map. As follows, you just map x1, x2, x3, x4 to sigma 1 of x2 plus sigma 3, sigma 2 of x4. And you can see that E leaves this endomorphism variant. And because of that, the first, so there are no Zarski densorbits, and the second condition will hold. So yeah, I mean, in general, it works in a similar manner. Similar manner. So, if you have a translation whose coordinates are linearly independent with respect to each other, then you can find Zar C dash orbit. Otherwise, it's not hard to see that. You can see that the second condition holds. So you can find a non-constant rational map such that phi leaves it invariant. So that's basically the general strategy for dealing with the For dealing with the proving the theorem. So, as I said, so maybe I should go back to the theorem for a second. So, as you can see, this is a theorem only for split semi-abelian variables defined over sp bar. So, in general, you want to deal with the case where you have a general split semi-abelian variety defined over k. Over k and that we refer to that case as the non-isotrivial case. So you want to deal with that. And for that, there are extra complications. So the theorem of Moussa and Scalon, the F-structure theorem of Moussa and Scalon, is for semi-abelian varieties defined over SP1. However, there is an extension of that theorem or Extension of that theorem or a strengthening of the theorem, which also describes the intersection, you know, the structure of the intersections of a finally generated module or a finally generated subgroup with a sub-variety. And we need to use that strengthening. However, that is more complicated. So, and that really introduces more complications. Introduces more complications in the proofs. However, we believe that with some care, the result will be, I mean, using that strengthening of the theorem, the results will generalize nicely to the case of general split semiability and varieties. And secondly, you have this the case of all semi-abelian varieties, which we believe that. Which we believe that will be significantly harder than what we than the proof that we have. And that was also a similar case for the case of the characteristic zero case. And the reason is that the dynamics of the endomorphisms, I mean, the orbits are easier to understand for split semi-abligant varieties because of the existence of these matrices. The existence of these matrices and worth working with you know eigenvalues and stuff like that. However, in the general case, it's harder a little to understand the dynamics. And because of that, it becomes harder to find points with the Zara Scan's orbit or prove that the orbit will be Zara C dense. So, we believe that the proofs will require more technical results and. Results and new ideas. So it will be significantly harder. And lastly, the general case of the conjecture, I mean, we believe that it's going to be as difficult as the zero characteristic case, which has shown to be a very difficult problem. And we believe that it will be also very difficult to prove this in whole generality for the For the positive characteristic. And yeah, I think that was it for my talk.
