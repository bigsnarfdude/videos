Joint work with Bono Marti and it's uh well the the title if you don't know uh environment embedding should be a bit uh puzzling but I will soon expect what is or what is more or less environment embedding so the idea is that we have a dynamical system with a one ordinary differential equation but you have a constraint instead of You have a constraint instead of saying, okay, I start from this point and I go to where do I go? That you want to solve this linear system, but with a constraint on the starting point on the terminal point at a given time, right? So H0 and H1 are linear operators. And then you want that the terminal condition and the initial condition are rated by this affin Mundari condition. Mundari condition. So, just to write it in a more mathematical manner, that's okay. Here for a reason I will explain I have put V and T as parameters. And so we want to solve this differential equation, Y V T and so on, with this relationship on the initial terminal condition, which means that you do not. Condition, which means that you do not know where you start, and that's the point. And this kind of problem, okay, you can, it was developed from the 50s, 70s. You start with what, for example, you find it a lot in wave in these other media, in radiative transfer, transport polymps for neuron. Think of, okay, a media where you have some relationship between what tons on one side, but what. What under on one side, but what on the water on the other side, and you have a constraint. So, this kind of problem, and one of the way to deal with it is to use invariant embedding. But if you look at, okay, what is invariant embedding, there is no clear definition, but I found in one of one article that it's a concept, not a technique. But the general idea of invariant embedding is that Invariant embedding is that we consider V and T as parameters, not as fixed value, but as parameters, and we try to transform this problem into a non-linear problem on the initial condition. And so I will explain first on this classical case, how do we transfer this problem into another one? And then once we have done this, we'll see that. This, we'll see that if we replace this integral by a Jung or Roof integral, then it is easy to arrive to existence on uniqueness result and then how to extend it. So, our starting point is this equation. The first remark is that if I differentiate it, okay, I assume that I have enough regularity, of course, with respect to V. So, V is this condition. Is uh is this container is a is the value fixed on t capital T is the terminal time, then the two derivatives are both solution to a linear equation on to the same linear equation at the difference of the starting point, which means that if I have the unique solution of this linear equation, then I know how to compute the derivative respect to V and respect to T. B and respect to T. So Z is a solution to a linear equation. And if I differentiate the boundary condition, then I get, okay, this kind of spade on earth, spade on Kreb equation. So it just makes some computation. And if I assume that H0 plus H1 Zt is invertible. T is invertible. Okay, this is we'll see later the importance of this condition. Then I get that actually the derivative of y with respect to v and the derivative of y with respect to capital T solves this equation. This equation, it's a first order linear equation in capital T on capital in V on capital T. In V on capital T with this term. On this kind of first-order differential equation, we know how to solve it using the method of characteristics. So the method of characteristics means that we are looking at a curve Vt, depending on the time, such that Y of Vt on T when T is moving, remains constant. So it remains constant is equal, for example, to set. Set t is equal to zero, so we want this to be constant. And if we differentiate this, we see that the curve Vt to solve this equation, right? Because of this term, the term in the integral is the term in front of the derivative of V. So this is very, very classical approach to solve first order. To solve first-order or kind of transport, this kind of first-order transport equation. So, the idea that first idea is that okay, we have reduced the problem to find a characteristic when a characteristic is to solve a differential equation. But we, up to now, we have not solved this equation because we do not know why, because it is what we look at. If we use the boundary condition setting t is equal to zero, this is why where. This is why the core idea of invariant embedding is that, okay, we use capital T as a parameter. So we have the terminal time. We can shrink it to zero or not. And if we shrink it to zero, we get some kind of trivial relationship that Yv zero, but with the termial time is equal to zero, is related to V through this relation. So this is. This relation. So, this is a trivial. So, the conclusion is that y at the position vt 0 t is constant and is given by this. So we have the initial condition, but not for the right value of v. We have another value of v is not the but vt on the other hand, okay. Okay, it is a solution to a first-order differential equation. So, for this, we use the flow property of the differential equation. And we get easily that yv is equal to t, so the initial condition of our system, if everything is all right, should be the solution to this is given by this. On this, for this, okay, we have just to use uh We have just to use to use the flow property of the ordinary differential equation. So, if I look at the differential equation starting from A, the point A, then it is uniquely defined. It is a diffeomorphism in space. And we see that, okay, just some algebraic manipulation, but we y be 0t. So the initial condition. So, the initial condition will be a solution to this problem. So, this problem is that, okay, we have our two operators, the inverse of the two operators. We have V and we have the capital I is a hitomap. So, it is the flow of the differential equation. But here, with still the initial condition on With still the initial condition, and here the initial condition. So, here actually it's capital Y from a point minus this point is nothing more than the integral between zero and capital T of the of F of the solution. So, here, if everything is all right in terms of invertibility of the operators, in terms of the regularity of the vector field, we saw that if we have a solution, We saw that if we have a solution, then the starting point should solve this non-linear problem. But this problem can be just written as simply as, okay, it's A is equal to a non-linear functional of A. And in this linear functional of A, we have capital I, which is the flow of the differential equation, but which is uniquely different. Equation, but which is uniquely defined, provided that H0 plus H1 is invertible. So, this is important because we cannot use it for periodic mandarin condition, so we need other techniques. And okay, we need the first order differential equation y prime fy to be well defined, but in this case, if But in this case, if f is one, it's okay, and we need the condition okay, which contains the first one that h0 plus h1 times the derivative of the flow still be invertible. And this is important because it will restrict the time, there will be a maximal time at which we may solve the equation. And there is nothing trivial here that okay, for small time because H0 plus H1 is an inverse. Because H0 plus such one is invertible, it will be okay. But if the time grows, then we can expect that there will be some problem because, okay, this is a solution of a linear equation, but nothing prevents this term not to be invertible. And of course, so we have seen that if there is a solution, then the There is a solution, then the starting point should solve this non-linear problem. And of course, if you have a solution to this non-linear problem, it's easy to see that we get the solution we look at. So now we want to consider the same kind of problem, but with instead of a first-order differential equation, we want a wolf or a young A differential system driven by a young or wolf pass. Why? First, because this kind of equations arise as the limits of ODE with a highly oscillating coefficient, for example, in random media. And usually you get something relevant by Boron motion of fractional Boron motion. So it's used at using limit diffusion approximation, we can get this kind of problem. We can get this kind of problem. But if you want to use it for stochastic difference all equation, we have some anticipative, we need anticipative stochastic calculus because we have some condition on the terminal condition. And this can be done at the price of using rather technical tools from stochastic analysis, on Mali-Man calculus, on anti-sipastic. Calculus or anticipative stochastic calculus. So it's a bit, it's become rather very technical, quickly, very technical. And also using roof pass theory, we can use it for a wide range of stochastic drivers, which means that we are not restricted to use boring motion or fractional boron motion. We can use every wolf signal, which is a conveyance. So So just to recall you that, okay, if you have a young or roof differential equation, so it is this kind of dynamical system, it's pretty close. Okay, I won't detail this slide, but it behaves more or less like it has many properties of ordinary differential equations, especially with respect to the flow property, to the differentiability of the equation. Of the question. The only difference is that, okay, we have to impose different regularity. Everything depends on the regularity of F. But if you have enough regularity, then we know that we have it creates a flow. So with respect to A, and we have continuous dependence, or even more than continuous differential dependence with respect to the driving vector field F. Vector field f with respect to x with respect to a on so on. So it's we can think of this as a natural expansion of ordinary differential equation with probably respect to to flow property with similar property as OD. So if we want to consider, okay, so in particular, okay, I want Okay, I wrote that A capital I is a eto map, so it is a solution to a given starting point which owns the unique solution of this equation. And we know that this heteromap, provided that F is regular enough, that we may differentiate and it is also a solution to a linear differential equation. Differential equation. So everything is like ordinary differential equation with respect to this point. So the idea is that, okay, we have developed a strategy for, okay, I mean, a strategy was known for ordinary differential equations, and there is nothing that prevents us to apply it to roof context because the idea that, okay, we consider the We consider this problem and we consider the non-linear fixed point problem with this problem where we solve with respect to A. Okay. On this, all we have to do is, okay, as we have the flow property of A, the differentiability, all we have to do is to find the suitable condition to apply the banner fixed point theorem. And for this, we this we we could exhibit some condition on the terminal time on the on boon on the on on the driver on the on the vector field so if you are if the terminal time t is small enough then by a banana fixed pointer rhyme okay you have a constructive map and you can you have a unique solution and you show that this unique solution gives the solution to the two point affinity binary condition. 2.5 in binary condition, and for this, we avoid any technicality related to stochastic, anticipative stochastic calculus. And we have also continuity of the solution with respect to the driver because of the continuity of the er map with respect to the driver. Again, okay, we have to just to exhibit the right constant. The right constant, but that there is no difficulties here. And for example, an application is that you have a first-order equation, differential equation with a superposition of vector field driven by some unknown variable, which are IV with mean zero and variance one on finite moments. One on finite moments. And if we consider linear interpolation of the sum of this, we know that this linear interpolation converges, it's just the Donsker theorem, converges to a Boolean motion. And the same is like for if we use the lift version of this linear interpolation, and we have also the convergence. And so applying the The above result, then we get that the process Yn converges, so it's just the continuity of the hitomap, converges to the solution of the Stratonovich differential equation with the constraint on the initial on the terminal condition. And we can do the same thing for fractional Bohn and motion, for example. So there is an immediate consequence of the continuity. All we have to do is just to control the All we have to do is just to control the norms, but infortunity is not true for everywhere because we need just to work on the trajectories that remains in a given bot. That's the point. And this is because we have some restriction on the terminal time t. And that's the point. So we can ask whether do we have global existence, mean that we have. Distance means that we have global existence for any time or not just for small time. Actually, it's easy to show that if f is not bonded, to construct some counter examples, there is no global solution. The idea is that, okay, we use banner fixed pointer REM on the just control on the Lipsystem on this control to get a contractive map. It was in short time. So if we want to extend it, So, if we want to extend it, we get some existence results, but not for not uniqueness, but just existence, using degrees, degree cell rate. So it's a kind of post-man version of the low-eye shorter fixed point CLRAM. That is rather very nice tool. So, the way that if you have a map on If you have a map for an open subset which is continuous, and you take a point and you take the x are all the inverse images of y and the degree of phi in O at point Y is the sign of the determinant of the Jacobian of phi. Assuming that you have a regular value and that y is not in the image. in the in the image of the boundary of of hope and this degree so it's it has a very lot of nice properties that if the degree is not equal to zero then there is at least one solution to to phi x is equal to y which means that you we may invert phi at the point y and it is stable by homotopy it is stable by omotopy biomotopy means that you you can stable by continuous deformation and this is the main point about the rate theory that it is useful for practical computation because you start from a problem for which you know that you have a solution and then you continuously deform the you apply your continuous deformation to reach your your problem and that we we can do in our case on Case on the but at the price of work in finite-dimensional state space, still with the invertibility condition, that we get that we have a solution to the two-point affin boundary condition. And for almost every V, which is the constraint, the number of solutions is finite. And this is the consequence of the third theorem. And for this, we have to. And for this, we have to use a directory for this map. So I just recall you that one of the difficulties we get or for which we should use this kind of techniques is that we require that H0 plus H1 gradient of the return. Of the eto map to be invertible at the starting point, but where the derivative of the itemap is solution to a linear equation, and there is no reason for this to be invertible because, okay, you can read some point, it will be invertible in short time. But what say the above results that for most of the point it's okay, or most of the. point it's okay or most of the time it's okay but sometimes you may have some uh you may have some problems that's uh there are a couple minutes too many problems okay that's uh the end of my talks so thank you very much any questions
