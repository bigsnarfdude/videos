And so, Defense Research and Development Canada. And so, my name is Anguang. And I'm the leading and quantum relevant in the project at the start of the center. And here, the quantum relevant in the program at the RDC and almost the quantum relevant project. And this is we call it quantum three zero uh two zero Means like this is some like you know, this quantum size and technology, and so you can add and so with you know four in the mission. One mission is a quantum radar, and the other mission is a quantum in the light, and the third is a quantum algorithm for defense in the security, and the third is a quantum in the network, and it's for quantum in the And it's for quantum in the communication. And so for me, we have the five big projects. One project is a quantum computing algorithm in the simulation, also quantum energetic is the world technology. We cannot go further. So third one is quantum chemical biological defense in the drought development and the toxicity in prediction. And so the fourth is a So the photos are like a chemical, quantum and bio, chem and the biological sensor, and the detection and the identification. And the last one we call it is the operational, you know, this is something like the new one. So we are just like in the think about like we can do something for the ministry. And so the funding and so the results, and up to, I cannot give you some exactly, but so we. Give you some exactly, but so we can talk, you know, I can see five figures and so the money mainly for you know the contract. So we see in next five years. Also, again, we have in some five and so full-time staff. And so we also have some opening. Right now we have three. And so we are looking for the people now. And so we have some like AI and Yokang and Silk Kono in Taiwan. And your con and self kernel in computer. We also have some like hybrid and CPU, GPU, QPU, RAP4. And the collaboration with NRC and SpinSock and so inter-M department, like some like, you know, and so Innovation Science Canada, also several departments. Also, you know, and 5R and MOU, and so you can output. And so we can output and so bilateral APA and so kineming in university in particular now we maybe could work in some category university. So maybe we can power but also looking for new and so new and so you know our congregation now. We have a funding so like so and briefly say some you know just today my talk is like a two part. One part is like you know Like a two-part. One part is like you know development. And the third is some like application. So we have to think about an application. In development, first of all we want to talk about like second quantity entanglement network under the momentum molecule solar. So we try to understand how molecules get correct in a some like a in a sort of curl. So we're looking for quantum in this material. It means like a quantum in the sugar. like a quantum and the shoebook of chemistry. So the third, the second one is the hardware with the CPU, GPU, QPU, quantum computing platform. It's nothing to say, just the build like something we have in something like it. And so like the workstation, we install, and we install again, we already have some software, some library, we have the GPU, we just QPU. So the third one is some non-perturbation electronic regulation in the interaction. So we're looking for temperature effect, some like you know, some, you know, this is a very challenging now. So we have been working with the UAS to develop this simulation. We are looking for thermal effect. Also, the last one, a random sampling statistic for crystal structure prediction to 25 by chemical sensitivity in space beyond machine. In space beyond machine learning. Because of the data, I already said that something like, you know, eventually the machine learning will be slow or stop, but in its complexity growing, it's very fast. So it means like we're doing some machine learning and we just expand and we expand in the few years. Now we are trying to do something in a few weeks. So that's why we do something beyond machine learning. So application, so we're going to something like you know. So we're going to some like you know the quantum in energetic and the superconductor and quantum and superchemistry. People know that something like you know the complexity for some like the second contact and so electronic in the Coulomb field is very complicated. That's why people working on some like a token defeating and so tensor and so hyper contraction. But still it's some like you have the arrow. Is something like you have the arrow. So you can accuracy is up to only up to 10 and so minus 5. So we are working on something like beyond that path. So that's why we can summon like an atomic center block, like demographic. And find your pair density. So we have two types. And so AA, you know, AB. AA is very simple, so we don't talk about it. But in for the button for AB, In for the AB, we need to think about that. But so we just introduced two atomic center gives the freego inharmonic. So we can do that because there are some still in a summary like a summar, unitary, in a small market basis, only one S, one P, one B. Also, you have someone like A and B, and associate that someone like, you know, some, you know, some annual momenta means that like this is formed with correlated assembly. Product is something. When you have this in a third, someone, like say you have ABC, you can do something three and some so on. That's why some you have the fully independent. Let's say in a creation and some creation and operator, you know, you know, associated is L A, M A, L B, also L B. This is like, you know, this is fully queried. So with that and simulation, so Data in simulation, so we can do something like in a quantum share in transformation because this is local. You can say, MA is local. You can do something global. This is global transformation. Also, this faster, so you can do something like because and someone like you when you're doing the fading, you also summon like a 10-second hyper contraction. Contraction is not some, you know, not a sovereign, not in a trade. Also, you need something like you know, some like you know, non-linear organization. It's not need that, so it's human. So, we can do something like for the sensor. We look at some data from the point here, and definitely you can see, okay, some interaction with the field, some mechanical field, the thermal field, some radio issues. You can do something like you can do in the circulating humble sensor. The finally, you can do something like auto-fast reaction. Because when it's a folding, you get something correlated. And the sexy disc reaction means like you see, you can see, and so one state occupied A, occupied B, occupied C, and fully occupied in some correlated. So when in the chemical reaction, it's also fast. Direction is also faster. That's why so that answer is damaged. This one, I don't want to say more because it's very simple. Just you have like a computer and workstation. So we have a laptop and some data and some this is a 7750. So we do install and some like and so IBM and Google and Penelate and some backstop. So also Google, if you have GitHub, Google, if you have a GitHub, if you have a lot of programs, you can do some QG organization and the QG chemistry, so on, so it's very, very straightforward because we can access two ABM in the cloud and so and the Google, we can talk to the Google also, can we have our own any other system? This is what we call something like a fabulous CPU, QBO. Hyper right at CPO, QPO, TPO given significant rifle. There's some known in perturbation and so you know electron and wave prevention induction. Because we know that the density function theory, perturbation theory is not an accuracy. Because also it's limited, because you have to think about using a super potential. The shield potential is whether all the type shield potential. The new type shield potential. Potential. The new type 2 potential is not available for secondary duty. That's why we're using some final difference, you know, finite difference. You can see this again, now being 67, we can see final difference. You can say 0, and so 0, 5, and 9 form. You can get some, this is like 2, 1, 0, or some next 9, 6. And so X Mala almost can somehow converge it. Compare DIFTB. DITP is not accurate. It certainly is not a summary because it also limited the subhuman potential. That's why we summon like it we have, we need a high level and so derivative calculation for band structure. And so in the wind, we can see, we are trying to visualize how can solve electron and so cool it, how can the electron and some cooperate. How can the electron and some prepare and so form? How to break and so compare? So we want to do some moving. This one is something we can and beyond machine learning, and so we have in a simple and efficient random sampling statistic and stratified by chemically statistical space for critical structural prediction. Structural prediction. This is the critical structure in the population is huge. You know, something like we can have, because there are a lot of possibilities. It's not, you know, very large. So then we apply the chemical setting in space. That means like first of all, it's a density. Density is a k. Some like you know density. So we have some density the factor. The second one atomic in distance. The one atomic distance because when the hydrogen bond sum should be less than one, you know, one line trans. So you have to third one is a transit group. So you have to think about like a sub, you know, and so if your same child in the group cannot be closely to each other. You know, this somehow is repulsion. And the last one is like symmetry. You have to think about, you know, think about symmetry because the molecules have symmetry. Symmetry because the molecule has symmetry, and it's a threshold structure, you have symmetry. So we apply that part so we can say, you know, someone, you know, it's a huge population, you know, downward field, and you have some, you know, some synthetic measurement. You can have something, because currently simulation doesn't have some like in the measurement. You don't know in some simulation is convertible. You know, this is why someone like you know, this simulation gives you some probability. Simulation gives you some compatibility. How the simulation gives you the send it. So wireless and some efficient. Only fair example. I think some US and UK have in the system machine learning spent almost three years and with 6,500 samples. It get one structure. So we have 20 samples. So we have the 20 sample. We got a two structure. It's a few weeks. This is an example. Say this is someone like hedging balloon and so we have in the RAM, a single RAM. So we have a single RAM, we have some covered some, this is a physics background, and it's a PBCA, and this is some first phase. And we can get some like a PBCA. PBCN is first phase, and PBCA is the second phase. PCCA is the third phase. This is very good something like it. Usually you give some one structure, but so the single one gives some whole in the surface and also three in the phase. This is very good. Compare XRD, you know, so yeah, very good. So for that, this is another example. Some like in people using some like in a GA. People using someone like in GA, and as you can see, and the system, we have someone like 50 samples, and some like almost, and some like 89% is lower than the GA method. That means the GA method is not converted. This is some very good example, it demonstrates. We have very simple method to do, convert it in a. You know, to do can converge it in a simulation. This is exactly the you know, I just mentioned that some like this system, very large system. So you have machine learning, if you're training some, you know, so, you know, so potential in the training, you have some sample something like 6500 structure. And so we are doing some only 20. So we get a true structure. And here you can say PA minus 3. PA minus three, and it's the same with machine learning. We also get the new one, PM and minus three. Only 20 samples, we get the whole story. Because it's a very large system in the simulation, one single run taken several weeks. This very you know, this is a large system. You can see many, many NSM molecules inside. So that's why some we do That's why we do the US and so we talk about like, okay, we have to do something smart beyond machine learning. So, you know, this one is the nail beam, the nail beam system. You can see, you have seen some of like this band structure. You can see in the band 40 and 41, 40, 42, into something is overlapping. It's overlap each other. Because how in the summer we just Like we just find how and some breakdown basically propair. So you can see, and in order to group the poop pair, you need some like three conditions. The one condition is longitudinal, the wave is not involved. It means like stretch bonds that cause that some deduced by energy. And basically the point line and the floor revolution in the vector. Okay, basically, this is another example of something like a this is where a good example is something like a tolerant and some potassium and this superconductor. So we can see the second derivative, we need someone like it's this quantum entanglement network and the some of the field. So you need a third of the derivative, second secondary derivative. You can see how to get cycling. So you can see this, you know, this going on here. This one is every 10 people watching on the same sense how to break and prepare. It's a movie show you. So exactly this is like a band structure. This is like another delivery also show you how to separate. So this is exactly show you which in this motion in the mode can Greek prepare. When we think about a chemical reaction, in the mechanical field, so we need something like a soda director. So you see in a something like this is an example of something like a boring network. So we have something like a 5 GPA, 10 GPA, 15 GPA. Only 10 GPA gives us a larger. This would give us language. This is something like a great, this is causing the subtendable, right? Causing the subchemical reaction, ultra-frost. This is summary we have in some one dimension and some nanostrap. This is a bending molecule and it can form some nano one dimension, nano strap. So this same sense, we can have, you know, this would be the sunrise cubic dash and also Hysteron diamond and the cubic and so. And so carbon high-wide, this is all good. So we did the simulation. This is partly some like the quantum tuple chemistry reaction because some like in a calculating quantum tangent, also in the some like Guency and causing the whole system in the motion and it's also faster. It's in the last uh last month and the Chicago University already and so you know Already, you know, some you know, discovered that some like a quantum in quantum digits cast like in a phantom super superchemistry. This is one good example of something like a function superchemistry for phasing transition has some of the diamond. You can say the movie, so how is it in the form that something like that? Yeah. I think some the last slide. There's a conclusion. It's a conclusion, so I don't want to go to detail because I'm having already there. So thank you. Maybe.
