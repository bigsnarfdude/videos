Distinguished representations in the PR set. So here is the definition of distinguished object. Since Marisa already gave this definition, this will not stay very long. And we are working in the context where G is a community regardless of the theater group. And our non-armed local field has odd residual terms. Okay, so we work with convolutions, and we have H is the fixed points of convolution. And the distinguished representations are the ones that are important for homework analysis on the gene H. Okay, so whenever we have an invariant form, H into the form lambda, and a vector V and V, we can form a generalized matrix sculpture. Form a generalized matrix scope of the function on G. We evaluate lambda on the vector pi of e to the okay. Now that might not be a matrix coefficient because for a matrix coefficient, the lambda would have to be smooth. And if you can add it, the work is smoothly represented. So that's why you call it a generalized matrix coefficient or a relatively matrix coefficient. Okay, but it's still a nice function on g and so. And so you can ask about its support. So it's H-invariant. So obviously, we should really work on G1H, but also we have an irreducible representation a lot of the time. So there's Schurz lemma. And so we work mighty low H times the center. Here's that denotes the center of G. And so being relatively supercospidal means that all of these Of these functions or compactly supported module H times the center. Okay, so now in the p-adic setting for ordinary representations, we have JK sub-representation theorem, which tells us, you know, if we want an irreducible representation, well, it's going to occur either as a coefficient or sub-representation, whatever you want, either one, of something obtained by parabolic induction from a supercospital. Conduction from a supercospital and in the dam. So, here we have a theorem by Kaido and Tatano that gives a relative version of that. How do you get H distinguished irreducible and visible representations? Well, it might already be relatively supercustable, but it might not. And in any case, what will happen is there will be some proper data split parabolic subgroup. So if data split parabolic. The theta split parabolic is one that behaves a certain way relative to the involution. So you have your parabolic and you apply theta to it. That's another parable. So basically, that should be, they should be opposite relative to some levy factor. The intersection of those two parabolic set groups is a levy factor of the rating model variable. So these play an important role in distinguished representations. And this is one place where you really see that happening. Really see that happening. So, you, if you are in this situation, M is going to be this levy factor, it will be the intersection, and it'll be theta stable. So, you can say, okay, then theta becomes an on-point restriction on the evolution of M. So you can say, okay, so there's an irreducible m theta distinguished representation there, and it also happens to be relatively supercuspid, which means that generalized. That generalized vatrix coefficient of tau, all of those are actually compactly supported module m times the center. And then you get a parabolic induction, this is normalized parabolic induction, and your pi is occurring as a, how did I write it here, a sub-representation of the parabolic induced thing. You can, of course, arrange it to be equipped. Okay, so what this tells you is that if you're building What this tells you is that if you're building irrigation municipal representations, the relative supercospitals are the building blocks. Because I was going to ask if the cospital support is a week after conscience. What do you mean by cospital support? The 10th date of half. Like in a real case, we always know which pair of articles. I was just curious. There are females world hospital support. Is that what you're asking? Yeah, in this in general? In this case, yeah. Alice, yeah, I'm not clear what you're asking. Can I become clear from what I say later? So we do know that if you have an air disciples of procuspil, it happens to be H distinguished, which might have been, it will be relatively true. But the thing is, there are some pairs where there aren't any H distinguished to the cusp. So, like for this pair GL2 and SC2INF, I want to know the relative supercus levels. There are not any distinguished suitable cusps. So, I have to find relatively supercusburgical representations some other way. That is what I'm talking about here. So, and for some pairs, you have both. You have a mixture. Like, if you would get the relative supercast level, some of them will be super cuss battle and some of them won't. So, basically. So, a basic example is GL4SP4, which could also be GL2 and SP2N, except for PlayStation to be larger matrices. And you have various parabolics with a levy factor, isomorphic to GL2 plus GL2. And then, for example, if you just choose a levy with this block form, and then there's a unipotent radical, this is a way to build like a theta split for that particular example, which of course has a Which, of course, has a light-dice feel too. Okay, and I'll come back to that in a minute. This was just the point of this was just to give an example of a phase split card, as I've already mentioned, phase-split card locks. Okay, so now this is ongoing work. It's not published, but hopefully something will appear on archives possibly soon. And so there's some special examples that were done earlier. And also, I'm going to be talking about the PhD student, PhD student. PhD student Mercenario, who finished in 2023, who did give a bunch of examples. And I will hopefully have time to mention some of his results. And then there are some results of Kaidon to Pano that give some specific kinds of examples for certain symmetric pairs with a somewhat simpler structure. Okay, so throughout the talk, I'm going to assume all irreducible supercospherils are induced from representations of compact marks and subgroups. And that's basically known in all the cases where we really know what's going on. So we'll just assume that. Okay, so the distinguished supercospitals, we're talking about the non-service cospitals. So I'm interested in saying, you know, cospitals supports this thing about the assumption about super cuspitals because I'm working with the cospitals. Cuspitals because I'm working with the cusp. So, this is about what cuspal support is: you have irritable smooth representation, and then you look at you have a pair, you have a levy factor, and basically your pie is occurring as a sub quotient of something parallel to the induced strength. There's something with Levy. Okay. All right, so now here I'm going to just move around inside the georbit again, chaots on the side. G orbit, again, it reacts on the set of involutions in kind of the obvious way. I compose with this conjugation by g theta of g inverse. You get a new involution, but it's got the property that the fixed points are just the conjugate of the original fixed points. And so the distinction doesn't matter. Like if I would switch from the involution theta to the involution g dot theta, the distinction is kept track, by the way. So a lot of times you have to move around inside a g orbit. You have to move around inside a georg to see everything that happened. You cannot just stick with one. So, this is a background result that tells us if we're looking, how do you say something about the cuspical support of a distinguished representation? So, and what it says is if you have something, you take something in the cuspal support, and then you assume your representation is distinguished, what happens at the level of the cuspidal support? So, this might ask your question. So, this might answer your question, Mon, but I don't know. So, what happens is up to some conjugate, some conjugate of the Lemmy must be beta stable. And there, when we move the representation over, actually, actually, we could work on M as long as we switch to the other evolution, some positive twist of the original supercospital is distinguished. So, basically, there is some distinction happening at the level of the cosplay support. At the level of the cosmos support, there could be several conjugates where this is happening. It's not unique in general. And so that's sort of our basic result. So what we're going to do, taking this into account, is we're going to look at the following set. We're interested in non-supercuspital relative supercomputers. So we're going to start with some parabolic with a levy factor that is theta-stable. We're going to start with a supercuspital such that. We're going to start with a supercus little such that some positive twist of it is distinguished on m relative to theta and also some irreducible subquotient of this is relative to supercuscal. So we want to make this happen, right? So we're basically going to make some conditions here that make this representation distinguished. And then also some irreducible self-quotient element is relatively superconstant. So that's the strategy. That's the strategy. So, when we look at this, what we're going to have to do is we're going to say, what do we say about M? Because if we randomly choose a theta stable M, we're probably just going to get like a mass. And also, we need to impose additional conditions on tau because just having some polyglot twist of tau being distinguished, taunt's basically used to make this being distinguished. We need extra conditions to make some. Extra conditions to make something become relatively supercustable. Okay. So that's what we're doing. So suppose we're in the context of what I just said, if you have something that's not relatively stable, it will occur through parabolic induction from something that basically was induced from a levy factor on a fixed lift divolk. Right? So it suggests that. So it suggests that when we're choosing our M, we kind of want to avoid theta split parabolics. Because if we work with theta split parabolics, probably what's going to happen is remember the titan is supercuspital on them, because we're just going to get something that's not relatively supercuspitive. That's the intuition, and certainly a lot of us know that. So what we want to do is we want to say our M should not only be the steel, but actually it should also not be Should also not inside any problems with parabolic because we're trying to avoid those parables, right? So, that again just saying why I'm doing what I'm doing without fully explaining it, but sort of suggesting the idea behind it. And so I have a lot of slides, I have a lot of words on them, and your only hope is to just try to get the new idea of what's going to be. Okay, so this is some stuff about the data tori. About data tori on evolution. So, an element is data split if data takes it to its inverse. A torus is data split if every element in it is data split. A torus is data f split if it's data split and f split. And then you can take any theta simple torus and you can take the identity component of the theta bits points and maximum theta grids of torus and at the level of the algebraic behavior almost direct product. Okay, so this is about the definition of. So, this is about the definition of theta elliptic. Oh, we can work with a crystal every subgroup. And if it's theta stable, we could say it's theta elliptic. This is another way to describe theta elliptic. Really, it's the same thing as saying it doesn't sit inside the levy of any theta split particle. But you can do it at the level of the maximal F split torus in the center of G prime. That's theta stable because G prime is theta stable. Because G parameters theta stable, and you just look at the maximal theta s good, or actually maximal theta spit torus in there, and that should be central. So we're only seeing theta split elements that are central when you push into the maximum escalator in the center of your land. Okay, and then just comment, as was going on, We said, like, so we can have various things that will conjugate. Some of them are data lift against some that are not, and that comes into it. So, we turn to our example here and we look at a different level. Well, first of all, there's described already, which was the other block forming the corners, and then the two by two in the middle. That if you look at its center, you get these diagonal matrices here, and A L, A L 1, A L is actually equal to A L. A L is actually equal to A L minus, which is definitely not central, right? Because L is a central eclipse, right? So that's not theta elliptic, actually, it's a levy of a proper theta, as we already said. Now, choose a different one. So take the block form where you have a GL2 and a GL2, like a standard GL2 plus GL2 levy. There's your center. And there, if you look how it adds here, the development. Here, that the elements are actually all central. That one's theta elliptic. So, that particular GL2 plus GL2 levy is theta elliptic. Its conjugate L is a levy of a public theta spill. So, that happens, of course, much more in a much more complicated way in general. Okay, so let's forget this remark for now. And so, And so, and here, what I'm doing is I'm just saying my statement about theta elliptic and this definition that I had, there's a bunch of equivalences here. Like what I said was theta elliptic in two different ways is actually the same. So that's just saying some stuff about theta elliptic levies. Okay, so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to like start with the theta elliptic levy and just take any parabolic that has that on the Take any parabolic that has that idolity factor, add a supercospidal there, and then I'm going to say, well, what do I need to make? I want to induce, right? Here, I want to induce. I want this to be distinguished. Even before I want it to be derived, it's impressible. I want it to be distinguished. So we have some modular functions that play a role here. So whenever you look at positive value characters on a layer, they're actually completely different. They're actually completely determined by how they act on the center or the escalate center. So I could define a think character here just by, okay, there's a modular function on p and there's a modular function on p theta because that's just the fixed points of theta. P is theta stable. And then, so this just defines some unique positive value for the character here. So what happens is this last part here. Is this last part here, this lemma? This has been known for a long time. Whenever you have a big single parabolic, how do you make the inducing distinguished? You have to do this, right? You have to introduce the modular functions here. And so this space embeds in this space. So if this space is not zero, then you better distinguish and use our function. But however, because of our assumptions about supercrushed holes, this I can actually tweak if I Tweak. If I use this thing I just define, and then I just twist tau by that, I can actually talk about the distinction of this twist of tau. And that's isomorphic to this. So what this does is it simplifies things somewhat in the sense that I can now talk about distinction of a twist of tau rather than this thing here. Okay, so if that's twist of tau, and the new few theta can be terminated. How and the few theta can be terrible. Sometimes it is, and sometimes it is. If that's distinguished, then the induced thing is distinguished. Okay, next step. Okay, I've got a distinction. Next step, how do I make it relatively super complex? I'm going to make the whole thing relatively supercomplete. Okay, so here's how we do it. Okay, here's some information about this character, this quasi character I've just defined. You can say, just look at this sort of analogous to your usual. Sort of analogous to your usual formula for delta P. And don't try to read this. Okay, so no, there's no. So, but there's the point is there's a simple formula. Okay, so now if we look at this example of GL4 SP4, the mupi theta has a very simple form. You can just compute it. And whenever you write down a specific example, you can easily tell what you need theta. It's very simple. So you get. So you get, you know, our distinction is going to come from the case where tau2 is equivalent to the absolute value of the p-iodic absolute value of the turbine inverse times tau. This is, of course, this has been well known for a long time. I'm just using this example because it's easy to write down. Okay, if tau is also supercuspital, then the induced thing is going to be relatively supercuspital. Okay, so here's a condition. Now, so now I want to get to the point where I actually So now I want to get to the point where I actually say what extra condition I'm imposing on the cow. Remember, I was saying I need an extra condition on the cow to make the thing be relatively simple custom. So that's what's happening here. So I've got the state-stable energy I'm working with. And then there are, and we can shift around into different things in the g orbit of beta. And some of the conjugates could be like stable under something in the g orbit. Stable under something in the G orbit, or M is stable under something in the G orbit. Well, actually, that's equivalent to G times theta of G inverse being in the normalizer of M because M is already stable as well. And then so theorem one is going to be our main theorem. And so I'm going to define a theta regular property, which is going to be what's going to guarantee that the inducing is relatively superfrustable. So we have our tau, right? Our tau, right? That's just our superficial on M, and we want to say what it means to be theta regular in G or theta G regular. So every time you have a G such that G theta G inverse is in a normalizer of M, but not in M, and every positive quasi-character of M, you're not allowed to have distinction, but also to this other involution. So what I'm doing here is I'm looking at any positive choices of tau. I make positive choices of tau here because of this problem with more than one that comes up, which is why the new be theta could be non-physical. So basically, I'm conjugating m around under different things in the g orbit of theta that preserve it. And I'm saying, when can a positive twist of tau be distinguished? And I'm actually saying I'm not going to allow that if g theta geners is not in him. So I'm excluding certain things from him. I'm excluding certain things from happening, right? The problem is, if I allow that to be getting outside M, I could be in a situation where M now is not G theta ellipse. So basically what I'm doing here, and I mentioned this before, oh no, this is just about the bars. Okay. So we're excluding certain kinds of distinction relative to other things and Q bar. I'll talk to other things and get a few out of it. And then I just want to not do too much here, but the bottom part is relative here. Obviously, positive twist, the theta distinguished pairs in the g orbit here involve only g conjugates of m that are theta. That's what this theta regular property is saying exactly. So I'm keeping things, distinction on gene. Things, distinction on G conjugates of this of two positive twists, can only happen by the theta level. And while I'm doing the obvious thing, I'm trying to avoid phase-life carbohydrates everywhere in the whole geo. Okay, so we continue with the example that we had. So we had our levy with our M, right, our geo2. With our M, right, our GO2 plus GO2 standards. And then we had the situation where we want a distinction for the inducing. So our tau looks like this, right? Okay. And then, of course, normal is a maximal level, maximal parabolic. So, you know, like it just have this normalizer. We do have a G, such a G the inverse. It's a normalizer in, but not an M. And then actually, you know, what we're doing is remember the L, that's the other based on G. And it was a labio with this. So we want theta regular to guarantee relative suit cost riddle. But for this example, if you think about it, you look more closely, the fixed points of m under g theta is actually SL2 plus SL2. And so I wouldn't want to say, okay, well, I'm not allowed to have tau or some positive toast of tau distinguished by SL2 plus SL2. By SL2 plus SL2, but the thing is, we already know that GL2 does not have any SL2 distinguished supercluster. So that's automatically happening whenever tau is supercluster. That means tau is theta regular just by virtue of being superclustered. So this is an example where the theta regular property is automatic. It is not true in general that the theta regular property is automatic. This just happens. Properly designed. This just happens with this. Okay, and then we have reducibility for the induced thing. And this is reducible length two is the unique irreducible quotient. And that's the relative sort of length. So it's a very simple example, and this is already known. It's just a new significant restriction. Okay, so this is the dam. And I think I've said it also with this statement is obvious. This statement is obvious now. So I start with an aerial supercrystal on a proper theta electric lowest field, right? I assume that I have this distinction for this particular positive preservation half, which makes that this thing is distinguished. And then if tau is data regular as well, then this whole thing is relatively significant hospital. And it has an HRS reducible hospital irreducible old. And every H2SI irreducible. It's just a reproducible sub-portion of this. That is, well, everything with this customer support is relative. So I've actually identified a property actually on hospitals, the level of hospital support. This is another way to state this theorem, which I'm not saying exactly that way here. I'm just mentioning it here. I can look at these various cosmetal pairs and I can impose various conditions on them, i.e. the M is the thick and that chow is. And that tau is data regular, and furthermore, there's some additional distinction happening at the level of just the tau that tells me, okay, here's how you get some relative hospitals from a particular sorts of hospitals, hospitality. So that's basically how this theorem works. So you would have to be able to do this, right? You'd have to be able to find the photoelectric. Have to be able to find the theta leptic levy, and then you have to be able to go. Well, here's the theta levy. I have to look for a supercuspital that's theta regular and also has a distinction property. That might not happen. Right? There are theta elliptic levies. You don't even have distinguished supercuspitals, let alone ones with theta regular. Theta regular can be evolved, right? There's existence questions. Also, questions about parametrization. I haven't said anything about uniqueness here. There are things you can say, but There are things you can say, but I don't think it would be possible to say those in the time here. Also, mention that we have some, you can do the same thing for finite reductive symmetric pairs, but you have a slightly different definition. So obviously you can like talk about combat support, or you can, but it's meaningless. So there are results there, and they are analogous. We have a paid or regular property, but I'm just mentioning that in passing because I think it would just be too much to whatever. Because I think it would just be too much to write a slide on that with details on it. Okay, so regarding the proof, I have one comment to make about the proof, and it's very quick. There is a descent property from invariant forms down along theta-script terravels. What I'm trying to do, I'm trying to, another way to define relatively supercospital is that all these descents better be zero for all the proper theta-spirit curveballs. What I'm doing with my theta regular condition is I'm With my theta regular condition, is I'm just forcing that this J module is never distinguished, which means, of course, all these descents are going to be zero because they're in graph, right? So that's a very brief remark, which unfortunately I don't have time to dwell on. Okay, so a few brief comments about my PhD student, my former PhD students' results. He just wrote down a bunch of examples. So for our classical groups, you can. So for our classical groups, you can just have you know VI involutions and SPG1 is really good because you know every single involution of SPG1 is quite straightforward and so he looked at a lot of examples and so here are some comments about his results. He just looks you know where what are the theta elliptic levees? How do you parametrize them? And then once you have a theta elliptic levee, can you find supercospitals there that are distinguished in the right way? Are distinguished in the right way, and also then, once you have that, if you have it, well, can you get something that's irregular as well? And so, by this example, what happened? These two pairs. You don't get H distinguished very disciples of cuspines. Okay, that's good because you don't get, there one doesn't give you anything at all, right? So, the problem is. Right, so the problem is that you've got problems with uh you've got problems with data regular, it just doesn't happen when you want it to happen. So so that's nice because uh we do want it to have some relative supercosticles. It would be very strange. I don't believe that there exists a symmetric pair that does not have relative supercluster. And then you can ask: okay, this is our expectation that when these pairs all relatively supercrustable. Pairs all relatively superfluous. Okay, how do you prove it? Well, that's somewhat complicated. So, what he did was he did brute force computations for a low rank, which you can do because it's low rank and it's not torture. So, but these are open questions in general as to whether or not you can actually verify some of these expectations. Okay, there's another example here. Some pairs here again. You've got various sympathetic children. Galois case, and then another case with a couple of thorough extensions. Here, in the first line, you said that there's the fast million. There's relevant surface, but yeah, that is no, most of the time. Well, no distinguished. Yes, but yeah, it's that's what you've defined. But yeah, it's that's that's enough. Yeah, yeah, he writes it all out. There's just you just have to find the right words. So he describes them and then he, you know, he says, okay, well, okay, suppose you've got like a theater lipid levy, you're going to have to establish the existence of the theta regular supercospital on L Levi to show that they are really there, right? And he does do that. And it helps with fastball groups that the levies have a very That the levies have a very classified classification. It's not a classification. I mean, on the data, you can classify, but the meter, I don't have like, what if they come some other way too? You know what you mean? Like, I don't have exhaust. You might mean like, there's a lot of questions. So, and then again, for pairs, some low-rand pairs, you know, everything comes from theorem. Ideally, I would like to come with theorem one, but that might not be the list. That might not be a little bit okay. So then, you know, the question arises when you're doing this procedure. I mean, the theorem is very general, right? And I'm saying things like there might or might not exist the same superclass levels on the M, and then there also might or might not exist in theta regular ones, right? So sometimes what you want to do is be more specific. So it can be more specific. Specific. So he can be more specific in some examples about how this breaks down, but I don't really have time to say anything about that. In a longer talk, I could do that. So I'm going to skip the next thing. And so here, I'm starting to say something more. I'm saying, okay, which super hospitals can I actually make things work for? For a general reductive pietic group, on a Levi subgroup? Like, which superhospitals can you even say are distinguished? Are distinguished in a nice way. So, then one very nice family of superclusters are the regular supercluster. These were identified by Kaletha, and he did a lot of things with L packets and local ends for those, right? I'm not talking about that part of it, but the nice thing about these representations is like if I have the theta-loped level, right, I've got a parameterization of these representations. Of these representations in terms of pairs, where T is an elliptic, can be ramified elliptic mass motor 4s, and V is some quasi-character that's M regular in a sense that collateral parts. So if you have a datum like this, then the distinction of this associated supercospital or the twist, positive twist of it, will be reflected in properties of this classification. That's a lot easier to work with. That's a lot easier to work with. To say this quite a character has to have a certain property somewhere than it is to just go this, this one has to be distinguished. So suppose briefly making a remark about this, like suppose you have a pair like that and your towel came from a pair like that, right? Then you start using results about distinction. Chang Zhang has a nice paper in parallel on this. No, Machinel, sorry. Which just basically says that That's what should happen is, you know, we want this new p tau to be m theta distinguished. Well, you can assume after you replace tau by some m conjugate, which is say that t was theta stable, and that this like b multiplied by this extra positive thing on t theta is just a quadratic character. So, a quadratic character is a character whose square is trivial. And so, there's a very specific quadratic character, right? And so, if this Right, and so if this equals that, you get the distinction that you want, okay? That's the distinction of the tau, right? So that's fine, that's good. But the next question is what theta regular, right? Because theta regular means some bunch of other things should not be distinct, right? Like some other twists of tau should not be distinguished by some other involutions. Okay, so I'm So, I'm oops. So, I'm just going to make a couple of really quick remarks here. That I'm going to assume I have depth zero. If you don't know what depth zero is, it means that it's terminal in the maximum focus of both the V is. If you know, but categorical. So, forget this remark, minimum times. So if I just so let's assume that I did have this, right? So I've got this V, I got it multiplied by this positive value thing on the fixed points. It does agree with this quadratic theorem. Okay, now make some extra things happen, right? So remember that before we were looking at m and we were looking at things where g theta g inverse normalized m but wasn't the m. So here we can be a little more specific about what we're doing. Can be a little more specific about what we're doing. We're going to look in the normalizer of t for things that are not in t and also for technical reasons involving irregularities, the squares in t. So we're looking at certain order two elements of the normalizer of t that arise in the form g theta g, right? So there's some also sometimes people call these involutions, right? Elements of words. So we're looking at particular involutions in the Involutions in the biomedical towards that are somehow arising through various basically it's state-stable body that we're interested in. And so for the things like this, if there are any, which there might not be, if there aren't any data regulators automatic, then you have to not allow stability of the feed. So you look at this subgroup, which is basically waving my hands a bit. Basically, waving my hands a bit, the maximal complexity, right? And then you go, well, decomposed with this thing, which normalizes T, also normalizes the maximal complex algorithm. And that's another character of it, right? I'm not going to be able to get feedback. I'm not allowed to stabilize feed by certain involutions in the model, right? If I can find a feed with this property and this property, And this property, I have what I want because I get distinction from this, and I get theta regular from this. Right? So theta regular happens, therefore the theorem applies, and therefore I'm getting some alphabet supercluster x. Why is this nice? Well, because I'm not saying anything directly about something not being distinguished, right? There's no guarantee that something is not distinguished. Something is not distinguished. But I don't know if it's equivalent. You know, flies stay irregular, it might be stronger. But one reason why this is nice, it's very reminiscent of to the list of general position kind of results, right? You know, when you have over finite fields and you have some elliptic torus, then you have this character of it, and you want to say, oh, I'm going to get a very simple cuspical representation from this. Cost representation from this, then you may say, okay, if it's in general position, which basically means it's not fixed under a non-trivial element of the log loop, you get it automatically get a custom, right, over the finite field. Well, this is kind of like a relative version of it. Like if you would do this in the finite field setting, again, it's like it's like a relative version of general position, right? So this is This is possibly going to be something that can be used to avoid issues with showing things are not distinguished. It does imply certain things are not distinguished, but to directly show that they're not distinguished is going to be challenging. So this gives a little more structure to the construction in certain cases. So this is another thing that is interesting because, again, I'm going to produce a lot of well-to-superfuscators. Produce a lot of relative superclusters this way, if I can do this. And I will also get relative puscurls over the finite field from this. What I don't know is whether or not this is equivalent to theta regular, because that is that needs to be investigated. Okay, so and this is just what I'm saying here, what I just said, that it's an analog of gel position there, and you can apply it to so. So that gives some information. And now, if you work more generally, like I said, I'm with James F0 case there, you can do it for all the regular super hospital, but you have to, this is a more technical statement of the work well as some subjects. So I just chose a simple, the simplest context. And then I write off. Thank you. Do you have any lessons for your student cities and in Part Archive? It's not on archive, but it's on something that it's on. Yeah, we're all thinking that it's public. There is a thing with like this. Okay. It is over after Spong, right? Where is your last year? 2022. Yeah, he did. Yeah, he did he planned it in 2022, but he graduated official health 2022. So Gerard had some examples of SL2 and some Torah, SL2, and extension relative to those Torah. So what do those look like? What ends up being the answers to what are the TV schools that we could do with the salt? I mean that's not the majority. Are there fighting in the are there finite and you? So is it that maybe they say, oh, well, yeah, obviously it's those. Well, there's not that many kinds. You're going to have to like, they're object wasn't there some fuzzy character. Yeah, it's you should look at something. I don't remember that. See, like that's a thing that it's very simple, like the structure is very straightforward. But the thing is, when you're looking for Puzzy tokens before, right, you might not find many that are involved, right? Like, but like up to that general, like there's finally many general forms is basically answers your question. Yes. There you go.
