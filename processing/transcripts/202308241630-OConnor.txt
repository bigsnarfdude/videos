Are you agreeing with being recorded? Yes, yes. Since the first time that I asked, I'm ready. Okay, so sorry for the delay, especially to the people on Zoom. Can you hear me? I can hear you. Anyone can hear? Anybody from Zoom can hear us? Is it on? It's on. He can hear it. You can hear me. Can anybody hear us? Yes? Okay, if not, well, send something in the chat. So this outfit. without first delay than you o'connor talks on fuzzy geometries please thank you very much and thanks to the organizers for the invitation i was asked to speak about fuzzy geometry so i'm following that's that remit um and the i'm going to keep it relatively simple i believe Relatively simple, I believe. Oops. Now, please. Okay. You see my oops. Not sure which which way it goes back. Which way goes back? They all go forward. Okay, I see. Okay. Okay, I have a, after some practice, I'm going to give a very brief introduction and then I'm going to spend a little time on discussing the fuzzy sphere, which many people have heard of already today and throughout the week. I'm then going to describe a construction of A construction of what we call Fuzzy S4, and this is closely related to some work that has been taken in a very different direction by Harl Steinecker. I will very briefly mention some construction based on the exceptional group G2, which gives an analogous version of S6. It follows a very similar type of construction. And then I will finish up with some description of where these models play a role in membrane physics. So that's the outline. So standard differential geometry, it probably only makes a very brief appearance here, but it's But it for me, standard differential geometry was always in terms of the metric and the differential geometry associated with that. There was an old observation of cats who was relying on some beginning with Weil's law. Weil's law tells us that the number of eigenvalues of the Laplacian grows as the cutoff to the power, to the diminished. cut off to the power to the dimension so it's clear you can read off the dimension of the space from the spectrum of the laplacian the higher order terms involve the curvature and this is closely related to uh corn et al spectral geometry in more recent versions and katz phrased this question in terms of can you hear the shape of the drum and of course the classical answer was no you can't you need more structure You can't, you need more structure, right? And that more structure was provided by Khan and the idea of spectral triples. So you need the algebra that was not part of Katz's construction. You need an operator, and Kahn replaced the operator of the Laplacian of Katz with the Of cats with the Dirac operator. And you need a Hilbert space to represent that. So those three structures together give you a lot more information. You have the spectrum still, so you can talk about the spectral geometry, but you have the structure of the Hilbert space and the algebra. So to make things concrete, the algebra for S2, we can Two, we can take this dual point of view now and just switch over and say, well, let's take the algebra. The algebra is the algebra of the spherical harmonics. The algebra is generated by the coordinate function. Oops, there's a pointer here as well, probably, is there? I'm not sure which one I can't figure out the pointer on this. This one. Oh, I see. You have to wait a while. Okay. It is given by the coordinate function xi. So basically, polynomials of a fixed degree in xi give you all of the spherical harmonics of a given angular momentum L, and L is really. Momentum L and L is related to the power of X. The Dirac operator on the commutative sphere, this is the commutative sphere I'm talking about, is given by sigma dot L, where L is this differential operator, and H is the Hilbert space. This is, I see why everyone was having difficulty with this earlier. And H is the Hilbert space of the Dirac operator. The Laplacian on the sphere is given by DC. on the sphere is given by d star d is equal to l squared over r squared and the spectrum of the laplacian is l plus l times l plus one with degeneracy 2l plus 1 i didn't give you the spectrum of the dirac operator but it's l plus 1 it goes through the integers positive and negative uh with degeneracy is uh 2j plus 1 if i remember correctly i forgot all right the positive sphere it Buzzy sphere, it was introduced by John Medor, to the best of my knowledge, though the algebraic objects existed prior to that. And Jens Hoppe likes to claim that he introduced it, but there was a little missing ingredient from the earlier results. That was the spectral geometry was not there. They were just algebras. They were finite matrix algebras. Here we have a finite matrix algebra, which I've written down in terms of Which I've written down in terms of polymatrices. Polymatrices are two by two matrices. They close to give the three poly matrices with arbitrary coefficients, close to give a matrix algebra, which is mat2. And the Dirac operator in this setting that I'm using is this direct analog of the commutative Dirac operator, where now the Laplace, the differential. The differential operators are replaced by the commutator with the polymatrices. This is not necessarily the optimal one. There are many others that were discussed. Which I think are mostly related to one another that have spectral triple that fit better with the spectral triple ideas. But I'm not going to focus that much on the spectral triple because they haven't really been constructed in the higher dimensional case. Constructed in the higher dimensional case to this to a satisfactory level that I'm aware of. So I'm just not going to do that. But once one has this, once one has a Dirac operator, I believe that you can construct things, which is an approximation to the commutative one. Then one can proceed. The Laplacian, by analogy, is again given by this double commutator, and the spectrum only. And the spectrum only has angular momentum L equals zero and one. Two by two matrices have four degrees of freedom, the constant L equals zero, and three, which are the coefficients of the Pauli matrices, the L equals one. And these are the spherical harmonics of L equals zero and L equals one. General representations of the fuzzy sphere, one can take any J as a generator of SU2. generator of SU2 with j squared being proportional to the identity. This is the quadratic Casimir. So, and the J is n minus 1 over 2. This generalizes. You have xi. If I define xi, normalize them so that I get to xi times xi is 1. The commutator, they no longer commute, as we've heard many times already. These commute, and this is This is the one over square root of c2 is just coming because I've normalized the x's from their j so that I get back to one. The algebra now is matte in, just a matrix algebra. So there is no structure really in the algebra. There's very little information. The information is coming from the Laplacian or the direct operator here, sigma dot j plus one plus the identity. J plus one plus the identity works well. It has a cutoff version of the spectrum of the continuum spectrum. And the Laplacian is the double commutator and it has a cut-off spectrum as well. This is a sharp cutoff with no distortion of the spectrum. With no distortion of the spectrum. I should twice one twice fast. Twice goes forward. Oh, you're um okay. So this was, yeah, okay, let me go forward. We can understand the cut-off spectrum by just understand the cutoff spectrum by just expanding in spherical harmonics. You've got a Hilbert space on the left which carries the which is of dimension n. This is the n-dimensional representation of SU2. The Hilbert space on the right is the n-dimensional representation. Tensor product of them expands to the sum up to n equals l equals n plus one. And this is the structure that is given. And it's in it's Is given and it's forced down by the spherical symmetry. We have a mapping from this, we can then consider mapping between the sphere and the between functions and the sphere, provided we have some omega, I've written as omega here. written as omega here uh which allows us this is very frustrating okay this omega here it should be a ma uh yeah this when one maps between from the integral of the function to the trace of it and the Laplacian goes over here and then one can go back I think I wrote out a little bit more yes I wanted to describe a little bit more of how To describe a little bit more of how one go makes that mapping, which I believe is what's called the tunnel or some part of a tunnel by Frederick in one of the lectures here. One takes the function, one can take a function f, which is expanded in spherical harmonics. The expansion is not really necessary, but it's easier to describe it this way. The coefficients are f l. The coefficients are F L M and a particular matrix which pairs spherical harmonics with polarization tensors. Polarization tensors are the eigenvectors of the non-commutative Laplacian, these commutator ones. So you pair them. You can do this exactly the same thing on the phositorus, where you use exponentials and more generally. So this is a pairing which gives you Which gives you a projection of the function onto a matrix. It cuts off the higher angular momenta above the cutoff n minus one and it gives us a matrix. The expansion of the matrix is guaranteed to have exactly the coefficients of F L M up to the cut half. The advantage of this is that one can take one over n times the trace. 1 over n times the trace of the same matrix, rho, which if I take rho, if I take the trace of the function, it maps me back to the commutative function, but just cut off, project it out. This is not the only way of doing this. One could choose a different row, which would have distorted functions here. And if one uses coherent states, one does exactly that. One gets the that one gets the row where there are where there are coefficients twice again it's i still haven't got the trick for this so you have three pointers now i may use one i may just point with my finger and and abandon that okay um i think it's it's too slow for me to react Think it's too slow for me to react anyway. If I point following Jani, I will so one can change the coefficients in here, and that's what happens in a coherent state representation, which induces a star product. Using this, the product of functions here, going backwards, one induces a star product using this object here, this row. And one gets different star products depending on the Depending on the row that one uses. This is the nicest one in that it has no symmetric tarum in the second tarum. So that I think it's called it would give you the Vorus star product, if I remember correctly. Anyway, if we go and use this tunnel to make a comparison between a community. To make a comparison between a matrix theory and a commutative theory, one can discuss a scalar field theory on the sphere. So, scalar field theory, I've taken phi. Now, the advantage of taking phi as a commutative function and pulling it back onto the fuzzy sphere means that all the coefficients up to infinity are defined already. So, I can have a commutative field phi here, and I want to compare. And I want to compare this matrix action with a commutative version of it. So I can do that. Because phi is pulled back and cut off version of this. This one has star products. When I move or not, as you depend, we know how to represent it in this, in terms of star products. If I take it in terms of star products and map it into functions, these leading terms cancel and one's left with... Cancel and one's left with some positive, some terms which, by definition, are positive. And one can see that it goes to zero in the limit because they fall off from the star product. That's an easy way of seeing this. So if one chooses the coefficients as I've defined them somewhere here, there's some version of it. Well, you can rescale them to if you're doing a path integral to. Doing a path integral to get rid of them, solve them. However, I should let me go back. Let me go back and describe it. When one quantizes this system, this matrix version, one sees that there are problems. It doesn't match the commutative version, even at large n. There are two origins to the problem. One of them is the non-commutativity itself and the tadpole diagram that's divergent. There's a diagram in this scalar field theory and only one diagram. It's super enormous, but then there's only one diagram which is divergent. And that's the one that would normally get rid of by normal ordering. So that divergence is considered harmless. It just shifts this parameter R. Just shifts this parameter R, and one can absorb it into it. On the that diagram in the non-commutative setting splits into two diagrams. It splits into a planar diagram and a non-planar diagram. The planar diagram is exactly the same as the commutative one, but cut off and it diverges just as the commutative one does. The non-planar version does not diverge. So when you take the limit as n goes to infinity. Limit as n goes to infinity, it's actually it must diverge if the thing was to become is to agree, but it doesn't diverge. So that's the origin of the difference between them. But since it's not divergent, you can see that it must have an effect in infrared because what's ultraviolet to it is not the same as what's ultraviolet to the commutative part of the diagram. So there's an info UVIR mixing. A UVIR mixing associated with that problem that can be removed by a version of normal ordering, by cancel, putting the tadpole back into the original action to cancel it. That gives you slightly more complicated action here, but that can be resolved. The second problem is associated with the potential itself. This potential, in the commutative case, it's a potential that's local. Local. Every point is just a function. And the function, the Laplacian picks out functions that are constant. This one here, in the commutative case, constants, you have a double well, as Yuri explained to us, and you can get a phase transition associated with the ising critical point. Critical point because the Z2 symmetry of this potential is broken spontaneously. One gets a spontaneous magnetization, and that's what happens. However, what we've got a matrix here. The analog of this, forgetting about the potential, by just looking for this derivative term here, is to put the, is to solve the matrix problem. The matrix is minimized by By phi squared being the identity up to some kind of proportional to the identity, but that means that phi can have eigenvalues plus or minus one, and it can have an arbitrary mixture of eigenvalues plus and minus one. That creates a problem, and it isn't sufficient. This Laplacian isn't sufficient to lift that. And to the best of my knowledge, Yuri has worked. Yuri has worked on trying to improve it, but to the best of my knowledge, that problem hasn't completely been solved yet. So, the result is: if you simulate this on a computer, that model on a computer, it has a phase transition, which is nice, usual type phase transition down here, but it has two other legs. And it has this disordered phase, this non-uniform one, because a non-constant plus and minus ones doesn't. Plus and minus ones don't map into a constant function on the sphere, it maps into this striped space. So, that's that's what's going on here. Okay, so if there are questions, I'm happy to take them at any point. I'm going to leave the fuzzy sphere and go to higher dimensions. If one tries to follow the same logic, Follow the same logic for the fuzzy sphere, one might say, Well, gamma matrices of Dirac, nice four by four matrices, they square to the identity. I can easily normalize those to get an S tree. Does that work? The difference here is that instead of the polymatric, the commutator of two polymatrices gives you back a polymatrix. So here, it doesn't come back. It doesn't come back into itself. We take the commutator of two of them. This gives us a generator of rotations of SO4. The symmetry group here on these mu is SO4. I mean the Euclidean setting. Whereas, so these are the generators of ession 4. 4 by 4 matrices. Well, we need more objects. We can see that if we're going to have the entire algebra is going to be spanned by more objects, it's going to be spanned by these sigma mu nu. These sigma mu nu, which are the generators, I normalize them to more standard, mu times gamma five, and the gamma five itself. So those are the identity, these five, these six and these four are the 16 elements that span four by four matrices. Uh so let's let's look at S4. S4, we could take gamma A, including the five gamma matrices, that squares to the identity. This is a nicer object because we've got S4. We know that we need the 16 generators, but the 16 generators are the generators of SO4 or SO5. And these are the five-dimensional vector representation. Vector representation, the generators of the 10-dimensional representation. And with a small bit of some work that I did with a Mexican student of mine, Juliette Medina, we found that the entire space was really a CP tree. So this is a CP tree. One can see that, one can understand it from the fact that if I put the five and the 10 of SO5, they together far. They together from the adjoint representation of SO6, or the spin, or spin 6, really, which is identically the same as SU4. The symmetry then of SU4 quotiented by an SU3 gives us CP3. But if I deal with spin five, you're quotienting by SU2 plus U1. SU2 cross u1, and you get the same object topologically. So there's a vector bundle structure that's sitting here, and this vector bundle structure is a lot nicer to deal with than to deal with S3. So let me show you a little bit more of how that works. These representations, so that are the analog of the gamma matrices, exist for all representations, basically for all symmetric representations. For all symmetric representations, the symmetric tensor product of the gamma matrices are equivalent to these J's that I'm describing here. And together, JA and JAB are symmetrized versions of the four dimensional representation of SU4 or the for the spin representation of SO6. So you have these objects. These objects, the commutator of two j's is always a jab. And if I look now and I rescale the x a's so that I get a radius r squared for them, the commutator of these x's is r squared divided by l. The limit l goes to zero, it becomes commutative. So you can see that there is a structure here in which the CP tree. CP3, I should be able to recover an S4 in a commutative limit. To do that, well, I'll describe it first of all in terms of putting Laplacians on it. The Laplacian on the natural Laplacian on CP3, which has SU4 symmetry or SO6 symmetry, is the adjoint. Or SO6 symmetry is the adjoint action of the commutator of those ones, just as we had in the previous case, in the SU2 case. So it's the double commutator action, which gives us a nice round one. If you look at what happens by using SO3, the SO3 is geometrically, it's topologically the same space, but geometrically it's not. But geometrically, it's not. It has a different Riemannian structure to it and because it doesn't have that same roundness, it's the squashed version of that space. The spectrum of this Laplacian is what you expect for CP3, but the spectrum of the SO5 one, it's the same, but it has these M and M plus one modes as well. These M and 10 plus 1 modes as well. So it splits into two types of modes. The M equals zero modes here are precisely the modes that you need for S4. So those are the modes which you want to survive in the end. But note that if I play a little game between the two Casimirs, I can construct a difference Casimir, which just picks out these modes. And these modes are precisely. Modes are precisely: this is a Laplacian on the S2 fiber of the CP3. So you can pick out the Laplacian on the fiber. And, well, it would be degenerate to pick out the Laplacian. Well, there's another difference which picks out the, you can remove and pick out the S4 as well, but that's. But that's uh, that's not the natural thing to do because you're it's degenerate, it's got um oh, I've gone back. So a nice Laplacian on a generic squashing that has SO4, SO5 symmetry, but there is the radius of the S2, is to choose an arbitrary interpolation between the two. Relation between the two. So when h is equal to zero, we've got a nice round Laplacian. H goes to one, well, we've just got something on the S2, and we've nothing on the rest of it. So that's a singular limit. And if you look at the ratio of the two radii by studying the geometry in more detail, you will see that it is related to this parameter H. So choosing large H is choosing. Is choosing small radius for the sphere. So, this is a kind of a twisted colluted Klein construction, and you can make that sphere arbitrarily small, even in the fuzzy case. Again, one can go and construct a Dirac operator on it. First, there's an observation that one should make is that the Dirac operator on CP3 won't Cp3 won't drop naturally to a Dirac operator on S4. And that's essentially a result, and it's due to Lickshinerowitz theorem. If you square the Dirac operator, there's an R over 4 that you get in the square of the Dirac operator. R is the scalar curvature. The scalar curvature of the space is positive. So making the sphere arbitrarily small is going to drive up the eigenvalues of this space. Of this this space. One way around is to try and use a spin C structure. That is the type of thing that could be useful here, but we didn't follow that route. We followed a philosophy that's closer to the Wilsonian prescription for eliminating lattice doublers in lattice gauge theory for fermion doublers. So we worked out in some detail. out in some detail this consequences of this Dirac operator and the low-lying spectrum of this is precisely that of S4. So this is a nice prescription that gives us a Dirac operator on a commutative S4. This is a rounder hack operator on S4. It is not really an operator on S4. Not really an operator on the full space. It is treating the fiber differently to the base. It's only a direct operator, really, on the base. It's a first-order operator. You might call it a direct operator, but it has no relation to the commutative direct operator on CP3. But it has exactly the spectrum of the commutative direct operator on S4. And again, And again, using there's a second issue with going to CP3. CP3's Clifford algebra, it's a six-dimensional space, so it's got an eight-dimensional Clifford algebra. You only want four components, so you might want to use vial part of it, which is essentially what's going on here and distorting that. Okay. And I've given you the modes here. And this H tilde is driving up the. Tilda is driving up these M modes, these sphere modes are being driven up. And again, this is exactly the spectrum of the commutative sphere, but cut off. And it's, as I said, it's in the spirit of Wilson. I'm not going to go into much detail on this higher dimensional, yet higher dimensional version, but it is built on. It is built on the exceptional group G2. The exceptional group G2 has a seven-dimensional representation, which is closely related to quaternions. That seven-dimensional representation, if you take the generators in an arbitrary representation, you can see that the quadratic cases are in the seven, in the seven of it, that lowest dimensional representation. I'm repeating the analogous construction. These are the analog of the gamma. Analogous construction. These are the analog of the gamma matrices. There are 14 of them. So, and there's a seven here, which you project out to us. And if I focus in on that seven, then those ones square to a sixth sphere with a distortion. But one can go back to But one can go back to the geometry and understand what the co-joint orbit, what the orbit structure of it is. And one can construct, and we did in a paper with Brian Dole, we constructed the fuzzy version of all of these spaces. So there's G2 quotiented with U1 cross U1, there's G2 quotiented with SU2 cross U1, and G2 quotiented with U1 cross SU2. These two spaces are not the same. Two spaces are not the same. They're associated with putting the SU2 as one of the and one of the nodes. The two nodes are distinct. So the two SU2s are really behaving differently within the group. So you've got these two spaces, which are similar, but not the same. And the U1 cross U1 is that one. So all of these ones have co-joint orbits. There's a nice one, which is the U2 minus. This one, which is the U2 minus one. The U2 minus was this one. And I think I've got it right on it with regard to the nodes. Well, that's a convention, I suppose. This one has a CP2 bundle over CP2 bundle over Q5. That may well be the quaternion you were talking about, because there's an S4 sitting around here as well. Well, um, there's a CP2 bundle over, but it's the other one, I believe, the other version of the quaternion. They're both isomorphic to that quaternion. This CP2 is an is in, it's a CP2 bundle over S6. And again, by going exactly through the same construction, playing with Laplacians, the two Laplacians to play with here are Are because let me just go back. Taking the seven-dimensional representation, you see that it has the one and there's another natural representation, which is the adjoint of SO7 and the symmetric tensor product of SO7. That this one, I believe, is closely related to a CP. A CP6, probably. But the 14 here, and the 7 and the 14 is spin 7. The 27 is another, is the symmetric representation. So in 7, this is the adjoint representation. So you can play with the Laplacians of spin 7 and G2 to squash, dividing the general squashing in this case. Okay. Ah, so that was. Ah, so that was that part. I'm going more slowly than I had anticipated. I wanted to just go back and describe, tell you something which was fun with regard to generic CPNs. And this is to build those representations from the Fox space. And the advantage of this particular construction is that it gives you access to all of the equivariant vector bundles over generic CPN. CPN. So these are the general. If I take a family of ratio and annihilation operators, and I've labeled them by A alpha I, and they're the daggers of the A I alphas, and I runs from one to N, and alpha runs from one to N plus one, so there's a mismatch of one between them. You can see that the general You can see that the generators of SON are these objects with the alphas uncontracted, and these are the generators of UN with the I and J uncontracted. And there's a U1, which is this N hat, which is all of them contracted. So the structure of the Fock space here can be split under UN, UN plus one, and U1. One and one can decompose it rather nicely. But I want to go. Oops. It turns out that there's a nice object here, which we call pseudo-creation annihilation operators, anti-symmetrize the n of n plus one creation operators in the alpha indices. All of these. Indus is all of these creation operators and dilation operators commute among themselves, but you can anti-symmetrize them because they're different. So, this creates the invariant under the UN. It's an invariant under UN, and it is the anti-fundamental of UN plus one. So it's the analog of a single creation operator. These objects here don't satisfy. Objects here don't satisfy commutation relations, there's a generator of rotations that is coupled with them. However, if I restrict myself to a subspace where those are the creation operators on it, that subspace is orthogonal to the rest of the space. And in fact, they don't. And in fact, they don't take you out of that space, those pseudo-creation annihilation operators. That means that one can normalize them as ordinary creation and annihilation operators. They're composite operators in a sense, but we can normalize them as true creation and annihilation operators as long as you work in this subspace. They have an action on this subspace as well, but they don't act as creation annihilation operators in the usual sense in that one. Operators, in the usual sense, in that one. They involve additional rotations. This orthogonal part can be decomposed under representations of SUN, not the SUN plus one that I'm talking about. This decomposes into single copies of each representation, of this each symmetric representation of SUN. So taking these ones here, these representations. These ones here, these representations occur only once, one can nicely build operators that map between these different spaces. So this one has a creation operator on FL. It's just moving us to a new FL. It's moving it up in that space, goes to FL plus one. This one is taking us down. Is taking us down one, but it's exposing an index to us. So it's giving us access to something that transforms under UN, and UN is the holonomy group of CPN. So these three operators play a nice role. The construction works precisely because the contraction of A dagger with this A dagger with this is zero. And the reason for that is because you are anti-symmetrizing over these I indices and you've won too many. So you can't do it. It's zero. So this is identically zero. And that's a crucial aspect of the construction. Using that, one can act on these modules which have a mismatch. They have more of these areas on one side. More of these A's on one side than the other, more of our capital A's, and they behave like this. So you're picking out U1 bundles. I'm focusing on the U1 bundles here over CPN. And the reason for that is because I need them for Dirac operators. I'm just going to go quickly here. So the Laplacian on this space on This space on these operators here and is precisely this. And if you can check that it reproduces precisely the Casimir operator, the Laplacian on vector bundle, on U1 bundles over CPN. So this reproduces that in a nice way. And in general, one can go further. These operators, KI and KI dagger, well, they naturally arise. There's natural actions associated with them where they are Laplacians. And I've taken the representation R, Nabuzzi representation R, the dagger of Kionet is related to this one. And this, these ones, this is an invariant, or I could use the Or I could use the opposite one. They're two slightly different versions that exist in the non-commutative setting. And what I want to describe finally is the DIC operator on this space. And this was work with another Mexican student, Idris Huet, who was in Morelia briefly. So, this Dirac operator, well, the easiest construction of it is to take the standard Clifford algebra, the standard Dirac operator in terms of creation annihilation, Grassmann creation annihilation operators, or Fermionic creation annihilation operators. They anti-commute, except when they have the same index and they're joint to one another. The fuzzy spinner. The fuzzy spinner then is built up in the usual way from the Fox space of these fermionic ones. The Dirac operator that works and reproduces the spectrum of the Laplacian in this setting is very simple. It contracts the I bar with the I and the I with the I of these operators that we created there. And this gives you some fuzzy versions of the Clifford bundle. The Clifford bundle. Once you have that Clifford bundle, you can go back and try and reconstruct it, and you find other operators that are in that class. But this shows that there at least exists a Dirac operator, which is nice in the non-commuter setting that one can begin with. Okay. Pause. I'm okay. I wanted to switch gear a little bit to tell you where some of To tell you where some of these non-commutative structures enter in, and this goes back really to the original work of Hoppe, Hoppe and John Lessigno. John Lessigno's name is not on the papers, but he was Hoppe's advisor. Not John Lessigno, Goldstone, transmuting names, arbitrary name. So the Nambugoto action is just the area. Is just the area of the membrane, and they're often called these p. I'm interested in p is equal to two. So these are three-dimensional objects, two plus one. You can have an arbitrary metric in the ambient space and the pullback metric on this membrane. And this is just the area of that membrane in that ambient space. Both things will be important. things will be important. This metric here plays a role in getting a variety of models. So one can rewrite this a la polygraph by putting an alternative metric here on the thing, on this surface, and it gives an equivalent construction. If I do that, the key thing is to use H0I, this is a gauge. This is a gauge, then H00 is this determinant, and one rewrites the action in this fashion. So, and that construction works for actually for higher dimensional objects as well, where the determinant is the planning that plays a role. The key ingredient in two dimensions is that the determinant can be reorganized into a possum bracket, a two-dimensional. Poisson bracket, a two-dimensional determinant, and this flat 3S can be reorganized into a Poisson bracket. So we get this action. It's coupled with a constraint and these two constraints. If you use light-con coordinates, and this was the observation of Hopper, the light-con coordinates that made life a lot simpler, you can transform it and reduce it, the physics of it. Reduce it, the physics of it, of membranes. These are classical membranes now, relativistic classical membranes can be reduced to a Hamiltonian which has this possible bracket, which satisfy a particular constraint. So that's classical physics of membranes, just the inlight coordinates. No, happened here. Of course, the obvious thing to do for us. Of course, the obvious thing to do for us is to quantize it, to turn it into a quantize it and quantize it in the two senses that are used here. To form the Poisson brackets into a commutator and turn the momenta into derivatives on the ambient space. And one gets this Hamiltonian, which it is coupled with a Gauss law constraint that says that all Law constraint that says that only singlets of the Xn as matrices are allowed. That is replacing the area-preserving diffeomorphisms of the commutative case. If I took, I just described, this is the version you get by going to a flat space. If you are familiar with it, you might recognize that this object. That this object looks awfully like Yang-Mills theory. And in fact, this is our dimensional reduction of standard Yang-Mills on a Taurus down to one dimension. So this is a dimensional reduction of standard Yang mills, and the Gauss law comes along for free. So these membranes are equivalent to Yang-Mills theory is dimensionally reduced. To Yang-Mills theories dimensionally reduced. These quantized deformed non-commuted versions are equivalent to those objects. An important model in this setting is the BMN model. The BMN model is taking one of these membranes and propagating an 11-dimensional space. If I set these parameters to zero, this parameter. To zero, this parameter, these massive parameters to zero, then it is probably in flat 11-dimensional space. And it is a dimensional reduction in that case of n equals four, or n equals one Yang-mill, supersymmetric Yang-bills in 10 dimensions. So these, the supersymmetric versions have a similar property. And this version here is a membrane propagating on a PP wave background. PP wave background and it also is related to n equals four supersymmetric Yang bills contracted not now on S on a torus but on an S tree. There are lower dimensional versions of these which are actually much simpler but this particular one is meant to describe M-theory. So it has a special interest, but my interest is really in the But my interest is really in the physics of these membranes. These ones are quantum mechanical models, so we can put them on a computer. I should have observed something back before I did that. This object here, if you minimize this object here, you see that the solutions which give zero here are exactly fuzzy spheres. So fuzzy spheres that play a natural role. Play a natural role in the ground state here of this model. So, one would like to see how they emerge. So, I'm going to go very quickly and show you the last couple of slides. One can see by just putting it on a computer, including the fermions, the supersymmetric version, doing a lot of additional work on it, just to massage it so that it runs smoothly, getting rid of the Getting rid of the first fermions, and one can simulate it and cool it down. As one cools the system down, this is putting it in a thermal bath. And the conjectures that put it in a thermal bath is meant to have a dual description in terms of 11-dimensional supergravity in terms of a black hole background. And the parking temperature should be matched with this. That's a conjecture. There's evidence for it, but. There's evidence for it, but it's still at not understood stage. If I look at what actually happens here, you can see there are fluctuations. This is the trivial state. And these are small little fuzzy spheres. So you've got fuzzy spheres that fluctuate in and out of existence. These are higher dimensional. As you go further out, the radius is... As you go further out, the radius is larger. So they're higher-dimensional representations of the fuzzy sphere. So that's what happens here. So one can invent a little model to study what happens, focusing in on that, on the essence of that term and putting a little bias on it in that it's no longer now a complete square so that you see there's a fuzzy sphere in it. One can put that mass term back, but this model is more natural. This model is more natural. In if you take that analog, if you take the membrane at two plus one-dimensional membrane propagating in four dimensions, you get this model sitting in there. So this is, it has a very similar structure. This has a phase transition where the fuzzy sphere undergoes, or those fuzzy spheres fluctuate out of existence and into existence. So you can track that fuzzy sphere. It exists at low temperature. It exists at low temperature and it disappears at high temperature. This state is no longer stable at high temperature. There's a phase transition which we studied years ago. One can understand it. It's in terms of this beta. It's at this value. It's a very one-sided transition. And this seems very characteristic of lots of these geometrical models which undergo phase transition. Models which undergo phase transition, they tend to be one-sided, that they are stable in one side, and then they collapse into a purely matrix-like object. And when they collapse into that matrix-like object, it's one tend to fluctuate easily back into it. So, they have very large fluctuations before they collapse. So, thank you for your attention. We are good in time, thank you. Okay, so again, a few minutes.   Yes, so so yes, I was wondering because you presented different fuzzy spaces and the fuzzy sphere associated to membranes, and then you were discussing the fuzzy tree sphere that you were connected to M-theory, the sense that The three-form flux of M-theory is giving rise to such membranes that are fuzzy three spheres. Or the tree form flux, yes. Yes, yes, yes. So, so in empty  Okay. And then I was wondering, I mean, yesterday we heard Tanasi speaking of the fasion, and you have a different approach to a tree sphere. I mean, the tree sphere just not occurring the natural sense here, I would say. One has to borrow and do it in. One has to far and do it in a slightly different way. I didn't describe our approach to the tree sphere, but you have to focus. You were discussing the two, the four? You mentioned the three sphere. Yes, you mentioned the three, but it doesn't quite work the way one thinks. One can see it from the four sphere by focusing in on a particular multiplex of the angular momentum of the four sphere. Yes, one can get it that way. One can do it, one can get it that way, which is it's an it's it's putting an additional potential in that makes the minimum of the uh of the action around one particular one. And I have never tried to write a Dirac operation back, yes. But yeah, so thank you. More questions from the room? From Zoom, from Zoom? Yes, I have one question. You mentioned, can you hear me? Yes, yes, I hear you. Okay, right. So you mentioned there is phase transition in the last part of your talk. Yes. So I'm wondering how is it observed? Is there a proof or is it a numerical check? There's both. I see. Of course, one can one can go back. There are curves in here which you can see. Those ones that are obtained by analytical means, they're not, they seem to be to follow the transition incredibly well, but they're only there should only be. There are only there should only be approximations, and those are analytical approximations, and they're using effective potential ideas to track the transition. Close to your mean field suggestion that you were by mean field theory, okay. Yes, that seems to work incredibly well there. Great for tracking these transitions. Yeah, okay, yeah, that's uh okay, thank you, yeah, thanks. And the rest is numerical, but Iman. Put him on a computer and just let it run. Sure, yeah, okay, very good. Yeah, if there are no more urgent questions, so we stop here because we are short on time. So thanks to the speaker again.
