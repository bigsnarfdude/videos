Um I think I'm not the one. I think we can save this one. Okay, our last speaker today is Dene Jimenez-Peto, who is going to speak about modelling the actuation of equipoleaster and kirigani in print with political defects. With political disease. Thank you, thank you for having me. And the opportunity to present this work, this work that it's not done only by me, but by me along with collaborators, I will be achieving all of this by myself. So I finally have time to give the whole story and to give proper credit to each part of the project. So first, let's talk about Nico Bristol. About liquid crystal astomers, they possess the characteristic elasticity of rubbery materials along with the orientational order observed in liquid crystals. And what occurs is that you have a liquid crystal molecules or messages attached to a polymer network. Those messages can be attached on the side of the polymer network. So, this is the case of side chain equiprystal elusters. And of course, a proslane can be side-off. Prosthlin can be side-on or end-on, whether it is on the long axis of the molecule or the short axis of the liquid crystal molecule. Or we can also have link-chain liquid crystal elastomers in which the messages happen to be part of the older chain. So they actually have also the orientational order observed in nematic liquid crystals because of this. Enematic liquid crystals because of this code cross-link between my messages and my co-nerve network. And that is beautiful because liquid crystals, they respond to external stimuli. And in this case, when we have external stimuli applied to liquid crystal astomers, they also have very nice stimulus response. When we have uniform director by constructor, this is just a contraction and elongation of the sample, right? Right, but when we have more interesting director configurations, then we can have more complex activation. Here we have a beautiful, beautiful simulation of a polymer material, polymer network material that is being manumulated by the site. And then there is some self-shadowing effect that actually makes it move forward. This is where by some. Forward. This is worked by broader sellingers and co-workers. Also, when you have a twist between top and bottom, and here we have liquid crystal elastomers that respond to light, we can have a change in the helical pitch of this beautiful river, chiral river. So, what's going on? What occurs is that when my What occurs is that when my liquid crystal molecules are at the isotropic phase, and in the isotropic phase, we have disorder, okay, and then my polymer network is disordered. There is not a specific preferral orientation here, right? We have a sphere, well, a circle, so the 2D view of what's happening in 3D, right? However, when we are in the pneumatic phase, we're going to have ordering microcrystal molecules. That's going to give me an elongation of the polymer network along the Of the polymet network along the director, and because my samples actually they have in a very sweet spot, which is with cross-linking, but they are not gels, which means they conserve volume. Then, this elongation along N comes with contractions in all directions perpendicular to m. So, when we want to have this. So, when we want to have this complex out-of-plane actuation, what we do, we create a non-uniform director microstructure. We can have, you know, on the top substrate a planar liquid crystal orientation and on the bottom a vertical orientation. And we can engineer our liquid crystal director to actuate as a function of temperature, illumination, of changes in our chemical environment. So, under this. So, under this external stimulus, the top part wants to extend and the bottom ones wants to contract. And as a result, then we have a nice overall bin. And how do we use this non-uniform director microstructure? Well, normally in the liquid crystal display community, there's some lessons from it. So, we can have planner anchoring, we can make a sandwich of two different sauces, like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Uh, peanut butter and jelly sandwich, right? So, in here, you have planar anchoring, here you have vertical anchoring, you sandwich together, and then in the middle you have display director. And if you want to have a twist, what you do, you have planar anchoring in one direction on the top, planar anchoring, you know, in another direction, a 90-degree twist between the two, and then when you assemble them, you get a twist director. This is the side view, and this is the top view. And this is the top view of the director microstructure. So, overall, in order to have complex saturation, we play with pattern substrates, anchoring, and having a chiral dopant. Of course, if you have a twist, you need to have a chiral dopant in order to break the symmetry, right? Whether you need to twist the helix, it's going to be right-handed or left-handed. That's going to create a non-uniform director. When the material is cross-linked, then you're going to print. Is cross-linked, then you're imprinting that order, this liquid crystalline order and that liquid crystal microstructure in the polymet network at cross-linking. And then, as a result, under external stimulus, we have nice, beautiful, complex, out-of-plane activation. So, I feel like I'm running about. So, let's talk about how this non-uniform director can be. Uniform director can be. You can have a variation along one direction, which is the thickness, right? You can have variation across two directions, which is the length and the width. And that is the case when you have an acyneuton plus one defect here and a radial plus one defect here. So that's going to give us cones and anti-cones. And this is a realization by Dehan et al. This is a finite element simulation of those specific. Simulation of those specific activations, like cone, plane, and something like a saddle. And also, you can have variations in two directions, which would be the length and the thickness, which happens to be the case of an accordion actuator. In here, this is the top view of my actuator, right? It has a twist. Always my twist is left-handed. What is happening here is that the Is that the director on the top? It's going a 90-degree rotation between this and this. So each of these stripes have a director that is vertical, horizontal, vertical, horizontal, as well as in the bottom. As a result, you get a stripe that goes from 0 to 90, from 90 to 0, 0 to 90, 90 to 0, and so on and so in the... And so and so in the twist. And of course, when this dice actuates, it wants to bend, these stripe is going to bend upward, the only one downward, and gives you something like an accordion, accordion shape. So how do we simulate this beautiful behavior? I'm a computational material scientist, so I don't. Real scientists, so I don't synthesize samples, but I do have to communicate with experimentalists to understand what is the regime in which they are working and how thin my film has to be in order to accurately reproduce their results. We do finite element elastodynamics developed by Ron Salinger and this is how the developer of this finite element elastodynamic code looks like. Looks like. We have a three-dimensional sample that is secretized in an entrostical structured tetrahedral mesh. And of course, I mean, here we have a nice picture of my tetrahedron. We have our nodes and the vertices of the tetrahedron. And we have our tetrahedron element, which is going when we're going to have contraction and elevation. Our displacement vectors, U, B and W, it's just a displacement in X, Y and C directions. X, Y, and Z directions. Now, inside the tetrahedral, the distortion follows the linear mapping functions that we have here. Okay, so we can have the displacement of the four vertices given these equations that we have here. And of course, if you notice, this matrix is the same as this matrix, as this matrix, this matrix A, which we are actually going to invert, okay, to find the To find the coefficients for my mapping functions, coefficients a1, a2, a3, a4, b1, b2, b3, b4, and c1, c2, c3, c4. Once we have our linear mapping coefficients, then we can calculate the Green-Lagrange non-linear string tensor with this beautiful set of equations. I have to say, I normally, when I give this talk, I don't show all the details of it. Talk: I don't show all the details of these equations, but I said if I'm gonna have the time, let's show the messy equations and give proper credit to the person that developed the model, which is Robbie, okay? So, this is my Green-Lagrange non-linear string tensor in terms of my mapping coefficients that we have here. And now, this is the slide that I normally show when I talk about finite element simulations. We have the free energy inside each tetrahedron following. Each tetrahedron following here. These first two terms are just pure elasticity, okay, just like rubber. And here we have our Lame coefficients, elastic properties of the material. And then in this third term, we have the coupling constant alpha that couples with strain and the nematic order. Here we have an immeaxial order parameter tensor, Q0. Of course, my bring a random. My Bring Lagrange non-linear span tensor, more compact way. And in order for me to emulate activation, what I do is I change S, my pneumatic order parameter, my scalar pneumatic order parameter. Under external stimulus, that S is going to change, and as a result, we are going to change the free energy of my system, and then we have. And then we have to allow my system to reach that new equilibrium of free energy, right? Where pretty much when we have external stimulus, we are changing the shape of my free energy density, and my system needs to find equilibrium again. This and that we have here happens to be the director of vibration and cross-linking. So those patterns, you know, the radial defect, the asymmetral defect, or the twist, the alternate stripes we twist. twist the alternating stripes of twist happen to be embedded in here in this QYJ tensor that we have here. Finally, elastodynamics. I don't do statics, even though statics I have nothing against people that do statics, but I actually do elastodynamics. My nodes move E and F equals MA, which is my favorite differential equation. I tell that to my undergrad students every time. Time. And as a result, we get my force calculated by minus the derivative of the free energy with respect to position. And of course, I have to show here my conservative forces, my ugly equations that I never show, but I said, yes, here we have my conservative forces in X, that's what we get. In Y, that's what we get. And in Z, that's what we get. So, in addition to So, in addition to that, here we have a dissipative force, node conservative, which is proportional to the node velocity momentum in order to allow my system to reach equilibrium state. And I also want to damp any short oscillations that we could have. So, this beautiful methodology is what allows us to have these beautiful simulations. Each of these pictures here are. Each of these pictures here are the result of applying the finite element elastodynamics, modeling these specific director microstructures. Any questions? Yeah. Please, I'm sorry, this is because I don't know much, but could you please comment on the non-linearity? Because you have a non-linear stress tensor. Why is it why do you want it to be non-linear? Yes, because I want to be able to show large deformations. Large deformations. If you focus just on the linear part, then you cannot form large deformations. And where is the specific choice of nonlinearity coming from? That is quadratic, right? Yes, the non-linear part of your non-linear strengthens. Derivation for that? Yes, but I mean that's, yeah, that is beyond. I say beyond the scope, and I think the Britain La-Dranchlin are successful. I'm sorry, I'm asking because I don't know anything. This is why I doubt a bit. Thank you very much. No, don't worry. I feel like I don't know. That's exactly what I felt in each of the talks that I listened here. I felt like that and I felt that I learned something new. So that's why I'm so excited at the end of this day. But yes, this is well known in the literature. Robbing, however, she was a pioneer in a way that she... Was a pioneer in the way that she created a final analomy simulation using this Green Lagrange non-linear strain cancer. It is common to only focus on the linear part and then add some extra terms in order to, you know, go a step forward away from linearity. She is actually, she actually said, okay, let's get the full strength tensor, let's calculate the derivatives, this two-shaped rule, let's get these messy equations, okay, let's put everything together. Let's put everything together, which is the strength why this model can reproduce so beautiful experimental results. Okay. So here we have our, you know, three different ways in which my director can vary in this specific slide. But then you can also vary it in three directions, okay? Which is length, width, and thickness. This is beautiful work. This is beautiful work that I did in collaboration with Hubera Haroni. He is now at Wiseman Institute of Physics. At the time, he was at UPenn and he designed for me a very nice custom-made director microstructure towards a target shape. He solved the inverse problem. You can imagine any specific geometry, target actuation, and then gives the director. Actuation and then gives the director configuration for it. So he gave me this nice actuator, this nice design to get a motor sport, but Musvalium, which is my favorite car, by the way, Musvali below. And in here, the director configuration has two components. One is the intrinsic curvature, which is the in-plane variation of n that we can see here, and then there is an extrinsic curvature, which is a small twist along. Which is a small twist along thickness, along the thickness of the sample. And of course, more details in this methodology can be found in his PRL article from 2014. So I want Ayana, I got his design, what the colours here is the angle, the polar angle with respect to the positive X axis. And this is the director Poffit. This is the director configuration. This is analytical design. And I went and tried to do a mapping of this design into an unstructural tetrahedral mesh. And I was very happy to see this nice agreement between the two. And this is actually the output of my finite element simulation in my tetrahedral match. You can see I start to look like a Wolf's bag. However, the fine details of the curvature. Lethal so in order here, this fine lethal that we have here, and that we have here, are somehow averaged out. And this is due to the effect of the sample thickness, which is a limitation of pretty much this analysis that I can perform to now. Generating meshes that have enough elements along the sample thickness so we can have a smooth solution to the strain along the sample thickness. Solution to the strain along the sample thickness, sorry, and that are within the regime of thin films. That is a very challenging aspect of this work. So this is the best I could do at the time. I'm quite sure. I mean, try it again, to try to see with different meshing software which we can achieve. Which we can achieve something thinner, yeah, finer and with enough elements along the sample thickness. Then, my other approach was to increase the stimulus response to see if we could overcome that bending energy. And we found first this initial deformation to a sombrero shape, which has been seen. Which has been seen in nickel crystal astomers that have you know a big thickness, it's an effect of the banding energy. Then eventually that sombrero shape pops up. Yeah, now we have something that is starting to look like a Volkswagen, but not really the the detailed design that he was able to to give me. So this is pretty much what's popping with the Mulfwagen. Much was popping with the Mulzwag and Beetle design. A beautiful thing from here is that, inspired by this design, I went and created a protocol to get some arbitrary curve into my meshing software, right? And then create meshes with any specific shape that I got. Before, when I was showing, you know, the combs, the anti-combs, sort of the ribbons. Sort of the ribbons, they were, you know, rectangles, you know, circles, right? Nothing quite sophisticated. And this was what allowed me to work on topological liquid last word kirigami. So, kirigami is the beautiful Japanese art of cutting and folding paper, okay? And this was work that was done in collaboration with Chin Won Yan and Sheng Wo Y. Collaboration with Qing Wenyan and Sheng Wu-Ten, now at the University of Science and Technology of China. And what it is, they have stimulus responsible LC samples with custom-made cuts and outlines. They actually have a laser cut, Liko-Crystal Astomer, Kirigani. And they actually had a very rich variety of results. They tried a plus outline. Outline. This I like to call it a fan. It looks to me to be like a fan. A beautiful butterfly actuation that tries some authentic inspired shapes, rings, snowflakes, squares, and this is a very nice long actuator that exhibits locomotion. So this is the set of steps that I did. Set of steps that I did. I get the outline design from them, beautiful, you know, GPEC. I redraw the outline as a set of dots. I obtain the dot coordinates with image analysis software, USG. And then those coordinates get processed into the CAT software, SALUMEC, similarly to what I did with my motorsport actuation. Sport actuation. What is my director microstructure here? Well, N is varying in three directions again, in blend width and thickness. On the top, we have a radial plus one defect. That's my topological part. On the bottom, we have homeotropic anchoring, vertical anchoring. So we actually have a splay along the sample thickness. We are again doing our little. Thickness. We are again doing our peanut butter and jelly sandwich here, but with a topological plus one defect on top. So here we have the experiment by Huang Shang. That is how the student that synthesized those samples looked like. I don't synthesize anything again, that's why I like to give credit to the people that actually do this beautiful work. And this is a finite element. And this is the finite element simulation for the actuator. So they have a very nice agreement. In here, this is actuation driven by light. So we wanted to have some analysis of what makes this topological crystallastomer actuators interesting. And you can see here a map of the potential. map of the potential energy versus time and also we have this nice polar map of the potential energy. We can see the accumulation of high potential energy at the defect near the defect core. And of course the system wants to minimize its potential energy, right? So as a result the rest of my sample actuates to decrease the overall potential energy of the system. We also tried a plus one left-handed spiral defect. And in this case, we have a chiral twist for each of our arms. Very nice agreement between the experiment and the simulation. In here, if we repeat the experiment. Repeat the experiment. Actually, it's repeating again. We can actually see a more dramatic bending of this arm. And of course, I would be able to reproduce that if I just increase the number here, the stress of the stimulus response, which is the product of my Copland constant alpha and my change in my pneumatic order parameter S. Then we also. Then we also had a minus, plus, a plus, a half defect with dancing arms, in which if we add to eight, if we increase, we increase my pneumatic order, one of the arms is going to bend left-handed. It's going to have a left-handed twist, another one, a right-handed twist. This is going to be having a Is going to be having a bend, and this is also going to be having a small bending across the short axis of my sample. So I like to think about these specific simulations as a flamenco dancer. You go, you shine the light, right? And then the dancer opens the art up, right? You can shine the light with the post one, period. Here it is with the spiral defect. Then you can have some specific pirality and the motion of the arms in this direction or in this other direction. Or you can have an even more complicated actuation as what we have here, in which we have combination of left-handed, right-handed, and then if I had four arms, maybe I would be able to emulate. Maybe I'll be able to emulate the bend, this bend and this bend that we have here. So that was a story about dancing arms with the good crystal astomer, Kiri Gan. What actually made me fall in love with this project was this actuator, a butterfly actuator. When Cheng Hui showed me the Cheng Wei showed me the experimental results. I said, This is what I'm going to spend in my summer, pretty much. And this actuator is again based on a plus one radial defect, which is superimposed the outline of a butterfly, a very cartoonish butterfly, by the way. And we have a splay across the sample thickness. And of course, under stimulus, external stimulus, my butterfly raises its wings. Butterfly raises its wings or boards. This is the finite element simulation and this is the experimental realization. However, because these materials are elastic, this actuation is fully reversible, which means when you remove the external stimulus, the border. Stimulus, the butterfly goes back to its initial flat state, which means by just you know having light on, you can have upper motion, light off, go back, up, down, and this simulates the fluttering of a butterfly. Such a beautiful and you know, eye-catching simulation. So, we were very, very excited. We were very, very excited. Alice was very excited about this. There is something quite nice about this one. This was the first try. The simulation worked at the first try. That doesn't happen. It doesn't. But it happened in here. So, you know, sometimes, sometimes you get what you want. Just a little sometimes. I'm not saying it's gonna, it's gonna happen again. I don't know, but. Could happen again, I don't know, but it happened once. Again, we also did an analysis of the potential energy within the sample, right? And here we see when we have external stimulus, right? We have an increase of potential energy right on the defect core, right, right at the defect vicinity. I'm not going to call it the core, but at the defect vicinity. And of course, the sample is. Of course, the sample is going to, the oral sample is going to distort to lower the overall potential energy of my system. Once we remove the stimulus, then that energy gets that specific strain gets released, and then my sample goes back to its original state, relaxes back to its original state. Collation is running quite slow. Wonder if I can faster. There we are. That is, you know, the relaxation back to the flat state when this stimulus was removed. Beyond this, they also tried out technique-inspired. Also, tried out static-inspired samples. Again, a plus one radial defect display across the sample thickness. The only thing that is changing here is the geometry of the sample. And what we see here is the formation of an aperture, okay? And that aperture, of course, closes again when the stimulus gets removed. This is my finite element simulation, and now does this have? Oh, no, this does not have the video. Well, sorry about that. I thought that this was the video showing the upper post. But if you go into the supplementary information of this paper, you can see, you can see the beautiful experimental video in which light gets on and it's open, and when it's removed, then you have. When it's removed, then you have a return to the original state. Another algebraic-inspired geometry is this one. Again, same configuration, just change geometry. This happens to be the finite element simulation, and this is the experimental result. This is a very beautiful and something that is still intriguing me. There is nothing that That changes, that breaks the symmetry in here. We have the director microstructure, you know, it's sixfold, one, two, three, yes, sixfold. I mean, the geometry is six-fold, we have a nice radial defect. I still don't understand why. Why this specific actuator prefers. Actuator prefers to bend across this axis over along this axis, over this axis, or this other axis. I don't think there is anything in this specific design that will do that, but we saw it both in the experiment and in the simulation. There is a CD3 axis. Oh no, it's completely invalid by. Yes, I mean. This symmetry is completely bent by rotating. Yes, this symmetry is the same as this one, it's the same as this one. There is nothing that will tell, hey, bent through here. But for some reason, we saw it both in the simulation and in the experiment. And that's still something that I have to give more thought and try to understand. Yes? But if there is no symmetry, how can you tell that it's the same approach the same way? Experiment and simulation. Experimental simulation. But when I repeat the simulation, there is nothing that will... Okay, I see your point. Yes, I see your point, but... For some reason, it is. What I have here is my X, Y. It is. What I have here is my x, y, my x, y, and z, okay? They came place in there. And then this is the view that they gave me. So, yeah, you're right. I could just go and maybe rotate this in part of you and say, hey, this is the English one, right? And they could also say, And they could also say, okay, we're going to put the camera like this. However, I saw this result, then I ran the simulation, and it happened to be exactly the same. The square boundary of a theory figure on the left, the fourth folding. Is that just for presentation purposes? Yes, that's just for presentation. So initially, this was as, you know, a square thing, right? And then the laser cut shape. And then they give me this specific geometry that I use to make my mesh. So they have exactly the same all the specific points. Yes? Sorry, but I'm just wondering, the director on top, that is discretized, right? Yes, there is some. Discretized on a square grid. Is it right? Yes, that could be. I mean, the vertical axis, it's the only axis of symmetry that's a line with. Axis of symmetry that's a line with a direction of the grid in which the director is discretized. Is that right? Okay. That could be something. However, when I go and I code this, I don't really use this view, this specific mapping of the liquid crystal director. I do, I do parametrize, you know, angle, cosine, sine sine of the angle, x-and-a-the column. So in that case, So, in that case, it's given by the discretization of my mesh. The mesh. Exactly. And for them, it's given by the discretization of the pattern of the substrates, okay, that they can do. So, I know, yeah, it's intriguing. So, I'm enjoying this because I actually have no idea why this is working in this specific way, but it is. But it happens. Okay? So, if you guys have more ideas along the conference, please tell me. Reach out with Stockless Brainstorm because I have this bugging in the back of my head. Any other questions? Yes. So for the plush one defects, this was for a mobile phone. Are they converging type? Are they the diverging type of plush one defects? Yeah. The radio? The radial? Yeah, yeah. What do you mean, the conversion? Because it in the ball, you can have coming from the flat and then can I see one of the display? Let me see. This one. Is it going like this way or like going that way? Oh yeah, I mean, okay. Oh, yeah, I mean, okay. So you mean going this way or going this way? Yes, yes, yes. So you need to have, okay. Yes. So there is nothing, nothing that will break the symmetry for whether they go this way or the other way. Okay, so this case was me trying to be pedagogically pedagogic and showing, okay, we have a splay, it's not just a defect, right? We have some variation. A defect, right? We have some variation along the sample thickness to provide that information. Yes, you could have it in the other direction. And actually, they do see on their fluorescent microscope, they do see different domains. Okay? Showing the, you know, that could be this way or the other way. However, however, when they see the actuation, the actuation is mostly driven by the Conditions by the boundary conditions, the fact that you have planar here and vertical here. Why is that? I think that it comes from the fabrication technique. All of these materials were done with a technique they developed, the massless photo patterning, in which they have a stimulus-responsive, light-responsive liquid materials in the bulk, but they also. Good-resome materials in the bulk, but they also have like responsive components in the boundary in order to create the altern conditions, to create the patterns. And I think that's my hypothesis, that that is why the boundaries are dominating and the effect of the different domains does not affect that much the actuation. Does that make sense? Yeah, thank you. Uh any other questions? Any other questions? Let's keep going. Okay, so this is autistic, auto-sective one. Yes, authentic one. Okay, so I wanted to understand this and I wanted this free energy mapping, this potential energy mapping. Initially, we see a regional high free energy here, it looks like a circle, right? It looks like a circle right at the beginning. Try to get it down. In here, quite, you know, there is nothing breaking the symmetry. It looks like a circle right at the beginning. Then eventually you get some triangle shape around here, circle, somehow a triangular shape, and then eventually, you know, it gives me. Gives me. Yes. What do the colors stand for? Yes, the colors stand for the free energy, regions of high free energy, or high potential energy. I have the potential energy each detractor, right? And then from here, sorry, I have to go back to my model. So many slides. Yes, so these are what we're seeing here is that this is what the colors represent: high free energy. So, because we wanted to see regions of high strain, right, then we have the nonlinear strain tensor. And now that we have the nonlinear strain tensor, we said, okay, let's try to map the regions of high strain by mapping the free energy or the potential energy of our system and see where we have high strain regions and then high free energy, high potential energy. Does that make sense? So that is my view. Originally we have some circular shape, eventually it gives me something like a triangle and then it gives me something along the, you know, with twofold symmetry within the sample. So still something for me to For me to try to understand. So, up to now, we talked all about display, okay? But they also did work on twist. So, when you can go and superimpose two defects, and a twist, two plus one defects, and a twist along the sample thickness, you have a radial defect on top, an astronomical defect on the bottom. This was originally studied by MOOC. Study by Moot Warner Brewer 2012. This is how the finite elements relation of that looks like. Beyond that, there was also previous work on defects in the XY plane and a twist along the Z axis, whereby Fuji, Ware, and Taylor, Tim White. So Taylor Wade Ware and Tim White were working on this. We're working on this, also creating an origami box. And this kirigami approach, we want and create stripes that go in the assimutal direction. Okay, so this is how my top director microstructure looks like. This is my bottom director microstructure. Microstructure. So, overall, when you combine those two, you're going to have a twist across sample thickness, and each of the stripes are going to go radial to azimutal, azimutal to radial, radial to azimuthal, azimutal to radial, with a 90-degree twist. Similar to the accordion, but you know, folded in a circle. And they were able to, you know, show this circular accordion. Circular accordion actuator. This is our simulation and our experimental results. Only 15 minutes. 10 minutes, I would say. 10 minutes. Here, they also tried a kirigami snowflake. Okay, six-fold symmetry, placed across the sample thickness, and of course, here we have the center popping up. The center popping up, and this looks a bit like some kind of spider. Here we have some arms that are curling. I was not very happy with this actuation because here you can see a flattening is right at the beach, it looks very flat. And my simulation is not showing this increased curvature, you know, at least that they can see in the experiment. That they can see in the experiment. Again, for me, it's the effect of the sample thickness that is again averaging out. And you know, the bending energy I have to overcome in order to create this fluctuation. This is a much thinner sample than what I can achieve with my finite element meshing technique as it is right now. They went and they had a 2D array of defects. 2D radial defects, okay? So they put radial defects on top in each of the junctions here, and then acimutal in the bottom. And here we have some kind of hinges that go horizontal and vertical, horizontal on top, vertical on on bottom, if we are looking at this one. If we are looking at this one and they change, this will be vertical on top if we're looking at this one, and horizontal on the bottom if we're looking at this one. Again, twist across the sample thickness, and this is the experiment and my finite element simulation. Why I was always able to capture only one square out of the network, the net that we have here, because of again sim Again, simory limitations, okay? And how many nodes can I have, and how many tetrahedrons can I have when I have a plain sample and you know a finite element code? This is a view of the experiment at top view. You can see they shine light when they remove it. It relaxes back to its flat state. There, there, there. So, I think this is very nice because you can have somehow an actuated, another way of having an actuated aperture when you shine light. And not just that, they also create an actuator that forms. That forms a locomotion, that exhibits locomotion. When you have the radial side up and you shine light, of course you have to shine light from here to here. You have to break the symmetry and the way you're shining light in order to have locomotion. But in this case, when they shine light in this specific configuration, they can have your sample walking forward. Work and then they flip it. Okay, now the top is the one that has the astuto defects, and the bottom is the one that has the radial. And then, when they shine the lights in the different, in exactly the same way, then you can have a you know locomotion towards a 90-degree angle with respect to the number. Okay? So that was also a very beautiful. Also, a very beautiful result that unfortunately I didn't have the time to model. I didn't have the time to model the locomotion. I was only able to model the side view of these peaks and valleys for this little wormy actuator. So, overall, summary. I hope I was able to convince you and to show you the rich variety of topological Of topological mercurigami, power defects, and the combination of topological defects and nicocrystallastomercurigami can create a rich variety of activation. We had dancing arms, biomimetic floating butterfly, we have some oxygen spiral extruptors, and finally they were able to achieve locomotion. So, finally, acknowledgements, Robin Selinger.

Yes, that was very nice. How do you model the dynamics? Because basically the finite elements models use statics. And so I guess we have two questions. One is, you know, how important is the discussion? What is the language now of the system? Because one thing that I find a little bit puzzling is. Little bit puzzling is that you're getting reversibility, for example, of the butterfly wings without getting extra source energy. So how does this work? Yes. So for the dynamics, let me just go to the what is the the average greatest number of systems? Oh. Oh, I mean for the Raymond's number I don't think I have that number on the on the side of my head. Normally when I think about Reynolds number I think about particle moving through a medium, right? Yes, a particle moving through a medium, right? So if you have pollen moving in air, you have low rate. Know in air, you have low Reynolds numbers. If you have a basketball moving in air, you have high Reynolds numbers. Okay, but then in here, what I have is a liquid crystal that is stretching a polymer network, and the polymet network moves around. I would think in terms of viscosity, viscosity come into play right here or out of my conservative force. Out of my conservative forces in here, when we have the dissipative force proportional to node velocity, right? In order to reach equilibrium, an equilibrium shape. So that is included in that equation? That was the magnitude of the dissipation that we could have, right? That is something that we picked to be. That we pick to be under damp, to be under damp, because we don't want to have a high dissipation so that my system will get stuck into some intermediate metastable state that doesn't happen to be the final equilibrium state. That is something. The Reynolds number would tell me that whether yes, the Reynolds numbers could tell me that. That would be the, you know, the change between, you know, the ratio between inertia. Ratio between inertia and viscosity. So that's, yes, that is an analysis that I haven't seen from that perspective, my results. And then in terms of what do we do with the dynamics, we have our free energy, right? When we get the force, I calculate it as minus the derivative of the free energy with respect to position. And then my notes move F equals MA, right? Which is why it's so important. It's so important to avoid getting stuck into a metastable state. If we were doing Monte Carlo, right, in order to, you know, sample my free energy and then reach equilibrium, I would know, hey, my Monte Carlo can, you know, there are ways of sampling that can reach me, take me to the equilibrium state. Because I'm doing dynamics and allowing my system to respond and to, you know, travel to my free energy minimum. It could get stuck in a metal stable state, depending on what's the shape of my free energy. The shape of my free energy when I have my stimulus, my external stimulus supply. Does that make sense? Okay, yes. Yes, okay. I just thanks. Okay. Yes. I have a question concerning your free entity. Apparently, there is no coupling with the creation of light, which is in coupling. Yes. How can you be sure that you are s simulating a a light coupling, a couple of light the time? Yes, the coupling between the polymerization comes in here. This is the alpha constant, the coupling strain, the coupling constant between the strain and the nematic colour. Yes, it's a scalar. It's a scalar. But the polarization of light in here, we are not really. in here we are not really we are not really having polarized light here we don't have maybe this is just we are this is playing light from a how do you say flashlight that they are putting in here okay in order to to create this this actuation okay so in that case I don't know why the polarization of light if light is not polarized then you need to take advantage of it To take imagination, the interaction between network, polymer network, and enhanced light takes place through the electric field, which is oscillating in the way. Yes, I mean, yes, I understand, but in that case, it will come from actually what is making the activation is the legal crystal message, not the polymer per se. So, in here, I am modeling polymer. I am modeling polymer in the most, how can I say, explicit, not implicit way in this case. I'm not really going into the fine levels of modeling the polymer shapes, right? The constants that tell me what the type of polymer I have are just my Lame coefficients, right? My elastic constants that I have there. And that's it. So, of course, there is some assumptions and approximations. Assumption and approximations. We don't go into the detail of how the polymers are responding to the external stimulus. We are modeling in detail how the pneumatic order is responding or is changing and creating this actuation due to this coupling between the strain tensor, non-linear strain tensor, and the pneumatic order parameter tensor. So I guess the answer. So, I guess the answer comes with the fact that we're working with a green-dimensional linear string tensor and the coupling constant. I think that would be the term in which I will focus in terms of what is the response or my polymer reacting to steroid steroids. So, of course, there is much more. The light's locally heating things. Huh? The light isn't heating things? It's not heating. No, not really. I mean, there is. Yes, that would be. I was not considering. Okay, when I modeled this, I was not considering any heating effects. Okay? For my. I'm trying to answer his question. Okay, good. Is the light. I mean, in the experiment in the, let's just say, Tarentium, that was heat. Terence without heat. Yes. This, I think, is a cutting with heat. Not with light. That's my only point. You are not. But you have a thermal effect that you are modeling. Not light-induced effect. The simulations, the experiments are actually with light responses. With light-responsive molecules. They have a model. Yes, you don't have the right model. We may not have the right model, but okay, so when I initially get this model together, we were modeling effect of temperature. Actually, when we were doing this, we were modeling effect of temperature. This one, and this one, and this one. We were all modeling effect of temperature. And how I was able to do a model validation. Was able to do a model validation is they gave me the elongation of an experimental sample, right? L with respect to the node L0, right? L over L0 versus temperature. Okay? That's what they gave me. And I went and I did exactly the same thing, bottle L over L0 versus S, okay? Versus S. Okay? Put them together and I was able to see how my S will relate to temperature. Exactly the same thing could be done, the same model validation could be done with light. They can go and tell me, okay, I have a uniaxial, you know, yes, a uniform director right here, right? I shine light at some intensity, I measure the, you know, the deformation, and then I will be able to match, you know. We will be able to match how S will affect, will change with intensity. I think that is something, some test that we could do, we could do to move forward and check that, you know, this is actually a good model.
