Oh, yeah, yeah, I assume that I would do it in the past. Hi, Alex. Hi. Hi. I'm going to address the start. Are you recording long? Yes.  In the afternoon, it's probably 40% chance of rain. Are you ready, Alex? Yeah, sure. Are you guys? Yes. Sorry. Okay, sorry. Please, I should speak permanently because for some. Should speak permanently because, for some reason, my Zoom doesn't pick up the first words of whatever I'm saying. Oh, we can hear you. Yeah, so we can hear you perfectly well. Yeah, okay, good, good. Okay, I'm ready whenever you are. So we're ready. You can go. We're ready, you can go. Okay, okay, then. Good morning, everyone. So, I'm sorry for this unusual format because, well, anyways, I'm just sick of the busy business lately. But thank you for the invitation to this conference. It's a big honor to give a talk here. It's a little bit difficult because usually I'm not speaking about the code. Well, about the code. So, usually I speak about mathematics, but okay, I will try to explain some code details here. Well, anyway, so here is the title. I'm going to speak about 800 conics, well, at most, actually, 800 conics on a smooth vertic surface. And to put this problem to a context, let me start with a few examples. So, the first example is not exactly about phonics, it's about lines, but Phonics, it's about lines, but the first example is very old, very classical, and I just love this example because it is so simple that you can explain it to high school students. So, let's consider a quartic. Oh, we are speaking about quartics in P3. So, in the projective space, we have four coordinates, four homogeneous coordinates. So, let's break them into two pairs and let's consider a quartic given by an equation like this. So, here, phi and psi are just two homogeneous polynomials. Just two homogeneous polynomials of degree four. And let's try to count the number of lines. Let's start with lines on this quartic. So first, here on this blue, on this blue XY line, we have four roots of phi, right? Phi is a polynomial of degree four, so it has four roots. On the green UV line, we have also four roots of psi. Also, four roots of psi. And then it's pretty much obvious that if you connect any pair of this, so any of p's to any of q's, I get one of these red lines. And this red line is entirely on the quartic. So in this way, we get 16 lines. Well, now the question is if that's all. Typically, it is, but now let's consider a spatial case when phi. A spatial case when phi in psi is actually the same polynomial. And if it is the same polynomial, then we can make this substitution where i is, well, i root of minus one. We can make this substitution. So here k can range from zero to three, zero, one to three. There are four values. Well, now we are thinking about lines in space. So a line is given by two linear equations. So these are the two equations. So these are the two equations. Well, if you make the substitution now, since phi is a homogeneous polynomial of degree four, so this common factor is taken out and raised to power four, we get one. So we get an identity. So this line is also actually not line, it's not one line, there are three four lines here, sorry. So k can range from zero to three. So these four lines are also in our quartic. Well, it looks like It looks like that's it, but in fact, we can get more lines because what we can do, we can apply a Maverick transformation. So, in one of the two coordinates, say UV, we can apply a Maverick transformation preserving the polynomial. And then for each such transformation, we get a new quadruple lines, and it can be shown that they're indeed new. So, they are different from everything else. So, in fact, we got In fact, we got a new quadruple. And then, depending on what this polynomial is, now if well, so again, so here the result. So, if phi and psi are essentially different, not Member's equivalent, then we have but 16 lines. So, just the original 16 lines, which are always there. If at the same polynomial, and if this polynomial is generic, we know everything about the Mirberus group and how it acts on. About the Members group and how it acts on quadruples of points. So, if this quadruple of roots is generic, then it has but four Members automorphisms. So, for each of them, we get four extra lines. So, altogether, we get 32. And then there are two spatial quadruples. So, one is somehow associated with Ferma. So, one of them has one spatial quadruple has eight automorphisms. So, we get 48 lines, and the champion has 12. The champion has 12 automorphisms. We get the so-called short quartic with 64 lines. Well, and 64 is in bold here. In fact, this example is very old. It's 1880 something. But then it took almost a century and a half to prove that 64 is the maximum. But 64 is the maximum. A smooth quartic had at most 64 lines. Well, now, looking at this example, you can ask. Now, looking at this example, you can ask lots of questions, but the answer to most of them will be no. So, for example, you can ask if the number of lines is always a multiple of 16. Of course, no. In fact, pretty much almost everything lower than 64 can be taken. There are lots of examples, but so this is well, a very old and very classical example. Now, let me switch to conics, and this is a new example, and this is kind of a bit more. A bit more involved. And here I use to full extent the theory of K-3 surfaces. So I don't construct an equation. An equation will appear at the end, but it's just a miracle that we know the equation, because normally we don't know equations of our examples. So let me remind you, I don't know if I should do this or not. So let me remind you that what the Galilei code is. So here is the formal definition, just linear binary. Just linear binary code of length 24 dimension 12, minimal distance 8. So, in plain English, it's something in the subspace of the 24-dimensional F2 vector space, subspace of half dimension, and each non-zero vector has at least eight non-zero coordinates. Well, now, so this is an F2 vector space, so instead of vectors, we can consider dial supports, meaning subsets of the sodium. Meaning subsets of the solar 24 element set, which are called code roots. Well, and this code is unique, by the way, up to permutation, and pretty much everything is known about it. Well, okay, so it's written here. So it's first of all, it's invariant and the complement. Of course, it contains the empty set and hence the whole set itself. It has 759 so-called octets, which are called words of size 8. Size 8 and 2576 dodecats we kept for the birds of side of size 12. And then, of course, complements of octets are also there, they are of size 16. Well, now why do we need this? We need this to construct another classical thing, which is the leach letters. So, what the leach letters is, again, formally it's the unique root free unimodular positive definite even letters of rank 24. In plain English, you can define it like this: so, you consider the usual Euclidean. Like this, so you consider the usual Euclidean lattice of rank 24. Well, you modify the product a little bit, divide everything by eight to get elements of vectors of square four at the end. And then you define the leech ledgers as the sub-ledges of this spanned by certain square four vectors. Not all of them, but certain of them. So these square four vectors are of one of the three forms. So either this, so here I use. Three forms. So, either this, so here I use conveyed notation. So, there is three in one position and one in the other 23 positions. And then there is a requirement that the upper signs must be chosen in the code word. So, that's why I need Galais code to define the rich letters. So, this is one class of vectors. Another one is this. There are eight twos, plus minus two, eight plus minus twos, and the rest is. Eight plus minus twos and the rest is zero, and of course, plus minus two must be in an octet, and the number of pluses must be even. And the third class is just 12, a pair of fours, plus minus fours, with no further restrictions. Well, so this is one of the infinitely many descriptions of the rich letters. Like, I don't know any symmetric description. This description, pretty much every description breaks the symmetry a lot. The symmetry a lot. So it looks like there are three classes of square four vectors, but it's an illusion. In fact, it's a very symmetric lattice. It's an orthogonal group acts transitively on square four vectors, which is not seen from what I said. Well, anyway, so this is the leash lattice, and now here is the example. So it's okay, this is actually the Okay, this is actually the example. So now let me try to explain what it is. I'm considering five very specific square four vectors in the rich letters. So here I consider the first nine positions and I assume that all this, okay, with the exception of one of them, with the exception of three, this is an octet. Well, an octet of the Galai code. Well, so I consider five very specific factors and then Specific vectors. And then I define a conic to be just a square for vector in the rich lattice with this condition. So it's conic as L. So it must, so it's orthogonal to the last three and in the second, the first two like this. Or in plain English, so in this rank five latest, you consider the orthogonal complement of H. And then so L must be orthogonal to this orthogonal complement, and then it must in the same. Complement and then it must intersect h at well. It is since we have a description of all square four vectors, it is very easy to count. I mean, to see all this else, so they are shown here in the last four lines. And it's easy to count them. And the number is 800. Well, and this 800 is actually well the number of conics. So here is the theorem. Well, the theorem stated those 800 conics in fact are conics. But to explain how they are conic, so I have to consider the sub-letters spent by all those conics. I modify the form here. So I have a positive definite letter, but I want something hyperbolic instead. So I modify the form. I get a hyperbolic lattice. And in this new lattice, H. And in this mu lattice, h squared is still form. Now conics now have square minus two, and they're supposed to, and they still intersect h at two. And then it's a pretty much, once this lattice has been constructed, it's pretty much straightforward. It follows from what I call magic of K3 surfaces, which I discuss later. So there is indeed a quartic, so quartic means polarized K3 surface, whose neuron sevari lattice is this lattice. Is this lattice that we constructed, polarized by H. And in this lattice, so those classes L are indeed classes of conics. So each L represents a conic. So in this verticle, we have 800 points. Well, so this once the lattice has been constructed, the rest is pretty much straightforward and considered common nowadays. So it's not a big deal. not a big deal okay now just uh as a remark so previously known champions the previous previously known champion was uh 432 cognac on the smooth quartic well and when i found this example i put the paper on the archive just next day the year of law told me that in fact one can count compute the automotive group and The automotive group, and it turns out that this quartic is the so-called Mokai quartic, so it admits a symplectic action of one of the maximal groups. And then one can show that such a thing is indeed unique. And then one can just check Mukai's paper and find the equation. So the equation at the end is this. And the quartic with this equation has been studied before. So it was studied by Banafa Sarti, for example, and they did try to find conics there. They found... Tried to find connects there, they found three countries-something connects, so they didn't see all eight countries. Then, a posteriori, Bartash Naskersky found explicit equations of all eight countries connects, but those equations, unlike Shur's example, those equations look really correct. So unless you know that they're there, it's very difficult to guess that you look for them. Well, okay, so these are two examples. Well, and now I'm going to try to prove that 800 is indeed the maximum. And for this, I'm going to use, well, what I call the magic of K3 surfaces. So that's the reason why people work a lot with K3 surfaces. The reason is that lots of questions about geometric questions about K-3 surfaces can be reduced to pure arithmetic. In fact, there is a belief that any reasonable geometric equation can be reduced to an arithmetic. Geometry equation can be reduced to an arithmetical one. And the reason for that, so we have the so-called global dynamics theorem, which states that a K3 surface is essentially determined by its period, by the class of holomorphic to form. There is subjectivity of the period map, which states that pretty much everything that you can imagine is a period. So, in fact, this gives us this two. In fact, this gives us, this two gives us a complete description of all K3 surfaces, and in fact, there is fine modular space and such. Well, now there is a classical paper by Santanat, which tells us everything about the projected models of K3 surfaces. So you pick a class there and you can tell whether it is indeed an onus polarization or not. Well, there is Riemann Rock, of course. For K3 surfaces. So, okay, for K3 surfaces, Riemann Rock. For K3 surfaces, Riemann Roch, we use it in the form that any minus two class in the neuron servarian is minus rational curve. So we know everything about rational curves. Well, and so this four reduce everything to the arithmetic and the relevant arithmetic is done by Eden Yapin. So he developed a way to handle the corresponding arithmetical questions. The corresponding rhetorical questions, and maybe by well, Winberg lately we also used Wimberg's results related to group generated by reflections and such. Well, so with this introduction, of course, I'm not going to go into the details, but with this introduction, in the nutshell, we have the following. So, let's say that we want to study polarized K3 surfaces, let's say smooth, but not necessarily smooth. Not necessarily smooth, polarized scattered surfaces, and on those scattered surfaces, we want to study rational curves, say smooth rational curves of up to a certain projective degree. Well, now clearly, such a configuration of rational curves can be encoded by a graph, which has vertices are the curves, multi-graph, vertices are the curves, and the multiplicities of edges are just intersection indices. So clearly, two. Two complex curves, distinct smooth, complex, irreducible, two distinct irreducible complex curves intersect positively and non-negatively. So we do get an honest graph. Well, so all those statements in the previous slide eventually lead to the following. So if you fix the degree of the polarization, then there is a pure Then there is a purely algorithmic way of telling whether a given colored graph is or is not the graph of rational curves on a 2n polarized gate resettlements. So here, I just do a few examples. So the first example is obvious geometrically. Let's say that the black vertices are conics and white vertices are lines. So now this is obviously possible, right? I mean, you don't need... Is obviously possible, right? I mean, you don't need theory to understand that this graph, okay? Okay, so this first graph in this picture is possible because we have a pair of conics which lie in the same plane. So this is one plane section splits into two reducible conics. So those two conics intersect at four points. So that's fine. But if you again have just two conics, but you want them to intersect at just two points, then this is obviously impossible. Is obviously impossible. Why? Because since they intersect at two points, then they must lie in two different planes. And then in each of the plane, they must be something, each of the planes, they must be something else. So this graph itself cannot be realized at the Panagraph, but it can be repaired. We don't know exactly how. I mean, we should know something more about this surface, but so one way to repair it is this. So in each, so these are the two original conics. Two original conics, each of them spans a plane, and in each of the planes, there is one more conic. So, there are kind of two copies of this one, which intersect like this. So, this is one way to repair. Another one way to repair would be that in one of the planes, we have an extra cognac. In the other plane, we have an extra pair of lines. So, that second cognit splits into pair of lines. And then the graph would look like this, okay, if I'm not mistaken. If I'm not mistaken. Okay, but of course, for this, you don't need any theory, because this is geometrically obvious. But a kind of less intuitive example is here, for example. You have more than 10 pairwise disjoint vertices, which are connected to a triangle like this. So this graph cannot be the graph of lines of a pairized gateway surface. Well, I think I'm not sure. At least it cannot be the graph of lines of quad. It can be the graph of lines of quartic. I'm not sure about others. Another example is very classical due to Newpurin. If you have more than 16 disjoint pairwise disjoint vertices, then this cannot be a case resurface cannot have more than 16 pairwise disjoint rational graphs. So this cannot be the graph of anything, lines, coinings, whatever, for any parallelization. But this is less obvious geometrically. So this already means. Geometrically, so this already needs proof, but the proof goes along the line that I explained in the previous slide. Well, okay. Now maybe, maybe I should, okay, maybe there are some technicalities when you speak about when you allow non-smooth surfaces. So at first sight, it's in the same frame. In the same framework, because you just resolve the singularities and you get a bunch of exceptional devices which are also rational curves, also minus two curves. So you can just count them. But you consider this example, which is also geometrically obvious. So here, black vertices are lines, but white vertices are exceptional devices, so they are of projective degree zero. They're contracted by the polarization. So now this graph, the first graph is okay. This graph, the first graph is okay, and everyone understands that it's okay, just a plain section which splits into four distinct lines. So, each two lines, any two lines intersect. But this one is bad. It's again the same plane section with the same four lines, but for some reason, two of the lines don't intersect. Again, this one can be repaired. So, the reason why they don't intersect is that they pass through a singular point of the surface, which has to be resolved. Surface which has to be resolved after you resolve the singular point. The two lines no longer intersect, but each of them intersects the exceptional divisor. So on the way to repair this graph is that one. Well, one of the ways to repair it would be that one. But when exceptional divisors are allowed, it's becoming a little bit trickier. Well, we have some criteria about this, but luckily, we don't need this here because I'm going to speak about smooth square. Of course, here I'm going to speak about smooth quartics. So, exceptional device is not allowed from now on. Well, now, just to summarize, when we want to discuss configurations of rational curves on a polarized KT surface, we should just ask the right questions. So, such a configuration is described by a graph. We have a way to tell the good graphs from the bad ones. Good graphs from the bad ones. So the problem is to just have a sufficient supply of graphs to well to study. So for example, if I suspect that the maximum number of lines on aquatic is 64, so what I should do, I should consider all graphs with up to 65 vertices. To 65 vertices, check them all, and well, just see which ones are good, which ones are bad. And then it will turn out that them are bad. I mean, okay, so all with 65 are bad, and there is one good with 64 vertices. So the maximum is 64. And probably 10 years ago, I would consider this answer satisfactory. So I was a purely, pure mathematician. To your mathematician, so once something is reduced to a finite problem, then it's solved. But now, of course, I understand that it's not really feasible to consider all graphs with up to 65 vertices. So we need to do something to still solve the problem. So here we have two approaches. So one approach is that we construct the graphs to be Construct the graphs to be tried vertex by vertex. But well, okay, the good thing is that we always stop at rank 20. I mean, we don't really need to construct all 64 vertices, all 64 lines. Once you reach rank 20, then you know that rank cannot grow any further. So it's all in the finite index extensions, which can be analyzed using Newcoule. So you can stop. So, but at least we should get at least 20. At least we should get at least 20 lines. But studying from scratch, adding one by one 20 lines, it obviously diverges pretty fast. So it's still not feasible. So we have to start with something relatively standard and sufficiently big in the first place. So here we still have to use some geometric intuition. And well, currently, known geometric intuition is using elliptic pencils. But the other But the other approach, and this is the approach that I'm going to use, it's actually the approach of the second example, the new example that I considered, is that, again, we understand that essentially everything is in the neuron several lattice. Neuron several lattice is hyperbolic. We don't like hyperbolic lattices, so we modify it and make it positive definite. And upon that, we prove that this lattice can be embedded, in fact, primitively embedded. In fact, primitively embedded to a so-called Niemeya lattice, which is one of the 24 very well-known unimodal or even positive definite lattices of rank 24. Well, and then in this Nimaya lattice, the line sponyx or whatever we are counting all there. So there are certain square four vectors. In each Niemaya vector, there are finitely many square four vectors, not so many. They must intersect in a certain specified way the valorization. Specified with the validization. So they're all there. We see them all. And basically, what we need to do, we need to just extract from this huge set of all square four vectors a good well set which can serve as the graph of points. Well, I will say more about this. In particular, from this approach, it is immediately obvious, which it wasn't obvious a priori, but it's immediately obvious that we do have a certain It's immediately obvious that we do have a certain uniform upper bound. So, if say I want to count the number of conics on a smooth quartic, a priori it's not obvious that this number is bounded. Of course, in each particular quartic, the number is finite, but the existence of uniform bounds is not obvious. Here it becomes obvious. It's just at most the number of square four vectors in one of the 20 point lattices. So, each of them has finitely many. So each of them has finished the menu, so we do get a huge bound, but it's about. Well, okay. Now, here is the big theorem. Now going back to Poinix and quartics. So the theorem states, and again, following the tradition, the tradition was laid by my paper with Helietin Berk and Sinan Certas. So the tradition is not just prove a bound, but actually give a partial classification of all large configurations. Large configurations. So here large will mean at least 720. So it turns out that there are but four smooth quartics with at least 720 conics. And a priori, I don't distinguish between irreducible or reducible conics. So it's either an onus conic or a pair of distinct intersecting lines. So we don't distinguish between this. Well, but still, there are but four quartics. Now three of them. Now, three of them, so the numbers of conics are 800, 736, 728. So, in the first three, all conics are irreducible, and in fact, there is no lines at all. And the fourth one is our good old example, the example that I started with. It's still the same good old short quartic. It has the maximum number of lines, and out of those 64 lines, just while taking pair of intersecting ones. Taking pair of intersecting ones, you can cook up how many? Well, 576 conics, but there are 144 also irreducible ones. So altogether, there are 720 conics. Well, for two of them, for two of these four, I know the equation. So I explained where this one comes from. Just an accident that we know this one. Okay, I found an equation for an M20 quartic. So this one is M20. So, this one is M20, and this one is actually well the very first equation I started to stop with. So, for sure, quartics has been known from the beginning of time. Well, and again, so here the names of this quartics are just due to my lack of imagination, I name them after the maximal group of symplectic automorphisms, which sometimes work, sometimes doesn't quite work, but anyways, well, let's forget about the names. About the names. Well, and so basically, this theorem is proofed, the proof is heavily computer aided. So we construct large so-called geometric sets, in a sense, conic by conic. Well, so here, just a few more remarks, kind of they are not precisely results, but let's say partial results. So these are the conic counts that I So these are the conic counts that I observed. I mean, I just saved everything with at least 600 conics. So these are the counts that I observed. I believe that this list is complete, but well, I don't know that for sure. Now, in the main theorem, all quartics are singular. And here I have to apologize because for K3 surfaces, singular means something different. Singular means well, or maximal Picard rank. Well, of maximal current rank, or which is the same projective region. So they did the unique up to projected conformation. Well, and so the question is, what about if it's not of maximum decar rank? For example, the car rank, I don't know, 19 or 18 or less. So the best known example here is a family, one parameter family of vertics with 608 irreducible vertics. 608 irreducible coinings, and since my background is actually real algebraic geometry, in all these problems, I also try to find the maximal number of real lines on a real surface. And this is the first time that I failed. So, here I don't know the exact answer. It's definitely at most 718 because none of those works. But I the best. But the best known example is 656. So this number of maximal number of real on a real vertex on a smooth real quartic is still unknown. Well, okay. Probably I should skip the generalizations. Don't have much time for this. Well, now let me discuss other parallelizations. So, what is known about Other parallelizations. So, what is known about, by the way, so okay, maybe let me go here. So, one generalization. So, I started with phonics, but of course, the natural way, and my first example was about lines. So, we can consider other polarizations of K3 surfaces, not necessarily quartics, and we can consider other rational curves, not necessarily conics. So, here the only thing that is well known is the maximal number of lines. Is the maximal number of lines. So for any polarization, so you have degree to n k3 surface in p n plus one. So then the maximal number of lines I denoted by this n to n of one is known. Well, concerning the number of cognacs, which would be n to n of two instead of one, very little is known. It's really very new. Little new. So Little new, so in fact, the new thing which is unthinkable in algebraic geometry but which is very natural in my approach is that I do not assume that conics are irreducible a priori. In fact, till the very end, I don't really care what they are. I cannot tell the difference. I cannot tell them apart, irreducible from reducible. So from my point of view, so this subgraph just the pair of intersecting. This subgraph, just a pair of intersecting lines, is the same as just a single point. But you also know the lattice elements that correspond to lines. So you would. I can't hear all. Oh, you also know the lattice elements that correspond to lines. And then, therefore, you would know if you sum them together, two lines that intersect, sum it. Two lines that intersect some of them together, you would get a connection. Yeah, yeah, I know that. Okay, so I know this, but okay, well, so I know everything about lines. This is true, but in fact, here is okay. So the next conjecture, the next conjecture is actually funny. So the next conjecture state that if you have many lines, then there is no chance to have many coinics. So in all examples that are known, it turns out that so. It turns out that, so, as I said, so a priori, we say that conic is anything. It's either reducible or irreducible, we don't care. But in all examples, if the number of conics is large, then they are all irreducible and moreover, there are no lines. And so, even there is a conjecture, so the conjectures there is, so this n to n of 2 is the maximal number of conics. And so, I conjecture that there is a smaller bound with this property. With this property, if you have more than that many conics, then there is no lines. So, and in particular, all conics are irreducible. And here is what is known. So, here are just some examples. So, for conics, I considered only the first, well, classic, the first four classical polarizations. So, these are double planes, ramified as sextic curves. These are spatial quartics. These are sextic surfaces in P. Sextic surfaces in P4, that's intersection of a quadric and a cubic, and these are mostly three quadrics in P5, so surfaces of degree A. So these are the four classical validizations of K3 surfaces. Well, so here what is known? I'm speaking about conics only. About lines, everything is known. Speaking about conics. Well, so this is the maximal number of conics. Maximal number of conics, no matter what, irreducible or irreducible. So, this is that conjectural bound beyond which everything is irreducible, and this is the maximal number of real points. So, things in black are known. Things in red, I believe, are true. Well, so they're conjectural, but I believe that they are true. Although, well, so this I have no idea how to prove that looks very cheery. How to prove this looks very challenging. The numbers are overwhelming, of course. Overwhelming. Well, and things in blue, uh, well, so I know examples, but I'm not quite sure that they indeed the maximum. Well, so there is still a lot of work to be done. Probably something should change. I mean, the approach should change. Well, okay. Now, very briefly, very briefly. What they will do? What do we do, and how do we reduce the problem to arithmetic? So, we have a polarized case resurface, so x. Now, of course, it has homology. Homology is this middle homology. It's a standard lattice, so it's a unimodal lattice, where upon carrier duality, it's indeed a lattice. And all K3 surfaces are diffeomorphic, so this is a known lattice, which is well, this one. Now, we are speaking about an algebraic surface. So, an algebraic surface. Algebraic surface. So, an algebraic surface also had a so-called neuron-sevary lattice, which is the lattice of algebraic classes. So, these are the cycles which can be represented by algebraic curves. So, it is smaller typically, actually, well, it is always smaller because this one has three positive squares. Its signature is 319. And this one, by the so-called Hoch index theory, must be hyperbolic. So, it has only one positive square. So, this one has a rank at most. So, this one has ranked at most 20. So, it is smaller. Well, and essentially, the global thermal theory that I mentioned states that once we know this sub lattice, we know pretty much everything we want to know about the K3 surface. Well, we don't know exactly the K3 surface, but we know a family of surfaces. Well, so that's why pretty much any reasonable question reduces, boils down to studying this lattice. Down to studying this lattice neuron severity. Well, and this lattice is polarized. So, in our case, since we are speaking about quartics, so the square of the polarization is four. Here and the line are kind of parameters that may change from problem to problem, but I'm speaking about Koenigson quartics, so I have some precise values. Well, and as I said, neuron Seville must be hyperbolic, meaning that H perk is positive different. Now, if I wanted to be an honest smooth quadratic, by some denot, there should be no bad vectors. And bad vectors, there are two kinds of bad vectors. One is this, so on minus two vectors. They're actually the exceptional divider. So presence of such vector would mean that my quadratic is singular, I mean singular with singular points, which I have to resolve, and then I get exceptional dividers. And the second one is very bad. Is very bad. If there is such a vector, then that means that actually I don't have a birational model. This is a two-by-one, two-to-one map to a quadric. It can also be studied, but this is not exactly what we would call a quadratic. Well, well, and then all conics, doesn't matter, reducible or irreducible, are mainly vectors in the neuron several with these two properties. neuron severity with these two properties yes square minus two and h intersects h at two so two these two means precisely that it's a point so this means that it's a rational curve this means that it's a point well now we have a hyperbolic lattice we don't like hyperbolic lattices because it's not clear how to work with them so we want to change it to a definite lattice and then we just do the opposite to what i did in my second example Did in my second example. So, first, oh, so this is the new understanding of the construction. So, it used to be explained differently. So, first, what we do, okay, so this is our priorized neuron sevari lattice. Let's call it S for sort. So, first, we just actually get rid of all the lights, meaning that we consider only vectors which intersect H. Sorry, there is a mistake here, of course. I'm sorry, there is a mistake here. Of course, it must be zero mod two, so which intersect H even here. So I want the lattice, so there is a mistake. So this two should be read as zero mod two. Well, and then I modify the form. So actually by the same formula that I already used. So the new form would be this. Yes, in terms of the old form and age, could be this, but I will still denote. Could be this, but I will still denote it by dot. I don't like writing stars. So this mule is indeed positive definite. And what one can prove is that if Ns was indeed somebody's neuron sevarium, then this new positive definite lattice does admit a primitive embedding to enemy. Well, now in this new lattice, h squared is still 4, we can easily see from the formula. Now the bad vectors. The bad vectors that shouldn't exist there would convert to just roots, square two vectors. So the original lattice has no bad vectors if and only if this one, new one, is root three, which is well easy to check. And the conics in the old vector in the old letters, so let me remind you that conics just mean this. So conics in the old letters become square four vectors in the new one, which intersect H. In the new one, which intersects H2. Well, so that's the new arithmetical problem. Unfortunately, it's not exactly one-to-one. So unfortunately, okay, this one is embeddable to the homology of K3, then this one is embeddable to Nymeyer, but not vice versa. If this one is embeddable to any Maier, it does. Embeddable to any MAR, it does not automatically imply that that one is embeddable to K3. So here we have to, well, there is still some extra work to be done. But anyways, this is not. Well, okay, this has to be done. Well, okay, now I think I should okay, so okay, let me just paraphrase the problem. Okay, let me just paraphrase the problem. So, we start with the Nymeya letters. Now, let me remind you that there are but 24 of them, which are all very well studied. We pick a polarization for polarization of these letters. Again, there are finitely many squares for vectors. In fact, up to the orthogonal group, there are not so many classes. Then, once these two are fixed, I can pre-compute, in a sense. Compute, in a sense, the set of conics. So I just define a conic to be any vector in the Nume with these properties. So I have a finite set. And the good thing is that now from now on, all groups actually act by permutations on this finite set. So since I'm using GAP, GAP is extremely good with permutation groups. So everything is done in terms of permutations. Well, so in particular, the size of the set is. Size of the set is a bound. Well, it's big, but not so big, is a kind of an a priori universal bound on the number of pointings. Well, and then I'm going to consider some spatial subsets of this set. Well, okay, so here are some obvious definitions like span saturation. So, spatial means so there are two actually two conditions: one is admissible. Actually, two conditions. One is admissible. Admissible is that the span must be root free. So, root free is a must. So, as I said, so s has no bad vectors if this new lattice is root free. So, I want to keep it root free. And this actually rules out most of the things. Well, and second one, which we usually check at the very end, is that if we start with this lattice spanned by my set and then go back through that construction change in the form. Through that construction change of the form and such, this must admit a good isometry to the homology of K3. Well, this condition I call geometric, and this is usually checked at the very end. And it's not, well, I mean, it helps, but most of the time. Okay, in most NIMIA lattices, most bad sets are ruled out by the admissibility. Admissibility. So, usually, we check this geometric condition at the very end. Well, okay, now let me skip. I think I have five minutes left. Let me skip. Yeah, let me skip. Okay, very briefly. So, some pneumonia lattices are better, some are worse. So, So, for about three quarters of them, in fact, everything can be done manually. So, that's about three quarters of Nemayo lattices, they have so many roots that it's very difficult to be admissible there. And so, here, basically, you can take your favorite textbook in kimono mathematics, check various theorems of all binomial coefficients, mimic their proof, and find some bounds. Well, things are well, those square four vectors can be defined, described combinatorially. And in terms of this combinatorial description, you can write down some combinatorial bounds on the sizes of admissible sets. And as I said, they're so simple that if it were not for the huge number of cases, it's probably about a hundred of cases, but this could be done manually. Be done manually. So, most lattices are ruled out immediately. Then, there are lattices with few rules, and here one has to work. But the work is that basically we try to construct the boot subsets, just adding vectors one by one, increasing rank one by one. And as usual, we stop at rank 20. But here, instead of abstract graphs, we just speak about subsets. We just speak about subsets of very particular sets. So it's supposed to be easier. But again, I will skip the details because this is all. I will skip this. But here is the new thing, which is, and the bad one is the leach lattice. So the leach lattice has no roots, which means that pretty much everything in the leach lattice is admissible. So this, our main tool, the inadmissibility. The inadmissibility, which rules out most bad sets, wouldn't work here. Well, and its full orthogonal group is huge, whereas its group generated by reflections is small. Well, there is no root, so there is no reflections, which means that whatever we use for the other lattices wouldn't work. Of course, we could have tried to break the symmetry somehow, but still, the thing that the admissibility. Still, the thing that the admissibility doesn't work, it actually is very bad. I tried this, but it didn't seem to converge. So, well, I just aborted the computation and tried to think about something else. Well, but here we just do it the other way around. So, this is something unthinkable in all other approaches. Here, I start with the full set. So, instead of working from Working from the empty set upwards, I start from the full set and work downwards. So I'm considering subsets of this set. Well, there is an algorithm. Actually, this is so-called iterated index to subgroups. So at each moment, so okay, when I have a set, when I have a set, I consider it span. Now on this span, take span model or two. Take span model of two. I get a an F2 vector space, and then I take basically considering vectors in the dual space and the orthogonal complements and see what I get. Now, I'm bound to get fewer lines at each step. Well, so iterating these contractions, I'm bound to get any set that there is for this iterated index to subgroups. These two subgroups. It works, but unfortunately, it needs optimization. So I think we developed this algorithm when we worked with two planes in Ubuntu fourfolds with Wittenberg and Ottom. But when I tried that, as I said in the abstract, when I tried that, I was staying at Max Planck using the service. So in two months, it was still not over. So I had to upboard. So I had to upbot it because I was leaving. And wow, so I convinced myself that my theorem is true, but I didn't have a proof. So I tried to optimize this. And here are the two biggest optimizations. So of this algorithm. So one optimization is actually, well, we followed the proof of the existence of this chain literally, but I will not scare about this. So there are two optimizations. So clearly, we have to use the symmetries as much as possible, because, I mean, I don't. As much as possible, because I mean, I don't want to overcome. For example, when I have this F2 vector space, I'm considering the dual space instead of, and these are actually big, so their dimensions are here, well, 24, 23, 22. So these are quite big sets. Well, instead of considering all vectors one by one, it's better to consider a single representative, well, in each orbit of the relative symmetry. Each orbit of the relative symmetry group. Well, and obviously, using GAP, I was trying to compute the orbits like this: just orbit domain, and then I select, well, one representative. And when I asked, well, if this can be optimized in the gap forum, so just following Max Horn's reply, do I really need all those orbits? I decided that indeed I don't need them. So, what I need are the representatives. The representatives. So here is okay. I do this, I'm doing this for small groups. So here is the way to compute representatives rather than orbits, and it works much faster indeed. So well, we just compute the smallest representative of each orbit. So this is one optimization, but still it's not quite. And here I have a feature request for the gap developers. So probably, well, I'm very naive. Well, I am very naive when it concerns algorithms, so this is obviously a very arbitrary bound on the size of the group. So, probably should depend somehow on the group structure and other stuff. But it will be nice in gap, in addition to orbit domain, also have this function like orbit representatives. We should compute representatives of orbits. Well, so this is one optimization, and the second one is really a miracle. In fact, it took me a year to make myself to ship. Myself to sit up and write down these five lines of code. I didn't think it would help much, but in fact, it does help. And actually, this is that made the day. So at some point, what we need to do. So, okay, we can say we computed the orbits. Now, for each representative, so this is representative of an orbit, what I need to do? I need to compute the new set, which is its orthogonal complement. Well, Orthogonal complement, well, the annihilator of the representative. And then, okay, remember, we care only about large sets. I want large sets. So I compute this set. Well, the natural way to compute it. So GAP is very advanced with list functions. So there are lots of everything. So people tend to list library functions, to use the library functions. So, well, you compute the set and then see. Set and then see if the set is big enough. If it's not big, well, just drop it. If it's big, okay, keep it and continue. Well, so instead of computing the whole set, what I try to do, I try to count, so here we count the hits. So instead of counting hits only, I also decided to count the misses. So instead of using a library function, A library function, I well just wrote those on here. How many? Six or seven lines of code. So actually we are doing this, but we do it vector by vector. Now, if the vector is good, we add it to the list. If the vector is bad, we just count it as a miss. And as soon as we get sufficiently many misses, too many misses, we abort. Well, Abort well, it turns out that this really makes the day reducing two months to two days. And well, with this slight modification of the code, I managed to honestly prove the theorem that I claim a proof. And I guess, well, so at the end, okay, using that, so remember our main thing is the rank must be at most 20. So we have to reduce the rank by four units. By four units. So it turns out that in the least lattice, there are but nine sets of size at least 720 and rank at most 20. And out of these nine sets, four are geometric, five are not. So those four geometric sets actually constitute the theorem that I stated. And that's it. Thank you. Questions? Alex, you explained us your second approach, and you mentioned there was a first approach using graphs. Could you say if you were able to bring that to fruition? Yeah, okay. So, all right, but okay, I'm not used to writing on screen. I'm not used to writing on screen, unfortunately. So, and I'm not equipped now. Yeah, but the graph. So, there is okay. So, there is intuition is elliptic pencils. So, we classify the graphs. Actually, there is a taxonomy of graphs according to their minimal, yeah, minimal parabolic subgraph. And the parabolic subgraph essentially is an elliptic. I mean, geometrically, it is an elliptic pencil. Elliptic, I mean, geometrically, it is an elliptic pencil in a K-3 surface. Graphs are basically they're just well parabolic subgraphs. Well, it turns out that, for example, okay, so for example, actually, it doesn't work well for quartics or double planes. In fact, double planes was the first case for which I developed this machinery with Niemeyer. For quartics, with Slavic Rams, we managed to make it work. We managed to make it work, but it involved. But otherwise, so the intuition is like this. So you can see an elliptic pencil. Now you can do two things. You can either classify elliptic pencils, which is done, okay, for example, by Shimade, and it's not so difficult to do. You can classify elliptic pencils with fibers of a given projective degree. And you can, okay, by this I mean, so you say you can say only a line. You consider, say, only lines which are in which are fiber components and components of single fibers of these pencils. You can classify this, and there is a certain bound. Or else, another thing, you can try to classify the maximal number of, again, linear sections, linear sections in the presence of a single fiber. And usually, when you add the two bounds, you get what you want. Of course, there are something. What you want, of course, there are some technicalities which should be uh should be handled, but usually when you add the two bounds, you get the bound that you want. Now, for coins, it wouldn't quite work. I mean, formally, you can still try to do this, but the thing is that, okay, with lines, you have okay, two lines are either disjoint or in the second one point. With scoring, it's much more complicated, so it's either disjoint or one point, two points, four points. There can be, well, many more possibilities. So, you lose control. Possibilities. So you lose control much faster. So when you speak about the pencil, so why it is good to speak about, say, sections to your pencil? Because usually you manage to prove that if you consider sections of the same pencil, then they cannot intersect too much, whatever this means. But again, the problem is that I cannot handle all graphs. So I want to have as large. Have as large, relatively standard chunks as possible. So these candidates for such large controllable chunks are either pencils, so fiber components of a pencil, or else sections of a fixed pencil. And for line, this works because indeed they are controllable. For conics, it would also work by studying from huge parallelizations. Actually, well. Huge polarization. Actually, well, when I did these four lines, I discovered it was not clear, by the way, but I discovered a funny thing: is that when the polarization grows, things are becoming simpler and simpler. So the bigger the polarization, the simpler the configurations, and eventually everything is just an elliptic pencil mode. So for conics, when you increase the polarization, well, maybe I don't know. It can one can check, but when you increase the polarization enough, conyx cannot. Polarization enough, phonics cannot intersect too much, and then that would work. But the interesting polarizations are two, four, six, eight. For this, unfortunately, this work with the pencils, it's still possible, but I think we would lose control very fast. So it wouldn't work. I'm afraid. But I didn't really try that. But since there are too many possibilities, even for two conics, there are way too many possibilities. I mean, instead of two, you possibilities i mean instead of two you have how many four right well so well and this four basically gets a range
