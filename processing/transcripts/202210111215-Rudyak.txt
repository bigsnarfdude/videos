Hello. Yes, now do you hear me? Yeah. So can I start? Yes, please do. Yeah. Okay. So first I want to thank the organizers for organizing this meeting in relatively difficult. In relatively difficult things. So let's go. My title is Maps of Degree One and Critical Points. First, let me remind what is the degree of a web. So we have closed smooth oriented manifolds and And this M in squares in fundamental class, and we have the fundamental class. Now, if you have two manifolds and M F from M to N, we have the induced We have the induced map, and F star is map from z to z, so it is determined by a number d and this number d is a degree of a map f. The notation is degf. Particular, we have the t star. Here we have that F star, a fundamental class, is D times fundamental class of M. Now, I'm sorry maybe people know that, but I just, maybe for young students, to tell us that the degree of a map has the following geometric description. We have a map f from n to n. We have p i regular value of f. That regular value is a finite set. And for each point xi, you have local diffeomorphism. So since both m and n are oriented, then locally you have number positive. number positive or negative orientation. So if P plus is number of positive points and P minus negative points, then degree is the difference between P plus and P minus. Now you have another description of the GI. Another description of the GF. This analytical description. Historically, the degree of a move was first introduced by Leon Brower in 1921, and he proved that. He proved that degrees homotopy invariant performance and used it to prove the Brown fixed point theorem. Well known. Well done, theorem. I think I will not repeat it. Some examples we regard as one set of complex Set of complex numbers of norm one, then you have map g to the power n and this map has degree n. If you have extended complex plane and a polynomial, then the degree of polynomial Degree of polynomial is the degree of this map. Maybe this from the origin comes. Now, if you have suspension web, so you have this, and the degree P is the same of this degree. Of this degree. In particular, you see that maybe each number M can be realized some degree of S M for M positive. Another example: take a co-opsy map. map from m to m minus small disk this collapsible map has of course degree plus one or minus one because you can find a regular point m and here this local diffeomorphism next we will think Well, we'll think if you have a case-sheeted cover map, then degree is the number of sheets. And as an example, shows. That if you have manifolds from projective space as always even degree, this is a proof. This example shows that not every number can be realized of a degree of certain map. Real shortenment. Now, transfer. We have two maps and a smooth map. We have this concern and have this transfer work. We have We have induced homomorphism in homology and co-homology and have this. And you have the theorem of Dyer that this composition of map and inverse map, in a sense, is multiplication of degree. In particular, you see that if degree is one, then abstracts split heteromorphism. So degree one, degree is equal to one is a very strict restriction, strict condition. So that's what I wanted to say. So, informally speaking, if you have of degree one, then domain is in a sense more shift than a range. Next subject, I consider smooth function calls manifold f and recall that a critical point is a point where the derivative is zero. zero. Let crit large f denote the number of critical points of smooth function. So we have closed manifold m consider critical numbers and take the minimum of critical numbers. We have the following inequality: that critical number is the most dimension plus one. Now, consider map of degree one. So we said that m is more moisture than m. So we can pose the following open problem. Given two manifolds m and m, suppose that there exists a map of degree one. Is it true that minimum number of critical domain is more than or equal to the number of critical numbers or range. As far as I know, it's open question. Of course, it would be nice to attack the problem provided critical points M, crit M, this is how to be invariant, but it is an open problem. So, even to critical number, to critical Invariants M and N, crit M and crit N, is that I want to be equivalent. Is it true that they are equal? Still open question. So I have these two problems that I find very interesting. Two examples, I think for one. For example, for number two for S plan T M is since you know that this grid is not more than one plus dimension. Dimension and using the Kaplan's estimation, we will take this equality. So this is Takenson equality here, less than and Kaplan's estimate give you this another way and so equality. Now I explain one of multiple invariants that approximate the number grid. So, categorical covering of space 6 is an open covering such that each element of the covering is Of the covering is open and contractible in X. The minimal number of this covering number is called the Listernich-Snieldman category. And that is the fascinating Listernich-Schneidermann theorem that estimates the number of critical points. Number of critical points that the category plus one estimates from below is a critical number of functions. This is the main application of historic statement theorem. It appeared in. It appeared in beginning of 1920s and not unexpected that it has many applications. A piece of history. Mr. Nicholas Steelman attacked the old banker recognition that every two months. Two-dimensional sphere for any possesses these three subtleties action calls geodesics. So they regarded calls geodesics as critical point of action function or length function. And they tried to attack in this way. So, there is Terric Timber series that I told you, the baby version of this critical points question. Now, as I promised, I mentioned that Mr. Extreme categories are homophobian variants. It's a good, say it's a reasonable approximation of crit. Usually that are not, actually, I don't know the example that crit and cut are very different. Maybe I have examples where the difference is one, two, but not more. Now we can call this function. Can call this function for cut. If you have map of degree one, is it true that category of M is at least category of M. Well, category of X is zero if and only if X contractible. Of x contractible, and there is a homotopy description of a steric table category. So you have this pass vibration, you have iterated join, and the theorem says that Category is less than n if and only if the vibration has a section. Note also the estimate that category of x is logical. Is less than this ratio. In particular, category is less than dimension. Sorry, maybe it should be here minus one. Yes, integrity plus one less dimension in particular for n equals two, we have here one and here zero. Okay, what Correct. Now here I know that this conjecture, this one conjecture. Holds in dimension less than five, we can prove the following theorem. Prove the following theorem that n is q minus 1 connected and category is dimension over q then we have this desired immequiew. Another situation, then you have the desired inequality. Some examples If you have here a map of degree one from manifold to pursue, then category is equal to the dimension. And similarly, a projective space. Similarly, for CPM, and this is valid, if we repress CPM for any turn dimension, simply connected, simple active manifolds. Similarly, okuatarne examples If you have two-dimensional tools and M and two stable parallelized manifold and if you have here map of degree one then you have desired inequality Is that inequality? So we don't know about category of M to category of R, but after multiplication by some tools, we have this inequality. Another example. Consider the exceptional Lie group G2. It's a connected Lie group of dimension 14 and we can prove this inequality. More examples if you have triable manifolds and you have this connected sum. Then you have definitely map of degree one, collapsing map, and you have this inequality for category. Now, recall the following coupling system for category. Let R be Let R be a commutative ring. So I think you know it, but I remind that you have here curve product, and if curve product is non-zero, then category is more than or equal to couplings. It's a sharing of Rolohan Scholz in beginning of shorties. Note that it was beginning of shorties, of 19 shorties. So in that time, we did not have cobology language. We did not have, in that time, we need theory. And so, of course, Provoffa and Polf, as you can imagine. As you can imagine, profit for manifolds in terms of intersectional cycles. Here is the naive proof. Naive proof, and you can say it not only for cochomology but for any ring spectrum. And so, you have this estimate. Some examples Copranksoft is N. Is N because you know cohomology of tours, just products. So you have this because of caprice estimation, and from the other side we have this. So this next example RPM RPN real projective space, you have this homology ring, and so couplings is n and so because of the mate estimation estimation, you have this similarly. Similarly for Arpur. So similarly for shipwreck, So, you have the following theorem that if you have a map of degree one, then you have estimation for couplings. So, we don't know about category, but we do know about couplings. Couplings. So you have this estimate, sometimes useful, have this simple observation. Because if F has degree one, so this map is a monomorphism and so you have this an equality. And so you have this inequality. Similarly, holes are product of spheres. More examples. If you have a special orthogonal group, you have this well-known dimension. Diversion equality, and you can prove that you have this for every degree SOM of degree one. From this theorem, we know that category estimate couple for the variant, when you follow, we can consider moderating a degree and speak again about the The construction and map of degree one. Again, you have this transference equality and solves. Here is formal estimation of category between cup ranks and permanent variant. I will not explain too much about this. You can read it. One more American variant that for critical points, we have critical points here, but you have covering not boycotable sets but balls which really have. We trivially have this inequality. This is the theorem of the thing you have. And there is also the recent paper of Sadekov Ovstromov. I didn't put it that you have many examples with this. So for simply connected manifold of dimensional. Manifold of dimension more than six, you have this equality. Here you have the open question. I don't have examples. And like for category, we can put here. Now, below we consider general critical points. Now we can consider non-degenerate critical points. Apply to Morse function Morse theorem. So we consider critical points. We have Hessian, so this matrix and this. And this, if quadratic form is non-zero at P, then it costs non-degenerate. Now we consider not all, but most functions and consider this minimal critical point for For non-degenerate situation Let me put attention to this fact, a big difference between degeneric and non-degenerate situation. Also, it is easy to see that the number of critical points, of non-time zone critical points, minimal number, is finite. And so we prove for general this finiteness, the finiteness. Finiteness comes. Fineteness comes because you have critical points. The critical point is isolated, and so because of compactness, you have only a finite number of critical points. Also, this now this question This question, this much more. And this question for degree one hate, do we have this inequality? What about this? You can approximate this number by the sum of beta numbers. By the sum of weighty numbers, this inequality was from the whole theory, and we can regard this as approximation of great star. So, again, we have this inequality, which follows from transfer trick. Now these questions are affirmative for M and M. Yes, it's well and smell theorem. And in fact, for this situation, simply connected to dimensional six. Dimension six. Morse critical points can be exactly estimated by the numbers and torsion rank. So definitely it's homotopy invariant that Chris star for this person is homotopy invariant. This is an option. This is here R number, T ram the torson rack. So we have this well-known inequality by morph and because of this we have this. We have this small theorem, where more than a quality for this situation, dimension of simply connectedness, you have a quality creative star. Create star is a homotopy invariant. And in particular, you will have this degree one in dimension simply connect. Since dimension simply connected, you have this inequality. That's all for today. Could you slide? Thank you. Could you slide to the bottom one, please? Thank you. Right. Okay. Thank you very much. Welcome. Does anybody have any questions or comments? Anybody have any questions or comments? Is there anybody in the room who wants to ask anything? Is this CRET M a homeomorphism invariant? We even do not know if it is homography invariant. Yet Wait, but I'm saying what are you saying about non-degenerate case? If it's yeah, but if it's homeomorphism, well, if it's homeomorphism, no, it's also unknown, it's unknown if it is homotopy variant, if it's homeomorphismic variants. Disheomorphism, but Fism, but for her Fisman, known question. Does anybody on Zoom, anybody watching through Zoom, have a question or comment? Okay, well, let's thank Yuli very much.
