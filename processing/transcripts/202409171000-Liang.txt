Today, I want to talk about the principal agreement problem for some non-local diffusion operators. Okay. First, I want to introduce my problem with some non-local diffusion operators like this. But I just consider this problem on some circle. Some circle. We can see here, though, we just consider the problem a circle, but generally it can be used to describe the problem some line with some periodic media. Here, for this operate, for this operator, this part, the integral part. The integral part is just the non-local diffusion. Sometimes in biological, in ecology, this part is used to diffusion to replace the user random diffusion. And this part is the vector part. Since this A means some motion on a circle that means. On a circle, that means if we have some species, it's just sorry, that's on such a circle. We have some species. Move on this circle under the speed of move is just at any point x, its speed is a of x, minus a of x, that's a minus a. And this part, R terror. This part, art means the growth part. Yeah. And then sometimes we just reject this out as the following simple form that like this. We just write this part. It's some integral of the kernel K, integral of the kernel K. And we write. Connocate and we write the non-local different part as B and the direction and the growth part as A. And okay, let's give some substance. Here, we consider K is a continuous and the positive functions are from S times S to S. And here. And here A is just a C1 function and R is a C0 function. And similar to the random definite operator, Laplacian or joined to all the elliptic operators. So we just counted the principle eigenvalue problem. And what is the principle value or principal and functions? In some sense, the principle value, but it's our Principle for Ag value, but this operator means the largest value. More processes just to calculate the operator. We use sigma error to describe, to note its spectral side. And zoo error is a winter side. Then we can get the spectral bound of the size. It means we consider all lambda belong to sigma l and consider. belong to sigma L and consider its u part. The super of this set is SL. So this SL is called just if this SL is an arc value with some drawbreaker multiplicity one, then it's called the principal value. In many cases, for example, for elliptic operators, different operators and non-negative matrix. Non-negative matrix because of the maximum principle in such SL has a positive ad function. And our main question can be written more clearly for this operator, not local diffusion operator with advanced. If it's vector bound as a Its vector bound SA plus B is the principal eigenvalue in some banana space like functions space L1 or CZ and has a real positive eigenfunctions. And of course, as I said before, for this operator, equivalent operator can be considered as an equivalence operator in. As a equivalent operator in the periodic media, you are like this. Here, for this, for this operator, the second operator, A bar, and R bar are just one periodic function. And K bar is also one periodic function for the first variable X. And when we consider this problem, we want to consider the fact is a local R1 function. Local R1 function and one pair dig. And let's give some background. Sometimes we consider heat equation, or in other words, some linear parabolic equation and the diffusion equation in biology. And for this, this is a very classical heat equation. And for in some domain, and we also give some homogeneous genius boundary condition. Boundary condition on the boundary of this domain. And this part, the first part, also means the diffusion, but it's just the random diffusion. And the second part is advaxing. And the third part, R times U, is the local growth. And here I said the boundary condition is homogeneous means it's deleted automatically on absorbing. Norman or absorbing homogeneous boundary condition, which is equal to, in some sense, is equal to zero, and all periodic boundary condition. And for this parabolic equation, heat equation, we can form the point of view of evolution equations. We can count in the generator of the semi-growth of our linear equation like this. It's just the right. Is just the that said part of this equation. And after give some substance on the smoothness and the bondedness of the parameters and the domain, we can know the existence of the principle value of this object L, which is where standard and well-class and classical results. And the biological Ye biological biology and ecology. Here, we when we call u here u xt the function u is just the density of some species. And the principal value of this salt can be considered as the average growth rate. And this average growth rate may rate may be larger than the worst value of this r of the local gross gross rate and this principle and value can be used to describe the basic reproduction number of the some inipate and also can be described the propagation speed of some invited species that's some background from ecology on the And we have some observant of the semi-group of the solution of this linear parabolic equations and it's generated. Let T be the solution semi-group of this linear equations. And we know since some small Some smoothness of the solution. And this T is compact in at least one RP space or in continuum function space, and which is also strongly positive because of the maximum principle and all the preserving positive and effects that. And then by the cry-Nutman theorem, Newton's theorem: the spec radio of this same group finally fixed the t, that's the its specs radius is the principal values. And then also come back to the generator L and from the existence of the principal of the same group, we can get the existence of the Principal values of this generator R, which is respect bound SR as a principal value, and the SR is equal to lon zho over t. That says some standard results. And in some sense, we know this. We know this T is the same group generated by this equation solution of this equations. And the advanced term and the gross term may add some singularity of this same growth, but the random diffusion can eliminate such singularity and yet some smoothness and compactness. And now come back to. Now come back to our local diffusers and to consider the operate this the principal argument values of this operate A plus B, we just transfer it to the principal argument value problem of the solution semi semi-group. We just consider A plus B as the generator of The generator of our T and consider the principal argued problem of this subgroup. And then based on our observing on the heat equation, comparing with the journalist A plus B, the subgroup had better properties, like under we can explain some concepts and results clearly in natural language. And we have some known results for the existence of specified value of this operate. First case is the A is just zero. That means that we have no advantage. And for this, for this operator, if we have no, we have No, we haven't advanced this. That's something results by Wen Shenzhen from Auburn University and her former student Aijun Zhang and the French mathematician during career. And they give some results that suppose in this case, this part is zero. And for this part, the growth part, suppose the growth rates are not. The growth rates are the local repeats continuous near its maximum power points. Then the spectral bound of this operator is this operator is an value with algebraic mutability one. And moreover, the respective and functions is positive. And this is the result from Wen Shenzhen and Aijun Zhang. For the case, For the case here, you just consider the case results advection. For the case with advection, there are also some other results like this. If here Advex is larger than zero, but not on a circle, but just in interval, and the cover and the final and the Xue Feng one, they also give some sophisticated. Sufficient conditions to guarantee the existence of the principal value of such operators. We consider the first in our works, we first consider the case where A is larger than zero. That means it is larger than zero, and the motion is on a circle. That means, if you consider the circle as a river, and then what? And then water can just move periodically on this river. And this speed at pointer is minus A of x. And then in our work, we just suppose a lot of this. Then we can show that the spectral bond of A plus B is an add-value with a tribute multiplicity one. Multiplicity one. Moreover, the respective advances are positive. Comparing with the results in the case of results of the vexes, like in the Wen Shen Sen and Aiden John's work, here the effect of the vexation yet we don't need any solo subson R. In their work, we can see we need some discontinuous for this. Continuous for this percentage R. But here we don't need such a substance. And before proof of this theorem, we just explain how the growth rates are generated some singularity and how the advancement can help to eliminate such singularity. We just consider the operator R1, like R times U, and it's easy to see the spectrum. it's easy to see the spec set of R1 is just the all points all values of R X zero k X zero belong to R or S for young R k is S and its selected bond S R1 is not an isolated vector point and when we consider the evolution equation U T is equal to R times U. U t is equal to R times U. For example, we just like U Rx equal to zero. That means just at this point, it's the growth rate at zero means the density at this point is invariant for time. And we also set for any other point Rx less than zero. And to solve this simple equation, we can get We can get when t goes to the time goes to infinity, the value of the density of this species at this point x is just its original value, u0 x0. But at any other point, it's equal to zero. That means the special hydrogen. Special heterogeneity of the gross generated singularity. Finally, let's come to our proof. We just show this equations. I mean, let's we consider Ax. Ax is just some vector field on a circle. Then what you just to So this equations and denotes its equations are pi t i and it's very easy to show this part. And we can see to show this part a x we consider the integral of a x one over ax. In this case, since we In this case, since we just assume Ax is larger than z, we can get the finite value of this integral. We just consider the value Tz, that Tz equal to the integral of a circle, and T zero is also large Lazar. And another thing is that means after when a pointer began from Pointer began from the here x after time tz, it's come back to its this point. And for any x, for any x in this circle, and we also can consider how the growth goes through our change when here the time change. Here, the time change, we have found this integral of the growth rate is identical, and that means we just consider its integral from zero to tier zero, and we get the value r bar, which does not depend on this y, this permit y. And then after that, we can assume. Then after that, we can solve this. We can solve this equation. This Howard Dak is one other partial differential equations. And then we can give a process solution of it. And then we just fix the T equal to T zero. Then it's very easy to find that there's a T. To find that there's a t at this point, the solution just comes back to phi x and time sum the gross, the average of the gross rate e gam r bar. That means this operator at T z, T A, T z is just identical operator having some constant. And then we consider, come back to our original non-local diffusion problem and consider the respective evolution equations. And then we get the solution semi-group of it. Under us variation, variation of constant at t equal to tz, we can find that this of it is. That this operator is just like this. This part, the first part, is just some constant times identical operator. And the second part is a integral part. And we can find here, B is integral. And so the operator B is a compact operate. And then for any T belongs to R, this TA, this operate is a strictly positive one. operate is strictly positive and bounded and linear and the integral operator b is strongly positive compact linear and then this operator the integral part is also strongly positive and compact and the grain Zotman's theorem can be applied for this office L2 and the spectral radius of L2 is a principal value with a respective Value with a respective is a principle its principal value with a respective positive add value functions. And for the first part, for this first part, just the identical operate, and then any identity part and then the spectrum radio of it is just equal to the Eugene Poland. The exponents with E R gamma times it has to pass plus R2. Its spectral radius is just gamma bar plus lambda. Lambda is the spectrum of the second part. And it's principal, it's this operator's principle value with a respective positive argument value. positive and value and just use some log we get the spectrum bound of the generator a plus b and it's and get a respective positive and function this is it for the our first results and then a more interesting but difficult difficulty sorry amount of time three two minutes three two minutes okay a more intriguing but difficult case is a advaccine but let we consider some species we why it's very difficult let's consider uh give some examples let's consider some species with density u and consider u ta the token to a x times u the derivative of u you the derivative of u on x and that some point if we have some point x zero such that a x zero is equal to the then at this point there are no more set and if we assume a x less than zero finding x like x less than zero and a x is less than zero for x X larger than zero for x larger than zero, then the species just get to this point x0 is a sink. And since it's a sink, then long time ago, maybe the density of x point can be data function is infinity and can be data function. On the other hand, if this point, another point, If this point, another point xy is the source, then we need to support such motion to leave this point. Then in our time, the density of species at this point also should be largely enough. In other words, there should be some delta function appear at this point. And then? And then, okay, I have no time. I try to, after some substance, at a non-degenerate substance and some other substance, we just consider A like this and reject A plus B like this and consider this part as a process or growth suite. Another substance is this. Another substance is the gross rate at this point, x1, and not that at this point, x0. That means x1 is a more important point. Then we can give us all the, we can get some existence of the value. Just add some parameter s before the integral part s means that s is small, means the. S small means the non-local diffusion is very small, and S-large means the non-local diffusion diffusion is very large. On our subsets, we can have some the following conclusion. That means just to see if S is very large, then this operator has a principal add value with positive ad functions. But if S is very small, then we can't count. We can't consider its spectral bond as a principal ag value, but the respective ag function has some not a smooth function, but with some dark function at the point. And this is our result. I guess we just use some K-Zutman theorem for non-pact positive operators at the same group and use. The semi-group and use some calculus. And finally, let me show you what we used in special strongly Gaudic theory. We just considered that K is just the solution of dx dt minus equal to minus Ax. For this, we just consider any continuous function on S. Then we function on s, then we can find such a grotto steady. This limit is equal to the maximum of phi x0 or phi x1. We use this part to know that these two points are very important. Both and the other points on the circle are not so important. Okay, I'll stop here. Thank you very much.
