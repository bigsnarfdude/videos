Let's see for structures and grape varieties. Okay, uh thank you very much. Uh it's really a pleasure to be here. So this is like my first uh board talk since pandemic. So really excited. So I'm planning to talk about cluster structures on breed varieties and as a consequence it will give us some positive structures on this variety and the construction seems can also be generalized to module space of local systems over surfaces and this Surfaces and which may have some group of structures as well. So I will start with basic definitions. What is a bridge variety? So we fix a group G. This is a complex, a simple group. Of type A B for type A, for example, this is just SL1, please. And I will also fix a pair of an opposite borel of B plus and B minus. Payer of an Of opposite. And another data is not vibrator. This is a sequence of simple reflections I1 to In. And I require that such that it's That is so called demazoo, a product, so delta of beta, which is defined as Si1, that's a simple refraction, and Si2 into Si n. This is the node, this is the longest work of I note. So the Demasu product is defined as the following. So if you have Si times Si, that's your Si. So whenever you have the same simple reflection, they are the same. And then it also satisfies this printer relation. So Si Sgsi is equal to Sj Si is equal to Sj Si Sj. So whenever Sj and I are adjacent and otherwise we have to commute them. So when skill is done. Okay, so and we require that the product is the longest W. Okay. Okay, so then I can just define the brace variety m beta. This is a space of a chains. We first start with E plus. That's a fixed positive volume. E zero. And then E1, E2. V2 into Vn. This is going to be minus. So I further require the relations between V0 and V1 is I1, this is I2, this is I3, and so on. So here first of all, HD So each B and B J for our subgroups of G okay. So in the case of S L and C, they are just a complete flags. And this so the relation between the B i, sorry, B J And Bj plus 1 is denoted by I. This means somehow the T's distance, Vi, Vj and Vj is one of T's distance S I so So, for this one, another way to see this is if you have G, then you have the usual embroidered decomposition, plus W plus W is just the overall element. Then uh we can rewrite Bj as some G1 the the contribution of the positive grail. of the positive graph by G1 and BJ plus 1 is the contribution of the positive graph by G2. Then we see that there are t distance i, this means that g1 inverse g2 is contained in Okay, so that's a this is this is uh the variety that I'm interested. So are there any questions here? They are a sequence of simple reflections. Those are generators of the work group. The workbook. When you write b j cos by pi to b j plus one? Yeah, this means that uh those uh pair of brows of t's distance, t's distance as i and the definitions. Does that make sense? Yeah, I can give a complete example. So sorry, just to uh clarify. Just to clarify, this is some kind of closed sub-variety of the product, well, some kind of product of flag varieties of the group G in question, or I'm just curious as to like it's a product of a fragment rho n, but you have some like uh relative positions for each neighbor pad. For each neighbor pad. So it's some kind of closed, some variety of that product? Actually, it's not closed, it's open. It's open? I see. Okay. Yeah, so I can give an an example. So, I can give an example. Okay, let's say G is S of 3. And then beta, let's take this to be 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1. So, one stands for the simple reflection S1 and two stands for S2. So, then you can draw a corresponding You can draw a blocking and draw a brake so intersection at one here this just intersects as S1, S1, 2, 2, and 1, 1, yeah. Okay, so then we can just assign vector spaces. Vector spaces to the open region. So for the bottom part, it is just a trivial one. And this is C3. And then I put this is L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5. So those L's are just the lines, a one-dimensional space inside S C3. S C3 and then you have F1, F2, F3, and the condition is for every horizontal line, for example here, then you can just read from bottom to the top and this will give us a complete flat. This is atmosphere. F3 So L3 is a line and F3 is a plane. So you can just read it from the left to the right. So every step there is a complete flag. Those those just are corresponding to the flags. To the flexible. Okay, and so the relation between this, the first one, B0 and B1 is S1 means you just you fix all the other subspaces except that you change L1 to L2. Those are just different lines in F1. F1. And from here to here, we change this from L2 to L3. And so on. Okay, so that's just the model space of the sequences like this is called a break ride of data. Some transfer cell only position, yes, L1 and L2 or something? Yes. Okay. So um there is a trace-off at the answer for that in that example. Oh, yeah, so this is just S1 S1 S2 S2 S1 S1. So that's the demo product and S1 times S1 is just S1. And S1 times S1 is just S1 and this is S2. We just take the product of all this. And that that's the longest element. Okay, so And so the main result is the following theorem. So I want to show that this m beta actually is smooth affine right and who's caught in the ring. Who's caught in the ring is naturally and isomorphic to a cluster also magic. And sometimes we just call this empty class Poisson variety. So what is a cluster Poisson algebra? So cluster algebra is defined using some very concrete data, computer data, and then we can just do different pieces together and this will form some nice. Some nice coordinates for this guide. So, the next second part I will talk about some basics on plus H plus. Okay, so this was introduced by Formina and Zelubensky about 20 years ago. About 20 years ago. But my approach will follow the work of Falcon Gontro on the Poisson part of this theory. Maybe, are there any questions so far? Okay, so to define this, I will use something called C. So a C D is just the following d s and the collection of variables x1 and xn so just some form of variables and this n w is a set of variables and this w is a bar vector. W is a bare vector which is written as Aij and Xi partial Xi wedge and Xjasha Xj to all ij from one and two n. And so this AI And so this uh A R J, if you put them together, this is a skew symmetrical matrix. And so geometrically, this will give us some like local coordinate systems and with some Poisson structure. So geometrically we just look at a Taurus C start into n and whose coordinates are given by x1 and to xn and together with Paul's incorrectly xi xj is equal to 8ij. A dij times xi. And sometimes this is just a problem. A log for some structure. So if you take log xi pairing with log xj, then this is just a constant evaluation. So locally, the seed just gives us some tarots together with a Poisson structure and we represent it this way. And here I have another important assumption. So I will fix integer n, which is less than or equal to n, and then I assume that this aik is an integer for all. is an integer for all k between one and two. So uh this one is important because I want to later define some uh mutations such that this one is integer. But the local data is just so essentially we just have some skill symmetric matrix and for the first uh m For the first m rows, they are all integers. Some other condition. Okay, so that's called a seed. And then, given the seed, I can define something called mutations. So I will take an element k from one into m. And then we can get a new C from this Spot, just call it the meeting. This is called mu k of s. So it's a collection of new variables, x1 prime into xn prime and together with us directly w prime. So this x prime, this new variable is equal to x. is equal to x k inverse if then R is equal to k if not then this is equal to Xi plus X K to the power this negative the sine of Aik and then to the power minus Aik. What? Minus ARK. I is not okay. So this is why I require that this this AR integers because this relation is rational. And this w prime is just equal to w. Okay, so these new variables will give us a new torus. And so locally you just have, you start with the torus, you get a new torus, and you can glue them together by this transition line. So that's something that's only for K, let's require the M. K, let's repeat the m, where n was less than oh, yeah, so uh but this i could be any number. Oh, okay, so but I, for here I require that p is from 1 to n. Okay, okay. So the other part, this, these variables are called mutable variables, and the other part are something called flows and models. So that's uh So that's uh and then we have a few remarks So because we uh w prime is equal to w, then I can rewrite this w prime in terms of this new variables. prime in terms of these new variables x prime and this w prime can be the value in terms of these new variables. In fact you can rewrite this as this is of the simple This is of the same form. It can be converted by direct evaluation. X prime. So in terms of these new ones, you get a new skill symmetrical matrix. And they will satisfy the same condition. AI to prime are the gamma integers. So any time. Okay. Okay. So in other words, this new S is a new seed. And then you can you can further mutate this one using different directions. Is this hard to prove? It's just a direct calculation. You can even write down the You can even write down the except explicit formula for the algebra. Okay, so the point is one can one can further mutate this new seed, new k S. And another remark is: if you mutate at the same direction, Mutate at the same direction twice. So if I mutate at k and then immediately I mutate at k again, then actually this evolution will go back to this twice, it goes back to this. The expression of the AG primes in terms of the AG simple. Yes, it's very easy, actually. But there is an explicit function. There is an explicit formula. It's a piecewise linear expression, obviously. Okay, so then I can just, so that's why this is called a C. So if you start with one C, and then you can just do mutation. At like three different directions. We get new one, new one, new two, new three, new four, and so on. Pure mu n s. And so this somehow gives you a stop. And then if you do mu1 at s again, you go back. But you can also mu But you can also mu at the other directions on this one and so on. So eventually this will give infinite many seeds and it grows into sort of like a tree. So that's why this is called seed. So we can further mature many but depending on the matrix could be finite. Depending on the matrix, it could be finite or yeah, actually, that's a very good question. So, one, this is finite, and there is a classification in terms of this thinking diagram. So, that's a very natural result. Okay, so and so now we see that a seed S prime is equivalent to some fixed C S if Fixed the state S if an S prime can be obtained from S by a sequence of mutations. Okay. So in general, given the S, you just get infinite many charts, and then you can just glue them together. This will give us some nice variety. Should be fine or near it. It could be this is fine. And so now E C S prime gives rise to a Laurent polynomial. Which are just as a coordinate of this local torus. So I denote this by C. And then we can define this so-called cluster Poisson algebra So that's u of X that's just the intersection of all such neural polynomials prime for all For all S prime that are equivalent to the initial S. In other words, we start with one initial C and then you do notations, you obtain infinite many new C's. For each C you define a Laurent binomial ring and you consider the intersection. So the elements here are something called a universal Laurent phenomena. The wrong phenomena. It's always the wrong phenomena in every C. The x is for the whole cell. x1 for the y. Say it again? Well, what is the x? x, oh, that's some notation. Actually there are two versions of class algebras. Sometimes you call this uh x cluster x algebra. That's also called a class of postsum algebra. Class of Poisson algebra. And there was another one called class A algebra. So I mean, X is something that just called this type of cluster. Just the type of cluster? Yeah, the X1. Well, X stands for this X variable. Yeah, maybe I should. And this guy. And this guy is has a a natural is a natural a Poisson algebra. Because Because for each seed, there is this W, and this defines a Poisson structure locally, but they are all compatible, so you can glue them together, which makes this naturally a Poisson region. And actually, this one also has a natural quantization. So the idea is you just quantize this, the round-party number really locally, and you also quantize the notation. And you also quantify the notation rules and group them together, it will give us a quantization of this. And this algebra also satisfies many other properties. For example, this has some canonical basis and so on. So that's the definition of cluster personages. How big is it? Yeah. Yeah, very good question. So sometimes it's just empty. But in these next cases, I want to show that this is actually the same as the coordinate ring of the variety. Okay, so um I think I start at 450. And you mean that it's when this graph is of ADE type and that is going to happen then? Or is that too simplistic? When you take the S and you start generating the graph out of it? If it's finite, so A D type, that's why you get none of these braid varieties? It could be uh infinite type. The infinite type as well. Okay, so so now I want to construct this cluster structure on this grid variety, this n. And to do this, I will use something called And to do this I will use something called uh demo zoo weeps. Okay, so these are some commentarial it's a planet graph. Damazoo will be a planet graph whose edges are Are colored by the vertices of the mean diagram are the simple reflections. So uh this some comic horror uh structure follows from this uh Elias and Williamson. Elliott and Williamson. So when they studied the so-called calculus. And later is also introduced by Passaus and Zaslow in the context of contact geometry. So it's some graph, kind of graph, but it can also be generalized to surfaces eventually. Surfaces eventually, but here we just consider this. And so the internal vertices will be of the following pattern. So it can be something like this. It's a turbulent vertex. So if they are labeled by the same simple reflection, this is just a This just encodes this demo zoo product SI times SI is SI and there is also a six-volt vertex I D I F I So this this is one I and D I I and G are adjacent. That's including the Pareto relations, and another one is I and then K. You can just switch them. There's a four-value vertex by I and K and that object. So this is So this is shouldn't be king, I think. So let's consider again this one beta is one one one two two two here this is three this again is a three So this uh demazoo we basically just uh yeah. Basically, just encode how we take the demo product. So if you start with 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2. So you can first of all take the product of S1 as S1, this give us a new S1. And then you can also take the product of this. This going down S1 is S1. So eventually you get 1, 2, 1, 2. And here you can just use a breeder relation again. So this will create a new S2 on the right, and then you can just combine those with S2. So it's got a new S2 here. So this picture is a demazoo wave and somehow it's put this on a disk. I'm not missing a parental graph. With extra lengths, the top is just given by this beta, and the bottom is given by reduced decomposition of the longest element. The longest element you need to do. S2S4S2S4. Yes. But it's not in the wild group, right? Is it? S2S4S. This is the longest work element in for SL space. But you want it with this product at this, the most product. Yeah, but still. It's a reduced is fine. It was to get this. There are there is no such case in SL3. I understand. But in that case, are there no purposes? Or should I think about it as no purposes? There in the purpose of the last one. For this one? In the last one. Is it like no purpose? Okay, so um and here you're And here you put B0, E1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and E6, E7, E8. Those are just a chain of flags that are given inside this uh braid variety. So actually so this picture somewhat give us a subspace of this uh braid variety. Ready variety because generically this P0 is of distance S1 to B2, but they can also be equal to each other. Here, this width just give us some extra condition. And for here, again you have B0 here, this is B03, B4, and B6, and here And here we have a great change. And so this will give us some new, uniquely determined some new flight B9 and B10. Even the demosul waves somehow give us, so each open region of this giveaway is a flag. And so the edge here indicates the neighborhood flag of T's distance. Of T's distance as two of S1. Okay, so and the the key point is that we shall We use this demosul wheel as a 3 to 1 projection from a surface from an S to the disk. So this is a disk and we should actually for each region here we should view them as three layers and so those waves basically just these edges just tell us the intersection of the corresponding layers. For example, if you look at this picture, so you have three layers And for here, I could just intersect that. So eventually that's just a this will give us a surface S to D and so does particular surface? With clear surface or the cover state? It's actually a smooth surface with boundary. Okay, but they intersected here, but you can resolve them also. By gluing together certain parts. Is that I'm sorry? So, how do you construct the surface X? Is it just a blue? Yeah, so here if you're blue. Yeah, so I mean here if you glue them together that's singular. But you have to resolve them. Yeah. But uh for each piece there are three layers. Okay, so and also for each region there is a complete flag and for three layers there are you know zero and at line and a surface in C3 C3 here, and you can take the quotient for each pair. And so, this will give us a line on each surface. So, eventually, you get a line bundle on the surface as well. So, here we get the line bundle on the On the surface S actually with flat connections. Actually, here I lie a little bit, but it should be some uh twisted because uh when you consider the rigid here, When you consider the region here and you take some monogamy around here, which is of uh monogamy minus one instead of one. But anyway, we get some land boundaries denoted by m of s associated to the weight w. And this is, of course, since this is a Lang bundle with also some tribulation. Bounder with also some tribulization on the boundary given by the flag as well. And so this is isomorphic to a torus. The dimension, the length of beta minus the length of the longest value. In this case, it's eight minus eight is five. So locally that's a a Taurus. So Ataras. So, and to define a Poisson structure, you also have the special coordinates. And the key idea is that each button vertex gives a cycle from S on the surface. So we have five. So we have five turbulent vertex here. So for example, from here, you're just going down and add another turbulent vertex. So this corresponding to some cycle. And you pull this back to the surface. So this gives us some cycles here. Similarly, you this guy. And for this one we have to be a little bit careful. For the Chevalian vertex, actually it always cross and ends at the boundary. There is another one here and one more. Anyway, so there is a concrete commentarial rule to define all those cycles. Here we have five different cycles. Okay. And two of them that connect to the boundary. And those ones are called frozen cycles. So those ones we cannot uh mutate them. Gamma 1, gamma 2, and gamma 4 are mutable. And you can just consider the corresponding monogy along this line boundary. And so the monogamy is. Of this gamma i will give us a new variable of xi. So that's our local equates. So locally you just get a torus together with the coordinates xi. And so what are the symbolic of the Poisson structure between them? That's just the intersections of the cycles on the surface. So uh so so if I should write down the bundle conclusion and then overstop. So I So, uh zero suppose for every demo, so we give a low proceed. Further readable and beta. And of course, there might be infinite many demos waves. And the second statement, all the seeds obtain are mutation equivalent. So they all give us a syncluster structure. And now you can define the cluster Poisson algebra. The coordinate ring of the dispute variety is equal to the corresponding class of hydrogen. Okay, so that's a that's what's there. And as an application, because we know there is a way to quantize this, so automatically we get a quantization of the radio line. And also this guy will have a canonical basis. Yeah, and I think that's all. Is the converse also true? If you have a C that is potentially equivalent to one of those, the tool then it also comes from a T-motor leaf? So if I understand what you're saying, too, you're saying that if you take a T-motor beave, you get a mutation equivalent C. Yes. But what if I start with one and I have another C that is mutation equivalent? Does it have to come from a duty? Does it have to come from a demo? No, that's actually a very good question. So, all the demos of weaves will give us seeds, but not all the seeds are from demos weaves. So, actually, it's a very non-trivial question in cluster theory. How do we present all the seeds commentarily? At least partially. Partially represent like all the like uh cluster. All like the cluster of osman answered, but not all of them, yeah. It partially answers the question of why. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's partially because uh all the demazoo waves obtained but glue as some variety which is of coordination 2 in this variety. So, when you consider the coordinate ring, they are just the same. It's like the speaker. Hello. I'll let me for the questions. Hello. Oh, yes. Hi. Hi. This is Lu from Hong Kong. Hi, can I ask you a question? So why did you say there are infinite many demos or leaves? Oh yeah, so for here you you only get like finite many, but there is another thing called partial rotation that I haven't touched. Partial rotation that I haven't taught. So you can somehow rotate this. So before you have something beta on the top and reduce that become the simple W node on the bottom, but if I slightly rotate this and this will give us a new set of demos of waves and all together they will give us infinite many words. They're only five as many reduced words. There are only finance many reduced words and finance many ways you perform the to go to to get to that reduced word. Why there are infinitely many? Yeah, so if you just look at this one, from top to the bottom, there are finitely many. But what I'm saying is there is a new Damazoo wave that I haven't taught. Yes, you slightly rotate this. So if you start with the eye here, you can move this eye. You can move this eye down here and move the other eye to the top. This will give us a new wave. And you can continue to rotate this. And then this will give us infinitely many ones. And actually, it has an application when we also consider something called exact Lagrangian fillings in the study of the rounding dot theory. And so this one will give us infinite many fillings. This one will give us infinite medicine. So each torus corresponds to a logarong fitting. Yes, yes. That's where this comes from. Yes. Okay. They um also uh do you need why do you need the the Amazon product to be doubled? I think that's for this guy to be analyzed, I suppose. Your definition. Your definition? Yeah, so in general, actually, we don't need that, but when you rotate that, then you probably will need that. Can you just start with the ni beta and then request that the not?
