Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good. Right, so I'm happy to introduce Michael Ratz, who is currently at Iron in California, or Irvine, I don't know, whatever way you pronounce it. And he did his diploma and PhD in In Technical University Munich with Manfred Lindner, I think. And then he did postdocs at DAISY and Born. And then he was associate professor at Technical University in Munich between 2006 and 2016. And since 2016, 2016, he has been a professor at the University of California at Ivan, and he's well known for his work in neutrino feminology and the landscape of string orbifolds and feminology. So please, Michael. Yeah, thank you very much for the invitation, a kind introduction. So I'm going to talk about works with many colour writers, some of who are in the audience. Audience. First comment is that really most of this work was very heavily done by Patrick Vodewosh. I just want to appreciate his contributions. I want to also apologize in advance that these slides are 37 years of research. I cannot put too many references because it would be only references. And I'm not giving an overview talk, just some developments. Furthermore, you can see I'm an irvine, and we have the problem of a trout. So, for me, it's very unnatural to think about swampland. It's way too dry here. So, there will be no swampland. And we had all these nice arguments already in the discussion why string theory is important. I mean, it's only gain of in town and. And well, we hope that in somehow will ultimately complete the standard model in the ultraviolet. Now, if you look at this standard model in more detail, then you see that there are three gauge couplings. And possibly these three gauge couplings could unify. So you could possibly explain them or reduce the number of parameters. Then there could be a QCD parameter. Then there could be a QCD parameter, the CETA parameter. Now, there might be no such parameter, and you might have an axion. We don't know yet. There are two Higgs parameters. They are very much related to this hierarchy problem that was already mentioned. So this is the Higgs parameter. But then there are 12 masses of the fermions of the standard model, so 12 mass parameters. And then there are 8 or 10 mixing parameters depending on the mass. 10 are mixing parameters depending on whether neutrinos are Tirak or Majorana particles. And if you just look at the number of parameters, then it's sort of easy to see that the bulk of the parameters of the standard model resides in the flavor sector. So these are parameters that are sort of completely arbitrary numbers in the standard model, input numbers, and we have not really been able to understand them. But since they dominate the unknown, the number of unknown parameters. The unknown, the number of unknown parameters, considerable attention in this talk will be given to these parameters. So we have to say something about them. Now, I should also make some extended comments. So even if we have the standard model, we have to avoid certain things like proton decay. So if you have, I mean, it doesn't, if you just have a standard model, but the proton decays too rapidly. So maybe it's not the UV completion of the theory, you have to also explain. The theory, you have to also explain why neutrinos are very light. And often, these statements are tied to the appearance of a very large or high energy scale, which is able to suppress proton decay, neutrino masses, and so on and so forth. And/or additional symmetries, and often a combination of both. Now, we have discussed this, I cannot say anything about that, so maybe. Say anything about that, so maybe some part of the stabilization of the electroweak scale against the high-energy scale is due to supersymmetry, but we don't really know. So it's certainly there is at least a little hierarchy problem. And the bottom line is, of course, that getting just the standard model spectrum may not be enough. You need to get more out of string theory to be confident that the model that you construct has something to do with. That you construct has something to do with the real world. And we had this also in the discussion. I mean, of course, if you have such a model, then you could conceivably address the questions of the nature of dark matter, inflation, and so on and so forth. But I think it's perhaps worthwhile to focus on models that have a chance to be realistic and take it from there. But that's just an opinion. Now, what I'm going to Now, what I'm going to do in this talk is to focus mainly on heterotic orbifa. So, first of all, the orbifold, the organizers pioneered this field. So, I'm just going to sort of continue. And I'm going also to have in a certain way a modular discussion, which is modular in many ways. It's modular because I'm going to discuss some sort of ingredients that are not. Sort of ingredients that are not necessarily tied to heterodic orbifolds, but then tell you how they are realized in string theory. One of them concerns the origin of CP violation, which might very well be tied to the theory of finite groups. Then I will, of course, try to say something about the masses and mixing parameters and argue that modular flavor symmetries could help us to. Symmetries could help us to understand the observed mixing parameters and make non-trivial predictions. Please notice also that, for instance, the US, the high particle physics experiment that gets perhaps most of the funding these days tuned, which will measure some additional neutrino parameters. And I'm a person who likes predictions more when they happen before the experiment. Happened before the experiment measured something. So it would be important or reasonable to try to make some non-trivial predictions in this field. I will also discuss something that is called generation flow. I will define what this means and address some of the shortcomings of the MSSM, focusing on our symmetries, which are some Are some things that happen that have been derived in Orbifold, and they're probably, of course, present in many other constructions, even though they're not necessarily discussed very much. And as I said, I will consider orbifolds. The title of this workshop has symmetries in the idea, yeah, contains the word symmetries. And orbifolds, of course, have usually a lot of symmetries. They can be sort of as being the orbifold point is sort of a symmetry enhancement. Orbifold point is sort of a symmetry enhanced point. You can destroy some symmetries by breaking them spontaneously, but it's often a good idea to start with these symmetries. Good. And some symmetries of this type could be flavor symmetries. Already, it has already been mentioned that there's a curious feature in the standard model, namely repetition of families. And I agree that string theories predict a repetition of families, but very often this comes together with some flavor. comes together with some flavor symmetries which will lead to this repetition and the mini so-called minimal flavor violation has already been discussed by Tatsugu. Now these days in the bottom-up literature there is a popular scheme, these finite flavor symmetries. So these are finite groups which can Groups which can relate the three families that we observe. As shown in this picture, all of the relate the different families. And of course, if you work on grand unification, then there are also relations within the families, which are the grand unified relations. And you could argue that the repetition of the families is a prediction of the symmetry. So, well, you could also say you injured the symmetry such that it gives rise to the repetition, but anyway. To the repetition, but anyway, and one reason for looking at finite symmetries is, of course, that anomaly constraints are less stringent than for continuous flavor symmetries. And the hope is that imposing these symmetries can reduce the number of parameters and can lead to unequivocal predictions, possibly. So, this is what one hopes when playing these games. Games and there are many examples such as A4 and so forth, but I will discuss A4 a little bit later to the tiny extent. But of course, there's a huge abundance of finite groups. However, one particularly curious feature about these finite groups is that they are different from the continuous symmetries that we are so used to work with in one important aspect. And this one important aspect concerns the fact that. Important aspect concerns the fact that finite groups can be sort of the reason for CP violation, as I'm going to explain in what follows. Now, CP violation is an observed fact, but it has been only observed in the flavor sector so far, which also constitutes the so-called strong CP problem. And because it has been observed in the flavor sector, it's of course natural to seek a connection between flavor and physics and ZP. Physics NCP and flavor symmetries of NCM3. And one way to address the flavor structure could be non-abelian discrete symmetries. And what I'm going to discuss here is the relation between such non-abelian discrete flavor symmetries and CP. So what's the relation between these? To start, let us first look at the continuous groups, the elite groups. We do typically not discuss very much about these facts, but in this continuous group, you can impose a so-called canonical CP transformation, which often involves some outer automorphism of the group. If you have something like the SU groups or SO2N or E6, and you can at each step. And you can, at each step in the standard model, when you embed this in some trend unified series, whenever this is a chiral representation, then you can impose some outer automorphism. And this could then warrant CP conservation. So you're always free to do this. And now you could think that since these finite groups can be always embedded in such a continuous group, you should also be able to impose CP for any finite group. CP for any finite group that could be out there. However, it turns out rather perhaps surprisingly that this is not at all true. It is not true that for any finite flavor symmetry, you can impose CP. So they can clash with CP. Now, I don't want to go into all these technical details. There are tons of backup slides. Actually, majority of these slides are backup slides. But you can convince. But you can convince yourself of some basic facts using finite group theory that there are different types of outer automorphisms of these groups. Some of the outer automorphisms constitute proper CP transformations. And by proper CP transformations means that if these automorphisms are symmetries of your theory, then all these so-called CP Then all the so-called CP violating observables are guns, so no CP symmetries indicate, and so on and so forth. And obviously, violation, breaking this symmetry is a prerequisite for biogenesis to reproduce the observed CP violation and so on and so forth. Unfortunately, in the literature, there were also, well, there is also the term of generalized CP transformations around, which is sometimes not very accurate. Sometimes not very accurate because it could be also a CP-like transformation which somehow involves an auto-algemorphism, but the physics does not prohibit physical CP violation. So I just want to make you aware of this complication in naming. So there are CP-like transformations, which some people like to call generalized CP transformations, but they really have nothing to do with physical CP. Okay, good. Now, having said this, it turns out that the finite groups come in two in three classes. So, finite groups have outer automorphisms. And now you have to ask whether there is any outer automorphism which can serve as a CP transformation. And this is a question which has yes and no answers. Now, there is a technical toll, the so-called twisted Frobenius shoe. Twisted Frobenius Schur indicator, which I'm not going to discuss, but there is a simple way to figure that out group theoretically. And if you do not have such an outer automorphism, then Cp is broken. There is no physical CP transformation that you can impose, which does not clash with this finite group. And I'm going to discuss, of course, an example. If you can impose CP, then there are still two cases. Then there are still two cases. So there's another sort of two cases. The theory could be such that you can even find a basis in which all Klebschgordens are real and where you wouldn't suspect any CP violation. But surprisingly, there are also groups which have the property that there's no basis in which all Glappschgaudens are real, but nevertheless, CP is conserved. CP is conserved. But of course, I'm going to focus on what has been called type 1 groups in this context. And the type home message from this slide is that there can be finite groups that clash with CP. Obvious question is how can we get those? You can, of course, always impose those. But what I want to talk about here is that even the very first stringy models of particle physics proposed by some of the organizers actually. Proposed by some of the organizers actually had a built-in mechanism for CP violation, so it's really tied to String C in a sort of in a somewhat surprising way. But just to give you an idea what these groups that clash with CP are like, so they are actually not very super rare, rather any finite group with an odd order, an odd number of elements while HCP. Number of elements while HCP. But there are also groups which have an even number of elements like delta 54, which I'm going to discuss in a minute. Many groups do not violate CP. And there are also some examples of these exotic, somewhat more exotic groups, which do not violate CP, but have no basis in which all collapses are real. But what I want to discuss. But what I want to discuss since this is string pheno right now is how we get this delta 54 from string theory. Now, you see some of the people who attend here were responsible for some of the very first models of string phenomenology based on the C3 orbifold. And if you look at one orbifold plane in the C3 orbifold, it looks a little bit like Before that, looks a little bit like something that Fernando has called a ravioli. So, there are these three fixed points, each of these fixed points can carry a family. And you see that somehow this picture already suggests that there's a symmetry that relates these families. So, somehow you can rotate them. And together with Stuart and Peter and Tatsu, we worked out in the older days that there is indeed a delta 54 flavor symmetry in the. The delta 54 flavor symmetry in this model. Now, in order to understand this symmetry a little bit better, I heard also recently a paper with Patrick where we looked at just orbifold guts. And to our greatest surprise, we found that orbifold guts actually missed a lot of important symmetries that are often outer automorphisms of the low-energy group. And this also happens in the G SU3, an orbifold gut with an SU3 gauge group. Gut with an SC3 gauge group, overfault by SC3. It turns out that the condition for the remnant gauge symmetry was not completely appropriate, at least not in the bottom-up literature. And it turns out that there are residual symmetries that have been missed previously. Now, I'm only telling you this because in this case, orbifolding this SU3 will break it down to U1 cross U1 times an outer. Times an outer automorphism C3 symmetry that has been sort of missed previously. Other symmetries that have been missed was the left-right parity, which is actually a gauge symmetry in partis Salaam and so on models that have been constructed. But the reason why I'm talking about this here is that Tatsu, with collaborators, has discussed how this SU3 symmetry is really a gauge symmetry in the string models. Models or how this delta 54 is in fact really a gauge symmetry. So, this proceeds in two steps. You look just at the toros at the toros level, you have a gauged SU3 symmetry. You orbifold it, you get this combination of these two U1s along with the C3 orbit, the outer automorphism symmetry. And once you go away from the self-dual. Once you go away from the self-dual point, this gets broken to C3, cross C3, semi-direct C3, and this is just delta 54. So this delta 54 is really a gauged flavor symmetry. So that's important, I think, if you want to ask about the reliability of these symmetries, but they turn out to be gauged. In fact, there is a much bigger symmetry that comes into play. This is something that Peter. comes into play. This is something that Peter and Saul and Patrick pioneered. These are the so-called eclectic symmetries. You can look at the full symmetries of this plane and it turns out that this flavor symmetry is just a small part and I'm going to comment a little bit more on this eclectic scheme a little bit later. It's just to tell you that the delta 54 is not the only thing that pops out here. Now, if you look at particle physics, At particle physics models using this, then you can have models in which the three families are sitting at the three fixed points and they will transform as a triplet or an anti-triplet under this delta 54. In fact, Saul has constructed a model of this type. So I'm just mentioning this because I'm not talking about the MTZ. There are models which have standard model spectrum where this is the flavor symmetry. The flavor symmetry. Good. So, this is a particle physics model. And now I've already told you that delta 54 is something that clashes with Cp. So you expect that there is CP violation. And we will, of course, see that there is CP violation. But it is a little bit harder to explicitly verify that than one might initially think. If you look at the massless representations of this model, that means the twisted states, then you get only Then you get only triplets under this delta 54 and some non-trivial one-dimensional representations. And it turns out that at this level of this truncated representation content, you can still find outer automorphisms, which are not really CP transformations, but just acting on these representations, they can serve as something like CP and forbid physical CP violating processes. So, there's a candidate for CP transformation. Now, you might wonder whether CP is not really violated or not. It turns out that it is. And to see why that is, you have to remember that this is a string theory. String theories, of course, have not just the mass the spectrum, which we often care about in the effective description. They also have additional modes. And the modes that are important of And the modes that are important for the subsequent discussion are the winding modes. And it turns out that there are certain winding modes. And you can then ask what are the representations of these winding modes under this delta 54 symmetry. And it turns out that they furnish some two-dimensional representations. And now once you have all these representations, it's no longer possible to find a CP candidate and CP is broken. Of course, you may You may not be happy with just the statement that CP is somehow broken. You might want to see some explicit verification, and this explicit verification can occur through so-called basis invariants, which are often used to really prove that some theory is CP violating. And we constructed or found such a basis invariant that does the job. And one way to see some fish. To see some physical processes that violet CP is to look at the decay of a doublet into triplets. There's such a decay. And you can compute the decay amplitude. And then you find that there's CP violation in these decays. And of course, there are many other observables, but once you have seen that CP is violated somewhere, it's just violated. But beyond that, we have not really worked out the phenological. Worked out the phenological implications except for a small comment that I'm going to make later. Good. Now, it is sort of amusing, at least to me, that in order to see that this theory really violates CP, you have to also include the states that usually are used to complete the theory in the ultra-violet, so which give rise to all these nice properties of string theory versus just quantum physics. Properties of string theory versus just quantum field series. You have all these winding modes which sort of save you in the UV, but they are also responsible here in this very simple model already for CP violation. Good. Now, another side remark, something that was and to some extent is still bugging me, is that it seems a little bit what's happening is looks a little bit strange because you could. Because you could embed these finite symmetries in an SUC, say. Now, at the SUC level, I told you you can always impose CP. You can break it explicitly if you wish, but you can always impose it. And I told you that the subgroup does not have a CP transformation. Now the question is: where does CP broken if you break SU3, let's say, to delta 54? Possible options include. Possible options include that CP is broken by the WEF that facilitates the breaking. That's a plausible option. Or the resulting setting, if I do this like this, then I told you that if I have the if I have only a spare truncated representation content, I may still somehow preserve Cp. Now, these are the obvious options that one could. That one can think of. However, it turns out that neither of them is realized. Neither of these sort of obvious options is the case. Rather, what really happens is that the two outer automorphisms still exist in this originally CP conserving SUN series. However, it no longer warrants CP conservation. And we worked out a model with many, many, many cross-chains. out a model with many many many cross checks and saw this explicitly because it seems to be a little bit odd but i mean according to all i know this is really what happens the next topic that i'm going to address here are modular flavor symmetries this is something that tatsuo already has mentioned and this is not an audience where i have to really talk a lot about modular transformations so modular transformations i certainly come from tori at least in the simplest case At least in the simplest case, where you cut a torus open, make it a lattice where you identify the blue and the red edges if you wish. And you can therefore identify a torus with a lattice who's banned by two lattice vectors. But of course, as everybody knows, these lattice vectors are not unique. You can get the same torus by choosing different lattice vectors. And those transformations that relate Transformations that relate physically equivalent lattices or lattices or choices of basis vectors that give rise to the same tori are the modular transformations. You all know this. This is something that happens in string theory all the way. And this just gives rise to the modular transformations. And this is an infinite dimensional discrete group with infinitely many elements. Many elements. There are two generators that you can pick. One is in a certain way exchange of these two lattice vectors, and the other one is a shift of one of the lattice vectors by one. And then you get, can represent or can generate this whole group using these generators. Now, the idea of modular flavor symmetries is in a certain way to start with those modular transformations. With those modular transformations that are well known, but now impose some additional stuff to get some flavor symmetries. And this is something that already has been introduced in Tatsuo's talk. So you take the modular group, but divide it by a subgroup where you identify elements through some mod condition that is detailed here. And this n here is also the so-called level. And And these finite subgroups are groups that have been popular in bottom-up model building anyway. So, for instance, if you construct gamma 3 that way, you get the A4 symmetry, which is the symmetry of a tetrahedron. So, this is a tetahedron. You've probably seen this. It has many symmetries. You can rotate it around many axes. And the emerging symmetry group is some non-abelian finite group. And it can be also. That group. And it can be also constructed in this way as by taking this quotient. And if you want to know more about this tetrahedron, then you can look up Wikipedia. But that's not so necessarily important for this talk. What is important is that you can now make predictions for flavors physics, possibly. And this works as follows. So first of all, you have all heard about Model F4. You have all heard about modular forms. For instance, Fernando's lecture notes from the 90s has already mentioned that Yukava couplings are modular forms. In some heterotic orbifolds, the modular forms come with also called modular weight. Now, what is important, if you look at modular forms at some level, so in a certain way, if you mod out the symmetry, then you get, in addition to this modular weight, To this modular weight, you get systems where the modular forms get rotated by some representation matrix of this gamma n. And these can be symmetries like A4 and so on and so forth. And now in a bottom-up approach, Ferulio just asked the question: what happens if we take the Yukawa couplings to be such modular forms? So, what kind So, what happens then? And he presented a model which initiated a huge amount of literature. So, he presented a very simple model where he assigned certain representations under this A4 or modular group with a certain level. And importantly, this model is very predictive. So, I'm not going to. Predictive, so I'm not going to work out any details and so on and so forth. But the important fact is that in this model, you can convince yourself that the Weinberg operator that ultimately describes the genome masses is entirely specified by the symmetries of the model. And it has this form here. It has this form where you have three modular forms that you can construct or work out. And therefore, this whole And therefore, this whole neutrino mass matrix in this model depends only on three parameters. This is this lambda. And then there is this tau, which is the modulus, if you wish, which has a real and imaginary part. So there are three parameters. Once you specify those, the whole neutrino mass is given. And if you look at this, this basically suggests that if you have specified these three parameters, Specify these three parameters, you predict nine observables. And the nine observables are three Trinomass eigenvalues, three mixing angles, and three phases. And this is a rather highly predictive scheme. So usually, I mean, this is not something that often happens, at least not in this kind of model building. And even more amazingly, this sort of works. So this is a very constrained system, but it turns out that. But it turns out that the predictions are sort of consistent with observation. And you predict nine things that are in principle observable. Some of them have been observed. Many of them, the mixing angles are known, two delta M squareds are known. And the current observed values are sort of consistent with this prediction, which is amazing. And then, of course, you make predictions on the up. And then, of course, you make predictions on the absolute neutron mass scale and DCP phases, which can and will be measured at some point. Good. So, this is something which has caused a lot of excitement. And this scheme is much more predictive than the traditional bottom-up traditional finite flavor symmetry models because instead of having all Models because instead of having all these flavors, you have only this one modulus tau. And once you fix this, you're done. However, it actually turns out that these predictions are not really reliable. And this has to do with the fact that in this model, if you really look at the symmetries, the kinetic terms of the meta fields are not fixed by the symmetries. It turns out that It turns out that if you really look at this model, then you can add a lot of other things that also involves this triplet of modular forms. You find a lot of additional invariants that can be added to the Keller potential of the theory. And in this approach, all these terms are the same footing. This is a non-linearly realized symmetry. Each of these terms is as important as the term that was considered in the original model. The original model. So you have now all these additional parameters, alpha k that you can introduce. And just to give you an idea what these parameters do, they actually completely destroy the predictions of this model in many ways. So it's just one example, one of these many alphas, you turn it on, and the mixing angles gets drastically changed. And of course, for me personally, this is on. For me personally, this is a motivation to again look at string theory because, first of all, something like these modular transformations seem to be something that can be realized in string theory, and in fact it is, as we will see. But in string theory, we could have more information about this such models, and in particular, also have some control over the calor potential. So we need more ingredients to get going. Get going. And anyway, so I mean, you'll never be happy with just having a model of flavor. We want to connect it to the big questions of our time. So, and one way to go is something that Peter and Saur pioneered, was the so-called eclectic flavor symmetries, which are still to some extent bottom-up at some level, but are more powerful than the original proposed symmetry. However, I'm now However, I'm not going to really discuss all of those in detail. I want to discuss some simple examples in which we sort of see how these modular flavor symmetries really emerge from something that looks stringy enough. It's still simple enough to be described in simple terms, but it's somehow stringy. Now, it turns out that the flavor symmetries that we obtain when we are doing this are metaplectic. And I want to just tell you how that works. We were following the pipe. We were following the pioneering work by Lewis and collaborators who looked at magnetized tori. But as already discussed previously, magnetized tori are dual to deep line models and so on and so forth. But they are nice toy models for understanding some chiral models with massless chiral zero modes. Now the zero modes in this magnet test tools have been explicitly worked out. They depend on many parameters, but you get a repetition of families by turning Get a repetition of families by turning on some flux parameters. If you put on some integer, you get an integer m repetition of families. And other than that, the theorem mods have surprisingly simple form. They are also so-called Wilson line parameters and so on and so forth. But it's really all boils down to some Jacobi theta functions. Good. Then there's a normalization factor in front. From this normalization, you can Front from this normalization, you can read off the modular weights of the corresponding fields, and you see that there's sort of a factor of one-fourth, and this turns out to lead to modular fractional model weights one-half, which is why we are talking about meta-plectic symmetries. Now, Lewis and collaborators have worked out elaborate models where you have the n-theory with a sort of number of fluxes, this number of Of number of fluxes. This number of fluxes gives number of different families. And these are all sort of now not so important details, but somehow the number of families is the differences between fluxes. And this can be always some integers. And you get now repetition of families by just turning on some appropriate fluxes. There are certain constraints, a sum rule that these differences, of course, have to vanish. And importantly, you can also Importantly, you can also work out the Yokava couplings of these settings. And the Yokava couplings, as already mentioned by Tatsu, can be computed via computing overlaps between different wave functions. So these are completely predicted by this theory. Again, there are some Wilson lines and so on and so forth that in principle appear, some normalization factors and so on and so forth. And what has been done? And what has been done in the literature was to write down the Yukova coupling as a sum of theta functions. Now, it turns out that for our purpose to really find out what the modula or metablactic flavor symmetries of this model is, working with these thumbs is a little bit inconvenient. For that purpose, okay, so sorry about all these extra details. So, there are a lot of things, and if these slides will be posted, and Louis' paper is very readable. And Lewis' paper is very readable. But anyway, so we can work out these Jukava couplings. And the well, there were expressions that are sums that give rise or to describe these Yukawa couplings. And as already mentioned previously, there are relations also of such couplings. If you square them, basically, you can get something that looks like a heterotic orbifoid coupling. Good. Good. If one of these flux parameters is one, then there is no sum and you have simple expressions and they have been used a lot. But what happens if there's no of these flux parameters zero is something that, well, they have an expression that is correct, but this was not as useful as it could have been for our purpose. And therefore, we used some elementary number theory to reduce the sum to Um, reduce this sum to just a single theta function, describes all the cases where you have arbitrary flux parameters. It's a very nice exercise in simple number theory, but and involves the Euler phi function that can be used to solve linear congruences that appear as select jingles in this business. But anyway, so there is this Euler phi function, there are the flux parameters, and what is also important is that this all Is that this all important parameter in this game is the lowest common mean of these flux parameters, or the number of generations, if you want. The other things that I thought represent the selection rules, if you want, of these models. But importantly, since these things are theta functions and they are only so in so many theta functions, that That with this, yeah, there's only so in so many theta functions with this upper characteristic. There is actually not so many independent couplings in these models. The number of independent couplings only depends on the lowest common mean of the flux integers. And this means that if you have a model with one, two, and minus three generations, it has as many independent couplings as a model with three, three, minus six. So they're always. So there are always different multiplets with different multiplicities, but the number of couplings is only determined by this lowest common mean. Even more importantly, perhaps these cup expressions are very useful to derive the modular flavor symmetries. Now, why do you expect modular flavor symmetries to emerge from the scheme? It's very simple. I mean, if you do a modular transformation, you will still have the same torus, but it somehow transforms the wave functions. Transforms the wave functions because the wave functions get transformed, you will somehow have rotation matrices. You can write this as a rotation matrices acting on the Yukava couplings. And these are rotation group matrices that belong to some finite flavor symmetry. And they then determine the metabletic flavor symmetries of this model. And what we find And what we find is that the symmetries are again given by this lowest common mean, and there is a so-called gamma2 tilde symmetry. Now, it is not so super important to tell you what this gamma tilde tilde symmetry precisely is, because probably you all know that these metaphysic symmetries are a little bit cumbersome. You have to play with signs, so it's not just sufficient to have these generator matrices, you have also to keep track of signs. Keep track of science. But what is important is that people in the bottom-up approach have looked at these meta-plectic symmetries and proposed or used them as flavor symmetries for realistic model building. And they precisely get the same symmetries in a bottom-up approach without any appeal to any torus and so on and so forth. And precisely get the same symmetries as we get in the more top-down approach. In the more top-down approach. So, the bottom line is there is an explicit connection between bottom-up metal building with this model out of meta-plactic flavor model building and some existing models of the literature. So, existing models of the literature already exhibit these symmetries. There's a slight subtlety that has also led to confusion in the literature. So, the naive expectation is that if you have a transformation. Is that if you have a transformation, a modular transformation on the torus, this will sort of just reshuffle the zero modes. So, usually. However, it was experimentally or empirically discovered in the literature that this is actually not something that happens if the number of generations is odd, if there's some flux parameter that is odd. However, this is not a problem. It doesn't lead to any inconsistency. Rather, Inconsistency. Rather, the full picture is that under a modular transformations, it's not only that the zero modes mix, but they sort of also get shifted. Or if you want, the Wilson line gets shifted by some discrete amount. So you have in the end a fully consistent picture. Can you easily use Wilson line shifts or Schokschwart parameters? But in any case, so you find that this is all working out. And you have a precise match with the metaplectic flavor symmetry. The metaplectic flavor symmetries that have been studied or proposed in bottom-up model building. And to the best of my knowledge, this is actually the only example where one of these model of level symmetries that have been proposed in the bottom-up approach have been reproduced or really derived explicitly from something that looks more stringy or has a U, well, has at least some explicit torus. Now, these Now, these bottom-up papers, of course, they have found realistic models. They have found most realistic models. Now, you could hope that this will allow you to also construct realistic models using these tori or d-planes or whatever you like. It turns, however, out that this is not so easy. And the reason why this is not so easy is that in the bottom-up approach, they can put in representations. Put in representations as they like, they can put in modular weights as they like, and we cannot do this in a top-down approach. So that means that we only get sort of the symmetries, but at this point, we are not able to precisely reproduce the bottom-up models. But at least, okay, there's some science, some hint that all these modular flavor symmetries somehow fit into explicit string models. Yet a detail. Yet a detailed detailed picture has not yet emerged at this point. Good. So this is this. So then I want to comment on the eclectic flavor symmetries that Peter and Saul have produced. Actually, they have a very nice geometric interpretation. So they look at the flavor symmetries. Symmetries and realize that they are actually outer automorphisms of the Narine lattice. And you see, in a certain way, these eclectic symmetries are the marriage between some traditional flavor symmetries like A4 and some model group. Now they chose to write this union symbol here. And this can give you some explicit examples, some you can look. Explicit example, some you can look up in some gap or so, some GL23, never mind. But they have these explicit symmetries that really come from strings. And they always involve some sort of modular flavor symmetry or metaplectic or something of that sort. In addition, they include some traditional flavor symmetries. They also include R symmetries, which are really nothing but discrete remnants. Really, nothing but discrete remnants of the Lorentz transformations that you originally had. And then additionally, CP symmetries and other automorphisms, that is, CP-like transformations. And it turns out that you can convince yourself that all these symmetries ultimately gauge. So basically have to look at all trevios where they tell you why the duality transformation and so on gauge. Probably you all know this. And Tsatsu showed that. Tsatsu showed that these delta 54 and so on symmetries are gauged, and in the end, you find out that they are all gauged. However, it's so far, certainly far from hopeless, but so far there is no explicit realization of successful bottom-up models in this scheme. However, there's one key ingredient of the eclectic scheme which can be very helpful for the bottom-up method. Can be very helpful for the bottom-up model building. And I'm not going to use a fully fledged eclectic symmetry to make this point, but I'm using something simpler. So I'm using now just to illustrate that there's big hope to really address sort of the shortcomings of the bottom-up construction. You can do something, you don't take the union, but you take just a direct product of the modulus symmetry, not the traditional symmetry. And if you And if you break this product down to a diagonal subgroup, then it turns out that the Yukawa couplings or Weinder operators are still modular forms. However, you have full control or have at least an expansion control over the kinetic terms. So you have control over kinetic terms. And we found that in some region of the parameter space, the control is good enough to make predictions where the error the theoretical. Predictions where the error, the theoretical errors, are smaller than the experimental errors. So, this now you can now build predictive models of flavor by just taking the simple trick, which is really inspired or borrowed from the eclectic scheme. Good. Finally, I want to just make one more comment concerning string model building. And this comment concerns something that we have called generation flow. There's a long history of this. There's a long history of this. So, many years back, Nelson and Strassler built a model in which one generation of the MSSM was sort of a generation of composites. Now, there are stringy models where in a certain way, the number of generations at the high scale gets affected or changes. Gets affected or changes. These are very interesting models, which I would like to understand better. But now it also turns out that more recently, Ratzamat and Tong have used something that is basically the charge conjugate of the Nelson-Strassler model to give mass to chiral generation. So what they basically did is to generate chiral generation, anti-generation from some composites and made and therefore could pair up some chiral. Could pair up some chirage generation. Now, in this talk, I want to ask to which extent such models like Nelson Strassler or Rasma Tong can be really occur in string theory. Now, let me just explain to you what these models really are. These models have something, some SU5, or more precisely, in the end, it's an SU6 symmetry, which you could say this is the standard model symmetry. Could say this is the standard model symmetry, so you can break it to the standard model. This symmetry is not so important, that's sort of a global or weakly gauged spectacle symmetry, which you can break the subgroups and so on and so forth. But in addition, there's an SU2S that somehow gets strong. Now, the original matter content of this model contains two comma six bar. So, this is a six bar and it is SU6 and a two. And a 15 thread of SU6. Now, you might be more familiar, more inclined to believe that this could have something to do with the standard model if you write this down in SU5 language. There, it's a five bar, two, one, two, ten, one, and five, one. And if you now just ask how many standard model generations are here, well, you see you have here 10, two, five bars. Here 10, two five bars, and a five. You could, in some sense, pair up one of these five bars with this five, and you are left with one generation of the standard model. So, from the standard model point of view, this is just one generation plus a vector-like pair. However, it turns out that when this SU2 becomes strong, then in a certain way, the series undergoes something that has been called S-confinement, where S stands for suspicious. Suspicious. And you get these states from composites, which transform as a 15-bar under SU6, or in SU5 languages as 10-bar plus 5-bar. And this means the whole story confines to something that's completely vector-like on the SU5 or SU6. And that means you started out with a parallel theory. Started out with a pirate theory, but it somehow condenses to a vector-like theory. And now, if you have appropriate trilinear couplings in your theory, then these vector-like states can acquire mass. And just to give you an example, there are models where you start off. Okay, so we're looking at these models and asking whether we can get them from string theory and can sort of remove or add a generation. To the theory through this S confinement or through this generation flow. And this can happen. So, for instance, you can start with four generations, but this additional SU2. And after the SU2 confines, you have four minus one generations with three net generations. And again, provided that the required couplings exist, you can get rid of one. You can get rid of one pair of vector-like families. You can also add a family that way. So just to start with something that's sort of the conjunct gate there, this is more like the original Nelson-Schrassler model. And you start basically with two generations, two net generations at the high scale, but the low energy effective theory has three generations. Less vector-like. Now, if you look at this model, it looks a little bit contrived perhaps because you have this specific representation content and SU6 and SU2. And you can ask whether this is contrived or perhaps by rock. But it turns out to be exceptional. It turns out that this representation group, so this is a maximum subgroup of E6, and the representation content that I was always using. Representation content that I was always using is just a 27 plat of E6. And therefore, it's no wonder that all these anomalies cancel and so on and so forth. And whenever you see it in E6, you can ask whether or not this whole thing fits into string theory. So that's something that we studied. And of course, if you want to embed this into string theory, you want to have other reasons why this SU2 is so much more strongly coupled than this SU6. More strongly coupled than this SU6. Now we asked the Orbit folder or Saul asked the Orbit folder to scan for models that can potentially give us what we want. And Saul usually gets these things. So what we get is that they are indeed stringy heterotic orbifold models that based on C4 cross C2 and C4 cross C2 orbifold, which have models that can That can give rise to such schemes. And importantly, in these models, these models were designed in such a way that the SU2 and the SU6 come from different E8s. And in this case, you can at least hope that the SU2 is much more strongly coupled than the SU6 and can perhaps say that something like this could be the standard model. Good. So since I'm running out of time, I just tell you that this happens, that works out. So there are models that look, maybe find that they have originally just four or two generations. We found that all decouplings exist, that we need to decouple exotics and so on and so forth. They are supersymmetric vacua that give rise to something that looks like this Nelson-Schusler or what's. Looks like this Nelson's Chesler or Watson Martong models. And the upshot from all this is that, of course, if you are scanning for three-generation models, you may miss some potentially realistic models because these models here that I just introduced look like completely wrong if you just look at the tree-level spectrum that you get from something like an orbifold or some other scanning tool. Because you would say, oh, this is a two-generation model. I don't need two generations. I don't need two generations, but it turns out that with this strong dynamics, it actually is a three-generation model. So the upshot is that within the low energy effective theory, the chiral spectrum may change. And obviously, there are many more models. And maybe these tricks can be also used to decouple other things that we don't need. Good. And certainly, I mean, at least for me personally, it would be better to understand. Me personally, it would be better to understand the QFT dynamics or better, but okay. Finally, I would not have time to that. I wanted to also comment on the asymmetries for the MSSM. So these are important things that possibly important things that also have undergone revisions in the recent years. But I only mention this to remember Cram Ross, who I was fortunate to collaborate with on this topic. So thanks to Cram and so on. To cram and so on. We were working out some RS images, but again, I'm not going to discuss them because I'm out of time. Let me just summarize. The summary of all this talk is, so first of all, the message is something that I think anybody working with string theory always believed that modular invariance is very important. And of course, for string theory, this has always been the case. That is a very important thing. A very important thing. More recently, you see that there are also people working on finite integrals, which originally have nothing to do with string CSD, also discover modular forms. And Keith and collaborator have also proposed that this can have advantages when doing regularization. However, Keith postponed his seminar, so I really cannot talk much about this. And a point that I wanted to make here is that conceivably this modular invariant. Conceivably, this modular invariance is also a powerful tool to address the flavor questions of the standard model. So this modular invariance, once you learn it, you can not only use it for single, but for many other things as well. I have argued that you can have repetition of families which can enjoy flavor symmetries. And one point that I want to stress again, if you have flavor If you have flavors images of a certain type, not a very bizarre type, a very common type, then this can already be the source of CP violation. And actually, it turns out that one of the first models ever that have been proposed in the string pheno community have already all the necessary ingredients. So I had no time to discuss R symmetries. So R symmetries can So, our symmetries can be instrumental. And well, obviously, we have worked hard to find, or not so hard actually, but it's not so hard to find models that have the phenomenologically desirable R symmetries, and they really emerge as discrete remnants of the Lorentz symmetry. Then there's a new game in tone in some sense. These are the eclectic symmetries, which contain the flavor symmetries, but they also contain the Symmetries, but they also contain the R symmetries and the CP symmetries and all these modular things. And at least the true eclectic symmetries appear in explicit string models, and they seem to have a lot of the ingredients that we need to make the existing flavor symmetries truly predictive. Now, we don't have as of now explicit string models that. Explicit string models that have flavor symmetries and are fully realistic at the same time. But on the other hand, I mean, the bottom-up models are also not complete without additional input. So in some sense, we hope that this merges at some point. And I also commented on the fact that there can be non-trivial strong dynamics, which in a certain way invalidate to some extent some of the model scans that I was involved in, because we may have. Because we may have easily overlooked potentially promising models. As a side remark, I told you that one obstacle in constructing these modular flavor symmetries, realistic versions from strings, is that the modular weights that the bottom-up people just take arbitrary as they wish. They are, of course, predicted by string theory. And it seems very naively that there is only a very narrow selection, but. Narrow selection, but at least naively, if you have a generation that is made of such composites, then they have more freaky modular weights. So maybe this can help eventually to combine these observations. Now, something that I had no time, but I think is very important. I mean, we have not seen supersymmetry, but for the whole field, it might be important also to revisit non-supersymmetric model building as pioneered by Keys and Alon and others. And obviously, In others, and obviously, new ideas are perhaps even more important. I don't know. It turns out, actually, if you look at these model of labor symmetries, they may not necessarily require supersymmetry, but I cannot make more than just vague statements on this. Well, we hope, of course, that next year we will learn more about this modular flavor symmetries in Bonn, where some of us will meet. That's just an outlook. So, we really hope. Just an outlook. So, we really hope that we can have this workshop and nobody cheats when doing the corona test, or no corona test will be necessary at this time. And yeah, so that's basically the end of the talk. I have also prepared provocative questions for the discussion session, but I don't need to ask these provocative sessions because I'm already out of time, but I'm happy to ask them if somebody wants me to. Thank you very much for the very much for the attention for paying attention thank you uh shaul am i uh supposed to continue uh yes of course of course okay thanks it wasn't clear to me right so thank you uh michael um for the nice talk uh With a nice talk. Are there any questions? Right, so maybe I can ask a few. Right. So in your discussion of CP violation, so the two questions, have you looked at the Yasko parameter? Absolutely. Yeah, I told you that one way to explicitly verify that there are Explicitly verify that there is really CP violation is look at to look at the basis invariants. And the most prominent of those is the Yalscock invariant, right? I mean, this is how you do CP violation in the standard model. Now, there's a huge, much bigger scheme which produces Yalscock-like invariants. These are the so-called basis invariants that you can look at to establish CP violation. And then you what numerity do you get sufficient amount of? Oh, sufficient amount of CPI from the R-Scrog parameter. See, I mean, as I said, the phenological implications are not worked out. So, I now looked at the decay of a stringy winding mode doublet to lighter states, and I can compute the CP, the interference diagram, and find CP violation. Now, the CP phase in this case is pi over 2 pi over 3 or something. Or something, yeah. But this is, of course, a process that has not yet been seen in any collider. So, whether this matches any observation doesn't, you know, make sense. But for me, it's very important that CP is violated by these constructions because you see, I mean, I've argued that these modulo flavor symmetries can potentially give us a realistic picture. Now, in the bottom-up literature, they just put this tau value at some value which violates CP by hand, and there's no justification. Hand. And there's no justification. In fact, if you look at the old papers by Hans Peter and Fernando and so on, when they looked at modern stabilization with some eta function, it was always trapped at the symmetry enhance point. And I think it's very important to see that there are sources of CP violation, which could possibly shift this tower a little bit to become more realistic. But these are, of course, just wild speculations. Right, good, good. I see that Fernando had a question. Yes, yes. Very nice talking, Glad. Yes, yes, very nice talking. I really enjoy it. Very nice work. Just follow totally. The Ferruglio case, when they say it was very predictive, it was just a mistake because they were just setting to pseudo-some parameters, I guess. Yes. So there are this colour potential. That's actually something that's already was there in the traditional flavor symmetries. They always had these fantastic models. And then you see, they always, well. They always, well, they said we have this symmetry for the line wag operator, this operator for the charge lepton-you cover coupling. But if you do a quantum field theory, of course, nobody tells you that a subsect of the La Crushian can have a symmetry. Either the La Crushian has a symmetry or not. And you also saw that these couplings run. And of course, the answer to this puzzle is that the kinetic terms don't have these symmetries or are not fixed by the symmetries. And that's why you get randomization corrections, but you get other corrections that you get just from high. That you get just from higher order terms in the calor potential. In the traditional approach, this was not necessarily so bad because you had an expansion parameter flavor over VEF. And if this is sufficiently small, then these are possibly a little bit under control. But this is not the case for the non-linearly realized model of flavors in the version, even worse. Okay. Was that the main reason the model became so popular? The predictability? I think so, yeah. Because I mean, I think so, yeah. Because I mean, you see, I mean, if you look at the traditional models, then you usually predict five parameters with 10 inputs. And now it was sort of the reverse, yeah. And also, I mean, that's an extremely simple model. That's the most simple-minded thing it can work down. And then it's very close to observation. I mean, that's sort of, you see, you have Mac already in five non-trivial predictions, you have only three parameters or more than, yeah. And also, I mean, some people, of course, there are rumors of what these. Some people, of course, there are rumors of what GCP file should be, and this also fits well. So, yeah, that I think is the reason why. Right, right. Thank you. Thank you. And would you mind saying your provocative questions just for curiosity? Okay, so I have two. One actually I asked in the past at some conference and never got an answer. So we all know that supergravity Calabiao compactifications can emerge from string compactification. Emerge from string compactifications. We all know this. However, do we know the converse? And I'm asking the critical, but I think Fabian can answer this. He will give a talk anyway. Fabian wrote a paper where they sort of found an infinite number of possible compactification in just in the supergravity approach and between the lines, at least they seem to be saying this is something we shouldn't get from string theory. But this suggests that not all Calabri-Yau models might be full. Calabi-Yau models might be full-fledged string models. At least, it's not obvious to me that any Calabi-Yau that you can write down is a full-fledged string model. Now, it's a provocative question because I don't know, maybe there's a simple answer and so on and so forth. But to the best of my knowledge, well, I don't know, have seen this address. And then there's the other thing that was more something by Emilian Dudas and Wilfred Buchmüller. They were looking at some magnetized toroy and were looking at the vacuum, but some of And were looking at the vacuum, but somehow they found that, at least in the simple models that they studied, they always got non-chiral spectra in the end after they do something that they call tachyon condensation. Now, again, I don't know much about this. I don't, you know, you know me, I never work really on deep rand models. But it seems a little bit like there could be a problem in some of these models that once you really go to the ground state, you get non-current models. I hope, of course, it's not the case. But now, since all the experts But now, since all the experts are here, they can say, no, no, it's not the case for that and that reason. But at least this paper reads as if there is a problem. Interesting. Okay, thank you. I don't know. Right. So have you looked at the strong CP violation in the context of this symmetries? Yeah, I'm very confused about this because. Very confused about this because you see, I told you we can start with a CP transformation at some SU3 level, and then this merges into a outer automorphism which does not enforce, which where CP is violated. But this outer automorphism still kills the theta term. Now, in the best of all world, you find somehow some outer morphism symmetry that is realistic, gives rise to CP. Gives rise to CP violation in the flavor sector, but at the same time explains why the theta parameter is zero. Now, have I found such a model? No. Can I hope that maybe something along those lines ever occurs? Maybe, yeah. I don't know. And okay, good, good. I mean, thank you. And a final question. So you assume that the Higgs is fundamental in well, you see, in the very end, I talked. Well, you see, in the very end, I talked about composites. So, I don't know. So, I hope of course. You talked about composite families, but not composite leagues. But then, you know. So, so, no, because I think it's an important point because what we do get from string theory when the Higgs is fundamental, we get precisely the couplings that you talked about. We get the coupling between the Higgs. coupling between the Higgs and the families in and I think this is non-trivial. I totally agree with you, but if I understand F3 correctly, then somehow these states they get in F theory, which have these properties, they are somehow composites of some deeper models. I think I will make the statement that nobody understands F-theory, but I think it's hard to falsify you on that, but. Falsify you on that, but um, but but okay, good, good. I mean, I think it's it's it's okay. I think it's it's uh as I said, very very nice work. And I think that the fact that we do get from string theory naturally the coupling between the Higgs and the chiral families in the way that we do it in the standard model. Assuming that the Higgs is fundamentally Is fundamental, is highly non-trivial. And so, you know, it's ugly enough, I think, when you try to do flavor symmetries with composite Higgs without trying to get it from string theory. Sure, I share your statement. I also think that the effect, you know, you look at the zero modes of whatever you have. Mods of whatever your favorite string model is or something, yeah, and it really has 16 plats and 10 plats, but nothing else. So, all this, well, you could call it badness, but the things, the ingredients that bottom up people like like 126 plat, you don't get, but you also don't need it. You get only what you need. So, that's, I also find very compelling. But, yeah, I mean, I think there I would say that we don't know if we don't need it. Know if we don't need it. That's because when you use the 126 or some, you know, broken into its components, you can induce neutrino masses without breaking lepton number by one unit. So that's the thing is. I know, but I find it much better to get the metaparity from an R symmetry. From an R symmetry. For me, this is much better. And the R symmetries are discrete remnants of Lorentz symmetries as they occur in orbit faults. I like this personally much better than this R party from SO10. Okay, good, good. Other questions? Yes, Paul and Fabian wanted to ask. Right, okay. Sorry. Paul. Paul, uh, yeah, thanks. Yeah, um, yeah, first, I would like to say really quick: so, at least from my perspective, uh, as an sort of an F theorist, uh, I think I think sort of that one of the appeal of the duality revolution was somehow the insight that uh even strings are sort of uh or the the concept of a s if a string is fundamental or not is sort of uh duality frame dependent. Of duality frame dependent. So strings that are perturbative and fundamental in one frame can look as composite states in a dual strongly coupled theory. So in that sense, maybe, maybe, I don't know, maybe Alan needs to stop. I mean, maybe not. But maybe the Hicks. I didn't get what the maybe. Maybe the Hicks is a stringy Hicks would even be. A stringy Hicks would even be a composite, depending on the way you view it. Well, I mean, I right. But that was just a comment. Right. No, no, I mean, I think it's fine. Look, I mean, we know in QCD that what we see as fundamental degrees of freedom at one end then become composite at another end, right? Compose it at another end, right? So this is not such a so when you have a non-perturbative, I mean the problem I would say that we don't understand the non-perturbative limit of QCD easel. So we know that we have composites, but how how does but how does it work? I don't think we can really we can say that we we we we understand. Can say that we understand them. No, right. So, yeah. No, I just the only thing I wanted to add to this thing is that it's that even in the string theory context, it might be sometimes hard to really say what is a composite and what is a non-composite string if you want. But actually, I had some questions from Isaiah if I can. Okay, so yeah, I was actually wondering if how far how far in this modular symmetry business. How far in this modular symmetry business the like anomalies are checked or looked at? Yeah, that's a very good question. I mean, of course, some people have starting looking at this, yeah, but I think there's a lot of things to be done. So if you do it from derive it from strings, then you're in a good shape because you know that all these anomalies should somehow be absent. Yeah, some of them even come from a GHD1, right? So, um, well, it's Well, in heterotic orbifolds, there's a so-called anomalous U1, but I would say that is a misnomer. I mean, it's not, it looks for many purposes, it looks like an anomalous thing, but of course, there's a green Schwartz mechanism. It's not really anomalous, and this so-called anomalous one is actually an important ingredient also to create hierarchies and so on and so forth, at least in some traditional approach. But there is no fundamentally no anomaly. So it's just cold that's here. So, it's just cold, that's right. Yeah, that's all right. Yeah, yeah, okay. So, this was one question, and then the other one I had was that if you have these flavor symmetries and if the sort of the OB fold representations that you have, if like the blow-up modes of your OBFold, would those be non-trivially charged under the flavor symmetries or the modular symmetry? So, so which yeah, I mean, so you wouldn't be blowing. I mean, the blow-up modes are localized here and there. And one lesson that Peter and Stuart, and others and I learned in the arts a long time ago, that they always are charged under some at least flavor symmetries and they're also charged under. It's also, I mean, a priori, it's not so clear what a blow-up mode is in all cases, right? I mean, it depends a little bit on the model. It could be that a potential blow-up mode is some squawk which you don't want to give away. And you also not obliged to. And you are also not obliged to blow up. You can blow up if you like, but there's also no problem to stay at the orbital point as long as you cancel all D terms and so on and so forth. Sure. Right. So maybe you should let Fabian ask. Fabian. Yeah. Hi. And just because my name was mentioned here, I just thought I could actually try to give. I could actually try to give partial answer to the provocative question that's being asked there. So it's a very good question, and I do not have a full answer, of course, to it. What I wanted to say, first of all, the paper that decided there asked the question about sort of I fix a colour BR geometry and then I see what type of fluxes I can put onto this colour BR geometry. So it's not a question about the Calabia itself, but about The colour BR itself, but about the fluxes that I put in addition to this geometry. And what we found there was that if you wanted, you could put an infinite number of flux quanta. This is similar to the construction that Bodie and others had, where you had some types of fluxes that would just cancel out of the tagpole condition. In this case, it was the Bianchi identity of the three-form field in heterodic string theory. In heterotic string theory. So, if that can happen, you have an infinite family of or an infinite amount of flux you can put in the same theory, and you could potentially argue that these are all different back here, which seem to be consistent. But we found that in this particular case, you need to go to the boundary of the modelized space. And at this boundary, we don't have necessarily control over it. So, this is essentially where the small. So, this is essentially where the Swamland program would enter and ask if you write down a Calabiao compactification. Of course, in the beginning, you are talking about a supergravity approximation. And then you can ask, can I make this consistent in all orders in alpha prime? Or am I always taken to a point where it then becomes inconsistent at some point? These types of questions we couldn't answer, but we saw in this particular example that you are necessarily driven to the Necessarily driven to the boundary of the modelized space. And then it might very well be that, and we actually speculate that this is the case, that something happens there that prevents you from writing down these infinitely many models. And more recently, we also had a different paper where we're looking at the modelized phase of Calabial manifolds. So, this was the question of just can you have infinitely many Calabial manifolds which are related by blow-ups and blowdowns? So, essentially, you do what's called a birational. So, essentially, you do what's called a birational transformation. You blow up something and you blow up a different curve, and you do this infinitely many times, and you get to infinitely many colourbials that way. And we also found that if the some distance conjecture is true, then this is impossible. And there's also a mathematical conjecture, actually, which says that this cannot happen. So, these types of colour bears cannot exist. So, this doesn't really. So, this doesn't really answer the heart of the question of whether all colour BL models are string compactifications. I would say if you can write down this colour BL, it should form a background to your just the geometry, should form a potential compactification space for your colour BR. And a way to check this would be, for example, to write down the gauge linear sigma model and then see that this is essentially a conformal feed theory. Conformal feed theory. You cancel the you write down enough geometric fields to cancel the RST anomaly on the world sheet, and then you would believe that this flows actually to an LSM that describes a string theory that's consistent. So this would then essentially give you the world sheet description of a string theory with this particular colour that you have chosen. But even there, the question is: can this be done fully consistently? What is this flow? Does this What is this flow? Does this flow actually lead to colour that you started with, or does it destabilize it? Are there instantane corrections that actually break this? This is an important question that, for example, BC and Witten asked a long time ago, and they were very worried about effects that destabilize the moduli space that you started with. And I, yeah, they have argued that there can be. They have argued that there can be constructions where you are sure that this doesn't happen. But whether you're always protected or whether you even want to be protected from a physics point of view, because this would lead to unstabilized moduli is a completely different question. So I think it depends on the amount of rigor you want to put there and the amount of pheno you want to put in there in some sense. Because if you ask the question about what can I actually get the standard model of string T, of course, to my mind, we don't know the answer to that. We have tried for many years, we have gone pretty far, but there are still fundamental questions about modernized stabilization and Suzy breaking, which we don't have an answer to. So maybe I can. So, I mean, I think for me, it's obvious. I think for me, it's obvious that you can have Calabia quantification, supergravity that do not have a stringy realization. So I thought this was part of the statement of the swampland program, at least what I understood from Wafa's talk in String Final 2019. But let me ask you: is there an obstruction to construct Extraction to construct a supergravity with a Calabia quantification with the 126 of SO10? So I think you can compactify any strings here in a Cardi R manifold. I think this you can always do. The Swomland program is then more a question of whether you included all the effects that you get from this compactification in your effective theory or whether you truncate it too early in your theory. Whether you truncated too early and you threw away effects that are important. That's my understanding. I'll take a question whether you can. I ask you a very specific question. Is there an obstruction to construct a supergravity collabio model with the 126 of SO10? Yes, I don't know. Because in string series, obstruction is because of the CFT. Because of the CFT, it's a CFT because the rank is 22 and you require the representation to be unitary, so there is that obstruction. You don't have enough room to put the 126 at any Kasamudi level. So that's a statement of the perturbatives, ethnotic thing. And I think that we heard today that it seems to be also the case in everything. The case in F-theory sort of analysis. So, is there an abstraction in a supergravity model to have the 126 of SO10? I don't know. So, if you want, are you asking whether you can get it from a string theory compactification? No, no, I'm asking in a supergravity. I just want to construct a supergravity. Just write down any supergravity. Forget about just write down any supergravity with 126-dimensional representation. I don't care about whether it comes. So, I don't care about whether I have a calabia that underlies it or spring theory. I just want to write down any four-dimensional n equals one super gravity with a 126 of s of 10. That is your question? Yeah. I don't see a fundamental reason why you shouldn't be able to write this down. I mean, of course, you would have to see that anomalies cancel and so on, but if you're allowed to add whatever you like, I think it's a bit. Whatever you like, I think it should be possible. I have never tried, but I cannot see a fundamental reason. I mean, if you just look at anomaly cancellation and say your mesopravity is consistent, if the anomalies are cancelled, I would be very surprised if you just couldn't add enough other stuff to make the anomalies cancel. Yeah. All right. Thank you. I have maybe can I make one comment, which sort of is also related to the earlier discussion with Ignacio's. As Ignacio's. So, one thing that I like about this orbit field, or the way I would think about this orbit field, is, of course, that you look at these unisotropic compactifications where you say, okay, good. So, I mean, obviously, you cannot take all the radius to be one over m gut also. That doesn't work. But what you could do is to take one radius to be large and the others much smaller. You know, people have worked it out. So, this is even already mentioned in Witten's famous MC paper. That's possibly a loophole. Yeah, now I know. Possibly a loophole. Now, I'm not saying that I have any understanding to why these radii wants to be so anisotropic, but in principle, this works. You have still the weakly coupled heterotic string. But if you want to play this game, you might want to, then of course the other dimensions are more or less at the center radius. And if this happens, of course, all these nice winding modes, which you may not necessarily see in these colour VR models and so on. I mean, I don't think you can do this with the Calabi R. We can do this. Think you can do this with the colour BR. We can do this with the orbiform, we have the winding modes. People even have proposed that these winding modes can be dark matter and so on and so forth. You'll see here. But I think it's sort of it can be an advantage to have sort of to really start from the full string theory description. Here we see that the winding modes can be relevant for CP violation and so on and so forth. So that's just an extended comment. So I personally think it can be a good idea to keep track of all these guys. Maybe. That maybe, yeah. Absolutely. All right. Thank you. I think Shaul, we are getting to. Saul had to go out, but I'm so situating him. Right, right. Sorry. So, Nana, so we I think we are reaching the end of the session, no? Yes. And at least in the UK, I think it's time for dinner. No, Fernando, are you in the UK now? Fernando, are you in the UK now? Yes, yes, I'm waiting for dinner already. Okay. Well, yeah, it's less than a minute now. So thank you all for this very interesting talk and discussion. And we would like to invite you tomorrow to the string cosmology session. So we have two talks by Ivon Sabala and Michele Shicoli. And we have a discussion session by Fernando Quevedo and Cashro. And Tatru. So, thanks a lot, and see you tomorrow. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Hello, hi, hello, no, how are you doing? Good. How are you? Quite okay. Where are you? You're in your office. Yeah, I'm my office in Sweden. Yeah, my office in Sweden. Nice. In where? Sorry? In Uppsala, in Sweden. Yes. Sweden. Today was the first day of snow. No. It's snowing already. No, minus four degrees. Wow. It's there. Yeah, I guess it's super warm at your place, then, right?
