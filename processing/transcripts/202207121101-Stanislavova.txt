And I will change the subject a little bit and try to talk about stability of special solutions, particular waves, traveling and standing traveling waves. And I'll focus on two models, although probably I'll spend most of my time talking about the Benny system. But before I do that, I'll kind of remember. Before I do that, I'll kind of remind you where this is started and kind of give you a brief introduction. So, this kind of orbital stability of solitary waves had its start in the early 70s with the works by Benjamin and Bona. And then later on, this kind of abstract general theory by Grilakis Shutta-Strauss, which is classical by now, was developed in the late 80s. Late 80s, and it has to do with systems with symmetries. It was really used a lot by most of the subsequent works to kind of the same approach where you use conservation laws to prove orbital stability. There are some disadvantages, particularly that this almost always requires a C. This almost always requires a C1 dependence on the wave speed parameters, which has to be assumed in some cases. The alternative approach, which started kind of in 2004, maybe 2005, in the works by Capitola, Kevrakidis, Sanskeli, and then Talinowski, and recently kind of generalized by Lin and Seng, was to study Study to use the so-called index theory and to study spectral or linear stability. And this is what I'm going to focus on. So this is especially important for coupled PVs, as our Benny and Sapphira systems are, because these matrix non-diagonal matrix operators are harder to analyze. In particular, studying periodic traveling wave solutions and their spectral stability is what I want to focus on. So what I want to mention again briefly is that these systems of coupled P D's, especially in the specially periodic context, have not been studied. Contexts have not been studied so much, and there is a lot to do here. The works by Bronsky, Johnson, and Capitulo for KDV type models for scalar periodic, for periodic solutions in dispersive equations for scalar quantities have been something that is really new recently. But in our case, we are doing systems. Doing systems of dispersive PDEs. So we want to push the index theory and try to use it in these cases. So let me briefly mention what this index theory is all about. I already mentioned the names involved with this. So I'm looking at spectral problems that have spectral problems that have that are in the form J L U equals lambda U, where J is anti-self adjoint and H is self-adjoint operators. And they map real-valued elements into real-valued elements. And so I'm going to introduce these notations. And the first one is the N of S, which is the more significant. A Morse index, or just the number of negative eigenvalues for a self-adjoint bounded from below operator, counted with multiplicities. So then I have this Kr, Kc, and Ki minus notations. So Kr is the number of positive real eigenvalues. These all have to do with the Values, these all have to do with the spectrum of J L now. So, this is the number of positive real eigenvalues counted with multiplicities. And then I have the Kc, which is the number of quadruples of complex eigenvalues of J L with non-zero real and imaginary parts. And finally, Ki minus is the number of pairs of purely imaginary ideas. Of pairs of purely imaginary eigenvalues of negative prime signatures. So I'm requiring LFF to be negative here for those eigenvalues I 1. And so knowing all of this, you can state the index theory equality if you want. I just need I just need one more notation, and that's the matrix B, which whose entries are given by L eta I, eta J, where eta i, j are the span the generalized kernel of jh. So after all of these, we can formulate the following Can formulate the following equality that is going to be the kind of thing that will help us prove the stability of these periodic solutions. And that's that K Hamiltonian, the Hamiltonian index, which we define as Kr plus 2Kc plus 2Ki minus, is actually equal to N of L minus N of V. Minus n of d, where d is this matrix and L is our self-adjoint part of the J L unit lambda U. So this is really helpful for spectral stability and sometimes for spectral instability. For example, if one has a situation where K Hamiltonian, if you can see that K Hamiltonian is You can see that k Hamiltonian is zero, that's immediately spectral stability, but it's not really required because you can have k Hamiltonian equals two and then Ki minus equals one and you still get spectral stability with non-zero K Hamiltonian. We are really kind of looking to eliminate the Kr and the K. Eliminate the Kr and the K C here. On the other hand, if you have a K Hamiltonian be what if your K Hamiltonian is one or an odd integer, then immediately you guarantee that you have guaranteed its stability. So, with that in mind, I'm going to show you the Benny system and briefly put it in. Put it in, well, describe the derivation of these special solutions and then put it in the required form and tell you a little bit about how we get what we get in the index theory formula. So, I have this system where u is complex valued, v is real-valued function. I'm looking I'm looking for it on a periodic domain. It is one-dimensional. And I'll really try to go briefly through this, but this problem was studied on the whole line and with the well-positive existence and non-linear stability of solitary waves, etc. Solitary waves, etc. What we want is to consider this model on the periodic domain and to study again, as I said, the spectral stability of periodic traveling waves. And there will be two types of those, the noidal and snoital type, which we construct first. And let me mention briefly the main results are going to be. Briefly, the main results are going to be that for all natural values of the parameters, the periodic noider waves are spectrally stable with respect to perturbations of the same period. And then for another natural set of parameters, we construct the snow waves which exhibit instabilities in the same set. In terms of periodic domain, this has been studied. Relatively more recently, and roughly with the GSS, the Grillake Sheta approach using the conserved quantities of the system. And I may say a little bit more about this. Also, this is only for the noise. This is only for the noidal type waves. Orbital stability was proved in a certain part of the parameter domain. So what do we do? We look for periodic waves in this form and clearly they satisfy the system for here. Poor here. We work on this a little bit, kind of doing the standard things, integrating the second equation, substituting the first. Gamma is a constant of integration here, so we get this equation 5, and then we integrate this again to get this. To get it in this form from which we can use kind of dynamical system methods to get the solutions in elliptic function, Jacobi elliptic function format. Basically, we know that phi will be a periodic function if this If this h of x y cos a will contain an oval and depending on the polynomial u of phi we have two cases which will give us the two different noidal and snoidal solutions. I'll just show you the form in which we have these solutions. Have these solutions, it's not really going to be important for the follow-up of my talk, but of course, we use all of these for the computations, which I'll try to avoid discussing as much as possible. So, we have these noidal solutions, alpha is given here, and also the period of these solutions, and then we also have. And then we also have the snoidel solutions for different values of the parameters. And I give you the period here. So having constructed these, we do the standard think again where we look at perturbation. Here is the form in which I look for the perturbation and then we linearize. We linearize around these solutions and get the form 8, which now has three equations because I want to use the real and imaginary part of U. Remember, U is complex value. So I have this P, Q and V equations here. Here. This is the linearized system. And I'm going to show you that this is exactly in the form I needed to apply this index theorem. So it is, if z is p vq, then I have zt equals j xz, where j is this operator here. Operator here and H is the operator given here for L1 and L2 given in this form. So we are exactly in the setup I started with with the index theory and I'll just mention again what we mean by spectral stability. So basically, I want this eigenvalue problem defined basically for z in this domain. If there is a non-trivial solution lambda with real part positive, this is unstable and has. This is unstable, and otherwise, it's spectrally stable. So, just a brief remark about the connection with spectral, between spectral and linear stability. If you were thinking about this, because we are in this periodic setting, one can show that these two are equivalent. And, for example, a general justification which General justification which applies to our case is provided by Lin and Zing in their recent paper. So let me state the theorem which I already mentioned. So we have stability for the noider waves for all values of the parameter provided we have this condition that guarantees periodicity. DC. So this is for those values of the parameter subject to 12. I mentioned this already. Here is slightly more detailed comment in the original paper by Angul, Konsho, and Pakaev, who is one of my co-authors. And I forgot to mention that this is a joint work with Atan. That this is a joint work with Antona, Stefanov, and Petaev. So, what they did is they proved using roughly the Griwake-Sotastraus methodology the orbital stability for beta less or equal than zero and for beta zero under this condition. They basically look basically look. Basically, we looked at the number of positive eigenvalues of the Hessian, which is given here, for the conserved quantities E, P and M that I mentioned. So this result extends this to all values of the parameters. And then we have the instability of the snowdel wave. So, in different parameter regimes, we were able to derive the snowder wave. We were able to derive the snowdole waves which look like this with this periodicity condition. And we can show that these are spectrally unstable with at least one real and positive eigenvalues for all values of the parameter. You can imagine that I would be focusing the proof in this index. In this index counting argument, computing the Hamiltonian index. And so, in order to do that, I need a lot of spectral information and I actually need the generalized kernel, the span of the generalized kernel of J H. I also will use this Schrodinger operator here. And so, collecting a few facts about facts about the spectrum. I can, this is in this proposition. So we have L with periodic boundary conditions on minus T and we can show that N of L is 1 and that the kernel of L is spun by phi prime. So this is both in noidal and snoital cases. And then again for L2 which was For L2, which was one of the two operators in my script L, I have that N of L2 is 0, the kernel of L2 is spun by phi. This is for the noidal case, and then for the snoidel case, n of L2 is 2, and the kernel is spun by phi. So this is kind of partly where the difference in stability is going to come from. But let's try to see. But let's try to see a little bit more of how this goes. So, as I said, we need explicitly the kernel of H and then the kernel of J H and then the generalized kernel of J H in the computation. So, this proposition is stating that the kernel of H is two-dimensional, spun by these two vectors. And then, in addition, under In addition, under the assumption that L inverse phi phi is not zero, we can also find the generalized eigenvectors here. So this means that my matrix D, which basically uses these three eigenvectors eigenvectors, will be three by three dimensional, and I will need to know. I would need to know the number of negative eigenvalues of D. So here is another proposition. We can show that N of H is 1 in the noidal case and then N of H is 3 in the snoidal case. That makes my life really easy. makes my life really easy in the noidle case. Because remember, if n of h is 1, I only need to know that n of d is also equal to 1. On the right hand side, I have n of h minus n of d. So if this is 0, that means the Hamiltonian index of J L or J H in this case is 0 and I have stability. So you really only need to focus on showing that N of these. Showing that n of d is 1. And it also cannot be bigger than 1 because I already know that n of h is 1. So it's actually enough to compute, to establish that d22, which we already looked at is L inverse 3 phi and showed that it's non-zero, it's enough to check that this is negative. And that's the case. So I have that n of d is 1. That n of these one, so I'm done with the noidal case, that case is stable for all values of the parameters because of the index theory. It gets more complicated in the case of snoidal waves. I I'm gonna need a full matrix D there, so I have to compute all of these ingredients and consider the determinant of D. Consider the determinant of d and I have to do this in the regime beta equals one over c plus epsilon for small epsilon and then kind of claim that this continues locally. So the proposition here says that there exists epsilon zero so that for all epsilon between zero and epsilon zero we have that the determinant of d is positive. Positive. And then let's focus on the instability for the snowdole waves. So I know then that the symmetric matrix D, because the determinant is positive, it can have two negative eigenvalues and a positive one, and that means n of d is 2, or three positive eigenvalues. or three positive eigenvalues, and that means n of the is zero. So for the Hamiltonian index, in the first case I get three minus two equals one which gives me immediately instability. Remember odd Hamiltonian index is giving you instability. Or n of l minus n of d is 3 minus 0 which is 3 again all. So I get the at least that there is Get the at least that there is at least one real instability. In for Hamiltonian index one, that's obvious. For Hamiltonian index three, it's almost you just need to think of what the possibilities are. So you can have three real and instabilities, or one real and two complex instabilities, on or one real and a pair of. Unreal and a pair of pure imaginary eigenvalues of negative crime signature based on how the Hamiltonian index, how the index was defined. So this completes my Beni system and I am out of time, but I'll just show you what the Zakarov system looks like and mention that we use similar techniques to Techniques to construct the noidal solutions here and to prove their stability for all values of the parameter. Again, it's a complicated computation. We get a four-dimensional system here and we are not Are not we haven't completed this because there are other elliptic solutions for which we don't know the stability. So, so far we only have the stability for the Nordic solutions. That's all. Thank you. Is there any question? Uh can I ask about uh condition thirteen? Uh I think it was on the periodic travel waves a periodic condition, if this is uh if and only if somehow this is gonna come out of the of the derivation of these uh snoidel solutions uh with these Hamiltonian uh level sets of the Hamiltonian. Of the parameter. I can just use the like any other question or comment perhaps. Somebody online, are there any questions online? Okay, well, thank you very much. We are now lunch break. It's still pretty far away.
