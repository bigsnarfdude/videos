So indeed, I will try to talk about some of my recent work on trying to put a distance on the space of certain spectral footprints. I will try to motivate why I want to do that with some examples as well and explain most of the words that we'll use during the subsequent slides. So the idea starts. The idea starts with the generalization of spectral geometry to the non-trinear realm introduced by Alan Kohn in the mid-80s using something called a spectral trickle. So it's a chapter, if you want, of spectral geometry, where the key object, which seems to have emerged as a favored way to encode differential geometry at the level of possibly non-cumminous space-times, is given as a triple. Is given as a triple of a sister algebra, think of algebra of observables on a Hilbert space in the physical universe, but it could also be viewed as a non-cumulative analog of st of x or x-compact Hausdorff space. This algebra is acting on some Hilbert space, which in the sort of canonical example, classical picture, would be a space of sections of a spinner bundle, but more generally speaking, it's summing. But more generally speaking, it's summing up the space on which A acts. And then an operator, which is supposed to generalize a Dirac operator of a manifold. So, what we require this operator to be in general is some sort of self-adjunct operator. It can be, and it's typically unbounded. So, it is defined on a dense subdomain of the Hilbert space. And the requirements at the most elementary levels are that it has a compact resolvent and it commutes boundedly with a With a dense algebra of A. Okay? So the idea is that this triple encodes some spectral information and that we can do geometry by looking at this as a sort of spectral object. And what I'm interested in is, well, with spectral triple, what you can do is you can go well beyond the realm of classical manifolds. So you can define spectral triples on things like fractals. Here's an image of the surplus the gas capsule. An image of the scoping stick gasket for which vector triples have been built. Over non-cumulative system algebras, you do not need the commutativity of your algebra of observables, which is going to be our focus today. And even on things like finite set or on finite dimensional system algebra, which has a non-commutative analog of finite set. And people have been quite successful working with spectral triple to extend things like index theorem, et cetera, to these more singular or non-cumminative settings. or non-commutative settings. Sorry, for our purpose, one thing that's interesting is that you can extend some notions of physical meaning possibly in non-communicable. So an example is what's called a spectral action. We'll see a bit of a formula toward the end of the talk, which is a way to encode physics at the level, you know, to sort of read some of the physics encoded in a spectral triple. So in simplest term, if you take a spectral triple that If you take a spectral triple that's sort of canonically associated with the Riemannian spin manifold, H is the square integrable section of the section of the spinner bundle, D is a usual Dirac operator, etc. You can use this to recover, there's a Hilbert action in that case. A spectral action would recover a well-known action in general activity. But this action, the formulas that define it, makes sense when you leave the commutative realm and you just work with spectral triples. So spectral triple. So, special tripos offer a very, very flexible way to talk about geometry and even mathematical physics on objects and spaces that are possibly much more complex than a manifold. Let me give you a non-cumulative example that has appeared in some lectures on mathematical physics. It's a simple one. It's a famous one, but it will be a nice guide for this talk. It consists in looking at what's called a clock and shift matrices. So, this clock matrix is simply a diagonal matrix where Is simply a diagonal matrix where on the diagonal you put the ends of the various powers of a primitive root of unity, and the outsets, my Cn here, and my Sn is a shifting by one. And you could look at you know those distars graduated by those two things, and they're both unitaries, and they commute up to a phase, but that phase is this Rn number. So they behave a little bit like a sort of non-commutative torus. Sometimes it's called a fuzzy torus. It's not a quantum. Fuzzy torus. It's not a quantum torus because it's a finite-dimensional version of it. But this finite-dimensional object has attracted some interest in some sectors of physics, when people study what I call matrix models. And there is a natural spectral triple that you can build on this that is found in the literature, which I'll write here. The Hilbert space is simply the bounded operation CN, where these matrices act naturally. But then, you know, with four Um, you know, with four tensors, C4, that's for your spinners, you have four gamma matrices to make this thing. And my direct operator, I mean, basically, it's a symmetrized version, so they have a self-version operator of commutator with Cn, tensors from gamma thing, and commutator with Sn, tensors from gamma thing. So Cn and Sn also, you know, appropriately normalized, you see the factor n over 2 pi in front, plays a role of finite dimensional derivation, the commutators. But because you want to self-action operate. But because you want a self-action operator, it ends up looking like this once you do the natural symmetriization. So that's an example of a spectral triple with which you can ask geometric questions, but it is defined on a very non-commutative object because the sister algebra generated by these two matrices, as it turns out, are all the n-bind matrices. So to use fancy terms, heuristic terms, the topology of the space generated by CNN's SN in a non-conference sense is kind of trivial. And in a non-criminal sense, it's kind of trivial, it's sort of a space of endpoints but quantized. And it doesn't, you know, the space is not really playing any role here. You could change the phase a little bit, put another primitive root, and you would get the same thing. What makes it a torus versus anything else is the introduction of this additional geometric information process.
