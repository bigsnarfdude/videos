It's a broad overview of some of the various problems that number theorists are considering with relation to Barkhauff numbers. And so my hope is that this talk is something like an inch deep and a mile wide, just sort of a broad overview of all the different types of things that we think about as number theorists with work on numbers. So, one of the first problems is one closely related to the last talk, which Closely related to the last talk, which is the rational approximations of real numbers. And a lot of this is outlined wonderfully in Martin Abner's book, 100 Years of the Uniqueness Conjecture. But we start off with approximating a real number alpha with rational numbers p over Q, where we assume that these are reduced rational numbers. And we say that a rational number can be approximated to order T if there is a. T if there is some constant C1 and infinitely many primes such that the difference from our rational number in our approximation is less than C1 over Q to the T. And we have a couple of theorems outlining when this is possible. Dier Lachey in 1837, rational numbers theme approximate to order one and no higher, and irrational numbers up to order greater than or equal to two. Than or equal to 2. Louisville, a couple of years later, an algebraic number of degree d can be approximated to order no more than d. So, in particular, transcendental numbers approximate, or if a number can be approximated up to any order, then it has to be transcendental. Although that one was subsumed by this theorem here, all algebraic numbers can be approximated to order no more than two. So, the interesting case here for the orders of these approximations is really two. Approximations is really two. And so, you know, maybe if you're sorry? You said primes p over Q. Oh, no, I'm sorry. These are rational numbers, just P over Q. Just reduced rational numbers. Yeah, later on, P will always be a prime. But here, P over Q is just a rational number. Okay, so just a little bit more for this theorem for alpha Alpha being approximate to degree D. So if alpha is algebraic of degree D, then there is a positive C such that C over Q to the D is less than alpha minus P over Q for all of these, for, I'm sorry, this should say infinitely many, P over Q, not all rational numbers. So, you know, if you if you let F be a degree You let f be a degree d integer polynomial with two roots, and you're choosing the nearest root to alpha here. And if there's not another root, then you just set the length of this interval to be one. There won't be another root inside of that interval, but this just can be used for bounding purposes later. So if your alpha minus If alpha minus p over q is already larger than s, then s over 2 over q to the d already works for this bound. Otherwise, you can use the mean value theorem to come up with a suitable bound here. But so if the order two case is really the only one that ends up being interesting here, then we can shift our focus over to real numbers that are so-called. To real numbers that are so-called badly approximable, which is if there's a constant C such that you can't get closer than this approximation, C over Q squared. And then we define the Lagrange number of alpha to be the supremum of all of these L's, which satisfy this inequality for infinitely many p over q. Over q. And a corollary of one of the previous theorems being that the Lagrange number is going to be less than 3 will always mean that these numbers are badly approximable. There's the converse of this being conjectured and an open problem. Okay, so Markov's theorem, the connection from the approximations of real numbers back to the Markov numbers, being Markov's theorem. Being Markov's theorem. Yes? What's the conjecture? The conjecture being that the converse of this is true, so that every number that's badly approximable has Lagrange number less than 3. So the Markov's theorem that the Lagrange spectrum below 3 is given exactly by this expression for m being the Markov numbers. So if m is the set of integers which If m is the set of integers which appear in the solution triples to the Markov equation x squared plus y squared plus z squared equal to 3xyz, then all of those Markov numbers going into this expression here will give you exactly the Lagrange spectrum below. Now the first Markov numbers are 1, 2, 5, 13, 29, so on. I'm sure we've all seen these Markov numbers by now. And these arise from these integer solutions here. And so any, so the mark. And so any, so the Markov numbers appear in more than one solution, and then the Markov, more than one of the triple solutions, the Markov numbers are just all of the integers which appear in any triple solution to the Markov equation. x squared plus y squared plus z squared equal to 3xyz. Okay, so if we look for solutions to the Markov equation, we start here and Start here, and we can fix two of these variables, y and z, and the equation is quadratic in the third variable that remains unfixed. You can solve for what x is, just quadratic equation, and you get two possible solutions for x. So fixed, y, and z, and there's up to two possible x values, which could solve the Markov equation. And if you And if you flip between these two roots by mapping x to 3yz minus x, this gives an involution that we're going to call the Markov-Vienna involution. And as a lemma, no Markov triple can repeat elements except for 111 and 112. So all of the Markov triples, except for these two cases here, will contain three distinct integers. Will contain three distinct integers. And just as a very short proof, if you assume that two of these numbers are the same, then just through some divisibility rules, you'll end up with y is equal to z is equal to 1, but then the only two possible values for x and that is are 1 and 2. Okay, so you can play this game on swapping the roots on any of our three variables, x, y, or z. Three variables, x, y, or z. And so we have three Vieta involutions that operate on the three coordinates of any of these solutions. The only fixed point for all of these, well, the only fixed point for any of these is going to be 0, 0, 0. All of our solutions will be positive integers. And if you start with a triple ABC and you apply ABC, and you apply any of these three Vieta involutions, two of them will increase the value of the largest integer inside of your triple, and the third one will reduce it. If you apply the Vieta involution onto the largest entry in your triple, that one will be decreased. If you apply the event involution to either of the two smaller entries, then those will increase. And so, the conclusion there, if you apply And so the conclusion there, if you apply this argument recursively, is that all Markov triples can be reached by the n relations applied to 111. If you start with the Markov triple, then you can see which of those entries is the largest in the triple, apply the Vietnam involution, swapping that entry, and it will be reduced, and then wash, rinse, and repeat, and the largest value of your triple will descend until. Will descend until you end up at the case of 112 or 111. And then at that point, you're finished. This gives us a very nice setup for connecting all of the solutions to the Markov equation in a tree structure. So the Markov tree is an infinite three-regular tree. Usually we take it to be rooted at 111, and the Vieta involutions give the branches. Involutions give the branches or the edges of the tree. And so this edge here would correspond to the Vieta involution applied to the second coordinate. Here would be the Vieta involution applied to the first coordinate. And every solution to the Markov equation over the integers is contained in this tree. Sometimes the tree is drawn up to per Up to permutation in the sense that you start with the root right here and you just have a single child of that node, and then from there you will get the tree structure below. But if you set it up this way, then it's an infinite three right now. All of the nodes are degree three. And it'll be a nice setup for a construction in a few minutes. Oh, do I have a type of Oh, do I have a typo here? So, well, so, but before there's another, actually, actually, let me show a slightly modified setup of the Markov equation here. If you drop the three from this Markov equation, so you have x squared plus y squared plus z squared is equal to x by z, then you end up with the same theory, but all of your numbers are now multiples of three from what they were before, or they're all. From what they were before, or they're all scaled by a factor of three. And so then your tree, it begins with 333, and then it goes out from there. That's how I usually set up my presentation. And so I believe that when I moved over this tree from a previous presentation, apparently I didn't get all of my reduction by three correct. So my apologies. But yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay, so if you instead consider the Markov equation where it's congruent 0 modulo 3 for some prime p greater than 3, and again, all of these constructions can be done if you drop the 3 coefficient here. So x squared plus y squared plus z squared minus xyz congruent to 0. You largely get the same theory, although some of the degenerate cases start moving around a little bit. The solution set to this equation. The solution set to this equation here will still be closed under Vieta involutions. You may have other fixed points. For example, 556, if you consider this in the integers module of 7, if you apply the Vieta involution on the third coordinate, then what you would get is that the third coordinate would be swapped out for 3 times 5 times 5. So 75, that's. 75, that's 5 modulo 7, and then subtract 6, that gets you negative 1. Well, that's just 6 modulo 7 again. And so you do end up having some fixed points, although the only point, and sorry, this should be 0, 0, 0, is the only solution fixed by all Vienna involutions. So the Markov graph modulo P, we construct it as the tree in which all of the vertices are the solutions to the Markov mod P equation. To the Markov mod p equation, and the edges are still the Vietnam equations. So it's largely the same construction. Here's an example of the Markov graph module 05. So you have 111 still as the center as your root. And then if you, you know, this would be the Vietnam evolution applied to the third coordinate, and so on. But you no longer have a three-regular tree. What you have is now a finite graph. A finite graph. Here, the dotted lines don't have any special meaning just for legibility purposes. Now, this example here doesn't have any loops, although, as we saw from the last slide, the Markov graph module 07 would have a small number of loops. Yes, question? Sorry, why is it part three we're given? Because you can have a small number of loops, and so all of these. I mean, if you can't correctly, I mean. But yeah, I mean if you count correctly, I mean you've always always got I mean if you count a loop as a okay yeah sure so if you if you include the loops inside of those trees then yes it would still be three regular. The problem is that these loops cause some problems with some of the constructions and algorithms that you might be interested in running. And so depending on the context that you're working in, you may or may not want to include these loops in the graph that you're working with. And if you Working with. And if you always about to apply three involutions. Yes, so the third involution is still defined for those elements. Depending on the context that you're working in, you may drop those loops from the graph. You may insist that your graphs have no loops. And if you do that construction, then your graph is no longer three regular. So I guess it depends slightly on the setting that you're working in, whether you want to allow those edges to still be in your Markov graph module. Is to store the intermarket graph module. But my question is: so you're allowed to do three involutions. Yes. So there are two situations in which I can imagine you could get the loop. Either you do an involution and you fall back on yourself, or it turns out that two involutions actually coincide differently. Which would mean that the two edges would correspond to both situations possible? Let's see. Well, you're only swapping out one element for another. And so this would need to be a case that you already had two elements in your triple that were the same. And if you sort of work through that, then that situation won't come up. Although there's a similar construction for the Markov graph that you can do, that we'll see in a few minutes. That we'll see in a few minutes, that then, yes, that would be a concern. Okay. Yes? Sorry, just they're not only graphs, but they're actually triangulations of surfaces, right? Sorry. If you consider the dual, you do not only get graphs, but triangulations of surfaces. Okay, yes. Does that play a role? Yes. Does that play a role in the query, Gabriel? Yeah, definitely. Yeah, yeah. That won't play much of a role for the next 30 or so minutes, but yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so these Markov graphs, modulo primes, so that the Markov tree over the integers includes. Over the integers includes all of the solutions to the Markov equation. Now we defined the Markov graph modulo P to include all of the solutions, but if you begin just at 111 and apply the Vietnam evolutions, then do you get the entire Markov graph modulo P. And the conjecture made by Beriger in 1991 is: yes, that the Markov graph modulo P is connected for all primes P. For all primes p, and equivalent, this would be equivalent to every solution to the Markov graph modulo of prime lifting back to a solution over the integers. One of the biggest breakthroughs towards this conjecture came from Brigade and Gimbert and Sarnak, who showed that roughly every Markov graph. Every Markov graph modulo P will have a large component inside of it. So if you begin at 111 and you apply these Markov involutions, you may not get every solution to the Markov equation modulo P, beginning from 111, but the component that you get out of that will be quite large. And so for every epsilon greater than zero and So, for every epsilon greater than zero and a prime large enough based on what epsilon you chose, there's going to be a component inside of your Markov graph such that everything else is less than p to the epsilon. When you say you may not, you mean we don't know. So, the conjecture is that you will. Progress towards this conjecture showing that this is true for all crimes, that in fact you do, we have yet to find an example where you don't. An example where you don't get the entire graph from starting from 111 and working your way out. But the fear is that there may be another component that so you can start with the Markov tree over the integers, and you can take the quotient of that graph. And that thing that you get will definitely be connected. And it will contain all of the solutions, modulo p, which lift back to the integers. Lift back to the integers, but you get more solutions out of that. Is there another connected component to the Markov graph modulo P? That's the question. That's the question. And the conjecture is no, that there's not another connected component here. And so the result is showing that that component, if you get like that, has size at least. At most, right. So if the conjecture is not true, then at the very least, what we know is that those extra components that you get. That those extra components that you get, they have to be small. If the conjecture is not true, like if there is a prime where there's this little component, did they prove, or do we know if it's the big component or one of the smaller components that lifts? Do we know if it's the larger component that necessarily came from the integers reducing mod, from the integer solutions reducing mod P? That's what I'm saying. Yeah, it'll be the 111. It's proved. It's proved there in that paper or that one one generates the large component? Yeah, I believe so, yeah. Yeah. Okay. I will look. Yeah, because you can do a counting argument also on the number of solutions that will come from the integers. And the connected component is defined as one. The large one is defined as containing one number. Yes, because in the Yes, because maybe I'll say something else about this in a second after we talk briefly about the argument of the VGS paper in a few moments. Because their large component is defined as beginning with all of what they call the parabolic orbits, and those will contain the 111 solution. And so, yes, the large component here has to contain 111. And so then that means that it has to be the one that contains the solution. To be the one that contains the solutions that lift back to the answers. 111 is parabolic. Is that what you're saying? Too many things happen. Okay, I'll wait and launch. Okay, so some further progress towards this conjecture. Oh, yes, another major step in this working towards this conjecture came from Chen in 2000. Conjecture came from Chen in 2021, who showed that every connecting component of the Markov graph modulo P has to have size divisible by P. And then from a symmetry argument with considering the permutations of the solutions, you can improve this to having size divisible by 4 key. And I believe that Chen will have a lot more to say about this theorem later in this week. But so, in a lot of the searches for these connected components and whether these graphs are. These connected components and whether these graphs are connected. We appeal to the size of the connected components. Comparing it to P, in particular, because the connected components have to have size divisible by P, they have to have size at least P. And so a lot of working with these Markov graphs is counting potentially how many elements are not in these connected components and seeing if it's at least P. Okay, so using that result, Eddie Fu. Using that result, Eddie Fuchs, Lippmann, Byrne, Tritony, Vanyo, they showed that the Markov graph modulo P is connected for all P larger than 3, followed by 394 zeros. And in particular, this means that if there are Markov graphs, modulo key that are not connected, there can only be finitely many of them. And essentially, what they did was they used What they did was they used this result here by Bernard, Gamber, and Sarnak. And based on the results of Chen saying that the connecting pods have to have size at least P, they set epsilon is equal to zero and then solved for P. And this was the bound that they came up with. Separately, I've been working sort of from the other direction, thinking about the smaller primes, and I recently explicitly. Explicitly computed that they're all connected through 1 million. And this is based on an explicit algorithm for calculating these graphs that runs in nearly linear time. But so there's sort of a no man's land in between these two numbers that we can sometimes say whether they're connected or not. But exhaustive check is too big of a bound to do an exhaustive check so far. And so a lot of So far. And so, a lot of the work right now is trying to lower this bound. And, well, I would be interested in raising this one. Okay, so I would like to give a brief overview of the argument by Burdain, Gimber, and Sardak. So they consider in action fixing one coordinate. Now, this is nearly the Vieta involution, but they not only swap out one of the coordinates. Swap out one of the coordinates, they also permute two of them. And so this would be the Vieta involution applied to the second coordinate, followed by a transposition of the second and third coordinates. And they call these the rotation maps. Now, these are no longer involutions. And so if you apply this rotation map to a particular triple many times, then you will get some orbit. And they And they classify the triples based on the orders of these rotations, which will then determine whether these triples are connected or determine whether they can explicitly show that these are connected back to this so-called large component of the graph. And they count how many of these triples may not be connected back to the large component based on this classification. If we call these the bad triples, then we try to tally up how many. Try to tally up how many of these triples there are. And if there's not enough of them to make its own separate connected component based on the results of Chen, then there may just not be enough to make their own connected component. So there can't be a separate component of the graph. What do you mean by classify triples by order? Yeah, I'll say that in just a second. So what they do is they look at the triples and they look at the orders, and then for some of those orders, And then, for some of those orders, they can give an argument how to walk from those triples back to an element that's already meant to be in the connecting element. A bit like the descent argument that you talked in the C case, but now it's in a model B descent case. It's sort of similar, and I'll actually outline that argument in just one second. This is just the general overview for how their argument is going to proceed. So, just as a little visualization of their argument, if you Of their argument. If you start with a triple, say ABC, and you apply the rotation map, then you end up with some orbit here. And along the way, you'll see many other triples. And along the way, at any point, you could stop applying the rotation map fixing the first coordinate and instead start applying the rotation map fixing the second coordinate. And as you walk around these orbits, you'll find orbits that are maybe bigger or smaller, and the goal. Maybe bigger or smaller, and the goal is to walk from orbits that are small to orbits that are larger and larger, eventually reaching an orbit of maximal order. These are the orbits that are known to already be part of the connected, the large connected component. And so the goal is to walk up the orbits, walk up the orders until you reach one of maximal order. And then at that point, you know that you've reached the large component. And all of these orbits will have order. These orbits will have order dividing p plus or minus one, and so the largest ones have orders p plus or minus one. There is a degenerate case of orbits having order exactly p or 2p, but those are dispensed with fairly easily being a part of the large comet. Okay, so how big are these orbits? So, if you begin with a triple ABC and you apply the rotation map, you end up with this nice. Rotation map, you end up with this nice parametrization where L will be the order of the orbit that you're looking at. And you can get this through the decomposition a is equal to chi plus chi inverse. Now, if chi is an element of your finite field, then it will have order dividing p minus 1. It may come from the quadratic extension of It may come from the quadratic extension of FP, in which case probably we'll have order dividing p plus one, and so that's where the maximal orders being p plus or minus one come from. And so this is now where we talk about the classification of the orbits based on the order. So is ABC connected to the so-called large component? If this orbit has size exactly P plus or minus one, then yes. This is the beginning of the large component. All of these orbits are connected. All of these orbits are connected, and you can show that these are all connected. If it has size at least p to the one-half plus delta for some delta fixed by p, then yes, your orbit is guaranteed to contain a triple of maximal order. And so you can walk from this smaller orbit to an orbit that is larger, and then you're a part of your connected component again. Component again. If you're not size p to the one-half plus delta, but you are at least p to the epsilon, where again, epsilon is fixed by p and less than one half, then yes, you are going to be connected to the large component because your orbit has to contain a triple that has an order larger than the one you're currently looking at. And so you can apply your rotation map over and over and over. Your rotation map over and over and over again until you get to this triple that has larger order, and then you can switch to another one of your rotation maps, either fixing a different coordinate, and then walk from there to a triple of even higher order. And if you keep doing this, eventually you'll reach a triple that has order p to the one-half plus delta, or maybe you get to p plus or minus one immediately. But so you can walk to the large component by applying these rotation maps. Component by applying these rotation maps. Yes? I'm not asking you to spell it out design, but like how do you do something like demonstrate if the orbit these people have most delta Lindy must have mentioned if I want to work this one? Yeah, you count the number of intersections of these curves, and so you write down these parametrizations and you count how many intersections there are. Intersections there are. And then if you have, if these are your orbit sizes, then you can show that there always has to be at least one element. So it's a counting argument based on the intersections of these curves. And if you're not this large, if you're not even p to the epsilon, then maybe not, and these are what we call the bad triples. And if there's at least p of them, or 4p of them, then 40 of them, then this algorithm will be inconclusive on whether this graph is connected or not. So, some applications of this argument or if you fix epsilon larger than zero, then there's going to be a sufficiently large p such that you're connected, then for a sufficiently large p, then there's going to be a connected component inside of your graph that. Inside of your graph that leaves out no more than p to the epsilon elements. And so this was the original BGS argument. And one of their corollaries here was that almost all Markov numbers are composite. I apologize. I should have double-checked some of these slides a little bit more carefully. Should be almost all Markov numbers are composite. Like I previously mentioned, Eddie Fuchs, Lemon, Martin, and Tripney, they appear. Martin and Tripney, they appealed to the argument by Chen to prove that all but finitely many Markov graphs modulo P are connected. The PGS algorithm forms the basis for my computational results. I'm happy to talk about that later on with anybody who is also interested in computational number theory. Joe Silverman recently had a very interesting paper showing that if you pick two random vertices in a Markov graph modulo P, then there's a randomized Then there's a randomized sub-extimential time algorithm connecting these two vertices, and he uses these orbits in the BGS paper in order to find those paths between these vertices. And these there's a lot more here, but a lot of these graph arguments really are based off the BGS construction for these graphs. The BGS construction for these graphs. So I clocked in well under time here for my brief overview, but hopefully it was just, like I said, a brief overview of sort of list things that me and my advisor and some of my close math relatives have been thinking about recently with these Markov numbers. And hopefully there's some people here who are also interested in these sort of graph-based arguments. There's a lot of really neat stuff going on here. There's a lot of really neat stuff going on here, including some projects. I know some of the people also here are interested in looking at eigenvalues of these graphs, spectral decompositions. And so I'm interested in hopefully meeting some other people who share some of these interests to me. So I'm happy to answer any questions at this point that y'all might have about these Markov graphs or Markov numbers on the number theory side of things. Yes. So almost all Markov numbers are composite, then almost all means all but infinity. We call all that function anyway. In the sense of density. Yeah. In the sense of density. Yeah, yeah. Yes. So does it follow from the DGS argument? So say I take absolutely So say I take epsilon one smaller than epsilon two. Get the large component for epsilon one. Is it contained in the large component for epsilon two? Is there containment as unquestioned epsilon? Does that somehow follow from the argument? I think it goes the other order. You can epsilon and have the same size of prime. Oh, yes, yes, yeah, because the bound is on the common red. Okay, yes, so the other thing. Yes, yes, yes. So there is conflict. Yes, yes. Although if you try to find examples of these, one of the troubles that you would run into is that all of the examples that we've seen so far only have one component to begin with. But yes, that is true that if you fix these epsilons, then yeah, the containment would be in the opposite. Then, yeah, the containment would be in the opposite direction. And so you do get some sort of containment argument. But what Matthew's saying is that the statement is you fix epsilon first, and then it's for sufficiently large primes. So if one epsilon, so if your prime, if one epsilon works for it, you may not be able to take a smaller epsilon. I think it's the same component. You pick epsilon one, epsilon two, whichever one is smaller, you take B big enough that it works for both. Works for both. But then there's only room for one big component. I mean, it's all the vertices except for a tiny fraction. It's the same one that works for both and so on. But I guess my question was, does this containment follow from the boot? I think it just follows from the sizes of the components. There's not room to have a different one for epsilon one and another one for epsilon two because they're both only got p-squared vertices. It's only got p squared vertices to begin with, and each of these components would have to have size, p squared plus 0%. Right, there's only one large component per Markov graph modulo p. And so, right, once you fix epsilon, and that was their argument, was that if you fix epsilon to be equal to one, for example, then you're finding the Markov graphs whose large components. Whose large components may exclude fewer than p vertices, but then by the argument of Chen, that extra connected component can't exist in the first place. But so any connected component that you get out of that for a sufficiently large p would have to be the same connected component that you get for any other epsilon for which that p also works. Yes. Did you say that in the intermediate piece where connectivity is not known, you can sometimes deduce it? You can. So the argument here that this bound came from, it's based on the factorization of both p plus one and p minus one, and the sizes of the orbits. Orbits of these rotation maps correspond to the factors of p plus and minus one. And so based on this factorization, you can do quite a lot of estimating and bounding in order to count how many of these bad triples, so to speak, there are. Now, there's a lot of estimating here, and there's a lot of room potentially to improve these estimations. One of the tools that they use in this paper is a theory of maximal divisors, which are divisors below a certain threshold, which don't share divisibility with any other divisors below this threshold. So there's a lot of potential room here. A lot of potential room here to improve this valve based on these estimations. But what ends up happening is you take a p, you factor p plus one, you factor p minus one, you look at those factors, you make a counting argument based on that, and then sometimes you can say, yes, this graph is connected. And sometimes this argument is inconclusive. You say, well, there's too many of these bad triples, so to speak, that they could potentially. To speak, that they could potentially form a separate connected component, and then you're inconclusive. Now, they ran this argument for quite a large number of crimes, and their argument gets better the higher you go, in the sense that you're more likely for the algorithm to terminate it conclusively and say, Yes, I am connected. So, they have a nice table showing the percentage of random crimes that they chose and how many of them ended up being connected, and it appears to approach one. But you hit up with the computational factor here, which is that factoring p plus and minus one is in general time-consuming. And so that's partly where the no man's land comes in. That the primes that are close to 1 million. Are close to 1 million. The algorithm gives an affirmative answer for not that many of these volumes. And then the higher you go, the more frequently it returns an affirmative answer. But eventually, you just hit a computational limit that sort of your patient spreads out on the runtime. But eventually you can guarantee that they roll all reconnected past this limit. Yes? So we find the sound right? Yeah. So we understand right. So you've got the the lot of numbers defined on Z. So you've got this uh RA3, I mean uh so this is giving you triangulation of the surface you get when you take model from the two, I mean the project from the conventor group cannot get the time relation of that. So that's the big concurrent. Time relation of that. So that's the big component. And then the question is: would there be other solutions of P which do not come from this and which could still, and so this will still give you a triangulation of a surface. I mean, you seem to be saying that the dual is always the triangulation of the surface. For the big components, it's obvious. You just need the switching model and you have that from just the water. Yeah, right. Okay, okay, yeah. So this rotation move, so this corresponds to going around powerbolt, I mean the big component. And so is that the idea? Like trying to find, like, you moving along. Like you're moving along I mean if you were moving uh in the big component, you're trying to get back to this component containing the point infinity possible. Moving along these big components until you reach one of these components. Yes, although the details of this argument I might leave to one of the Leave to one of the geometers in the room. Although, like, one thing that I should also add here is that a lot of these arguments about moving from triples to triples with larger orders and trying to find these triples that you know are part of the large component, these are almost definitely not going to be the shortest paths. There are a lot more paths, and if you just start doing a random walk, you end up finding. Doing a random walk, you end up finding fairly short paths between these triples. It's just that these are the ones that we can sort of spell out explicitly. So far, we do not have an invariant on p, kind of an arithmetic invariant, which could decrease the height, that's that's kind of something we would like to have. Yes, that's something that we would really like to have because maybe when you look at the primes between When you look at the primes between when you work mod P between P over 2 and minus P over 2, you actually get some nice idea. Right, because the main tool that a lot of people have been using on these Arcov graphs so far has been the BGS argument. But when you actually start trying to construct these paths, these paths tend to be not the shortest. They tend to be quite long, possibly. I guess related to the stable. So the orbits of rot 1 are like the sort of connected regions around the tree. So the analog of the Markov conjecture would be whether each number mod T appears in only one orbit of rot 1. Is that plausible or is that too strong? I think that's too strong. Yeah, yeah, I think even in the small examples, you might see the maybe even Matthew I guess would be that even in a small example you would see Yeah, I have not seen anybody state an analog of the uniqueness conjecture Of the uniqueness conjecture for the mod P case, yet, and I think it's for exactly that reason that it's too strong. Although I would certainly be interested in seeing something like that, yeah. The next question would be: can you control how many times the number is the largest in the triple in the portal? Yeah. Yeah, that's part of the problem: is that a lot of the arguments over the Markov tree over the integers are based on like dissension arguments looking at the largest integer and you now no longer be how many different round one orbits can a single lumber appear in? And is there some bound on that? Well if you if you have a number, if you pick one coordinate, if you fix maybe a I guess the question I guess the question would be: like for how many B values is there a solution to the Markov equation? So part of the problem here also is that if you pick just two random triples and you ask, are they in the same rot one orbit? Well, I guess that would be exactly if they share an element in their triple. Yeah, this is a good question. This might be a good one to think about over the next four days. I know somewhere in my notebook I have a counting argument written down that's sort of based on how many ways can you combine a fixed day with some arbitrary second element. Maybe I'll go and I'll pull that back out and Maybe I'll pull that back out and look at that and see how it relates back to that. Other questions? If there's not a simple answer to this, maybe someone could tell me at lunch. But how do we know it's the big component that lifts again to integer solutions? Not one of the smaller components. Okay, yeah, so let's look at this argument in more detail over lunch. I'm fairly confident that it's going to be a little bit more. Fairly confident that it's going to be based on the so-called parabolic orbits because, so in the BGS paper, they have the hyperbolic orbits, which are the orbits of order dividing p minus 1. They have the elliptic orbits of order dividing p plus 1. There's one more type, which is the orbits of order p or 2p. Or 2p, that comes from the degenerate case of the parametrization. So this parametrization here, when these denominators, when you have that this doesn't decompose in this way, you end up with the degenerate case, and that gives you the parametric orbit, the parabolic orbits. Those have exactly P or 2P elements, and they will contain. They will contain, you can say pretty explicitly which of those contain. And again, this is an argument that I have written down in my notebook, and I'm going to pull it back up. I'm pretty sure that it always has to contain one of these triples that you can show fairly easily is contained in the large graph. If it's not 111, then it's one of the other ones. It's one of the other ones that I think is fairly close to the root. But let's maybe go through this argument over lunch. But I'm fairly confident that it has to do with the parabolic orbits specifically. Because those are the easiest to say which triples those contain explicitly. Something wrong about this, but I don't think it's known whether 111 is the convergence. I didn't think it was 111. No, exactly what chi is. You know exactly what chi is. I mean, it's like 3 plus 35 over 2. It's fortunate for you. Very low worker. But you could change, you could change. That's just going about one of the parabolic orbits, but then you can change at some point. You could take the remodel 4 and not have any of these parabolic things. It might at all. Let's look at this. Let's look at this then. This might be a good one for us to work on. Any other questions for the moment? Well, I'm very glad that there were some nice conversations that came out of this discussion, and I look forward to continuing many of these discussions later on. Yeah, maybe one more. Yeah, maybe one of the things. There are lots of variations on Markov's equations. Yes. Are there other close equations where sometimes we know that it's false? That gives modification of the equation more? Yes. So if you so that one of the one of the easiest ways to change the Markov equation is by swapping out this zero for some other integer mod p, and in that case you will not. And in that case, you will not have connected components. Now, if you have some data that I've generated on my computer looking at these components, and what it appears is that there will always be one of these, which is one that you can call the large component. Except in there's a degenerate case when zero is two, then you end up Is two, then you end up with sort of a cacophony of components that are all about the same size. But as long as you're avoiding that level set, it does appear that there is a large component. So in the case of Cayley, when it degenerates into Cayley QB, this equation linearizes and help you degenerate. But for other values of But for other values of k, it should be connected. But Chen's result at the moment, I think, only applies to Markov. Other results that can be extended. But the expectation at least is that apart from Kaylee-Cubic and a few other understood cases, you should have strong approximation. I'll say a little bit. I'll say I'll say a little bit about it. So, one trick, I thought about the explicit, but we'll bring the meeting for people.
