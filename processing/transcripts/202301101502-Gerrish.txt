Okay, so uh this talk is a little different than a lot of the talks uh today in that it's kind of um more of a methodological talk. Uh it's developing a protocol, but it's answering a big it's uh the aim is to answer a big question. So yeah, that's fine. Okay, that's fine. So, and these are the players in this work. Again, me, and this is Isaac. He did some of the simulation work and some of the math work. Erica, both in Mexico, and Sophie in France, who has done kind of an extension of this work that I'll mention briefly. And okay. Actually, I just checked this link and it doesn't work. But this is, the last time I gave this talk was to a group of mathematicians, and this was the slide, it was a movie of DNA replication and mutation and that sort of thing, sort of with the aim of convincing them that I was a biologist and therefore they can forgive my mistakes in mathematics. Mistakes in mathematics. So this is just, again, for that audience, this is the idea that there's kind of a positive feedback loop if you look at replication of replication of machinery, right? So this is the DNA replication. You have proofreading repair DNA to proteins that make the machinery for DNA replication. Machinery for DNA replication, right? And so if you have errors in this DNA replication, then they can cause changes in the ability of the DNA machinery to replicate. And so you can get differences in mutation rate. And this is, again, sort of the positive feedback idea. You have DNA copying, you're copying the DNA. You're copying the DNA machinery. And errors in DNA copying can make DNA copying machinery less accurate, which in turn increases the errors in DNA copying mutations. So mutations beget mutations sort of thing, right? Mutations can increase the mutation, right? If we look at, this is, I worked for a while with HIV, and this is the HIV genome, and a very large fraction. And a very large fraction of the HIV genome, about a third of it is devoted to replication. So potentially any mutation within the replication machinery has the potential at least of changing the mutation rate and changing the accuracy of replication. So there's a lot of reason to believe that there are variants in mutation. Variants in mutation rate. Okay, there are two sides to this work that we're doing. One is sort of a basic science side, and that is is the evolution of mutation, sorry, the evolution of mutation rate Darwinian or Lamarckian? And I'm going to talk only briefly about that. The applied side is what is the rate of mutation to The rate of mutation to mutator phenotypes. So, and so here's the first. So, this is Darwin and Lamarck. Lamarck said that environment causes adaptations. Darwin said that environment selects adaptations. And sort of the first real experiment that asked the question: are mutations, are adaptive mutations caused by Different mutations caused by the environment they're in, or are they just selected by that environment? And that was done by Luria and Delberg with their famous experiment where they had some bacteria here in a flask, and you take some of that bacteria and grow it up in this flask, and you plate some of those here, and you count. So you put your pipette in there, and you plate this. You plate this and put your pipette in there, and plate this. And so, you're going to get a Poisson distribution here. And over on this side, you take your pipette in here and you inoculate this one. You take your pipette in here and you inoculate this one. And then you take your pipette in here and you plead it. And on this side, you don't. Well, if Darwin was right, then If Darwin was right, then you don't get a Poisson distribution. If Lamarck was right, then you do. And here's sort of the logic. So the bacteria grow up, right? And if the mutations are only created because they're needed, then they only occur right at the end, right? When they're plated, because that's when they're needed. They need to be resistant to whatever antibiotic is in there, is in those plates, or resistant. Or resistant to whatever T phage is in those plates. And if Darwin was right, then the mutations can occur anytime during the growth of these cultures, and you get a distribution that's extremely heavy-tailed because you have the possibility that a mutation can occur really early on and produce a lot of mutants in the final culture. So the expected difference. So, the expected distributions are very different. If Lamarck was right, then we expect a Poisson distribution. And if Darwin was right, we expect what's now called the Luria-Delbert distribution from that famous experiment. And these are, I express them here as their probability generating function because the Luria-Delbert distribution has no, that's the only way you can express it in probability generation. In the probability generator function format. And it has, in its simplest form, it has no defined moment and no closed form probability mass function. So the first experiments, well, this is actually the data from the Luria-Delberg distribution. You can say these are the averages, and this is the variance, right? So if it's Poisson, the average. So if it's Poisson, the average should equal the variance. And you can see that variance is much, much, much larger than the average. So we know that Darwin was right. So now that we know that Darwin's right, we can use the Luria-Delbert distribution and the probability generating function associated with it. And these guys have, since they developed a method of getting the probabilities. Of getting the probabilities from this PGF, which is nice. Anyways, so we're going to use this parameter lambda, the big lambda, which is the product of the final population size times the mutation rate. And so the idea is to, we're going to estimate lambda. So we can, right, so if we know, if we basically Basically, we can, using this function here, we can estimate lambda, and we know big n, so then we can estimate mu. And this is an improved fluctuation test that I called the Jones protocol in some work I did a while ago. And it basically, because it was developed by this guy, Jones, who observed that if you Observed that if you grow these, if the culture is up to the maximum possible, if you grow them up to very large population sizes and then dilute them and then plate them, you can actually get much tighter confidence intervals for your estimates of lambda. Okay, so here's this is the same PGF, but now we just, it's a composition of that with the Composition of that with the binomial sampling, right? Where V is the sampling probability. Okay, so just some quotes that mutators are common in nature. They make up about 1% of the natural E. coli populations. An early study revealed that 20% of the isolates from 37% of the examined cystic fibrosis patients were chronically kind of. Patients were chronically colonized by mutator strains. So, anyways, mutators are common. And this is a really old work that I did. We looked at the populations, Vlensky's, for those of you who know Vlenski, his famous experiment where he just takes bacterial population in the lab. Bacterial population in the lab, and he just transferred daily from the, and it just has been evolving now for something like 80,000 generations. And so what we did is we just measured the mutation rate of those. And we noticed that in three of the, so he has 12 independent lines, and in three of those lines, mutators were fixed. And by mutator, I mean strange. And by mutator, I mean strains that have a mutation rate that's between 10 and 1,000-fold higher. Maybe, yes, roughly 100, 100-fold higher than the wild type. So, and this is the time at which they arised. So mutators are common in cancer. There's a strong association between mutators and cancer. Mutators in cancer. And so this is the big question that we're trying to ask here. How often do mutators appear and what's the rate at which a population will generate mutators? And surprisingly, we don't know what it is. I mean, it's a very important parameter for cancer and for infectious diseases, right? Because infectious diseases. Because infectious diseases, if you have a higher mutation rate, you can maybe have a higher probability of developing resistance. And in cancer, there's an idea out there that mutators may actually precede the first one or two cancer mutations. So there's a strong, I mean, there's. I mean, it's an important parameter, and we don't know it. And so, this is kind of a first step at trying to estimate it. Okay, these are some slides that Isak did. This is basically the idea. We have wild type, wild types, and mutators in a population. And in this case, the wild type will produce a mutant, right? So we have a wild type. So we have a wild type that produces a mutant, X. And so we have wild types that can produce mutants. The X's are the mutants. And we have mutators that can produce mutants, right? So the sample space is this, it's wild type mutator and mutant produced by wild type and mutant produced by mutator. And mutants produced by mutators. But all that we can observe are the mutants. So we don't know who produced the mutants, whether it was a wild type or a mutator. So all we can observe in this case, if you, is the axes, right? So we just observe them as red circles. And from those numbers, the idea is to try to It's not working. I don't know why I can't get my mouse there. To leave the full screen? What's that? To reduce to the window. To exit the full screen. Oh, there we go. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, so anyways, these are just some simulations that we did. And so the white guys are wild type and they produce, and green guys are mutators. So you see it's producing mutators. So this is one example where it produced lots of mutators and zero mutants. And here's another example where it's a highly A highly stochastic process. That's kind of the point of these slides here. So, same parameters, and here we have this is without mutators. Okay, so it's just producing the red guys. There are the Yeah, it's this one here. So these um these guys are uh producing right the green guys are mutators and then mutators or wild type can produce mutants which are red. And what you see, so the green guys are invisible to us. The only thing that we can see are the red guys. So this is just how the red guys neutralize So, in this case, are the red guys neutral or beneficial? It doesn't matter. I'm sorry, the new tenants here, the red guys, are they neutral or beneficial or no curious? No, we assume that they're neutral. That assumption sometimes has to be tested. So, basically, what we have is sort of a branching process, sort of a Sort of a a nested branching process, right? So the different colors here color chalk up here if you're looking for color children. Okay, cool. Okay. So, okay, so this let's call the yellow guys with V papers. Okay, and then this can this This can, this lineage can go for, right, and then you get a mutant. And these guys are mutated. So basically, we have a nested branching process where let's make it try to make the nesting more obvious. So now all these guys, this lineage is now mutant, right? But they're also mutated, right? So it's kind of a nested lineage. Okay, and the question is, so there are two questions we want to ask. First of all, just by counting those numbers of red guys, can we detect Can we detect the presence of mutators? That's the first question. The second question is: if we can detect the presence of mutators, can we estimate the rate at which mutators are being produced in the population? And okay, just a very quick review of probability generating functions is this is how they're defined. And if you have a sum, let me go back to full screen. Let me go back to full screen mode here. So if you have a sum, then it has this nice property, right, that the sum is the product of the, these are random variables, and so their PGF is the product of the two PGFs. And this is the one we're really interested in, in because we have a nested branching process. So if we have, if we We have if we call X mutators, right, and Y mutants, then the number of mutants produced by mutators will have a probability generating function that is I don't know if it's the same notation, yeah. Okay, so Okay, so this is a very nice property of probability generating functions. So using this nice property, we can immediately, almost, get the PGF of numbers of mutants when mutators are allowed. So here we have the numbers of mutants. This is the number of mutants that produce. This is the number of mutants that's produced by wild type. And here we have the number of mutants that are produced by mutators, which is composition, right? Because it's a nested process. And this is the wild type mutation rate, mutator mutation rate, mutation rate from wild type to mutator, which is what we're interested in, and final population size. So, how do we use that in practice? So, how do we use that in practice? We can't use the nice tricks of Mon Sarkar. So, what we do is we just use an empirical probability generating function, which is defined in this way. So, Z is your dummy variable, and X sub i is the number of mutants on plate I, and N is the number of plates. Of number of plates. So yeah, if you have three plates with seven, three and five, it would be z to the seven plus z to the three plus z to the five. Okay? And that would be your empirical probability generity function. And then we take that and we look for a least squares fit to this and Yes. And in order to estimate these parameters, right? So that's the goal. And so just so this is in dummy variable space. And what we found is, I mean, this is just an example that, so the first question, of course, is there any signal at all? If we just look at the two curves in dummy variable space. The two curves in dummy variable space, are they different? And yes, they are. If this, when the rate of mutation to mutator is higher than the rate of mutation to select to selectable marker, at least that's what we've seen so far. And there may be other regions of parameter space. But okay, so does it work? And this is simulations and And with simulations, we have basically we just simulated this process, right? So you saw the movies, and we just recorded the number of red guys. We did that a number of times. So we have a number of counts of red guys in different cultures, and then we use this mathematical machinery to try to estimate the rate of mutation. Of mutation to mutation to mutator. And in this case, it works pretty well. We had to use a data set of 200 cultures, which is big, but not implausible. And so this is the simulation. So with simulations, it works nice. And this is the point of my talk where I'm supposed to say, and it's I'm supposed to say, and it works with empirical data, but it doesn't. So, well, at least, I mean, this is, we use just a very small data, so we're using the original data set from Lurie and Belbrook, and it's a very small data set. We just, in the last couple of days, we're trying a data set from Danish group Bo et al. And that's a much larger data set, and we think. Data set, and we think I wanted to. I actually had a slide about that, but we still have questions about it, so I didn't put it up because I'm not quite sure it's right. But anyways, there's hope. There's hope, even though our first observation is terrible. And okay, and just a quick word about How this machinery might be used to sort of look at whether the evolution of mutation rate is Lamarckian, right? So if Lamarck were right about the evolution of mutation rate, then this is what the PGF should be. So this is the same, but now this thing is different. This is a Poisson, so this is the generating function. The generating function of the mutators produced, right? So the mutators are being produced in this case by a Poisson distribution and not by a Lurier-Delhoe distribution. So in theory, we can use this framework to ask the question whether the evolution of mutation rate is Lamarckian. And just a very, very quick overview of this. So a couple of the Overview of this. So, a couple of the people that I'm working with in Mexico are specialists in fractal analysis. And so, in view of trying to use their skill set, we were thinking about how mutators versus wild type might grow differently in space. And so, the idea here is that the whole fractal analysis is all about self-similarity. Right? And so in the wild type, most mutants are going to appear very close to the time of sampling. But in mutator, you're going to have a larger variance. So you could potentially have an increase in sort of self-similarity in fractal dimension. Anyway, this is the The ideas that we're playing with there. And so here's spatial model with mutators and spatial model without mutators. And so a preliminary look at this does suggest that there's a higher fractal dimension with mutators versus without mutators. So maybe there's something there, maybe not. We're looking at it. We're looking at it, and yeah, I think my time is almost up here. So, next steps: we are still working on exploring parameter space to try to get kind of a pseudo-optimal experimental design. And one of the things, so we have lots of different ideas. I mean, the name of the game here, the real trick, is statistical power, right? Because, I mean, we're talking. Right, because I mean, we're talking about mutants of mutants, right? So one of the things we're looking at is where we have, so if this is population size, we do two or three growth cycles. So we'll let it grow up to some population size and then sample it and let it grow up to another population size. Another population size, well, approximately the same, right? And then, and then count numbers of mutants out here, right? And this has the one of the caveats here is that selection might start acting, right? And a lot of mutants are going to be, well, mutators are going to produce mutations at a higher rate, and a lot of the, most of those mutations are going to be neutral. Most of those mutations are going to be neutral or deleterious, right? So, mutators are going to have kind of a downward pull on them. And this is where our French collaborator Sophie comes in. She's done a model that this very complex, and it's a multi-type branching process where she looks at the accumulation of deleterious mutations in mutators and how that affects the numbers of mutants that you're. That you're going to get over time. And I think that's there was another variant I wanted to mention, but I can't think of it. Oh, and I wanted to mention also just so acknowledgements, first of all. Cohort here from the University of Pennsylvania, Carl O'Malley, who's a Carlo Malley, who's a director of the Arizona Cancer and Evolution Center, we gave a talk for their group a few months back, and they seem really interested in this methodology in the context of cancer and funding. NIH, and this is one of the reasons, well, this is the primary reasons that you're seeing me twice in this conference. Because my first, this is the first talk. This is the first talk that I proposed, and I really sort of wanted to stick with this talk. But the people who hold the first strings thought it may not be justifiable given that it's very far removed from the topic of the NIH grant. So Lindy was kind enough to let me do a lightning talk too, which allowed them to pay my way here. Allowed them to pay my way here. So that's why you had to suffer me twice. That's it. Anyways. Yeah. I have a question about your simulation work. So when you simulate these data, you analyze them with your model and can estimate the mutation rate towards the mutators. Mutators. Did you also try to analyze them with a model that does not actually allow you to mutate to mutators? And I wonder how this mutation towards mutations is subsumed in the other parameters, and whether in a model selection scheme you could actually identify that you need a model with mutation to mutators. Right, right, right. So are you talking about using simulations as sort of for inference? No, I'm talking more about you have the simulations already to analyze them with a model that doesn't actually consider mutators and then do a model selection and show statistically that there is a signal in your simulated data. Your simulated data format. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So to test the mathematical machinery. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. So that's an obvious first step that we've done. Yeah. And right, I mean, that addresses the first question, which is: can we detect the presence of mutators at all? And the answer is yes. Is yes, depending on parameters. And then the question is: are those parameters realistic? One of the things that, I guess one of the challenges in terms of putting this into practice is getting it to a high enough population size. Because since it's a nested branching process, you have mutants of mutants, right? Then we want really, really high final population sizes. Final population sizes. And if you have that, then yes, you can detect the presence of mutators. And of course, it depends on the intrinsic mutation, the wild-type mutation rate and that. So we think we have an idea, for example, I've worked a lot with E. coli, and I think we have a good idea of what the parameters are. I think we have a good idea of what the parameters are for E. coli. And so, what our simulations are suggesting is that if we can go to a final population between 10 to the 9th and 10 to the 10th, which is 10 to the 10th is a tall order. 10 to the 9th, not so much, but 10 to the 10th, you have to go to larger flasks. But it's doable and And so, and our simulation suggests that we can get the signal with that. So, sorry if I missed it, but does your framework allow you to estimate not only the presence of mutators, but the effect of the mutator allele? So, the multiplier of the wildlife? Excellent question. Excellent question. Yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't mention that. That's a huge caveat here, right? So, we have to assume. So we have to assume that. And so our idea first is when we go to estimate from E. coli, say, okay, assuming that the mutator is this strength, what's the rate to mutator, mutation rate to mutator. And assuming that it's this. And so we. Is it converted by orders of magnitude? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Great question. I guess, sorry, if I have a comment about your large flask requirement. Your large flask requirement. If you started with an already mutator phenotype and we're looking at like next step mutators, so you say you start with a deletion in a misnature parameter, and then you're looking for additional increases on top of that, would that let you make your experiment slightly more practical, I guess? Yes. Yes. In fact, that's another idea. We have mutator strains that we can work with. And yeah. Yep. Yes. I'm assuming that you are looking for a small deviation from the loop distribution, because otherwise that. If you're looking for a small effect, perhaps there is a method which would be somehow more sensitive than the least squares method that you use. Something that weights the distribution by the scales more or something like this that you can know? So, like different statistical methods that I mean we w the way we're we're estimating it is by comparing the theoretical PGF to the empirical PGF and there are lots of there are lots of little tricks that and tricks of the trade that we're learning as and there are yeah but I don't have a good answer but but all I can say is yes there are there are tricks to and and and the idea that it's that it's heavy tails That it's heavy-tailed. Whether or not we can take advantage of that fact is another big question that we're looking into. Question? I mean, if you're after trying to estimate the mutation rate to mutate it, or sort of think about what the public size is and if you know the number of genes. The number of genes? Well, it means you know sort of what genes really do affect mutation rates significantly, and therefore you know how big their targets are. Exactly. Will you not be able to get a better sense? Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, but then it's the I think it's the big question is what fraction of those mutations that occur in those genes will actually change the mutation rate. So I think that's the big unknown. But otherwise, that would be an easy way to sort of guesstimate. Because you would have the feeling that it would be difficult to know what fraction of mutations hitting this particular target and what type of mutations would. Right. And that's the difficult. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's sort of the big unknown. Yeah. So, naive question here, but you understand, right, that the Laurie-Dilbert distribution assumes some demographic model or some people want some demographic dynamics. And so, the reason I was thinking about this is because I was thinking about Rob's talk and whether or not like an exponential growth is realistic in a real world system and if deviations from this demographic model could explain the deviations between theoretical. The deviations between theoretical and commercial so actually it's surprisingly independent of the demographic model. So you can have so they use a model that sort of assumes exponential growth, but really all that matters is so you can have you can have a You can have growth that's exponential, right? Or you can have growth that is more sort of logistic or whatever the dynamics of the growth is. But what really matters is this final number here. Because sort of the assumption is that it's a pure birth process. It's a with a pure birth process, right? And it doesn't that doesn't well. So beyond this, like beyond exponential versus logistic, what about overlapping versus discrete generation variation? Like, I'm thinking about the number of cell divisions. Like, you could have case under very different numbers of cell divisions, right? Yeah. Well, well, I mean, it depends on the number of cell divisions. I mean, that's that's what. I mean that's what it depends on. So because it's a each division is a chance permutation. So if there's no death. I mean, there's no death. If there's no death. If there's no death, right? Yeah, and I was thinking, yeah. If there's no death, because then there's a subset that you're not counting that. Someone's already looked at the effect of deaths. Someone's already looked at the effect of death on the mutation rate estimation, and it death does. It affects me just saying one byte. Do you remember how it? Well, the guy who did it is sitting in the middle of the morning. No, no, this was Antoine. But is it really dependent on deaths? Because is it really? Because I mean, if you think of it backwards, if you've got a ton of deaths in the birth rate, it's just. You've got a ton of deaths, and the birth rate is just a tiny bit higher than the death rate. Think how many cell divisions you would need to get up to a million cells. So you actually have way more cells. But then also demographics matter. It matters how you reach the 500. But you're still... Oh, right, right, right, right. I mean, the other way, it's sort of like the folks in the corners, Deanna and Oscar, had this paper, like if you don't have every cell contributing to one drone, right? It's on a plate or something. So the most important thing. Plague or something, so it was a funny one. I'm wondering if this might potentially make a good longer discussion group on Thursday, but should we
