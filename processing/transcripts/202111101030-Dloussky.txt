Thank you. So, in projective geometry, you have a lot of analytic complex objects. It's Keller. In dimension, two situation changes. Some K3 surfaces have no holomorphic foliation. Inoue Bomberi have no curves. Some Inoue Bombiri have no L C structure. Structure. So, is there a structure common for all compact, complex surfaces, in particular for non-colour surfaces? So, we have seen already the definition of locally conformally symplectic taming complex structure. So, we have a two-form such that one, one part is positive, and it's d alpha. And it's d alpha, it's twisted, differential, and alpha is called a le form. Of course, you have examples of L Secret structures when omega is already one, one form and the conformal Keller structure if alpha is exact. So there is a first theorem. There is a first theorem I will quote proved in 2016. Any compact complex surface admits a taming LCS. So we have here some remarks on the colour situation. And Belgone first noticed, proved that there exist non-Kellar surfaces with no L-Secastral. With no LCR structure. There are other LCS structures by Elias Berg Murphy. However, it's a different family of LCS structure. In particular, we have seen the first on Monday that because of the rational curves, it cannot tame the complex structure. And rational curves exist on many compact surfaces, for example, Cato surfaces. The second theorem is description, in fact, of modulus space of such structures. We shall denote by TOS the class in Durham. Comology of Lie form of taming LCS. So the result is either an open of minus infinity zero, or I shall explain why it's in this interval, or it's a single point. It's a single point only for Inuit-Bombieri surfaces. So the context. So the context. So I'm mainly interested in seventh class surfaces. So by definition, first Betty number is one and dimension of pluri or all tensor product of the canonical bundle is zero. So this is why we have no sections for M in L star. The other The other complex surfaces, when B1 is odd, which are known Keller, are L Cica by Belgoon-based man Tree Cherry. So the conjecture we are looking for is that any minimal S in class 7, different from Inwe Bombieri, contains a global spherical shell. So I Spherical shell. So I recall what it is. You have a neighborhood of the sphere in the C2, which embeds in the surface in such a way that the complement of the image of the sphere doesn't disconnect. That's a notion which has been introduced by Mazaridic Cato. Independently, these kinds of surfaces have been constructed by Lacamura, but by deformation But by deformation of projective surfaces with one-dimensional singularity, and the deformation of these surfaces produces also surfaces with global spherical shelves. When B2 is While B2 is minimal, B2 is strictly positive. A minimal surface is called Cato surface. When B2S is equal to zero, you have half. That's the simplest example of surfaces with spherical shells. So if we classify these surfaces as the end of Ocodera classification, and then it will be that topological. And then it will be that topologically, it's a connected sum of S1 cross S3 with several copies of P1. The number of P1, it's exactly the number of blowing ups you use in catal surface to construct the surface. Telemann proved for B2 equal to 1, 2, 3 that there are at least one. That there are at least one rational curve on these surfaces. So it ends the classification for B2 equal to 1. Unfortunately, his method constructs only a cycle of rational curves, and a cycle may contain only one curve with a double point. For B2 greater than 3, Greater than three, there is the study of a modulus space of fiber bundles whose dimension is B2 and it becomes very complicated. So the method has to be simplified. So is it possible to construct all the objects that these LCS taming structures related to the component? Related to the complex structure, LCK, currents, space hash functions. Brunela proved that every catal surface admits a LCCA structure. So till now, that's an open question to find in the modulus space of in the interval, the open set, if you remove the case of Case of Inoue-Bombieri surfaces, where are the Keller structures? So I shall give ideas for the proof. So general facts. So we consider flat line bundles. You can put You can put on the trival L Ercroix cross M connection with A closed. So Nabla square is zero. It's a flat connection and the theorem of Malgrange defines a complex structure on this line bundle. Locally, alpha is alpha is given by dfi and the o on ui the exponential of minus fi give a parallel section of l alpha such in such construction the line bundles are isomorphic if and only if the the class in h1 the ram H1 the RAM is the same. So I'm going to a little bit farther. We have line bundles L alpha, which is obtained by tensorization by C of the previous one. And the channel curvature is there is a general formula given here. And now Even here. And now I'm interested in the degree. It's always possible to suppose by a conformal change that the F, which is a KL form associated to the metric, is Goduchant. So here is the formula of the degree and And the degree of relatively a go-discharge metric of L alpha, so G and L alpha, alpha is are independent first, it's possible to compute. So here it's the definition. After I replaced the Chen curvature by the Chen curvature by the dj alpha, that's immediate. And since it's possible to put here a horizontal star, so it's the product. And after you d pass becomes here the joint, and you apply j, but j square is equal to minus, so there is a minus here. equal to minus, so there is a minus here which appears. And this is in fact the Lee form. Here alpha is closed, here it's co-closed, so it remains in the with the decomposition of it just remains the harmonic parts so When b1 equals 1, the sign doesn't depend on the Gaudichan metric because it's convex, set of Gaudichan metrics is convex, and zero is forbidden. So we are in minus infinity, zero, or zero plus infinity. And we have also the degree of alpha, L alpha equal to zero, if and only if alpha equal to zero. and only if alpha equals zero so so this application is injective after we notice that there is isomorphism between complexes so given by this mapping so here we have this twisted derivative d alpha and if you change you And if you change, you modify locally. So you have k forms with values in the dual of a line bundle. So here we have geometries. You pass from a analytic point of view, so to a geometric point of view. That's the reason why it's twisted geometry, in fact. So there are. In fact, so there are different lemma if omega first lemma if omega is locally conformally symplectic then de alpha de alpha cf equal to zero. So such just development of omega, which has decomposition in B degree and very B degree and very easy computation. After his lemma two, you have to solve this equation, but this is two to form. You apply OG star. A computation gives this one, this equation. Lema3, there exists a solution. There exists a solution. There exists G tilde in the conformal class of G. There exists one form in the class, Durham class, such that we have this solution, if and only if we have a function, positive function, which satisfies order two differential equation here. Here. The method is to replace alpha by its harmonic parts and write the exact part with such a function where c is positive. You replace in the equation of lemma 2. So with what you see here, you have two parts. Here, that's you have two parts which are self-adjoint, and the middle part is not. That's the difficulty of the problem. And it gives a method, such as the method which uses Perron principle to solve this equation. There exists a solution with psi positive if and only if the principal eigenvalue is zero. So that's It is zero, so that's a difficult part. And it gives when you have a solution here, you have the expression of the degree. Degree was minus this first term. And so here, as it's positive, so you have the degree which is negative. So finally, we have 2s. We have 2s in minus infinity zero and on h1, it's possible to put an order relation a greater than b if and only if this degree is positive when degree is negative here. Here, there is no section of the line bundle. That's a Gaudi-School theorem because the degree is in fact the volume of the zero set, the vanishing set of a section. Proposition: If S in If s in seventh class plus plus here means that b2 is strictly positive, then to s is an open, not empty, subset of minus infinity zero. The proof is based on a Gototo type deformation of the structure. We don't know if, in fact, Taurus is an interval, but it's open. So, how to use a question, how to use LCS staming structures to obtain new objects. So, we shall first interest with currents. It's impossible to define this twisted D on current. D on currents in the following way with phi. So d alpha goes from here k is the dimension. K dimension is decreasing. You apply to phi in a k minus one form with this formula. We have this relation. We have this relation between d alpha and d minus alpha. It's a particular case of a formula which has been given on Monday. In proposition, for S in a seventh class plus, we have equivalence between the following two conditions. For any For any alpha in the class of the Ram, there exists a Hermitian metric such that the alpha delpha C F equal to zero, or we have a taming. So I recall this fact because I'm interested in this condition, which will give currents. Proposition: Let beta a Durham class such that there exists a degree zero current, that's been a locally integrable function with T d beta d beta C to positive. Then B belongs to And B belongs to minus infinity zero, and in fact, it's an upper bound of tos. So we have a relation between function, locally integrable function, and a boundary here. Conversely, if to s is here in bounded, Here in bounded, bounded by B for some B negative, for each B there exists a current positive d beta d beta C positive of two. So we obtain positive currents. Just an idea of the proof that the computation first give such kind of formula. kind of formula. And after if A is in tow s as dimension is one, there exists a real T such such that B is T A. And as if I choose one form given by the same formula and taking T on both members, so I have Tf which is positive strictly and Strictly, and I use definitions, but here it's negative. So t minus one over two must be negative. And so t is in 0, 1 and a equal to b over t is less than b because b is negative. Don't forget that. Conversely, we use Anne-Bannard theorem. That's a kind of theorem. That's a kind of theorem like Harvey Lauson used also and Banard. Now, we want obtain functions, PSH functions. So we take a special, we can take a special covering of Z given by. Given by this kernel. If in case of the fundamental group of S is Z, so this covering is in fact the universal covering. We denote by J-Hart the automorphism such that S is the quotient. We have the proposition, S admits. S admits a closed one form, beta. And sorry, you hear me? I hear nothing. S admits a closed one form beta with and two negative of degree zero, such that t is positive, if and only if this covering admits a negative Persage function. Pesage function, which is automorphic multiplicatively. I mean that there exists a real number such that we have the composition with the automorphism of the covering is equal to a multiple of U-hats. We have a similar result with sto positive, and we obtain T positive, and it's also automorphic. So that corresponds to different situations, different cases of functions. The proof is quite simple. Tau is a function in locally integral function. A locally integrable function, we consider lifts, which are invariant by g on s hat. There is a smooth function such that beta is equal to df hat, and then there is a constant like that. Of course, c cannot be zero, and it may be supposed positive if you change g hat into j hat minus one. And we have now ddc of exponential of f at two positive. So we obtain a Plurisabharmonic function here. So I now give examples. First, primary hop surfaces. You know that they are defined by a contraction. That they are defined by a contraction. I give the formula, it's well known, and I consider U hat on the universal covering space. Now, the fundamental group is Z logarithm of Z2. Here we obtain an additive automorphic function. So D of this Descends on S. U is PSH, pluriharmonic outside the polar set. T hat is invariant by G hat, therefore induces an exact current T on S, exact current supported by the elliptic curve defined by Z2 equal to zero. If you consider a Lolland number for a Pluris of Harmonic function, it compares the rapidity of U hat toward minus infinity with the logarithm. So it's equal to one. And E hat, the inverse image of the elliptic curve in the universal covering space, that's exactly the point. That's exactly the point where the Leno number is positive, strictly positive. If you consider Enochi surfaces, they are given by a contraction like that. There is a normal form. And in the same way, P is a polynomial of degree B2, that the number of blowing up. That the number of blowing ups which are used to give the construction, you consider once again the pluris of harmonic function logarithm of z2, which is pluriharmonic outside z2 equal to zero, it's once again automorphic additive, and it's we have the same conclusion. We have the same conclusion as for HOF surfaces. We have a current, exact current, and we recover the cycle of rational curves defined by the equation Z2 equals zero, considering the points where Lolland numbers are strictly positive. The situation changes now for intermediate catal surfaces, defined by a contraction of type here. Now we have lambda z1 z2 power s plus a polynomial in z2. p is of degree at most z. Lambda is a complex number, non-zero, of course. course and z2 k k is an integer at least equal to two and z2 is less one so the absolute absolute value is less than one now you consider u hat equal to logarithm of z2 now it's automorphic multiplicative it's uh it's imagine It's immediate the factor is K and the current T I have no sound. Do you hear me? Yes, yeah, yeah, okay, because I and I hear nothing. So I'm going on. On you, you consider the current T does not induce a current on S now. If we want an additive Persage function to have the same trick as before, we may consider the function V hat equal to minus log of minus U hat. So that's a convex function of plurisabonic functions. It gives a PSA. It gives a Persash function. It's Peasache automorphic additive, but now we have a log of a log, and Lulland numbers are zero. Therefore, it's no more possible to recover curves by Schu theorem. So I recall, I recall, let T a close one current for C positive. For C positive, strictly positive, you consider the level set E C of T, the points in S such that the Lolland number is at least C. So it's an analytic set, it's a sum theorem. In S, since it contains only at most a finite number of curves, the one-dimensional part C of the union. Of the union of ECT, I denote by E plus is a curve. Perhaps there are also points, a countable number of points. We may suppose that the irreducible components are all rational, because on surfaces of seven scars, you may have only rational curves. You may have only rational curves and elliptic curves. But when a surface contains an elliptic curve, it's known that's HOPF or a special type of Enochi surface, Enochy Inoue surface, which contains a cycle of rational curves and an elliptic curve. So it's well known. So we shall suppose that the surface contains only rational curves. Surface contains only rational curves. If I consider for an irreducible component, this number, nu T Ci, the infimum of Lehland numbers along the curve, the irreducible curve. I write, I read. Write, I consider this difference of t and sum of new t ci, where ci is the current, one, one current. Now, E C of R is composed of points at most. And in fact, the examples, the properties of the example I quoted just before are characterized. Are characterizing of an enochy. S in seventh class is of or enochy, if and only if t there exists t exact positive one one current such that c is not empty, the one, one part. In one direction, we have seen examples. How much time I have. Time I have. Okay. So the inverse direction, if there is a rational curve such as A square equal to zero, it's a rational curve with double points. And so it's an Enochy surface. It's a theorem of Enochi. Therefore, we may suppose that all the rational curves have negative self-intersection, not minus one, because it's minimal. I suppose it's minimal. Minimal, I suppose. It's minimal. T is exact, that's the assumption. Ci are closed, there are four. R is positive and closed. Since we are in the seventh class, R exact implies that is also exact by Lamari theorem. So see this current. C, this current is exact, and C square is zero. So it's possible to find a divisor of self-intersection is zero and still once again by Enochy theorem, we have Enochy surfaces or not off because it's rational curves. It's rational curves. So, what is the goal? The goal is the theorem of Brunella. There are two theorems of Brunella. I put in only one setting, settlement. If S is in the seventh class and consider its cyclic covering, then the following conditions are equivalent. The minimal model. The minimal model of S is hyperbolic cateau surface. By hyperbolic cateau Brunella mean intermediate cateau surface or Inuiertubour surfaces. Respectively, Inui Bombieri. And the second condition is on S art there is a negative pluris of harmonic. Pluriso-harmonic function such that t equal to ddc of to positive and the support of t is an analytic set of dimension one respectively empty because in Wibombieri there is no curves so what does it mean that outside the polar set of the The polar set of the pluris of harmonic function, the function is pluriharmonic. So there is a gap between the previous theorem. So I put in this screen both theorem to compare them. So the main difference between them is that the regularity condition. If regularity condition If regularity condition is found, so that's the end of the classification, in fact. But it's a big gap. There is a gap with Bruno's theorem. We have to pass from L-A-Log to Pluriharmonic, in fact. So seventh class, I think, usually it was divided with B2. But from this point of view, From this point of view, we should consider on one hand op and enochi, and on other hand, inu bombieri and hyperbolic catosurfaces. And the fundamental fact is the aim is to find on the cyclic covering good plurisabarmonic function. Now, the question is Is how to obtain plurisabharmonic functions pluriharmonic outside polo set. So, in general, I don't know how to have them. So, I have to suppose one more condition, which is reasonable. It is to suppose that S admits a twisted logarithmic one-form, omega. Omega in H0 S omega omega 1. Sorry, I forgotten. So that's one form minus log D tensor reside by L L in H1S C star. A priori, L would be C star. On examples, the twisting. The twisting depends for Enochi surfaces. That's a complex number between zero, whose moduli is between zero and one. It's on the punctured disk. And for intermediate cato, it's integers. Integers, at least two, positive integers. And for Inoue. And for Inoue Irzebruk, it's real numbers which are solutions of a quadratic equation. So anyway, it's real. I denote by F the associate volation. So all known surfaces in class 7 are such one form. So suppose that it exists, it's not. That it exists, it's not a bad hypothesis. So, consider first special cases. If this line bundle is trivial, then in fact, it's a loki. I will give several. I will give several results. If S is in seventh class plus not Enochi, day, D, polar, just remarks that on seventh class, there is no one global one form. It doesn't exist. So if you want. So if you want one forms, you need to add a conditions, a polar set, logarithmic polar, or twisting. If it's not enochi, d polar, then d contains a cycle of Russian curve. So it's a very strong condition. Why it's true? Why it's true. That's if it doesn't contain a cycle of rational curves, so the maximal component of the divisor, it's not enough. So intersection matrix is negative. It may be contracted. And there is a theorem of Steelburg van Stratten, which says that in this situation, there is a I've not There is a, I've not written, but finally, when you go back, it would be holomorphic. So it's not possible since it's supposed that it's polar. So necessarily, this condition implies that D contains a cycle. As soon as the surface contains a cycle, you have information on the topology. By the theorem of Nakamura, Nacamura, such a surface has a deformation into blown-up off surfaces, and blown up surfaces as fundamental group equal to Z. So we have a relation. And so the covering S hat is in fact the universal covering space. So now S hat is the universal covering space. The universal covering space. Now, by use of Donaldson trivialization theorem of the intersection form, it's negative definite. So Donaldson trivialization theorem says that there are classes, B2 classes, which such that the The intersection form is you have classes epsilon i such that epsilon i square is equal to minus one, epsilon i, epsilon j equal to zero. It's trivial as this. With this class, it's possible to describe the cycle and other curves. And in fact, it's publishing in complex manifolds. It's publishing in complex manifolds. In fact, it's possible to prove that as soon as you have a cycle of rational curves, the set of curves organize as if it was a catal surface, but perhaps with missing curves. Perhaps it's only a cycle, but if there are a cycle, you have branches. Cycle, you have branches which meet a curve of the cycle, and two branches meet different curves. So another point which can be proved under this assumption that all intersection points are singularities of the foliation. That's not The foliation that's not surprising because the curves are invariant, and locally, locally, yeah, it appears because it's as a twisting, you have dz1 over z1, dz2 over z2, and it's in fact the constant here has to be non-zero, complex. Complex, both these constants have to be non-zero. This constant gives us the value of the residue along each curve. In fact, we have the exact sequence. First, the classical exact sequence is you remove a tensorization by L. So we have omega 1 to omega 1 log d. One log d that's the subshift, and after you have the residue mapping, that's d tilde, it's the normalization of the divisor. So normalization, so it becomes locally irreducible. So it means just that you separate all the rational curves. So you have curves separated, so you have You have when you consider the global sections. First, I have to tensorize by L, but L is locally free shift, so it's flat and the exactness is remained. And if you consider the global sections, Global sections, we have here H1. So it goes to H1 of all detailed tensorized by L. But now the curves are separated. So the restriction of L on P1 is treble. So that just here is H0 of DI, that's constant, so Zp. For each singular point of F, I say perps lambda one and lambda two are perps complex, but I say that the quotient is real. In fact, consider the holonomy group. The holonomy group is generated in this situation of lambda. Generated in this situation of lambda one and lambda two are non-zero. It's mu z, mu x. You consider the holonomy groups. You take a small dix transverse to a curve and you consider loops based on the intersection, and we go around the singularity. So you you So you follow a leaf along the loop and in fact you return to the transverse disk by multiplication of mu. And mu is exponential of 2 pi i lambda of p, this is the quotient. But if lambda of p you write lambda of p you write a plus i b real part and imaginary part then mu is this product so here it's a rotation and here it's b is not zero the exponential is not equal to one so you have a contraction so when you go back your leaf is nearer is nearer to the To the divisor. So that means that a leaf accumulates on the divisor, but is closed outside D. Now, here, intersection matrix is negative definite. Therefore, T contracts onto a normal point, normal isolated point. So N is this mapping. The singular point. The singular point down, and now I take the Aussie measure. H1 of this point, the image of D, is zero. Now we apply a Rehmerstein-Schiffmann extension theorem. You know, Rehmerstein theorem, classical. It means it says that if you have In an irreducible analytic set of dimension P in the complement of another of less dimension, the closure is still analytic. But Reimerstein is with an ambient space smooth, meaningful. So I have to use Schiffmann on analytic set. And this extension theorem says that the closure. That the closure of the image of the leaf is analytic. Hence, L is in the inverse image, which should be analytic, but it's impossible because L accumulates on another, L is of dimension one, and it accumulates on D, which is dimension one. So it's not possible. So So, as current, so it's possible to compute T of theta, that's current associated to theta. It has a meaning because the singular T is logarithmic. So, it's a current supported by G. So, replacing theta by a suitable complex multiple. Multiple, all the residue becomes real. So real teta, teteta, plus teta bach. In fact, this part is purely imaginary. So I possible to remove and so it's day alpha of theta and if i finish there it's possible to remove this and this theta perhaps multiplied by an exponential of gives a pluri subharmonic function pluriharmonic outside d Outside D. So thank you. I shall stop here.
