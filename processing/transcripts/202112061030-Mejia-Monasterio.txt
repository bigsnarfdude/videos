Gracias. Tenggo first, decided to disclose composites for various things, one because my presentation is in English. The second porno because it is not category when they are in Mexico, living various cities of Europe, and well, myself. And well, I am sure initially the whole vivo in Madrid is the mild professor of mathematics in the Polécécular Madrid University. Doctorado in Launa in Carmabaca in the Institute of Física. I am physical theorical physics, I stay in contact with With various colleagues that are de Matemáticas or Mathématicas, and an introduction. And Rodrigo gusto choos the presentation of the presentation, going to be proprietary transport in the family of villares. The villares a model. A model that initially pretends to utilize the problems of statistical mechanisms very definitely very simple. It is the dynamic data of a particular moment in general, but a geodesic constant of initial. If anitarian in a region, a compact region, with a fronter, in the particular reflections speculative. It is violent, present that very powerful. The front can do in some animation in a village, the front can be. But you can dispersed or contrary, convex por fur, protect, or include planes. We are a village, a cash of a form, with a fronter in which particularly one of the villagers, the entrepreneur of what existence. Potential existentio and es infinites like a cash development, not to infinity in the front, and how definitely defined, can be in the views or simples of distinct phenomena, like the gases, problems conduction problems, transport of mass, including color or energy. So, it interests us to Thos interest, our interests for the studio esteemed models expressament phenomenon of statistical mechanics. The simple palette, as I visited the rodent, not necessarily, but effectively a microscopic base to study this type of phenomenology macroscopic phenomena. Macroscopic. An example particularly in the cuados villades are by definition the model is transported in material transportation. It is a complicated problem, but rigorously rigorous. A material for us, you can imagine this definitely. And the idea can characterize the transport of these materials. There is infinity in all these materials for us, which is going to be rocks, better, or inclusive in biological systems. If we consider these types of systems in limited dynamic systems, so the structure, the topology, of the material porosity, not in some influences on transportation, one limited establishment, documentation that mesoscopic scales. Mesoscopic is the time as space, the composite not dependent of this topology, depending simple esoteric terminal volume and the transposition of terminals. We consider nanoporos or nanoscopic scales, the limited terms. The limited term, and then the interactions of the particle interactions with the cavity are important as the interactions between particular particles. And in this case, it is when we launched a point of mathematical, archadémic, including application. To study this transport, villars initially and pervolves simply for the most table. Rodriguez albums of Sinai and effectively this family of hyperbolic variables in first result important in the 50s by sin. Since in their 2005  And dynamically decided that consistent in a certain area in periodic conditions, and in the existence of circular and consideradis in the article of articles. This first violence that the history of villa is. Historia of villares, like models, of statistics, we have here. If someone has a question, I aquí podo ver chat, parece, but a questiona por favor esherman interrupteme y la discussínos. Welleno, muy bien. Well, very good. Obviously, if we have the statistical mechanics of gases, particular gas gas, two particular gases particularly interesting. This first contributions a program and to villa, which conclude, if you want to. That concluded, if we in 2013 with the work, which finally proposed robotic projects, if it was also a gas of in discounts. In discourse, in no good physical mass, for example, with velocity, in parallel, other results that mention Rodrigo, but.  At the studio of other types more than the villas and dispersible for the transport, so their dynamics. And also, we can mention that various results and probabilities, and ergolicidad, when the particles that are between them, between these cavities, are suggested. Stan suggests potential. Potential very particular potential, but the great ergo decided. Ergo decided if embargo for the study of the statistical mechanics that is sufficient if we want to propose a little bit more than that. And the reason of Ella is that in the physical system, exist a state, very important, in particular that the stationary stadium, that is in which no dependency of the evolution of the time. And if we need the description of these scenarios, we need Necessitamos that the dynamic scenario has a porque in the scale that trajectory in the space or initial and rational interaction. We result as this, as we rode in the consideration two observables when FG and their function. And we have their function of correlation function of F the time, and the time operated by the flujo, for the evolution, in the limit of time, is the case of correlated case, in which the correlation is comported implemented with the product of the media observables. A problem of this expression is that That the time apparently controls when your rapidity is proprietary. If we run into telegrams, if this property is going to be, then we have very important dynamic and the statistics of dynamic systems, which is that in the robotic road, that is quite great. Grand numbers. And if we have numbers, we can utilize or calculate corrections when depending on the velocity, with the cancer. The responding. Ok. The problem is to understand how this physical point is distinct what typical consideramos in mathematical considerations, astrophysical experiments that do not. Experiment that do not want two observables will satisfy this proprietary process, but we have a conjugate page that has observed as an interpretation important queue that the artists. Well, moving. Decided to exclude the history different story, the first result really important to provide mixing in a dynamic data for 19 porn people, a new sign and a central limit for the case of Gas Lorenz Vitamin. Vidimensional periodicism, which is the problem of what I have to do and mention. Carlos, I have a question: when this type of conditions to the observable conditions, one in mathematics, the one two, and But the point of the applications and the physical or what are the observables of interest or these are not if really this concise with some observables of interest in physical if physics are with observables important The observables important are, for example, genetic energy, the temperature, density, things for the style. They are campus, their functions, observables, which defines the dynamic microscopic requirements to model systemophysical models that have these. Tenganci est propedades. So that is typical of observables that are the observables relevant. Perfect. But the basics, one physical theory for satisfaction and we have this mixing force of observables. Observables relevant, some work the conditions simply more than what satisfaction control in a mathematical decadent of these correlations. Okay. This first result of good. Imer result of one and a half, not the difficulties to type properly. And passing 30 decided to prove the problem for the gas or subtension periodic extensions that the Lorenz periodic. Posteriorly in the 1930s, also Rodrigo. I also mentioned the sanguino proof exponential to the map of the map that is not the flujo del village, but it is not a situation based on the flujo and passar. Tel Villar and passing a few years very important to really provide or extend these results in the map of the punch. Toss millions force for various mercies and cabal liberal. Well, very well. So My bien, so this can tell that to be these uncuous roads, the proprietary, we can utilize a point of this parameter of the physical phenomenon. This history has particularly transported particles, they have a history of Rodrigo, but a year of puzzles can explore the concepts, the fundamentals of the statistical mechanics of the theory of Boltzmann in which challenging Spanish. Well, challenging this theory utilizing value, for example, there is a regulatory village regulatory, in panels, can be that the dynamic of particles in Gas Lorenz, but In the dynamic in the Lorenz, it is very distinct that they are circular for quadratus. For example, in this case, in this model of er in FEMA, as the wind tree model, model wind tree, The trajectories, the particles have finite velocities. Here the velocity, the vector velocity of its variable continuum, but in this case, the vector velocity can be simple two values. Or this, or this. Well, this problem that can be relatively more A relatively sensitive mass is much more efficient in the territory that Lorenzo is a point mathematical. The raise of it, one of the razors of this existence of these skills, and the existence of these discontinuities of the production, that trajectory many circumstances when passing a very circumstances.  Perbolico, in this case, the exponents of the sono, the dynamic integral, but the squins are society with singularities in the space that we know with. For example, we have the same interval of the monitoring in red signals, and not in some obstacles in the media, there are. Colour in the medium, there in a garage of the Lord, puedes the dynamic implementing rotation, all the rotation, and geodesic razor in total. If the stack is more than Lorenz, because we are an interval, the space has a superior, two, in which we have rotations of a part of the village, rotations in the other part of the village. The other part of the village is that these connected pork connections. The point in these systems parades like what are the physics and perbolices in the space, but in some separate exponential of the trajectory in the contrary. The case of The case of the model of wind tree of error in France, the space has this structure, tien age four, and well between these solutions, rotations in the pods pass much, the trajectory can change through their conclusions. The dynamic village in our The dynamic dynamics in those points with our definitions in the choice, our definitions in the trajectory when the exactly colligions in general is really singular in the space in the space. And how wear a transport very complex. As I mentioned, this type of model of winter models have a reflection in the interest, it is a mathematical interest in what. What great application to the flujos of technology? It is a program to make what one system. But very interesting. My interests are very important. Muy interests, very interesting relations with problems in Marsacani and users. Ok, so the type of transport of the dimensional is in systems that we have polygonal channels, which are simple channels, a dimensional channel that is formed by a repetition of a monitor that is a polygonal. There is a superior, a inferior ferrite. From inferior in the entry of the particular areas, the cavity is cavidad in blank. And how is this simulation pictorical? The function as portadors, like regardless of initial conditions, is interval initial intervention, conditional conditions, which came for their own. They are interested. That mechanism that is a chaotic mechanism in the exponential of trajectories, to learn the dispersion of these initial conditions. And the question that can be physical and mathematical is what the distribution of probability, or what is the probability that a particular standard has zero. Stand in a positional position, a position that is the statistic of the system of rebanado in our vista together. The transport very when we Implemente when we transport, and refer to implementation to understand how to initial conditions, roads that are important evolution in the time. If the diffusive system, if the transport is diffusible, we are still in two civil definition that. Well, for definition of things that transport diffusion and satisfaction of diffusion, if the density of space satisfies the diffusion. This diffusion, if we consider the contour, have a solution general simply generic simplicity, which is similar to a Gaussian. Gaussian in space, with a variance that create the line in the time and that depends on this exponent of physical or coefficient of diffusion. And for definition, very quickly the variance of this particular particle divided by a How evolution in the time and particles for diffusion will explain more of the domain or disclosures. The variant is with us also also in physical as the mean square displacement of the medium for this and that to transport as. Fusibo is like linear. If situations, many situations, in the platform for the time, as a potential time. In this case, a pued to a definite coefficient of generalized functionality, but the transport is not. But the transport is not diffusible, but anomaly. And this transport anomaly can be subdiffusible if the variance mass length, or superdiffusible, if the variance mass value. We have this case of subdiffusion, diffusion, and superdiffusion. How do we say this? One of the last question. Well, the situation is more complicated, which is only this classification of transport, diffusive, super diffusive, and in general that independently, as the variance, the second moment of the distribution of the diffusive normal segment or. It generalize or redeem the superiors, or momentum. The variance is correlated and for distinctions, because all moments of distribution of the results in the function of the order of the momentum. Function of the order of momentum is not uniform. If it is a certain manner for moments, there are some other para other moments, or general moments, is a function that is not linear in the order of the moment of time. The situation is more, but normally we are doing the distribution of probability or the probability of. For the probability of a displacement of the type that is input when the zero is in this property of invariance. If we have a scale, temporal determining an exponential or a constant, a point that the distribution of probability is invariant between the two. Invariant between this type. And result that dynamic system for the certain system is. And that coincidence when this function is not a middle function, it is a strong anomalous execution. Anomaly function was. No much a noses ain't 20, in 200. This bueno is a combination and existence, for example, two distinct scripts, because the combination of distinct status referred to how important it is to be in the police. Largas that could be in the schools of the distribution are generally associated with excursions that are because the schools of the typical distribution, or the cast of distributions that we are descriptions are, but can be larger. And this as a dynamical infinity, for example, For example, in maps intermittent data, their simples, in the unitary interventions, observed this component, here is the name of CU and records that the majority is the statistic of the value, valid. The valor medium, valor medium here is a valor temporal or a valor about the process and we are good because coincidental, coincidental, but it is a graphic nos dependent the value of the potential. The value of the plasma potential in the time, and we are graphically, that we can see the equation. How digital, for example, the mindsets that the moment has not in this case diffusible, so that, for example, if you have a sign. For example, if the variance is iguan, the new serum variance is linearly with the time. We scale diffusively terminated in momentum to the superior moments, which are realistic. This type of phenomenon. This type of phenomenon here, observing all phenomena, is not very concise to one in the area, in the area, well in the areas, because observa in map dimensional dimensions environments with infinite horizon, with the minor moments. Momentos minor depending the forma of the obstacles in the table of village, for example, in the case of case of periodic cases, or periodic or windry models of RF with the obstruction with channels of good studies. Stadium of good movies, we have the dynamic inferior moments to be determined by the type of dynamic type determined by stationary. But asymptotically, the dynamic dynamics are dominated by these trajectories that infinite horizontal are arbitrarily arbitrarily. Tractors of particles that can work the system with substance. James encountered one of the substrates. Also, in Hamilton, in Hamilton, no problems observed, this composite, this idea that when the trajectories of the tops can be evolved many evolution, that when they are in the chaotic region. In the chaotic region, there is no observation also in systems for people like the molecules and membranes of the celluloses to see all models to discriminate, which is models of diffusion for the button, for the volume, in the cuadas. Volume in the particles or proteins of air when the membrane is paramount of the membrane explorer in three-dimensional spaces, and bidimensional membership. This type of intermittent processes also the moments of the Of the same queen. And it is extraordinary that usable because in these channels, also this situation of strong cannon diffusion. The point of which no need is infinite to this composite. So, this method for definitely the type of system that can go to the final charge, which we have channels that are formed by repetitions of the unitary of this unitary polymer, is a polygon, the parameters of the determinants in the. This alturas determines the monteras and determines the horizontal horizon or finite or infinite. It is the dynamics with integral, but absolutely complicated. These are examples to distinct parameters between.  Scala ballistic, that is that the variance depends on the time, with the quadrature, and this independently horizontally is finite or infinite. That is independent of the particles of the canal, canstrate a infinite trajectory, or The situation of more complicated sensible senses are not the dynamic of trajectories, but the statistical observable relevant in physics, as coefficient and function, the variance of media, quadratic particles. Quadratic particulars, how are they sensible to the geometry of the villain? This is a figure only in this curve and in the violet curve. What is graphic here is not the balance of the particles, and imagine, for example, what we have to do and uniformly central with uniformity, also. Form of y theory, and we have the statistics of dispersal. If the parent is perfect parallel, if it is a superdiffusive, where the variance of the planet is more If in this front, the superior and inferior superior areas, where the case is epsilon, in this case, the transport is not more super difficult, but that is. It is super diffusible, but that is subdiffusible. The variance of this platform is subdiffusively, that is more than in the time. Machine that are not many types of transport, my side, superdiffusive, subdivisive, but diffusive. But their diffusive difficulty in dynamic distinctions, and together with a dynamic, in which new interactions, not many things, can be diffused. Carlos, there is some valor there. It passes subject, but. The problem of responding to no other manera to see what is numerically simple. Numerically simple impossible. One can, but for example, if these directors who have a bio, a billion times, one that is a point of numerical points, if the momentum is going to change. There are suggestions in numeric queues, but a point and formal and rebuild very difficult respondents. That the brazen. I experienced that continuum in these types of systems. But as I said, the diffusion in dynamic function is for absolutely ridiculous. No, it is more and spread and distributed. But that is good for the complexity. Of the complexity of these simples, or simples between simples because this compartment is established in the trade tienes that are multiple integration. Typically, what you can do or whatever is your arbitrary decision. I feel like in various programma sensitive and implementing temporal integration simple and machine algorithms in this case very sensitive, the evolution is. The evolution temporarily evolved because to resolve your resolve intersection of two intersections, so all we can do much, but the problem and that is here where arbitrary precision. The problem is when the trajectory passes very circumstances of what evolution of these trajectories. Evolution of these trajectories particularly space very conical, these singularities in the space, whatever, for many that the separation of our exponential trajectory, whatever, or whatever finite nosedar resulted a little distinct, not grammatical distinctions, but this experience because of Experiences because of the interest that in mathematics of all problems, in this work in 2015, this was your studio through this, not the classical wind tree model of infections. Model of inference. And what is essential? Well, first, we married a general vidimensional table, educating technical cats, the costs for violence, to see that the codices conceive can be applied to the approach. Sorry, can you apply the fluid of Tech Müller for these types of systems and demonstrate that the exponents of the fluid of Technullah dan para esema valor que determined the coefficient of diffusion? The coefficient of diffusion in this case results that super diffusible and depending like the variance of this variance depends like four territories. Simos insist in numerical In numerically, second trajectories and statistical trajectories, a variance in the commentary, the four territories, if not how 53 on the superficial, the subdivision, one person vital. No, it's very interesting and very disturbing that one needs its precision to study transportation. Well, I'm super transparent in the first place. Termino esto passago encinnate for these new victors, for example, that is in the time in the space that is at typical, for example, unlike a particular trajectory in a devil, for example, that would be paralyzed or it is a trajectory. And can But that repeats. If I insist in this structure change and we have a macroscopic structure that is, and OK, so I think if you have more time, if this part is what this here, this is what this here is a dynamic regular, and only linear, depending on the infinite, depending on, and we have another structure. And if we have more We have other structures, it is very parallel that in physics, begins that typically correlated or correlation. And that in this type of system is not desperate, existential correlations temporal, the position, as the idea of these poor phenomena, but are. Phenomenals, but they are absolutely interrupted. They are absolutely. Well, I have interest in studying general interest in studying the transport and anomalous, and the attention of the movement in general and general transport. For example, triangular violence, but results are limited. Again, audience of these interests to determine certain proprietas in these villages. Certain proprietors in these villas points mathematical. All that has been done, really with concluding, so that I will take some of the slides, and the people, but more interesting than our decides that we can do with these systems.  Mateo que algún sentido copy comportamento de la trajectori enos villares y que es una mathematico manejables, for example, this evolution in the interval in two variables, the interval for the center, their regular. And the reality is that the interval will be or dependent on if the position of particular position is better or more that this rebanador. That dynamic is very dynamic, I can dispatch and infinitely. And infinite times, between a cycle of periods, and we are resulting that, for example, the diffusion of the diffusion can calculate regulation, analytical, sensible, and also in the functions of correlations. We can see that there are more absurdity.  Disposition of mobile and enamored. It is simple that when they are simple, we can calculate all the properties of statistical status, so functions for students. And that we studied because this dynamic result described in universal classes, many systems that are important in this function. One thing that one has the variance of dynamic distinctions, and when they are distinct, I can see that this will paradigm stochastic as well. Paradigms, stochastic dynamics, like deterministic data, with distinct types of dynamical moments in limits, corrections for these dynamics, but also the functions of correlations, for this case, the function of correlation function in a cadence that appears to be and mentioned, but it is important, is a function of correlation function. It's like a correlation of correlation function for the fly and die, for the Gas de Lorenz with a definite, for a confined, for a infinite function, and the scalam correct all of the functions of correlations in a function, their universality of these dynamics. Most things more geometry that is when the space is a parallel and in which the parameters of the geometry, this angle and this and the infinite huge or infinite, but goodly time, we have yet these interests, more or less articulated. This article, and well, this encounter of the state, if you can terminate with it, can mention that the results are numerical that we study the statistics of time of first pass in these channels, and we paramount observing the statistics of the time. Tiempos devalues extremes and when one consider a channel that is finite, formal for a finite form of planetarias, that statistic is a macroscopic statistic well distinct depending on if the angle is that it is rational or irrational. This violent star. Star ration with the proprietors, the orbitals between rational and rational and mathematical determining this, and in that type of problem that is interested in it. If Mars and Node prepare a charge that you can stand up, Horse, but note somewhere, one is that these study diffusion in polygonal systems that in principle are relatively simple because no trajectory, but in our Most importantly, sensible geometry, and also complicated descriptive descriptions. In general, we depend on the unique here, which are these points, these singularities in the past, the conical and I'm interested in this. Carlo Angelo or Oliver in this direction, or what is. One is stochastic voice, in the cuando la particular fronters of the village, their velocity is terminated in a way, it is the enterprise institution of an interest in studying villages with interactual studies, because they are models identified for the transport of physics. Porte de physics, and also in the interest in the generalization of results of cattle to more general. Terminated a propaganda that is like a conference in Bangalore, in India. In India, well, that in the middle, the puest for 2022, and finally decided to allow them. If you have some interesting problems, these direction of the conference can registrar, and these mimes, if you have a question, as you can participate in this conference, that is a very important.  And you have to go to the next one. Ola Carlos Gracias, I want to say commentaries in the list of problems, assembling for. Y cato seños simplement considerar notify here, I see environment because they are simple translating the dynamic dynamics, of a particular study of a village. In this way, the trajectory of the particular category that particularly reflects it. In veterans reflect the particular reflection, reflect the same. And this can be repeated, the event of I is that when we do it. We can see the study of these trajectories simple, the study of geodesics between the case of quadratic as ours, this asido resulting also in some rational triangles, and that statistics of Of coalescing these viewers of what studies through technical studies of technique. The problem of Illo is that to be attributed between trajectories with the table of extended value can be fortunate, geometries in. For complicated things, if consideramos the cuadrades do not parallel their problems for people. So, that is my exploring type of problem, people who are doing it well. Most specifically, it is just a little bit. Muchacias, Carlos, I have a lot of percentage pero measure of the non-porcorse. Because we are tipping, and many of us are, and we are contacted, and extended for me, and that's the same thing.
