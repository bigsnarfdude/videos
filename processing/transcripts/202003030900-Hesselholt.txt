For organizing this meeting and thank you for the opportunity to speak here. So I would Okay, so uh yeah, let me admit so I should say first that this is probably showing up just like audio. Okay, so if something is commutative, it's geometry. And so we should try to understand the how Understand how the geometric language works. So, in a homotopy theory, if we have a commutative algebra in a spectrum, then we can take homotopy groups and then we get a commutative algebra, but not in the symmetric monoidal category of abelian groups, but in the symmetric monoidal category. The symmetric monotonic category of graded application. Yeah, I don't have a good name for that. So let me write it like this. But let me say, a good way to define it is to take a graded spectra and then take the heart for the billions and t-stars. If you do it that way. Uh uh if you do it that way, you also get the symmetric monoidal structure without having to write down any formulas or proving any uh wait, what's that? Graded or failed? Graded. C is discrete. C is discrete valence and t structure. Didn't I say valence? You did, but valence and t structure on silver aspects. Okay, what would you call it? What would you call it? Okay. So let's see. So isn't there a shift? Right. Yeah, there's a shift R with like indegree accurate. Yeah. Okay, so this is uh so so these these are what rates and uh And so, yeah, and so now we just produce the geometry the way we used to, so we take the opposite of Dirac rings. So, I'm not going to write that Dirac in the notation. I'm just going to use standard notation because we understand that. Always all of the rings that you can see. And so if I have a debug ring, I will bring, I will write spade A. Sorry, yeah, I will write split A if I filter as an N debugs. Yeah. And so now so so also I want to so the reading Uh I want to so the grading is uh is something we always so we have on the homotropic groups and it's a structure we cannot get rid of. So it's an intrinsic structure like spin is and I think we should think of it as spin. So I'm going to define the spin of a homogeneous element A to be minus one half the homological degree. Okay. Okay, so let's look at an example to see how this works. I should have asked this five minutes ago, but is the Dirac ring just a graded commuted algebra? What am I saying? So the underlying ring is not commuted. It's a graded screen algebra. What's up? It is a graded commutative algebra. Okay. But you're saying the underlying ring is not commuted? Yeah, because there's a sign. Yeah, because there's a signbox. It's a graded community. It's a graded community. Algebra. Okay, that's all it is. Graded is an adjective. I don't know why. Why does this need a new name called directory? Well, it is. Because I want to reserve grading for something that comes from a T structure, see. And this is different. I want to argue. I want to argue. Okay, so let's look at an example. So let P be a prime, which is odd, and let me write K for F P. So then yeah, so then the cosmology of B C P with a P coefficient is Coefficient is the Free Dirac ring on a spin one-half generator E and a spin one generator gamma. And okay, so it's an exterior algebra since a polynomial algebra, but it is the free algebra in this world on these generators. Yeah, so. Yeah, so uh now we can take spurf of this. So uh so this means the end the end the rock scheme which is with the filtration we get from the skeleton filtration so that is like like that and uh so this is And so this is now an affine 2 space over k. But now it's important that with it what the spin of the generators is. So okay now on BCP we have some additional structure. So on BCP we have a plus. Have a plus because CP is in a Boolean group, so it's classifying species again in a Building, but in particular group. And we also have a residual action of U1 mod Cp, which I will identify with U1. So now if we take oops, so Oops. So so spurf of the cognitive of P C P in k coefficients and then with the group structure. The group structure is just the additive formal group. So we have this two-dimensional two copies of an additive formal group on a spin one half generator and a spin one generator. And now we And now we have this residual, now we have this U1 action. So this gives an operator on homology that raises, so it raises homological degree by one, so it decreases co-homological degree by one. This is the B operator, but it's called a chart instead. And so what is the chart? And so what is the charge here? The charge of E is one or minus one if they prefer. And the charge of n is zero. Okay. So let's see. So now we can restate Milner's calculation of the dual Steenode algebra in this labels. Write in this label. So the tools D not algebra. Sorry, I'm a little confused about this charge business. It's the B operator. It's the B operator. It's the V operator. The multiplication by the by the fundamental class of the circle. Yeah, maybe that's called slame approach. Yeah, maybe that's called Slen product or something. Well so the dual thenode algebra which is the homotopic groups of k since a k so this gives an affine derived group speed. G and now and then Melnus calculation can be restated by saying that there's an extension. Of derived root streams derived root streams. So the action of the Will-Stenot algebra gives a representation of this in u1 equivariant automorphisms of this additive group. Group and it's faithful, and the protein is a copy of Gm. So this is the usual GM sitting in spins, so the spin zero here. I could have done everything with P equal to two, then I wouldn't have gamma, I would only have E here, and then Here, and then this would become an isomorphism. Okay, so this is to indicate how this can be useful. Yeah. Okay, so now let me begin to construct geometry and So, in the end, we want to define the RAC stacks and partial coherence heaves on the RAC stacks. And now, fortunately, Jury has written. Can you expand out that the actual exact sequence in standard notation? Yeah, so uh what is the Hough algebra that co-represents this? Algebra that co-represents this. It's k tau0 tau1 sine naught plus minus 1 sine 1 sine 2 and so on. This here is that part and this is well the one we know. And here, tau i is in, so if we look at an r-valued point, it's in r 2p to the i minus 1, and sine i is in r 2p to the i minus 2. Okay. I'm happy to go through the the calculation of this uh after, but not now. So if you want to see how to make this calculation, I'll have to do that. Okay, I don't know how people could build stacks in the old days, but now that Juri has given us this wonderful machinery, it's it's it's we just use what he has done. Okay, so again. So again, affine schemes are the opposite of if we write it like this, and again we write spec A when we think of this as a scheme. Okay. So now the abelian character The alien category of quasi-coherent modules on spit A is now the category of graded A matrix. Okay, and uh so now if we have a a map between affine schemes. Between affine schemes we have functors. So we have an adjunction, extension of scalars along F and restriction of scalars along F. Here. So if this was spec of A and this is spec of B, then this is given by M goes to B tends to all by A, M, and this one takes a B module and just uses it as A. I think this is right. Okay, so now we define so a map F in L is flat respectively three, four If extension of scalars along F is exact respectively faithful. Okay. Note that this is very different from how you build derival algebraic geometry. So when you derive algebraic geometry, if you have a map between If you have a map between TT Ultrabus, it's much more, it's much more restrictive requirements would be flat. So there are many more flat maps here. So derived geometry is not derived algebraic geometry. It's a different thing. Yeah. So now the first thing you have to prove is a faithfully flat descent for modules. So let me let me state that as a demo. So if So if from C some F in F is painfully flat. Then the map from the colon over delta R from C cross over S blank to S is an equivalent. Is an equivalence. And how do you prove that? You prove it precutually. So this is a cosimplicial graded ring. You want to prove that it's, or let's say a cosimplicial augmented graded abelian group. You want to prove it's exact. A Belium group, you want to prove it's exact. So you extend scalars up from along B to B, which is faithfully flat, and now it's split, so therefore it's exact, and because it was faithful, it was exactly the UNIDA inflating. Uh and uh and so now we move into uh into uh into uh higher algebra. So because this is functors from the opposite of F to spaces not sets. I'm going to use the STA notation. use the STA notation and write head to indicate pre-sheaves and tilde to use sheaves indicate sheaves not everybody likes that but let's use that a technical remark here this is not a small category so this actually doesn't make sense so let's let's just say that we by the That we by this, we really mean some that are restricted whose cardinality is restricted by some regular cardinal and then not worrying more about it in this lecture. So, now to make sheaves, we consider the localization. Here will be speak to the colours. What are those? I get entry and this functor from F. What? What's those? I get entry and the functors from open to street. Streets. Okay. This. That's animated sets. Okay. So we localized the perspective. Two things. So if we have F-in-Derox greens S and T, we can take the disjoint union in F and then apply the Yoneda embedding, or we can do it in the opposite order. We want this to become an equivalent. And similarly, for F from C to S faithfully flat, we want the map from the co limit of the UNIDA embedding of here. Here it doesn't matter yet. So the UNIDA embedding preserves limits. So the unit embedding preserves limits, so yeah. And uh but now this but it doesn't preserve cool so this goes to this and here this by the lemma is also H so yes we're going to do that. Okay. Uh yeah. Yeah. So, but now you have to prove a theorem. You have to prove that this localization here is accessible in basic set. And fortunately, Yuri does that for you. So, using what is written in Higher Topus Theory, chapter 6, and Chapter six and spectral algebraic geometry appendix E, I think. It follows that the localization is it accessible? and exact and that the infinity category of sheaves is an infinity toll part to so this is really wonderful so uh this means that it satisfies Lurius analogues of the GMO actions in particular. In particular, co-products are universal, and every root point is effective. So, yeah, so it's great that you can just pick this out of Tapa 6 in higher Toba's theory and not have to to try to prove it. Yeah. Yeah okay, so now let me prove something which is where I think we found quite a nice proof compared to how this is usually proved in the in the literature. Namely that the flat topology is a sub-canonical or in other words. Or the works that they do need an embedding. Through sheeps like this. Like this. Okay. So let's see. So, what do we have to prove? So, now let me use ring language. So, let R be let the Y frame and if from A to B a faithfully flat map So we must show that if we take maps from R to A, so this is the set of Of graded ring homomorphisms that the map from here to the limit B tensor over A blank, that this is an equivalence. So, this is potentially not such a This is potentially not such a nice question because this is just a set. There's no base point in this set. And this is a cosine vacial set, and we have to prove that this is an equivalence of species. So the limit here is the homotopy limit. What else is there? So, but now we use the faithfully the faithful the full sorry Embedding pair of rings, Dirac rings, in animated Dirac rings. This is what uh what uh Akil was calling simplicial. simply show the rock rings yesterday. But I really like the animated. So because this is the underlying infinity category of the model category of simplicial Dirac rings with a quilling model structure. But you don't need these models, you can characterize this completely infinity categorically and And the system of issues and also do that on their paper on flat purity and also other places. So this is really a great way to think about it. This identifies this as the zero truncated objects in there, in particular the embedding preserves limits. But now everything is infinity category, so therefore we. Is infinity category. So therefore, we can factor the map in question. And so let's see, we wanted to go from here to here. But uh now we can go through maps from Mass from R to this limit here in any metrics. And because both of these are mapping spaces in an infinity category, this will commute with limits. And this is what we proved before. So that proves that the flame. So probably this. So probably this well, okay, then I should say this proves true and one is easier. So there were two things we had to check for something to be achieved. Yeah. Okay. So the sheaves for the flat polity here is this is a very large large ring. The category of direct rings is a particular infinity category and it's also true that mapping set spaces would happen to be truncated. Excuse but let's talk about it. I don't think I think you need to be in animated rings to say this. In animated rings to say this. But yeah. To tell you the truth, I was confused about this myself. But I think, yeah. Let's not discuss it now. Let's discuss it. So here's a different mission. So a map. A map must be right stack so the right stacks is what what what that's the name for the objects in F tilde so such a map is is F i respectively F i flat Respectively, Fine people if every paste change. Okay, so if every base change along a map to S from an affine S is affine, then we say that this F is an affine map. If in addition this is a flat map, then we say this is affine flat. Or if this is a flat flat, Or if this is F if this is if T is Fine and this is faithful, then we say that F is F faithful. So let me write that down. With S F is a map respectively Respect a faithful man in F or in the essential image of F. And so for this this talk I will then just So for this talk, I will then just consider a small class of stacks, which we can call algebraic stacks, but really one should do atom stacks the mutual way. But let's not, for simplicity, let's not do that. So now definition of the atrophy stack. I dropped that. It is algebraic if there exists an affine faithfully flat map Like this will will yes, fine. So okay, so so how do we uh yeah, so this is the kind of thing we get. Yeah. So this is the kind of thing we get when we consider atom spectral sequences in Target. So here's a proposition. Let S be a group point object in In FIN DIRAC schemes. Yeah. So remember, in higher algebra, to be invertible is a property, whereas being commutative is structure. So if we think of this as the nerve of a one group point. Nerve of a one group point or a nerve of a category, then that that category is a group point is a condition on that simplicial set. We don't need to provide extra structure. Okay, so this is kind of a con condition, if you will? No, it's that if you write any element. any n as this union over a single point. Well, so if you write this like that, and the intersection is a single point, then now is was not such a screen. Yeah, this is no. Yeah, this ignores a bunch of little symbols. So then S of M to S of C to S of C prime, so S of those should be Cartesian. Got it. Yeah, that's the language. Okay. So group or objects. So group oil objects are what repres what replaces equivalent relations in infinity topos. It's equivalent to a content. You can write it as a content. Okay. Like this and assume. That D0 and D1 are flat. Then they are automatically faithfully flat because they have a common section. So then X, which is the geometric realization. Geometric realization of this is so formed in the rock stacks. It's an algebraic Dirac stack. And this one, the canonical method is not Canonical in affine way. It's not is affine faithfully flat. Yeah. Yeah, there's something to prove here, but again there's all the tools to do that are sitting on the shelf in chapter six of Higher Topus Theory. Once you learn where to look. So more over the square. Oops. Here it is cuts. This is the statement that this is that the group or is effective. Okay, so yeah Okay, so so much for stacks now uh to quarter coherent sheets. So let's see. So before we had defined the heart of quasi-coherence sheaves on S2B graded modules over the corresponding derupt ring. That is an abelian. That is an abelian category with enough projectives. So there's no problem taking the derived category of that. And this is now the infinity category of partial coherence of S. And here also we have an adjoint pair. Oops. Where these are the derived functions of what we had before. Because this is an affine map, it's exactly Follow the approach in Gates Gore and Rosenblung to construct quasi-coherence sheaves. One could also, it's probably possible to define as a risky topus where the underlying point set is the set of greater prime ideals. So we're not quite sure about that yet, so and we don't know, so let's not do that. Okay, and then and now form the left con extension of this. So So if we view this as a functor with respect to f lower star, then this is a functor from fine diructions to presentable infinity categories and wider joints. This is equivalent to the opposite of presentable infinity categories and left adjoints. And now we can't extend. Uh we can't extend along uh the unit embedding here. So this is the unique function that extends that and preserves co limits. So that means that q co of x is the co limit of affine schemes with a map to x. find schemes with a map to X of Q co is where this is the co-limit in here or equivalently it's the limit in in here and the for the inclusion of these categories into categories. These categories into cat infinity preserve limits, not co-limits. So, this is the better description because this is a limit we understand. So, this is just a limit in infinity categories. Yeah. So Okay, so here's a proposition if F is faithfully flat then Q co of X Of X Q co of S, sorry, is equivalent to the limit of Q co of C plus that. So Q co satisfies flat descent. This is not so easy to prove. This is not so easy to prove, and so this uses Luris-Barbec theorem, or also known as the Monet this theorem twice. And so the monadicity theorem identifies both sides with categories of Categories of modules over T with respect to some monad, and then you have to see that the monads are the same. Okay, so but as a consequence of that, Q profactors through Steve's Yeah. Okay. So so now we have that. Okay. Uh now Now we have to put now we put t structures in things. So it's also easy to put symmetric monochrome structures on things because the forgetful functions are from stable infinity uh yes well infinity categories and with the retensile power. And with the retensor power, so infinity categories will create strains. So now for F1 S we have the positive T structure. So we have the connective part Uh oops and the quotient I don't know what to call that co minus one connective file. Minus one connective file. Okay, so we have this. And now we extend to X at the right stack by saying that, well, so let's see. So q core of x is the limit over s and s. Is mapping to X of Q co of this. And now inside here we have the connective part so now we define this to be to be that. And these are limits. We can form these limits in presentable infinity curves and left adjoints. So therefore, we get the right adjoint current in the opposite direction here. Okay. And So, then to prove that that's a T structure, one just had to prove that this full subcategory is closed under extensions, and that's super easy. Okay, so this gives a T structure. In general, we cannot say what the co-connective part is here, but we kind of exist algebraically. So if X is this algebraic, then also the co-connective part is the limit of the co-connective parts. Or in other words, something is co-connected if and only if it's restriction along its Restriction along any map from an affine is co-connective. Yeah. So for algebraic stacks x, so remember if we have a full infinity category of quasi-coherence C some x, then this is a This is equivalent. I should also choose a flat colour like this. So let's see. So we have this, the descent. This that descends for the infinity category of horse coherent modules. But now if we are F, if we are algebraic, then we can then the same is true for the heart. So this tells us that the abelian group of OX modules is the same as graded OX modules. created O is modules with the six button or what topologies call co-modules okay so so now we have the language so I'm going to have to go. So now because we have so the grading makes it makes it gives us invertible OH modules, which I will write like this. Let me call this the spin the spin j half shift or twist the spin j half twist of O X. So this is pulled back from spec C and here this is this is now I just have to give a graded Z module and so this is Z module, and so this is the free C module of spin 1 JF. Okay, so remember the heart of Q co of spec Z is graded abelian groups. Okay, so this is the graded abelian group, which is Z sitting in cohomological In cohomological degree t. So in homological degree minus t. Okay. And P is that unique map from X to spec C. Okay, so now let's look at the descent spectral sequence. So let this be a map of commutative algebra. Commutative algebraic spectra then if D naught and D1 from here are flat That then we get an algebraic stack X such that this square oops Here is Cartesian and then the descent spectral sequence in homological CR braiding, you can regrade it any way you like. You like becomes e to ij is h minus i of x with coefficients m o x j h converging to i i plus j of whatever the distance vector sequence converges to. So in the last few minutes, let me show what this looks like for the Adams Novic. You didn't really want E to be in that structured category of spectrum, but you didn't really want E to be in E intend the array. I don't want rings things that are not E infinity. But you um s of course you can do this, but uh but yeah okay so okay, so here K is the sphere and E is immune. And so now let us So now let us define a spin one formal proof, one-dimensional formal corrupt proof scheme to be an end divide group scheme. Group scheme G such that locally for the flat topology I should say over something here over yes such that locally for the flag Flat topology on is the underlying int scheme is the affine spin one line. So not spin zero, spin one. Then the x value, the s value point in x is the group point. Of pierce T, alpha of spin one Dirac formal proof over S plus an isomorphism from O s O is a twisted one to the D algebra algebra. Okay. So in other words, we can interpret the structures. So OX1 we can interpret as the line bundle. Line bundle on the moduli step that classifies the B algebra. Okay. So, but now if we have if we have a spectrum, let me just take so a spectrum uh y gives uh an equal. OH module FY So now we don't have to separate between even on odd and now we could put if y here instead and then we would have sincere. Okay, good. Okay, good press. What the hell just happened? Yeah, so see, so if we don't have the wine, we just look at so in that case, there will only So in that case would there there will only be integer twists so only the integer twists of OX will have cohomology. All the half integer twists will have no cohomology. But in general there is and also if you write down the spectral sequence, the usual atom spectral sequence at an odd prime, there will be half integer twists. So we can think of the evenly graded part as The evenly graded part as commutative rings with a grading. So that's DM equivariant geometry. And in DM equivariant geometry, you have SAR twists. But now this is an extension of that where you have half integer SAR twists. And I mean this is just naturally the the geometry that's that's we live in. So you were doing something let's say category where you had a group or something. How much of this story would play around in a similar way? I'm not quite sure I understand what you say. But let me say something that might be related. So there's also something called called super geometry, right? So super geometry is the same, but we just say that 2 is equal to 0. But 2 is not 0, as we know. Okay, so here we have Tm intervariant geometry, and here we have super geometry. And now Dulin has understood every Tanakian thing that can happen. And so you can apply that to the symmetric monoidal category of graded abelian groups, maybe with some finiteness conditions. And then this gets identified. then this gets identified as representations of something. And what does it get with so it it gets rep identified as representations of GM in super vector spaces. But now because this sequence is not split, there's then some twisting guy, epsilon, that has to repair that. So I don't think it's always So, I don't think it's always not a good idea to say that 2 is 0. And so, this is an example of that. Yeah. So, in the Cochalos, you have the by Kopkins and students complex-oriented cohomology theories and the language of stats. You know, the thing description? No. Okay. You were there for the course. But therefore the course. My thoughts versus a so that's what he's talking about. You should, yeah, yeah. Yeah, what about that? So in there, there's a, you know, and you see this in many places alluded to in, you know, sort of philosophy that Mike puts out, that when you, you know, that when you have, you know, complex orientable quality theories. Orientable cohomology theories, or you know, when you take like the smash product of the two things, the associated stacks are the pullback over the moduli stack of formal groups. So like your E smash F is like the pullback of the associated stacks over your moduli stack of formal groups. And so two questions related to that. When you actually try to formulate the hypotheses to make this right and the hypotheses to associate stacks. To associate stacks, it becomes somewhat tricky. In this language, can you sort of make a blanket theorem of this nature? This is not something I have thought about, but I mean 20 years ago when Mike taught this course, there was no infinity categories. And I mean it makes life a lot easier that there's a language where we can talk about things. We can talk about things. I mean, so that we don't have to talk about a Cartesian square of two categories or something. I agree. It's easier to talk about sheaves of spaces than it is to talk about sheaves of one truncated spaces. But then a related question, maybe this might be a proposal, is that you never see in this language a discussion of odd degrees, how to understand. You know, how to understand the smash product of two things where you have stuff in odd degrees. So maybe that's a place where this language can help out. Doesn't Haynes have a paper about how to understand odd degrees for co-modules? Ah. Well then, then maybe it should be compared. Another precursor is that there's a paper of I don't know how to pronounce their last name, Inui, I-N-O-U. in a way, I-N-O-U-Primer? That proves this fact that the odd primary Doulette algebra is the appropriate automorphisms of this. Okay, we can look at that. I don't think I've not seen uh I've I've I doubt that he uses that uh the residual U1 action on BCP. I've not seen that yes. I've not seen that. You should look at the paper. So a lot of uh you see this two-dimensional affine. But is it not supergeometry then? It's not super geometry. Okay, I will look at it. I mean it's not a... It's not a. I mean, none of this is difficult, but having the grading is useful and it's Is useful. And geometry is the the good thing about geometry is that typically our brain has an easier time to process geometry than abstract algebra. And yeah. So that's it. Yeah. Thanks, Arthur. We wanted to
