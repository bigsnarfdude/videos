The organization for inviting me. So great mixture of people here, algebraists, topologists. So I definitely fall into the algebraic camp, but I'll try to pretend I know a little topology. And I thought I'd start by kind of giving an overview of sort of the connection between two of the major conjectures that people have been talking about. Let me fix the notation. And please let me know if I'm writing too small. True, please let me know if I'm writing too small. Just shout it out if I am. When I write mess, that's a mission for symmetric algebra on some number of variables. And don't get too worried about this. The variables will actually all have degree 2, and I'm using superscript or cohomological indexing. And when I write E, it stands for an exterior algebra. For an exterior algebra, and I need to indicate the number of variables up with a subscript. So, again, that's an exterior algebra on some number of variables with odd degree, and in fact, specifically the odd degree of negative one. Then I'll try to keep this notation up the entire time. So, T will be a chorus, the n chorus. Will be a porous, the n porus. So that's just a Cartesian product of n copies of the ones here, thought it was a topological abelian group. And then finally, x will be a, always denote a simple TN CW reference. So really that just means it's a space equipped with the torus action, but the torus action is relatively nice in the sense that you can break it down into cells. sense and break it down into cells. Okay, so oh, and TreeCon's was very, let's send out this email with these preliminary lecture notes. Let me just clarify the purpose of these is not for you to say look at them at all. My handwriting is sufficiently questionable at times. I thought rather than have people constantly ask me what's that symbol say, you can maybe just if you have the notes available in front of you, you can look at it. Or also for those you know participating online, maybe it's a little hard to see what I'm writing sometimes. So It's a little hard to see when I'm writing sometimes. So you can maybe look at those notes for clarity. And I'm not going to follow them exactly, but it's close enough. Okay, so let me tell you what BGG correspondence is in algebra. This is something many algebraists know well, and I'll just state it in its rather technical form. It's an equivalence of categories. Equivalence of categories between differential graded S modules and differential graded E modules in the same number of variables. This PB stands for the bounded derived category. Don't worry about the details, we don't know them. But all this is saying is up to quasi-isomorphism at least, you can think of a DGS module as the same thing as a DGO module and vice versa. Same thing as the DG ring module, and vice versa. And in fact, the functor going left to right can describe rather explicitly. What is a DG module over a graded ring? Let me say this out loud. So it's a graded module equipped with a differential that squares equals zero. So you should not confuse this with a complex of graded modules. It's slightly different technically. A complex of graded modules is a bi-graded thing. It's the homomodule index and the internal degrading. You take a complex of graded modules. A complex of graded modules and totalize it, you get a DG. That assignment is either one-to-one or odd to. So you lose information when you totalize, but also there are DG modules that don't come from complex functions. And I should say the classical DGG is actually about complexes, not graded modules. This is a slight variant of the classical one. Okay, so given a DG module, S module, so again, it has a graded module and a differential, which is S linear and squares. A differential, which is S linear and squares to zero. Then you just send it to derive a tensor product of the resonant field. And this can be modeled very, so this doesn't look like an E module, because where's E? But the point is, the way you realize this derived tensor product is with the Deswoil complex. And you want to be very explicit. K is, in fact, technically K linear is dual with V, don't worry about that. Linear dual would be, don't worry about that too much, tensor over S, equipped with this differential, which is multiplication by EI times sum probability. This is the Gazolda solution to K. All right, and so K obviously has an E module structure because the dual element, that's why this acquires a DG E module structure. That's the functor that represents this quote. And you can write down the inverse functor explicitly too, but I'm not going to. Okay. Oh, yeah, one last thing. So within the category of all DGS modules, you have those that have finite length homology. So it lives inside here and this BGG. And this BGG equivalence restricts to equivalence to a subcategory of this, and I'll just write it as part. So, and I'll just define out loud what that is. So, this is not quite 100% sort of correct, but basically the perfect DG, this stands for perfect DGE modules. What's a perfect DGE module? And there should be N's here, of course. It's a, well, basically, it's anything. Well, basically, it's anything quasi-isomorphic to a DGE module whose underlying graded E module is finally generated and projected. All right. Okay, so just as a simple example, what's the simplest example of a DG S module that has finite-dimensional homology? Well, how about K? Which is an S module in an obvious way, the variable is active as zero, and has trivial differentials. Active zero and has trivial differential. This counts as a DGS module. That's certainly finite-dimensional homology. And under BGG, it corresponds, well, not quite to E as you might want, but the dual of E, technically. But the dual of E is isomorphic to the suspension of V. So it is a perfect G muzzle. There are other conventions here for how to write down this correspondence, but this is the one that I prefer. Okay, so that's pure algebra, so now let me do a little deposit. So that's pure algebra, so now let me do a little topology. Here I'm more pretending to know topology than actually knowing it. So I refer to this, maybe no one else does, as topological EGT. So first notation, if I write x by t, that's what you get by modding out of x by the t action. And you can think of that as taking a one-point space, crossing it with Space, crossing it with x, which is silly, I realize, and then lining up with a t actually. Reason I'm writing it in that ridiculous way. This is the orbit space. And then if I just write x subscript t without the slash, that's the height of the orbit space. Remember, E T is a space you build that emits a nice and free. A nice and free t action, and which is contractable. So you can actually modify ET by a product of n infinite spheres, by the way. And just to help the algebraists understand what we're doing here, I'll write down this heuristic formula. So you should think of this as the derived tensor product of x with the f. How do you derive a derived functor, but what I mean by that, when you replace this by something that When you replace this by something that is still contractible, but upon which TX free, and then you form the modified T. Okay. And that's supposed to remind you of this, by the way, of the right tensor product of a module with a residue field. Okay. So now there's a unique map from any space to a point, of course. And so that induces a map because this is the Hamata orbital space, by the way. Homotopy orbit space, by the way. These terms have come up before, so I'm just reviewing them really. The homotopy orbit space instruction is clearly covariantly functorial, so a map from X to a point reduces a map to the homotopy orbit space of a single point with the one and only trivial t action. And that is, by definition, the classified space of t. So an action of a torus on X gives rise to a map from a homotopy orbit space. Rise to a map from a homotopy orbit space to the classified space. And this is reversible. So if you give me a map from a functor notation there, if you give me a map from a space to the classified space of a torus, you can form a space equipped with a t action by taking a ball back where y maps to dt by the given map, and then this e t value maps canonically on. Now you maps canonically on pullback of this. Because E T is a T space, the pullback of coordinate is a T action. These two assignments are inverse to each other up to an appropriate notion of U equivalence. Okay, so now what's the relationship between algebraic BGG and topological BGG? I'll tell you about that next. So torus being a topological group has a group law, of course. group has a group law, of course. And one feature of that is if you look at the singular coaching, sorry, the singular chain complex of T with rational coefficients, that's just a complex that computes singular homology with rational coefficients. This pairing makes this into a DGA, differential gradient algebra for rational numbers. Now the co-chain complex is always a DGA, but because of the Is always a DGA, but because of the group law, this chain complex becomes a DGA. In fact, it's a Hopk algebra. And then, since T acts on X, the co-chains of X, the chains, the chain complex for X, the fractional coefficients, is a DG C star TQ module. This mapping induces the module structure. And then finally, I want to make sure I say the right thing to do. Oh, yeah. Remember, I get this, I have this induced map from the Hamata orbit space to the classifying space. And now I'm going to look at this, now I'm finally going to talk about co-chains, which is controversial functorial. So look at the co-chain complex of Xt. This becomes a This becomes a DG module over the co-chain complex of DG. In fact, it's more than that, and I'll come back to this point later. The point is the co-chain complex is contrarily functorial. So you get an induced map going the opposite direction, and these are both DGAs. So a map of DGAs makes the target into a module over the source. More than just a DG module. Okay. More than just a DG control. Okay. Now, saying just scroll with me, is that how it works? Oh, there we go. Just slowed it. Fair. All right. So, okay, so finally we can begin to see the connection when we recall a couple of facts, which have come up over the past couple days. At least the second one, that's. So the first one is: what's What's the homology of a torus? The homology of a torus is basically an exterior algebra. The took homology of this complex, I would get an exterior algebra. But more is true. It is a formal DGA, meaning it is quasi-isomorphic to its homology. So there is a, so this, or twiddle, what is twiddle here? Twiddle means quasi-isomorphism. So quasi-isomorphism of DGAs is just a morphism of DGAs who induces an isomorphism on homology or co-ology. And then the other fact we need is that the singular co-chain complex of the classifying space of the torus, oh yeah, I mentioned earlier that the Et of a torus is a product of infinite spheres. When you modify that torus section, you get a product of Torus action, you get a product of infinite complex projective spaces. And the cohomology of a single infinite projective space is a polynomial ring in one variable, and so a product of them is a polynomial ring in n variables. So that motivates, but again, more is true. It's not just that its homology is the symmetric algebra. Clearer. Once again, the singular co-chain complex in the class namespace is formal. It's quasi-asomorphic tomology. It's quasi-isomorphic totality. There's an explicit map, which I'll write going this way, is a quasi-isomorphic strategy. Okay, so now the connection starts to come into play. We can summarize it as follows. If I have a torus action on a space, then one thing I can do is I can form its comic out of the orbital space, and then attached to that, I can form its single. Can form its singular chain convex for fractional coefficients. And this guy is a DGA over this, sorry, this guy is a DG module over this DGA, but thanks to this map, it is essentially the same thing as a DG EM module. Okay, and a slight subtlety here is that it follows that the Q linear dual is also a DG. Module over EM. Flight, taking of dual as it takes place, which always confuses me. Okay, but the other thing I can do, let's see. I screwed this up, didn't I? Sorry, this should have been. Ah, sorry about that. Lost my train of thought. Let me just, what is that in the video here? What I said was true of x, not of x of t. So, what I should have said is that the co-chain complex of xt is just a DG SN module. Why is that? Oh, because it's a DG module over the co-chain complex of BT, but then if you like that restriction of scalar as long as quasi-isomorphism, it becomes a DGSN module. It becomes a DGSN model. And then the other thing I can do, this is what I was saying a moment ago in a garden way, is I can take the chains of X, Q coefficients. This is a DGEN module. And therefore, so is its Q linear dual. That's the weird little duality we have to do to play this game. Okay, but now. Okay, but now I have a DGEN module and a GGSN module, and the BGG tells me those are the same thing up to this corresponding. And the sort of punchline is that these correspond to. Oh, did I ever say what BGG stands for? That's Bernstein, Gilfung, Gelfung. The three mathematicians who first discovered it. Any questions so far? Okay. So now I think I'm going to list a bunch of conjectures. At least three of them I think have already come up in the first two days, but over my job. And I've introduced this radical shortening of the number of writing I need to do. Which maybe you saw in that. Whoops. I've talked about some total rank conjectures and total rank conjectures. Total rank conjectures. A star is a member of the set T over R. So I gave kind of a practice talk at Lincoln a few, a little while back, and somehow I thought it was so clever I wrote T O star star star and star star star was either T O T O T A L. Some pointed out, I think it was always, in fact, I could just use one star. Okay. Okay. All right, so what's the total rank injection? Whoa, I'll emphasize the value of star button lamp. And this came up in our Minopedima's talk. Not quite in a way, a a slight variation of what I'm gonna phrase this. This is also not how Lucho actually stated it, but it's it's a special case of what he actually stated. Special case of what he actually showed me. Okay, so take M to be a graded SN module. Notice I did not say DG SN module. So what I mean by a graded SN module, if you say a graded SN module, you already sense, and you take the differential such that this dimension as a k vector space is Vector space is final. Then the way Irina put it is the sum of the betting numbers ought to be at least 2 to the n. And remember, there is a stronger conjecture which says something about the individual betting numbers. That stronger conjecture, the way I'm just saying it doesn't quite make sense, so I'll just stick with this, the total conjecture. It's only a lot of my talk anyway. Okay, so let's phrase this equivalently. Particular Y is the word rank appearing. So if F dot is the minimal grade of free resolution of M, then betting numbers are just the ranks of those minimal numbers. Numbers are just the ranks of those minimal modules, the modules appearing in the minimal resolution. So that's hence the name total rank, because you take the total rank of all the Fs that appear as F modules. All right, so that's the total rank notion. And something that doesn't really have a name that's not really appeared before quite this form. So I'm going to call it the generalized. So I'm going to call it the generalized total algebraic conjecture. So here I really do mean to take the F's to be a complex of graded modules. So really this is not a GG module, but its totalization would be a DG module. This generalization is going to be about DG modules. So it says if F is a stemming free G Snow G, The SN module such that the dimension of its homology, I guess I should write it as co-homology, as a k vector space is finite. So for example, if I started with a free resolution f dot, I could totalize it and get something like this. If the homology of the totalization would just be the m that you see here. And I'm assuming you remember the m in the fine change. So this is definitely the hypothesis. So this definitely hypotheses here clearly is a similar hypothesis here. Then the sum of the ranks of the Fi is the same enclosure. So each 2 of the n. Or a nice equivalent way to say this is if you took the homology of F tensored down to K. Down to k, divide out by the variables, in other words, forming a complex of k vector spaces, took its homology, or co-homology maybe, and then took its financial. That would be a waster gamma. These are seen to be equivalent if you replace F by a minimal semi-free VG module. It's close to a similar picture. Okay, questions so far? Let's see, maybe M is not clear or that is not what I'm trying to do. Uh here's uh I'm trying to hit I think I have this great thing not here's the easy fix. M can't be zero and if f can't be a cyclic okay. You guys should get one of those uh squeegee systems that Ark is using. Turner Java. Ark, what's if you remind me of semi-free? Yeah, okay, I meant to say this out loud. Thank you. So I'm not going to give you the definition, but think of it. Think of a bounded, well, I can. You said can I? Will I? No. Think of it as the appropriate analog of a bounded below complex of free modules. So the actual definition is there's an ascending filtration whose union is F and whose. Whose union is F and whose subquotients are all free with trivial differential, which you get automatically from a bounded below complex. Did it happen? You did give it average. I did give it down. So the screen is solid. That's good. So now I'll do the perfect DG DG V module version of generalized total break structure. So it's not a perfect version, it's just it's a version for perfect modules, what that really means. And remember, under B D G, D G S N module is the same thing as a DGEN module. And And the DGSN modules that have finite-dimensional homology correspond to the perfect DG. But BGD tells you there must be a way of just translating this almost word for word to a statement on the other side of the correspondence. That's all I'm going to do. So it just says that P is a perfect EGN module rather than Then this one's actually much simpler to state somehow. Just look at the total dimension of its homology of the star, all the homology of it, that should be a piece to Josh. Montreal. This one I think I've neglected to put in the notes now that I think about it. Okay. Okay. All right. And then finally, we have topology entering into the game. I'll squeeze this in right here in the form of the toral R, A L rank conjecture, and this is T high frame. Okay, so minimite global assumptions. X is a so simple means abelian, pi one, and the action on the higher objectives is trivial. On the higher object groups is trivial. T CW complex, that means it has a T action that's rather nice, okay? Not terribly pathological. So, if in addition to all those assumptions, you assume that the action is free on X, then the total rational cohomology of X must be at least must be at least the dimension q vector space of co-models of x with rational partitions is at least 2 of the other. All right. Okay, so what's the relation? So the four conjectures, I guess. What's the relationship between these four conjectures? That's what I'm going to tell you next. So we have the generalized total rank conjecture. So this is the mother of all conjectures in the sense that it implies everything else on the board. In particular, it's thanks to BGG, and the way I phrase this is unsurprising, this is equivalent to the perfect Perfect DGEN module conjecture. You prove one, you prove the other. You have a counterexample to one, you have a counterexample to the other. Foreshadowing there. And then, as I more or less alluded to earlier, this implies a Ramon's total conjecture. And as I said out loud, I'll not write down in a little more detail. Down in a little more detail. Just if you take a graded free resolution of a graded modules, that's the bi-graded thing. If you totalize it, you get a DGSA module. And if the hypotheses are satisfied for this, remember this is a resolution of M, then the hypotheses are more or less satisfied for this, but not just more or less, they are satisfied for this. So to prove the conjecture for things of this form, prove them in total conversations. And then, likewise, generalized total rate conjecture implies how important is total rate conjecture. And the way to see that, well, there's two ways. These are equivalent, so these both imply this, obviously, if you believe that one does, I suppose. So there's two ways of saying this. If you take, remember, I have this space X equipped with a T action, a torus action. What I can do, I want What I can do, I want to form a differential-graded SN module. Well, I already told you how to do that. First, take the homotopy orbit space and look at its singular co-chain complex. And again, I'll make this point at least once more beyond this now. I'm getting not just a DGSN module when I do this, I'm getting a DGSN outro when I do this. That's an indication that this error cannot be reversed. Be reversed. New this conjecture, you would not be tackling all the lengths that this conjecture addresses. If you prefer to think in terms of exterior algebras, first of all, you're strange, but if you do, then I can help you out. How do I get a perfect DGEN module from a face equipped with a torus action? I just look at singular chains, right? Which, remember, was a DGEN module in natural order. So I form. Take your pick. If you're senior chains or senior code chains, it doesn't really matter. All the senior chains, I guess. Remember, that's a DGEN module. And the hypotheses placed on X in the toral frame conjecture imply this is perfect. That's not so obvious, but it's true. All right. Oh, I did this occurred. I did this. Ah, this opportunity has probably passed. This opportunity has probably passed. I meant to point out, I wrote this talk before listening to the talks that came recently, of course. I said that the singular co-chain complex of the classifying space B T is quasi-isomorphic to a polynomial ring. But Bernard worked that out in much greater detail. In fact, what's true is the Sullivan-Nomal model of a singular co-chain complex of Bt is a polynomial ring in variables on the nodes. So it's not just quasi-asomparable. So you could, you could have. So you could you could approach this from the point of view. I wasn't planning to comment that should have occurred like ten minutes ago. Okay, questions? But we assume somewhere that X is finite dimensional? I mean, otherwise... Yes, okay. Yeah, absolutely. I skipped that. Sorry. I think I meant to throw that in at the beginning. Sorry about that. Compact. There we go. I don't know if I did or not. Let's do it. I will not talk about non-compact X's. So let's just make it a global assumption. Yes, absolutely. If you drop that, then this tutorial rank conjecture would be blatantly false. You wouldn't be getting a perfect EGDN module, so this case would not apply. And I didn't fully get back your remark about what the assumptions are for the solid model with the signal code chains, but I just want to point out that the signal code chains are not a module over um the module rec, right? Because the multiplication is not committed to it. So then you don't get the the module structure to monotopy. Yes, okay. Yes, okay, very good. So the singular co-chain complex of any space is a non-commutative differential-graded algebra. And the thing that Bernard introduced, this A, this Sullivan complex, A star, is a way of rendering that as a commutative DGA. And then sitting inside there is a Sullivan minimal model, which is a polynomial ring. That's right. That's right. So, but it is true that the singular code chain complex, even though it's non-commutative DJ, is possibly isomorphic to something that is scalar. All right. Any other questions? Ponder that while I erase it. What's assumptions on the field K at the BKG correspondence? So of the assumptions on the field K at the K. So of the assumptions on the field K, there are no assumptions. BGG is true in all characteristics. That's true, right? Okay. Characteristic 2 always confuses me, but I think it's true even in characteristic 2. The proof is really quite easy. It's very formal. The characteristic of the field just could not possibly enter into the proof. The proof is basically just the statement that you can resolve k over a polynomial ring by a Kazoo conference. By a gazille efforts. That's ultimately what it is. Okay. So finally, a theorem, which has been mentioned before, during this conference, I'll say. My theorem, so I'm going to have to read it carefully where I'll mess it up. So I think Adam decided this. By the way, this is not quite the version. By the way, it's not quite the version that Adam cited in his talk. I noticed he put 2018. I think it's 2017. I know it I actually proved it almost day that Trump was elected president. November 2016. Interpret that actually well. What's that? Was it before or after? I don't know, actually, but it was November of 2016. I think it must have been after. Must have been after. All right. Sorry. Sorry, putting such a somber mood over the audience by pointing that out. Reminding you that Trump is elected. Okay, now I need to assume the characteristic is not two. And F will be our good friend, the semi-free DGS of N module with finite dimensional and non-zero homology. And I'm gonna, I'll define this notation in a second, but I'm gonna use this so often. I'm going to use this so often that I started to abbreviate something that I've written down before by H. I'll tell you what H means in a second. It's going to be the obvious thing, it's just the total dimension of the homology, but I'll define that carefully. Under those assumptions, then the rank as an S-N module of F has to be at least 2 to the N, but as a factor, sadly. The factor is Sadly. The factor is the absolute value of the Euler characteristic of f divided by H of F. And as promised, here are the definition of these two undefined symbols. The way they're characteristic, you'll probably guess. It's just the alternating sum of the dimensions of a homology. Again, I should technically use superscripts, so it's kind of alien to me to do that. And then H of F. And h of s, this is not, a chi of f is of course quite standard notation. H of s is just my own dimension. So I want the non-alternating sum of the dimensions of the very summary. In other words, it's what I wrote previously, it's just the dimension of the total homology of L. I'm writing like this to indicate the connection with the order characteristic. Okay. Okay, so all right, so just to help you parse this, in any situation where this fraction is one, I will have proven the original total rectangle function. When is the fraction one? Well, the only way the fraction could be one is if there are either no negative terms or no positive terms in this chi expression. So the fraction is one if and only if either If and only if either all the odd cohomology of F vanishes or all the even cohomology of F vanishes. In all their cases, it's a fraction strictly less than one. It can even be zero, because whatever characteristic of such a thing can definitely be zero. For some F's, this theorem gives no information at all. It just says non-negative integer is at least zero in some cases. But in an important case, it does give no information. So a corollary is that Romlov's total rate conjecture holds, provided characteristic of k is not at 2. I'm going to sketch the proof of this eventually, probably in the second talk, and you'll see exactly why the characteristic odd bit of 2. That's not just an interesting to them. Okay, so the corollary is not an obvious consequence in the theorem the way I've stated it because as I just got done saying the generalized total rank conjecture would follow if only this fraction wasn't there, or this fraction is a little while. And that happens if either the even or the odd cohomology vanishes. Well, going back to the total rank conjecture, the DG module you get has homology of M, whatever graded module you serve. Disturbed, right? Oh, but so h of f, log of f, is m in this context. But m could have stuff and they'll be even in odd degrees. But remember, the polynomial ring has variables only in degree 2. So every ordinary graded module with trivial differentials, not a DG module, just ordinary graded module splits up into its even part and its odd part. And then you just apply Lithuania to each half, basically. That's how you put the category. Okay. Okay, so the thing I just erased, which as I was erasing it, I realized I should have said something about it first. The thing I just erased included the observation of the remember, I think I said this out loud a second ago. This is almost a proof of a generalized total conjecture, a mother of all conjectures. Only this fraction. Conjectures. If only this fraction wasn't there. And remember, the generalized total rank conjecture implies, in fact, there's a total rate conjecture. So this theorem has an obvious, really a corollary. I just think of it as a topological version of this theorem, the previous theorem. And I'm stating this very carefully in the hopes that topologists might have things to say about it, because I know very little about how to apply this. I'll give you one. Apply it. I'll give you one application of this theorem, but it's almost never one I know. So just because I garbled this earlier, let's make it very clear. So assume X is a compact before simple T and CW complex such that the action Such that the action is free, those are all the assumptions I need, then h of x is at least 2 to the n times the absolute value of chi of x sub t now over h of x sub t. And just to leave nothing to chance, you could probably guess these definitions when you give them everywhere. When you give them every private space, something gets defined. It's the alternative sum of the dimensions of the rational homology of that space. And h of the space, again, not standard notation so far as I know. It's the same thing without the altitude. It's a total dimension. It's not much. So left-hand side involves, so what does the toral rank conjecture predict? What does the toral rank conjecture predict in this notation? It predicts that h of x is at least 0 to the n. So once again, for any space which this fraction happens to be 1, the toral rank conjecture holds for such a space, such a term. So quite obviously, we get that the toral rank conjecture holds for our frame X, provided the odd The odd rational cohomology of x of t, a Hungarian order space, is entirely field. All right. Questions? Maybe it's worth pointing out that XT here is the usual orbit space. Yeah, okay, good. Thanks. Yeah, okay, good, thanks. Note, uh under all these assumptions I've labeled along, the homotopy orbit space is the same thing, not the homotopy equivalence, as the classical orbit space. So in particular, this is how you can deduce things like the cohomology of Xt is nice because it's X was a compact space, so this quote check remains compact, things like that. All right. Turn all the way over to erase here. Have you memorized the probably internal one? You've probably proven these by now, I'm guessing. That's all I've been on the board. Mark, can I ask a question? So is the compact assumption? Is the convac assumption guaranteeing that the homologous venture vanish? Yeah, not just eventually zero, but finite dimensional in total. If you have a finite number of cells in each dimension, but there's no bound on the dimension, then each individual homology is finite. But I want more than that. There's a finite number of cells total, basically. Therefore, the total homology is finite dimensional. So it's the analog, it's the under these various implications and correspondences. Implications and correspondences, it's the analog of the assumption that in the generalized torrent ranking, I've got to move this up so that you can use it again. The compact assumption is the analog of this assumption here, that the total dimension. Yeah, right, yeah, exactly. Sorry, because it's pointing to theorem. So, compactness is what gives you this. Yeah, and maybe just what is the Yeah, and maybe just what is the proof? So if you okay, I haven't proved the theorem yet. I kind of indicated how the corollary follows. This is really also just a corollary. How do you deduce this from the central theorem? You just take such x, attach to it its singular co-chain complex, and observe that it satisfies all of these properties. By the way, it looks a little weird. It looks weird. There's X here and X T here. I don't know if other people have this reaction. Somehow that's not present in this. Reaction. Somehow that's not present in this theorem. Let me point out something. I try to state this in the simplest way possible. Maybe I should have done this instead. Instead of saying the rank of f, I could have written the dimension as a k vector space of f tensored down to the residue field. So there's a weird kind of covariance going on here in that x goes with f tensored down to the F tensored down to the residue field, and X sub t goes with F itself. Do you see that? So that's the, I guess that is, I should have done it this way. This is a better, this is a more inspiring way of writing it. And again, they're not quite the same, but they are so long as f is minimal. And you can always assume f is minimal, because the numbers are the same. Sorry, that's f tensored with. Yeah, let me just, how about I just write there? Right there. So if f is minimal, by definition that means by tension down to k, its differential becomes zero, in which case this is clearly just the same as the rank of f as an s module. This is what's true in general, even if f is not n okay. We can't put H of X T or I'll just put H of X T X T Oh I see. This is correct, isn't it? Yeah, and this so X can be X T is a quotient of X. F tensor K is a quotient of F, I agree. But they get interchange because basically because of this weird Basically, because of this weird covariance that occurs in BGG. That's why the gander changes that. I don't know if that helps. That's how I think of it at least. Okay. So, let's see how we have time. Okay, perfect. Let me just give the sort of one and only topological application I know. And again, some of this has already been covered. So I think I will erase this again, right? This against my better instincts. So, this came up yesterday a couple times, I think. So recall why it is elliptic, both its cohomology with rational coefficients and its total rated list of how it up groups. I'll find it here. So for the algebraists in the world, what this is saying is if you look at the Solden minimal model, so that's a DG algebra over the rational numbers. And to be elliptic means that guy is both finally generated as an algebra, so only a finite number of variables are needed, and the homology is finite to neutral. For those of you who know more about DGA than you do about spaces, that's what elliptic means. You probably need Y to be some sort of reasonable space for this definition. I'm not going to try to get into those details that I don't really know. So in this situation, this came up in Bernard's thought for sure. It makes sense to talk about chi-sub pi of y, and it's just the alternating sum of the ranks of the dimensions. Of the ranks or the dimensions as two vector spaces of these rational homvectors. That's now a well-defined invariant. Most spaces are not elliptic, by the way. There's a very famous theorem, sorry, I don't know whose this is, which says either you're elliptic or, but within the realm of cohomology that is finite-dimensional, either you're elliptic, or not only are there infinitely many non-vanishing amethystic groups, but their ranks grow as much. With other groups, but their ranks grow, as mentioned. There's this huge dichotomy between elliptic spaces and all other spaces, and most spaces are not elliptic. That's what I understand it. Whatever most means. Okay, but they're a very nice product of spheres is elliptic, for example. But so nice enough spaces on it. Okay, so there's a theorem. And Bernard basically gave a proof of at least parts of this theorem. But as he mentioned, this theorem of Halbrun kind of. This theorem of Halberin kind of lies under the hood. So I'll call these Halberin's theorem. So correct me. Please do. So again, assume y is elliptic. That's the only situation in which this invariant is over multiplied. Then it's never positive, first of all. So this is intuitively obvious, I claim. But the proof, as you saw during the talk yesterday, is pretty hard. So intuitively, look, you've got in the Solz and Mimble model, you have even degree variables and odds. Model, you have even-degree variables and odd-degree variables. In order for the homology to be finite-dimensional, you have to kill off some power of every even variable. Otherwise, it would be infinitely number of powers. So how do you kill off a power of an even every variable? Oh, the easiest way is to adjoin an odd variable and have it map to it under the different. You have to have at least one odd variable for every even variable. That's what this is saying. I should say the dimensions of the fundamental. I should say the dimensions of the fundamental groups count the number of variables in each degree. That's the only thing. Okay. That's not a rigorous proof, of course, as we saw yesterday. Moreover, if chi is 0, that's the greatest value possible, in other words, then the odd homology of y is entirely zero. So again, I find this intuitively obvious. So again, I find this intuitively obvious, but you actually proof very hard to be sure. How could chi be zero? How could chi sub pi be zero? That means every even variable, some power of it, is killed by adjoining an odd variable. But to get chi to be zero, I could not have any other odd variables. So if you ponder that for a second, that would force the other characteristic to be exactly the same number of variables. Again, that's an entirely heuristic non-Rakers proof. That's the idea. That's the idea. Oh, okay. Sorry. What, yeah? I guess I didn't really ask the question. So, but I just, all I did just now, I didn't justify this at all. I just interpreted this as saying there's the same number of even variables as odd variables. But if you ponder that example, you'll come to the conclusion that there's no odd knowledge. Okay. All right. And then a third thing that I will need is that chi sub chi of one. So two is very happy. So, two is very happy news for me, by the way. As you will see, three is very sad for me. So, what can I say about prolific spaces where high sub pi is strictly less than zero? The ordinary Euler characteristic is exactly zero. So, let's see if I can come up with some BS justification for this that's non-rigorous. This means you have one extra odd variable. You have one extra odd variable. You have an odd variable that survives into homology, is what it means. So then that odd homology class, multiplication by it sort of gives you a bijection between the even stuff and the odd stuff in homology. And so therefore the order of variants is zero. Okay, this is getting even increasingly non-related, so I better stop before I embarrass myself. But that's at least the late intuition. I'll comprove all this rigorously forward. Let me throw in one thing. Definitely not quite a problem staring, obviously, as you'll see. Just a reminder: the odd cohomology vanishes if and only if chi of y equals h of y. That's an obvious statement. Okay. All right. Now, let's see. What was I going to say about? Oh, now let's get back to torus actions. That's just abstract. Now let's get back to Taurus actions. That's just abstract nonsense about elliptic spaces. Nonsense because we don't really know what we're talking about. Let me try to squeeze in this next comment here. Now let's go back to our good friend the Taurus, acting our good friend, a very nice GCW complex. So if X is elliptic, then there's something more, and the action is free, sorry. And the action is free. Is free, then in fact, what you can prove is that chi pi of x is at most negative l. So in general, this could be zero, but the larger dimension of tort is that acts freely, that pushes down this upper bound. The most it could possibly be is negative n. That's not too hard to see. I won't justify that. And let me say briefly, this comes from the fact that you have. Briefly. This comes from the fact that you have three spaces: the torus itself, which is acting on X, and the X mod T. And all three are elliptic spaces. And the chi-sub pi of the torus is quite obviously negative there. So that's where this comes from in conjunction with part one positive study. Okay, but there's a little more you can say here. I can also say that chi sub pi of the quotient, which remember is the same as the honest quotient under my assumptions. Um uh this is the let's see wait, so here we go. This is exactly the same as n plus the Euler, the pi Euler characteristic of x, which is a most negative n. So just we already knew this, but it's a most zero. But at least it's exactly equal to this. Okay. It kind of goes backwards. It's actually this fact that implies the first one. Okay, so. Okay, so I think I'm going to erase some feeling. I'm almost done with this. All right, okay. So what's the summarizing? Okay, so let me try to motivate this in a way that I myself do not actually believe. Let's say you're seeking for a counterexample for the total rank conjecture. Example for the toral ring conjecture. And you're seeking such a counterexample only amongst elliptic spaces, right? Because those bases are. Then you see if there's a free torus action, this pi Euler characteristic is at most negative n. But I want to think of that as saying if the negative Euler characteristic is at least n. That's not a deep mathematical assertion. But my point I'm getting is the larger the absolute value of pi sub pi is, Pi supplier is, the bigger the space is. You're adding more and more variables. So maybe the larger the value of this, the more likely it is wrong. The smaller the value of this, the more likely it is to be a catalyst. Because remember, the four-mine conjecture predicts that the homology of the space is very large. It's at least two P. Okay, so if you're seeking, like use car salesman, you're seeking a counterexample, I claim. Seeking a counterexample, I claim we'd want to seek, amongst elliptic spaces, we'd look for one that have the smallest absolute value of chi sub pi possible, which is exactly it. So now maybe you see this coming, because maybe we don't really do it about that. So in particular, if pi sub pi of x is exactly negative n, so this is the larger n, at the first like this, but the negative is exactly n, which is the smaller. Exactly, n, which is the smallest value possible. Then, cobbling together the things I wrote on the previous board, you will discover that chi sub pi of x sub t is fact to be exactly zero, which thanks to another part of Hopper's theorem, as I pointed out, says that chi of x t is. chi of xt is h of xt. There's no odd common, right? That's part two of how Britt's theorem applied to the space y equals x h. Okay, so what we've just done is proven accordingly, which is if the action of an n torus on x is free and x is elliptic, And again, this high weather characteristic of S is as small as possible an absolute value, because that's the way we're saying it. Then the toral rank conjecture holds. So the dimension is a few vector spaces of the cohomology events. Like the most likely candidate for a counterexample, if that's something. For a counterexample, that sounds curious that there's not a young example. Right, maybe. I mean, you have to accept that the more variables you throw in tends to make the homology bigger. Maybe that's just a complete garbage intuition. You have a finally presented algebra. Sorry, more variables you have, the bigger the homology. If you buy that, then this is reasonable. Okay, so I don't think any of I don't think anyone's quite written this down before, but maybe someone can correct me. So let's write down the torrel rank conjecture for linked spaces. I'm not sure this is really equivalent to what I wrote before. I haven't thought of through comparisons, so I just kind of invented this last night, to be honest. So if x is elliptic and And total rank. Sorry, I need to say it that way. You could say this in terms of total rank, but it shouldn't have come up more well. And this invariant, chi sub pi of x, you know it's some negative, some non-negative integer. Let's say it's negative n. It's some non-positive integer. Let's say it's negative n. So that admitting a free action by an n-troder is the largest n-torse that's true is known as the tolerable branch of this space. That's why I started to say tolerance. Okay, I don't think this is logically equivalent to the other conjectures. I think it's probably. I think it's probably possibly stronger. So I thought I'd just be a little bold and say, no, no, topology. I can feel free to bold, I suppose, and see if anyone knows the calories. So this is... Quick question. Are you claiming this polls or I didn't claim? Or is this. Sorry. The C stands for real. I'm not claiming it's true. This is a conjecture. And it's possibly, I mean, for someone to love. If someone politely comes up, politely, comes up after the talk and says, this is obviously false, just consider a three-sphere or something. Yeah, but I think this is not true, actually. So if you consider vibrations of spheres over spheres over spheres, these will rarely have the full orbit rank. So good. So I prompted a discussion there. So let me just flip this on its head. So if this is false, and it sounds like So if this is false, and it sounds like you're telling me it's just blatantly false, then what I would say is this is where you should look for counterexamples to help with this conjecture. Like the most likely place to find the counterexample. All right, that's all I had for this session. Can you repeat what was that example? I can't do it. Me? Yes, yes. Me? Yes, yes. Yeah, so I think if you take odd spheres and vibrations of odd spheres over odd spheres, then the multi-Euler characteristic will more or less be like the number of spheres which you took. But if you don't take a product, then you will not have the full symmetry rank. I think there is an example of this in the book by the Blue Book, like Algebraic Most and The blue book, like Alex Brad Host and Joe Triosso. Apology, yeah, yeah, yeah. So she's roughly saying you're not going to find an example from products about spheres, certainly, but you could find examples involving non-trivial vibrations. Yeah, so algebraically speaking, I would take like two generators degree and that one generator then has to the product of that. And that should be a counterexample algebraically, I think. So we just add the word naïve. To that conjecture. Seriously, what I was going to, I didn't mean what I said just now. Better way of saying this is find counterexamples to this rather non-conjecture and see if any of them violate Albany's torrent conjecture. At least it seems possible to me. My theorem says nothing about such fixes, in other words. About such spaces, in other words. Right? Because it's a little in this first spaces that are counterexamples of that, that's naive conjecture. My theorem gives you no information at all about the dimensions of literally, no information. I mean, in general, you can find many spaces which do not have very many x's because they're so tightly asymmetrical. And you're saying there would be sort of a There would be sort of a place to look for counterexamples. Yeah, I mean, okay, this is not very convincing motivation for why I say this, but let me get it anyway. So in the next hour, I'll talk about a counterexample to the generalized total rank conjecture, which is not a counterexample to Hobbes conjecture. I mean, it's just a counterexample to the algebraic analog. It's Srikanta-Engari, I found. And the way we found it is you looked at the simplest example. You looked at the simplest example for which my theorem said absolutely nothing. The Euler characteristic is zero. It's the simplest example of a complex whose Euler characteristic is zero that matches all the other hypotheses. And lo and behold, it was a counterexample for the theorem. So maybe I'm being way too brave here, but it's at least conceivable that you could find a counterexample for the Halperin's theorem by looking for the simplest possible example that the theorem doesn't tell you. Maybe. I don't know. Okay, I'm really done now. Any other questions? Okay, if not, I guess we can be in thirty minutes or so. Very sad. Don't linger on your coffees. The algebraic as a topological project would be much better if you state your theorem for the exterior algorithm. I will next hour. Just wait for me. Yeah. Just wait.
