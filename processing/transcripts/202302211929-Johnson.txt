Okay, should I get started? Sorry, it's a little hard to hear from there. Go ahead. Yes, please start. Well, thanks to the organizers for the invitation to speak at this conference. Sorry that I can't be there in person. All right. So, yeah. Oops. How do I move slides? Okay. How do I move slides? Okay, um, sort of the gist of this talk, or like the main idea I want to get across, is that NIP topological fields, by which I mean things like algebraically closed-valued fields or real closed fields, or just an NIP expansion of a field with a definable field topology. These things are closely connected to NIP integral domains. And in fact, they all kind of come from NIP integral domains on some level. integral domains on some level. And so therefore you can take facts about integral domains and turn them into facts about an IP topological fields. And this has some useful consequences. So first I want to just review some background on ring and field topologies. Like by a ring topology, so we're always going to be working on a field, but a ring topology on a field is a topology that respects the ring operations. So it might not respect division. Division. And we're only going to look at non-discrete, non-trivial topologies. And since this is a group topology, I guess by non-trivial, I mean not the indiscrete topology. And because this is a group topology, the fact that it's not indiscrete or trivial forces it to be T0 and then to be T1 and then to be Hausdorff. So these topologies are always going to be Hausdorff. And then the field topology is one of these that respects division. So it respects all the field operations. So, it respects all the field operations. Of course, there's lots of obvious examples like the order topology on any ordered field, or the valuation topology on a value field, or the standard analytic topology on the complex numbers. There's a notion of bounded sets. And if you have a field with a ring topology and the topology is not discrete, then there's a good notion of bounded sets. So, a set is said to be bounded if for any neighborhood. If for any neighborhood of zero, you can, so this at B is bounded. If for any neighborhood of zero, you can sort of rescale B so that it fits inside of that neighborhood by rescaling it by some non-zero constant. So it's not obvious, but it turns out this is a good notion of bounded sets. Like it agrees with the usual notion for things like the real numbers or complex numbers. And you can show that like finite sets are bounded. This is a filter. So subsets of bounded sets are. A filter so subsets of bounded sets are bounded, and finite unions of bounded sets are bounded. You can also take the sum set or the product set. Like, if you have two bounded sets and you look at the set of all sums coming from the first set and the second set, that is still going to be bounded. So, is the product set and the closure of the bounded set is bounded. So, this is a good notion of bounded in any topological field. And then, a ring topology is said to be locally bounded if some neighbor. Said to be locally bounded if some neighborhood of zero is bounded in that sense. So, all the topologies, the examples I gave before of like topologies coming from orderings or valuations or absolute values, these are all locally bounded. In fact, they all have a stronger property called being a V topology that many of you know about. An example of a field topology that's not locally bounded is if you take Q and you sort of look at the topology generated by the two atoms. Topology generated by the two-adic topology and the three-addic topology, and the five-addic topology, and so on, that is not locally bounded. Another way to describe it is if you look at the diagonal embedding of Q into the product of its completions, like at the non-Archimedean absolute values, and you take like the induced subspace of Q as the subspace of that product, that gives you the same topology. And the reason it's not locally bounded is that in order for a set to be bounded in this topology, it needs to be. In this topology, it needs to be sort of a, it needs to be bounded with respect to every one of these different valuations. And the open sets in this only say something like, I am bounded at fine, or a neighborhood can only say something like, I am bounded at two addically, three addically, and five addically, but it can only talk about finitely many places. And in order to be bounded, you need to be bounded with respect to all of the different places. So locally bounded. So, locally bounded ring topologies have some nice properties. Like, there's a if you have a locally bounded ring topology and you take any bounded neighborhood of zero, b, then you can show that if you look at the family of rescalings of this set, this set is going to be something like a unit ball, where the rescalings of this set, they're a neighborhood basis of zero. Uh, and also it's sort of in the opposite direction, it's like a filter basis for the ideal basis for the ideal of. The ideal of bounded sets. I think I said earlier bounded sets are a filter. I meant they're an ideal. So the point is that a set is bounded if it's contained in one of these rescalings. If you just think of the example of the closed unit disk and the complex numbers, this is all quite obvious, that the rescaling. So this closed unit disk is a neighborhood of basis of zero. Of course, they're not like open neighborhoods, but they're the other kind of neighborhood. And if you scale them outwards, then that set of then that set of that that set also determines the bounded sets like a set is bounded if it's contained in some disk around zero um so this turns out to be true these are all everything i'm saying so far is like uh things that are well known to experts but like unless you've studied this before you don't at least if you're me unless you study it before you don't know about these things so um um these are all facts that are well known to some people well i think there's a question oh sorry yes if there's Oh, sorry. Yes, if there's questions, I probably won't hear them because I don't think the microphone picks up people in the audience. So if there's a question, somebody should repeat it to me. On the previous slide, pair was ring or fields? There's a question about whether we're working with rings or fields. Yes. So everything here is working over fields, even though we're talking about ring topologies. Everything that's talking about ring topologies over fields. Okay. Over fields, okay. I don't know if that was the question though. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah. Do you have a microphone? I hear now. It sounds like a what? Drop the microphone in. Someone has to use it. Will, can you hear me like this if I'm talking? Is that better? I can hear that clearly. Otherwise, the way here is a lot of questions. Yes, you have to do that. Or like random syllables out of context. But if somebody holds the microphone, I can be heard. I mean, I can hear them. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Please continue. We are good here. Please continue. Sorry for the trouble. Yeah. Okay. I'll continue. So, um, one source of So, one source of locally bounded topologies is from subrings. So, if you have a subring, a proper subring of K whose fraction field is K, then it induces a locally bounded ring topology. And it can be described in two different ways. So, a ring topology, or more generally, like a group topology on a group, can be characterized in terms of the neighborhood basis of zero or neighborhood basis of the identity, because that determines which that determines the neighborhoods of zero by translation. The neighborhoods of zero by translation that determines the neighborhoods of every other point. So it's enough to describe a neighborhood basis of zero. And for this topology I'm talking about, there's a you can describe it in two ways. One of them is that the you look at the just rescalings of the ring R by constants that are not zero. That's a neighborhood basis. Another way to describe it is that the non-zero ideals in R are a neighborhood basis of zero. Anyway, it turns out this always gives you a rig topology. Maybe a motivating Maybe a motivating example of this is if you start with a valuation ring, then that gives you the normal evaluation topology. This topology, again, is not always a field topology. And in fact, there's an algebraic condition. It's easy to see that this is a field topology, like it respects division, if and only if this ring R has non-trivial Jacobson radical. That's the Jacobson radical, I think it's the right name, is the intersection of all the maximal ideals. But you can also describe it as. But you can also describe it as the biggest ideal of J, such that one plus J is all the elements of one plus J are units, and that's exactly what you kind of need in order for division to be continuous. So as an application of that, if R is a local ring, then the Jacobson radical is just the maximal ideal, which since R is not a field, it's going to be a non-trivial ideal. So in that case, you get a field topology. More generally, if you have a semi-local ring, which I think is the right name for a ring. Which I think is the right name for a ring with finitely many maximal ideals, then it's still going to be a field topology because those also have non-zero Jacobson radical. So if you take in an integral domain, if you take intersections of finitely many non-zero ideals, the result is still a non-zero ideal because you could take a non-zero element from each ideal and multiply them together. And now you have something in the intersection that's not zero. Okay, so this fact will be important later. So, this fact will be important later. All right, so yeah, this is a source of locally bounded ring topologies, and in certain cases, you get a field topology. I should point out, so everything I've said so far is in like a paper of Prestel and Siegler called, I think, something like Model Theoretic Methods in Topological Fields or something like that. And they show that, like, sort of up to some notion. Show that, like, a sort of up to some notion of elementary equivalence, which they call local equivalence, the locally bounded topological fields are exactly the ones that come from this construction from rings. There's also a notion of definable topologies, which is important for this talk. So if you have a definable set in some structure, then a definable topology on it just means a topology such that some definable family is a basis of open sets. Like the usual topologies. Like the usual topologies that you work with in o-minimal structures are definable topologies. And if you, in the setting of the previous slide, where you have a definable, if you have a subring R of a field K, as long as R is definable, then this induced topology is going to be definable as well. Okay, so now I can move on to the actual, this has all been background. So now I can move on to the sort of goals of the talk. Goals of the talk. So the goal is this. If you have an NIP expansion of a field, like a minimal expansion of R, or well, that's not an interesting example, but if you have an NIP expansion of a field and you have any definable ring topology on K, then that topology is locally bounded. And as long as you're working over a sufficiently saturated model, then it actually comes from some externally definable subregion. The sort of main The sort of main, it's possible that somebody already knows all this. I'll go through the argument for one, which is the core of this theorem, because it's not that hard of a proof. But anyway, like maybe the goal of the talk is really to discuss why this theorem is true and then discuss how it has some interesting applications when you combine it with facts about NIP integral domains. I should point out: so, externally definable sets and NIP theories are not always definable. Are not always definable. If they were, that would be the definition of stability. But you can add them to the structure, and the thing is still NIP because it's in this Shalah expansion. So we can often treat them as being almost as if they were definable. And in particular, this subring R is going to be an NIP ring. So it'll be an NIP integral domain. And this is why, if you can prove things about, this is why you can translate a statement about topological fields into a statement. About topological fields into a statement about rings. Because sort of up to elementary equivalence, the topology must come from sort of an externally definable subring. Which, since we're working with expansions of fields anyway, you may as well add that to the structure. And then you can basically assume that the topology comes from a definable subready. So there's a lazy way to get from From a topology to like an externally definable ring, which already has some applications. So let me just sketch that. So, if you take a small, if you work in a monster model and you take a small model K, and you have some definable ring topology, you can look at this group of infinitesimals over K. So you sort of take all the K definable neighborhoods of zero and evaluate them in the monster and take the intersection. And the elements of that are like the things that are infinitesimal with respect to k. Infinitesimal with respect to k. So this is always a type definable group. It's also externally definable. This is using the fact that the topology is definable. And so this is some like it's a limit of basic neighborhoods or whatever. And so it's externally definable. And if you just look at the ring of elements that such that when you multiply them by the infinitesimals, they are still infinitesimal. You can show that that's a it's an externally definable, it's still externally definable by this business with the Shallah expansion. By this business with the Shallah expansion, and it's a proper subring, and you can show that it's fraction field, it's the whole thing. So that gives you some topology that's not really definable in the original thing, but we, I mean, we started with the topology. The point is to get a ring from it. So this already tells us useful things in some cases. Like we know that if you have, and I, if you're in positive characteristic, this ring R has to be a Himsulean local ring. And then that tells you things about the underlying field. Like now the field is a quote. Field. Like now, the field is a quotient, the fraction field of a Hinselian local ring. That implies that it has this field-theoretic property called being large. And so, the corollary is that if you have any NIP field with extra structure, if it has positive characteristic, and if there's a definable ring topology, then the field itself has to be large, which is maybe interesting and could be useful for classification, for working on the problem of classifying NIP fields. But this construction here kind of But this construction here kind of lost track of what was going on with the original topology. So we want to do another version of this that has a tighter connection between the ring and the original topology. Okay, so I'll go through the proof of this later that if you have a definable ring topology, it has to be locally bounded. So if you assume that, then there's another way to get the ring, which is you just take, actually, it's equivalent to the one I just described. Actually, it's equivalent to the one I just described, but it's easier to see that this does something useful. You take the monster model, and instead of looking at the sort of group of infinitesimal elements, you look at the sort of ring of bounded elements. Like if you were working with the real numbers and some big elementary extension, this would be this convex ring of elements that are bounded, like between two standard natural numbers. Anyways, you just take the union of the bounded sets that are defined over the small field k. Over the small field k. That gives you this ring of bounded elements, and you can show that in the monster model. So, this ring is still externally definable because it's this directed union of sets of bounded complexity. And you can show that it induces the same topology. I mean, it induces the original topology you started with. Well, I mean, it's on the monster model. So, there's the original definable topology you start with. Definable topology you start with on K has some canonical extension with the same definition to M, and then R induces that topology. This is not hard to show. So the core thing that we need to show is that this fact here, that definable ring topologies are actually locally bounded. And I asked. Okay, what's the question? Yeah, so if you go back, this ring R, it contains all of K. No? It contains all of k, no? And you said every finite subset of k is bounded, right? So, yes, it contains k, it's a k algebra. But I thought, wasn't your condition that somehow the ring had to be proper, or maybe it's not, it contains k but not m? I mean, so it's a proper sub. No, R is a proper subring of M. R lives on this monster model M. I just think it's proper K. Okay, it's a proper subring of M because the type says I'm not in any bounded. The type that says I'm not in any bounded set is consistent. Like the K is not bounded as a subset of itself. It's bounded as a subset of the monster model, but it's not bounded as a subset of itself. And so the definable set, the complement of the empty set is not bounded or whatever. And so there are going to be elements that are not bounded over K. But yeah, there's sort of two topologies here because there's the original topology on the small field K, and then there's the topology on the monster model. Okay, so the Okay, so here's how you show that the thing is locally bounded. So it would be nice if like neighborhoods were groups. I mean, we have this, okay, we have a definable topology. So there's a notion of basic neighborhoods. It would be nice if basic neighborhoods. Neighborhoods. It would be nice if basic neighborhoods were groups or something like that. I mean, subgroups of K, but maybe they're not. So instead, let's just say that something is, so first of all, we're going to work on the highly saturated monster model. And then we're going to say that a special neighborhood of zero is like a is an intersection of some descending chain of length omega of basic neighborhoods such that it's also a Q linear subspace of M. This is, I guess, if we're in characteristics. This is, I guess, if we're in characteristic zero, but you could replace Q with any infinite subfield, I mean, any small infinite subfield. So it's not important what characteristic we're in. So one thing to notice about this is that these special neighborhoods are actually neighborhoods of zero. They seem counterintuitive because we're used to examples where a descending chain of neighborhoods, their intersection is not a neighborhood. But because we're in like a saturated model, we can always find some. Saturated model, we can always find some. This is a chain of neighborhoods of length omega, so we can find some smaller neighborhood, basic neighborhood inside them. And so these things are actually neighborhoods of zero. You can also see that they're clopen because they're open sub, like zero is in the interior and it's a subgroup. So by translating everything, the thing is open and then it's closed. Though that's not very important. There's also enough of these special neighborhoods. Given any neighborhood you, you can find. Given any neighborhood U, you can find the special neighborhood inside of it. You sort of take, you build a chain by letting U1 be the given neighborhood, and U2 is something that's so small that any combination of things in U2 is contained in U1, and any combination of things in U3 is contained in U1, and so on. And then the descending, the intersection of this descending chain will be a special neighborhood. And also, these things are externally definable because they're a limit of basic neighborhoods and basic neighborhoods. A limit of basic neighborhoods, and basic neighborhoods have bounded complexity, so it's externally definable and it's type-definable, of course. Um, so the goal, so okay, we're going to assume that we're, for the sake of contradiction, that the topology is not locally bounded. And using this, we will build sort of an independent sequence of special neighborhoods. By independent, I mean that the sense, like the set-theoretic sense, that if you make a Venn diagram out of the sets, all the Boolean combinations are non-empty. The Boolean combinations are non-empty. One way to think about NIP is that you can't have like an infinite sequence of sets that's independent where the sets have uniform complexity. So that doesn't directly give NIP because, first of all, these sets are definable. And even if you go to the Shalah expansion, it's not clear that they're uniformly definable. However, because each of them is approximated by basic neighborhoods, it's not hard to show that you also can get. It's not hard to show that you also can get an independent sequence of basic neighborhoods. So, the formula that defines the family of basic neighborhoods of zero is going to have NIP. I mean, so roughly the way you see that, if you want to build a sequence of independent basic neighborhoods of length n, you build a sequence of special neighborhoods, these weird externally definable things of length n, and you take witnesses. Like, if you picture this Venn diagram, you take a point in each of the cells in the Venn diagram. Point in each of the cells in the Venn diagram. And then because each special neighborhood is like a limit of basic neighborhoods, you could approximate it arbitrarily well by basic neighborhoods. And so replacing each special neighborhood in this Venn diagram with a basic neighborhood, you can make the basic neighborhoods be independent, if that makes sense. So then the one thing we need to do now is show that you can build an independent sequence of special neighborhoods. So this slide. So, this slide is running through the argument. You build the sequence by induction, I mean, recursively. So, here, what happens is the third step. You start out with two special neighborhoods, G1 and G2, that are independent. So, you can find these points A0, A1, A1, 2, and A2 in each of the four regions made by this Venn diagram. Then you look at the intersection of G1 and G2. And this is a neighborhood of zero. And because we're not locally bounded, we know that no neighborhood of zero is bounded. Zero is bounded. And because of that, there's some open set. Remember, the definition of bounded was something like: no matter how I rescale this, I can fit it, or given any open neighborhood, I can rescale this bounded set so that it fits into that open neighborhood. So the opposite then, if you're not bounded, there's some neighborhood G such that no matter how I rescale this intersection, it will not fit into G. And by shrinking G, I can make it be a special neighborhood. So now I just take some element C that's so small that. Take some element C that's so small that if I take these four witnesses, A0, A1, A12, and A2, and multiply them by C, they all sit inside this neighborhood G. And then I let the third set, G3, that we're trying to define, be C inverse of G. And you can see that it contains each of these four witnesses, A0, A1, A12, and A2. On the other hand, it doesn't contain this intersection of G1 and G2 by choice of G. So it doesn't, the goal here is to find the set G3. The goal here is to find the set G3 that's a special neighborhood that cuts across every cell, it like splits each cell into two pieces so that we go from having four cells in our Venn diagram to having eight cells, which is what we need to be independent. So we just needed to, we needed to hit each of the original cells, but not contain any of them. So the witnesses A0, A1, A2, and A12, these things show that it hits each of those original cells. But within we need to show that it doesn't contain each of those cells. So this argument just shows that it doesn't. So, this argument just shows that it doesn't contain the intersection of G1 and G2, but it turns out that because that implies that it doesn't contain any of the other cells. So, maybe the picture to have in mind is something where remember that all of these special neighborhoods are actually linear subspaces. So, if you picture G1 and G2 as being something like two planes that intersect, then G1 intersects, G2 is the line where they intersect. The other cells in this diagram are going to be something like a plane minus a line and a plane minus a line, and then all this, the remaining. Minus a line, and then all this, the remaining space. And those things sort of intuitively, their closure contains this intersection in the middle. So somehow the intersection of G1 and G2 is in the sort of closure, so to speak, of G1 and of all the other cells in the Venn diagram. And the set G3 is closed. So if G3 contained any of the cells in the Venn diagram, it would have to include the intersection. And we arranged that it doesn't. This talk of closures is all kind of fishy. Talk of closures is all kind of fishy and bogus, but I mean, you could formalize it, but really the point, the fact that we're actually using is that a vector space is not a union of finitely many linear subspaces, which works if you're working over, this is why I wanted an infinite field. Like this is why we're assuming everything is a q linear vector space, because q is an infinite field and it has this property that a vector space over q is not a finite union of proper subspaces. That's the real Subspaces. That's the real fact that you use to see that G3 doesn't contain G1 doesn't contain any of the cells in the diagram. This all feels like it might be some variant of Baldwin-Saxel, but I haven't thought about how to make that argument work. Anyway, so that's the proof. That's why this is like the last step of the local boundedness. So now we know that every topology, any definable ring topology on an NIP expansion of a field is locally bounded. Expansion of a field is locally bounded. And we know that up to after going to an elementary extension, you can assume it comes from some externally definable subarring, namely the ring of bounded elements. And so now, why is this useful? Okay, so there's a fact that Pierre Simone showed that if you have an NIP ring, then there's a bound on the size of anti-chains, I mean, all the anti-chains. If you look at the post-set of primite. If you look at the postet of prime ideals ordered by inclusion, you cannot. There's all the anti-chains are finite. And in fact, like this postet has finite width, which just means that there's some finite number n such that all the anti-chains have size at most n. The proof of this is actually very simple. I mean, I won't describe it, but if you think about like the easiest way to prove that the integers have the independence property is using divisibility in primes, and somehow the fact there are infinitely many primes. And somehow, the fact there are infinitely many prime numbers gives you the independence property. And some very similar proof, maybe using a little bit of commutative algebra, shows that if you have infinitely many incomparable primes, then you also get the independence property. So as a result of this, you see there's only finitely many maximal ideals, which is the semi-local thing. So any NIP integral domain has to be semi-local. And so the topology it induces has to be a field topology. Induces has to be a field topology. So we get this interesting corollary that if you have a definable ring topology on an NIP field, then it's actually a field topology. Like any definable topology that respects the ring operations will also respect the field operations for some reason. There's also, so this is an example of how a statement about NIP integral domains turns into a statement about definable topology. Statement about definable topologies on NID fields. There's also things related to Hencelianity. So this slide is just reviewing the definition that a local ring is Hencelian if it has this lifting property for finding solutions to polynomials. So whenever you have a polynomial equation, I mean, if you have a polynomial over R, and when you reduce modulo, the residue, I mean, go to the residue field, it has a simple root, then you can lift that simple root. Then you can lift that simple root to a root in the original field. And of course, the well-known examples of Hinsebian local rings are things like the piodic integers or the formal power series ring. So Dittman, Wahlsberg, and Ye defined a notion of generalized topological Henzelianity. There's a notion, there's a more restricted notion of topological Henzelianity that I'll say something about later. But anyways, this is some natural generalization. But, anyways, this is some natural generalization of it. This is not the definition they use, but I think you can show it's equivalent. But, anyways, a field topology is generalized topologically Hincelian if it satisfies the implicit function theorem for polynomial equations, basically. That's a relatively natural condition. And if you start with a Henzelian local ring, you can show that the induced topology is indeed GT Hinselian. So, what I want to say is that in certain cases, we can say that any definable field topology on an NIP field has this property. So, it turns out that if you have an integral domain, if the characteristic is positive or if it has finite dp rank, then you can show that it's a Hinsevian local radio. And so, the induced topology is going to be GT Hinsevian. And so, the conclusion there then is that if you have any. The conclusion there then is that if you have any NIP field with positive characteristic or finite TP ring, then any definable field topology on it has to be TT Hencelian. It has to satisfy the implicit function theorem for polynomial equations. So that's an interesting corollary. I mean, this makes sense if you think about all the examples. It's not surprising, like all the examples of all the obvious examples of topologies, definable topologies on NIP fields come from Come from are things like do have this property, like the order topology on real closed fields or valuation topologies on the piadics or algebraically closed valued fields. Right. This slide is reviewing the definition of a V topology. So, yeah, the field topology is a V topology if there's a bound, there's different ways to define it. Bound, there's different ways to define it. This is one way. If there's a bounded neighborhood, so it needs to be a locally bounded topology. It's a bounded neighborhood B of zero, such that basically for any element in the field, either that element is in B or its inverse is in B. So if you think about the standard topology on the complex numbers, if you take B to be the closed unit disk, then you see that it's a V topology by this definition. So there's other, maybe better ways to define V topologies, but Better ways to define V topologies, but this is the one we're going to use. So, the main examples are the topologies that come from valuations, the topologies that come from absolute values on fields, and then the order topology on an ordered field. And in fact, actually, it turns out that all V topologies come from the first two. Like if you have an ordered field, the topology, either it's an Archimedean ordered field and you have an absolute value, or it's non-Archimedean, and then the string of bounded elements gives you a Ring of bounded elements gives you a evaluation that gives you the same topology as the order topology. And the Prestel and C. Glerth, with their notion of elementary equivalence for topological fields, they show that V topologies up to elementary equivalence all come from valuations. Okay, so I brought this up because Delve and Halevi showed that any DP minimal integral domain. Any dp minimal integral domain is actually a valuation ring, or at least if the if r modulo, the maximal ideal is infinite, then it's a valuation ring. And so, using this, you can show that any definable field topology on a dp minimal field is a v topology, which we actually maybe, I think we already knew this from other proofs, but this is a much simpler proof than the proof where you classify dp minimal fields and do some other stuff. So, the way you get this is you take If you have a DP minimal field, you run the machinery from before, you get the ring of bounded elements, and it has the ideal of infinitesimals. And well, anyways, you can show that the ring of bounded elements is not, it's a local ring and it's not got a finite residue field. So, this theorem of Dalvey and Halevi applies. And so, it's going to be a valuation ring. And then you know that the topology is a, because the topology comes from. Because the topology comes from an evaluation ring, it has to be a V topology. So there's a, I don't, yeah, there's this in my work on fields of finite DP rank, there's this notion of field topology of the finite breadth that came up. And I'm mentioning it here because it turns out to be kind of relevant for this problem of looking at topological definable topologies. Of definable topologies on NIP fields. So, first, there's a notion of breadth for integral domains. In some of my earlier drafts of things, I called this by different names because I didn't know that there was a standard name for this in lattice theory. And then later I learned that breadth is what people in lattice theory call this concept. So earlier, I was calling it weight and cube rank and reduced rank and several other names. Anyways, an integral domain R has breadth less than or equal to n if. Less than or equal to n if, well, this satisfies this property that given any n plus one elements, one of the elements is in the ideal generated by the other elements. Or you could say that any finitely generated ideal, any minimal set of generators has size at most n or something like that. If you think about the case where n equals one, this is saying that for any two elements x0 and x1, either x0 is a multiple of x1 or x1 is a multiple of x0, and that's the definition of being evaluation ring. The definition of being a valuation ring. So these things are maybe some kind of generalization of valuation rings. And there's a corresponding analogous thing for ring topologies or field topologies. They turn out to be field topologies. So I say that a field topology has breadth less than or equal to n if there's a bounded neighborhood of zero, except with this similar property. Well, it's a weird technical looking condition that's not interesting by itself, but the reason. Interesting by itself, but the reason it's significant is that up to elementary equivalence, a field topology has breadth less than or equal to n if and only if it comes from an integral domain having breadth less than or equal to n. And in the case where the n is one, this is equivalent to being a v topology, because for rings, having breadth to one is the same as being a valuation ring. So these topologies do come up. I mean, there are definable topologies on NIP theory. Finable topologies on NIP fields that are not V topologies that have like higher finite press. The first of these is not an NIP example, but these are just examples of like what does this class of field topologies look like? So at the lowest level, breadth one, you have V topologies. What happens at breadth two? So here's two examples. First of all, if you have two independent valuations on a field and you look at the topology they generate, that's a topology that has breadth two. So you might think, That has breadth too. So you might think at first that all these topologies of finite breadth are just like generated by valuation, finitely many valuations, but it turns out that's not what's going on. There's sort of another example where if you take a field with an ordering and a valuation, I mean ordering and a derivation that are sufficiently generic, like take a model of CODF. If you look at this embedding of k into product into k squared, sending x to Into k squared, sending x to the pair x and the derivative of x, and you take the order topology on each of the factors and you pull back that, you get a field topology on k that has breadth to. And this example is a definable topology in an NIP field. So there are definable topologies that don't come from, that are not V topologies. And there's a variant of this example that has DP rank too. So CODF. DP rank 2. So CODF is not even strongly dependent. But if you do the same thing with algebraically closed fields, and if you go to a certain readup, you can get an example where this thing has DP rank 2. So we do have to worry about this class of topologies. So I showed somewhere that if you have an integral domain that has finite DP ring, then it's a local ring. And this is parallel to what Daubei and Halevi. To like what Delbay and Halevi showed, if the residue field is infinite, then the breadth of this ring is finite. It's bounded by the dp rank. Like when R is dp minimal, it has rank one, and then that's saying that the ring R has breadth one, which means it's evaluation rate. So this generalizes the thing that Delbei and Haulevi showed. So when you apply this machinery from earlier in the talk to translate statements about integral domains into topological fields, it tells you that any definable field that It tells you that any definable field topology on a field of finite DP rank, which I really mean like an expansion of a field. I mean, we know what the fields are, but there's, of course, lots of interesting expansions that are still finite dp rank. Anyways, any definable field topology on one of these things has to be one of these field topologies of finite breadth. And as I mentioned, there are examples where the structure has finite DP rank and you get a field topology that has breadth too. It's not a V topology. But not a V topology. So, lastly, I want to talk about some open problems or things that I'm curious about. So, there's these well-known conjugates. Okay, wait. There's a theorem here that's well-known that says if you have a valued field that's Hincelian and the residue characteristic is zero, then oh yeah, that's there's that big typo on that. Sorry, kind of ignore what I wrote here. I meant to say this usual. Here, I meant to say this usual transfer principle that, um, like if you have a value field, Hincelian value field or residue character thig zero, then like it's an IP if and only if the residue field is an IP. So this shouldn't say valuation ring. It should. Oh, no, wait. Yeah, sorry. This is the same statement, but it's rewritten in a different order from a different point of view. So if you know that the residue field is NIP, then and the characteristic zero, then as long as As long as this is also Henselian, then the structure is an IP. So that's this is correct. This is basically a theorem of Delonee if you combine it with the theorem of Kurevich and Schmidt about ordered abelian groups being in IP. So from this point of view, where you assume the residue field is NIP, this Hincelianity conjecture is sort of a converse, that if you conversely have an NIP value field, then it has to be Hencelium. Okay, so this is the conjecture. Okay, so this is the conjecture that people have made. It's related to some other conjectures, like there's a conjecture called the Shalat conjecture that says every, or maybe Shalat-type conjecture, I don't know, that every value, every NIP field comes from a Hinselian valuation, more or less. And these two conjectures together give you a conjectural classification of NIP fields. And actually, the Sheila conjecture implies this one. So there's this web of conjectures, but, anyways, this is part of it. But, anyways, this is part of it. So, I want to talk about this possible generalization. I don't know if this makes sense as a generalization because there could be some well-known counterexample, but I don't know the counterexample. So, anyway, I'm calling this generalized Hinseli-enity conjecture. It just says that if R is an NIP integral domain, then it's a Hinselian local ring. There's some, it turns out that's equivalent to some weaker and stronger statements. The weaker statement is that NIP integral domains are local rings. The stronger statement is that every NIP commutative ring is a An IP commutative ring is a finite product of Hencelian local rings. So, some evidence for this is that you can show that it's true if the ring R has positive characteristic or has finite DP rank. And you can also show that if you assume the Hinselianity conjecture, which is a respectable conjecture that might be true, then it implies certain cases of this generalized Hinzelianity conjecture, like if the ring R is an Ethereum or if it has finite breadth. If it has finite breadth in the sense I mentioned earlier. So it turns out if you assume that this generalized conjecture, that every NIP integral domain is a Henzelian local ring, then of course this gives you this, it would imply the following interesting fact that any definable field topology on an NIP field is GT Hensuelian, which would also, so that means the implicit So, that means the implicit function theorem is true for polynomial equations. And, like, as another consequence, it would also imply that the field k has to be large, which might be useful for trying to classify NIP fields. Like, we know how to classify stable fields that are large. And if there was some way to extend that argument to NIP fields, then we could learn useful things about NIP large fields, I guess. And then, you know. Um, and then if we knew this other conjecture, then we'd be able to say that as long as I have a definable field topology, then I get a large field or something like that. And because there's this connection, like you only need this original Hencelianity conjecture if the ring has finite breadth. So you could also say, just based on assuming the original Hencelianity conjecture, if I have a topology that has finite breadth, Topology that has finite breadth, then that also is going to be generalized topologically Hencelian, and that also implies the field, and then the field has to be large. Maybe one way you could turn around this principle is saying if you have a field that's so conjecturally, there should be no non-large fields that are NIP. But if these things were all true, then you would be able to sort of turn things around and say that if you have a non-large field that's NIP, then it doesn't admit any. Then it doesn't admit any definable field topology for that kind of thing. So, one thing that I'm curious about is whether there's any examples of a definable field topology on an NIP field that don't have finite breadth. Like, because all the examples I know of do have this property, but I can't think of why this would be true. And it's easy to come up with NIP integral domains that do not have finite breadth. Like, basically, if you look at the ring of power series over the complex numbers, where it's Over the complex numbers, where such that the constant term is an algebraic number. This is an IP and it has infinite breadth. But the topology it gives you is the same as the topology from the original Ring of Power series. So it's still a V topology. It still has breadth one as a topology. So I don't know how to make an example of an NIP field where the definable topology has infinite breadth. And if that's not actually possible, then it would mean that. Then it would mean that this theorem here would apply, and this weaker Hensilianity conjecture would imply that all the topological fields are Vt Hincelian. And again, so this question, is there like a definable field topology with infinite breadth on an NIP field? Using this machinery from above, I mean, from earlier in the talk, we can translate that into some algebraic statement about rings that's a bit technical. I mean, I wrote out the details here. Technical. I mean, I wrote out the details here. It's not some natural condition, but that's what this question is equivalent to: whether there's an NIP integral domain with this random algebraic property. And so I don't know if there is one. Okay, so the things I've talked about are kind of based on three papers, one of which isn't written yet. And then one of them was just posted on archive a week or two ago, and one of them is published. This published. So you can see these things, and hopefully, I'll put up the third paper soon. So that's the end of my talk. Thanks again. And are there any questions? So are there questions? More questions? Any other questions? These are the questions. I already have questions. You already asked the question. Will I ask the question in the talk? Was there a question? I don't know what happened. It sounds like it was fire. So it looks like we don't have. We don't have any questions for you, at least not right now. Questions for you, at least not right now. But thanks a lot for speaking with us, and we hope that we actually see you in the person. Let's thank Phil again. And we'll meet again by me.
