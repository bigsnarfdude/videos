Well, thank you. Thank you for coming and thank you for the invitation. It's my honor to keep one of the two experimental talks here. And so I will be talking about insulators and doping it and see what we get, you know, from point of view. And so I don't think I need too much of an introduction. The material that I will be talking about is this building block, it's a TMD. Block is a TMD monolayers that has a band structure, a bit like a gap graphene that has a gap opening at the K and the K prime point of the Berlin zone. And because there are some rather heavy metals involved, so that there is strong spinoffic coupling, also at these two points. So you can actually see that the spins are actually split, the finite momentum. And in fact, they are split opposite way from K and K prime because the K and K prime are time also copies of each other. Copies of each other. And the spin-orbit field actually, just those of you who are not very familiar with this material, is actually pointing to the outer plane direction. It's thousands of Tesla of spin-orbit field. So the spins is actually a very ideal Ising type of spin in this type of material. And Ellen already gave introduction, so I don't need to talk too much. You can, just similar to twisted material, you can actually create more heterostructures. Moray heterostructures, you can do it two ways. One is twisting for mobile layers, and the other is actually stacking two layers of different lattice constants. And then you also get, even without any twist angle, you can get a more a period in this type of materials. And you can actually see them directly experimentally. This is work collaboration with David Mueller's group and Monel that you directly can image the Moray pattern in this type of material. And the small dots you see here. And the small dots you see here is actually the real atoms in this STDM image. And on top of that, you can also see the interference, the lattice mismatch in this type of material that produces this extraperiodic structure of long wavelength in this particular material that I will focus on in this talk. Okay, so I don't need to talk too much. Basically, the extra periodicity. The extra periodicity basically gives like a smooth periodic potential for the electrons to move in. Then you actually would go from a big Briton zone to a mini Briton zone. You zone fold the bands and then you get this series of flat bands in the material. And the flat bands are good because you reduce the kinetic energy that amplifies the effects of the interaction between electrons. Okay, so if you have a good isolated band that you know that is far away from the other bands, Other bands, then the physics of this isolated band, the low energy physics, can actually be mapped into a single band Hopper model on the triangular lattice. And you can sort of think of it that the periodic potential gives rise to this Moray atoms in an array. That atomic size is much bigger than the original atoms. It's about 10 nanometers now, the atomic size, or the separation between the Moray atoms is about 100 nanometers. Separation between the Moray atoms is about 10 nanometers. The chuck-pin potential is about 100 to 200 milli electron volt. And in this particular case, the low-energy physics can be mapped to a Hubble model with two terms. Actually, an extended Hubble model with three terms. It's a tunneling between the sites, the T, and the on-side U quantum potential between two electrons at the same site, and also the inter-psi quote potential V between the electrons. And just to give you The electrons. And just to give you a sense of the energy scale in the typical materials that we are dealing with, T is about 1 to 10 milli electron volt. And U you can actually estimate based on the size of the 1 E orbital. It's about 2 to 3 nanometer. And the epsilon is basically the dielectric constant of the surrounding dielectric material, which is typically oral nitride. That's about five to six and they will give you about a hundred milli electron volt and you can use the periodicity. And you can use the periodicity or A period AM here to estimate the nearest neighbor Poulom repulsions about 50 milli electron volts. So you can actually see that the coulomb interaction is dominant over the kinetic energy of the electrons. So this is actually the simplest thing that we can do is to make this material, just to contact it and measure its resistance, right? And this is the first measurement in our lab and also in Feng Wang's lab. Our lab and also in Fang Wang's lab, that we measure the resistance as a function of the Moray filling factor. Let me just specify what I mean here: the filling factor. Filling factor 2 is two electrons per Moray in the cell in a triangular lattice that corresponds to a fully field band. So this is a fully filled band. You see a resistance peak that grows with increasing temperature. That is consistent with a fully field band insulator. But you also can see that there is an extra resistance peak. There is an extra resistance peak even stronger compared to this peak here that grows very quickly with decreasing temperature. That actually corresponds to a half-field band in the triangular lattice. And just in the band theory, you would not expect a strong insulating state like this. And you would expect just a metallic state. And that actually just shows that there's a strong interaction between the electrons. In particular, in this case, it's the strong on-cycle of interaction between the electrons that give rise to this mark-onsolating state at half-band. Mark insulating state at half-line filling. And to show that it is actually a mod insulating state, we would like to see the signature of local moments. Pretty much now you localize the electrons on the site by the Coulomb interaction, and they form locomagnetic moments, and you would like to probe the presence of local magnetic moments. And one of the nice thing about this kind of material is actually that there is this spin and valley optical selection rule that if you shoot left-handed light. If you shoot left-handed light into the material, it only couples optical excitations or interband transitions at the K valle. But because of spin-off interaction, the K value is also locked to a particular speed. And the same if you shoot light of right-handedness, it only coupled to excitation and the K prime value. So each handedness coupled to electrons of opposite spins. And now, if you actually can use a magnetic field or spontaneously break the time reversal symmetry. Break the time reversal symmetry and polarize all of the electron to a particular valley, one of the optical transitions will be fully blocked and the other optical transition is allowed. So by just probing the difference in the optical transition in this channel and that channel, you can directly semi-quantitatively measure the magnetization in the system. In particular, if it's a fully polarized one value, then you just get a saturated optical signal between the difference. Between the difference between the left and right-handed signal. And this has been working really well in many of these semiconductor morning materials. For instance, this is at filling one at the insulating state. On the left-hand side, I'm measuring basically the magnetization, but it's not really the magnetization, it's the difference in the left-hand right-handed absorption between this particular material, and you can see that. Particular material, and you can see that the optical signal here just grows linearly with magnetic field, and then it saturates for magnetic fields beyond like a half to one Tesla. That shows just that all of the carriers are now polarized to a particular value after that magnetic field. So it's a semi-quantitative measure of the magnetization in a sample. And if you try to extract the slope at zero magnetic field, you get a measure of the magnetic susceptibility. And if you plot the inverse susceptibility as a function, And if you plot the inverse susceptibility as a function of temperature, it follows the QUY's law very well. And that basically shows that in physics, that's one good measurement of the emergence, the emergence of locomagnetic moments in this smart insulator. And in particular, you can fit to this, you know, the red curve is to fit to the data and try to extract something called Kiwi-Wise temperature. And that reflects the interaction sprint between the local moments of the system. That actually is on the order of the J, the exchange. Is on the order of the J, the exchange integral between the local moments. And in this particular case, it's about negative 1 Kelvin. A negative sign shows that the interaction between the local moments is anti-ferromagnetic. And that's actually consistent with the super exchange energy scale T squared over U for a triangular lattice Mark insulator. So I hope I convinced you that there's a mark insulator at half-band filling. Not just we see it's an insulator, but also. We see it's an insulator, but also because there is the emergence of local moments that you can measure from temperature-dependent competitors. Alright, so I will talk about the physics of doping a Moray Mod insulator. Many things can happen if you dope a mod insulator. To name a few things, you can actually get with the mod insulator conventional refractional fillings. And you can get pair density waves. You can also get kinetic magnetism and spin polar ones that I will talk about. Polarons that I will talk about, and of course, one of the dreams that we have and we have not realized so far is actually that you may guess superconductivity by doping a mod insulator. Nobody has observed anything yet, so it's still an open question whether one can realize superconductivity by doping a more remote insulator. But today I will just mainly focus on talking about magnetism by introducing doping into the MO insulator. The system that we are interested in, this AB stack moly-telerway Thompson satellite MORE. There is a five, sorry, there's a seven percent lattice mismatch with this material. So you just stack them with zero twist angle, then you get a MORA structure with period, about five nanometer. And this is actually, I'm drawing the bands here according to the calculation of Yang Fusgroup. And the material actually supports a honeycomb, Moray Lattice. Moray lattice structure like this. And so you actually have the orbitals at the A sublattice sites and orbitals from B sublattice sites. And from the A sublattice sites, actually that's from the MOLI orbitals. So that's actually the orbitals from one layer. And so they can actually tunnel with an amplitude at T. That's actually the intralayer tunneling between the modeling orbitals. And there is also the atomic sites at the sub-letter size of B size. That's actually the B-size, that's actually the tungsten orbitals, and the intralayer tunneling would also produce the bandwidth of the tungsten layer. And there's something quite peculiar in this material is actually that the Molly layer, the bands are quite a lot flatter compared to the tungsten layer. Effectively, it's also that the Molly itself, first of all, has a larger band mass and secondly, it experiences stronger or a potential. I don't want to get into the details, but maybe just you accept this fact now, that the Molly has a flatter band. That the MOULI has a flatter band and the tungsten has a less flat band, a more dispersive band in the material. And also, that there is a sub-lattice potential difference that you can tune experimentally because the two sub-lattices are now sitting on different layers, and you can just apply a vertical electric field. And you can actually tune the sub-lattice potential, which is equal to the interlayer potential that you can tune experimentally. So that's a single-particle band without putting any electrons into the system, but if you put electrons in the system, for instance, Put electrons in the system, for instance, if you half-fill the Molly band, then the more appropriate picture is actually to split the Molly band into the upper hubber band and the lower hubber band in the system. And then you also have a dispersive tungsten band. And you get a mod insulator. In this case, the gap size is roughly U in the strong U over D in the large U over D limit. And you can also use an electric field to tune the interlayer potential difference to bring the tungsten band actually into the mod gap of the system. Into the mod gap of the system, then the gap size now is actually no longer related to the U, but instead it's actually continuously controllable by the electric field that tunes this charge transfer gap, and we call it the charge transfer insulator, because the next electron that you would like to do the system would actually not go to the molly orbital, but instead it would go to the tungsten layer. So we call it the charge transfer insulator in this high-electric field regime. So low, to summarize, low electric field is a model insulator. Summarize: Low electric field is a mark insulator, high electric field is a charge transfer insulator around feeling factor one. And this is the typical device structure. We have our material here, and then we have the top and the bottom gate. And the two degrees of freedom allow us to tune independently the filling factor, basically the electron from our reunion cell, and also the electric field perpendicular to the material. So these are the two independent parameters, and we can. Independent parameters, and we can put electrodes around the material to measure the whole resistance, the longitudinal resistance, and as well as we can shift light to the device to measure the signal proportional to the magnetization of the material. Okay, so I will talk about two things. One is about kinetic magnetism and the formation of spin polar ones in a whole dope remote insulator. So, I will start with the MAT insulator here and we'll push the Start with the mark insulator here and push the Fermi level basically dope away to introduce more holes into the Mark insulator and look at the magnetism there. And the second topic I will be talking about is that I will apply a large enough electric field to move the more dispersive tungsten band into the mud gap into this charge transfer insulating regime. Then I'm going to dope electron into the tungsten band here and see what happens with market insulation. See what happens with magnetism. And it turns out that this actually, the physics here, because you have a very flat hubber band and a dispersive band, the physics is actually like a condo lattice model. And I will talk about the emergence of ferromagnetism and also a doped churn state near the condo breakdown. Alright, so first I'll be talking about the kinetic magnetism in the simple one-band upper model limit. And I'll be talking about in this particular limit that you must We're talking about in this particular limit that u is much, much larger than t, and the service L T is also much larger, much larger than the Anderson super exchange. J is on the order of T squared over U, E. And lots of the theoretical studies have already examined this problem on the triangular lattice. So let's consider the case that you have a Mach insulator, which are the occupied states, which is represented by these blue dots here. So that's the Mach insulating state, the parental Mach insulating state. Now I put an electron dope. Put an electron doped on my insulator and I put this extra electron onto this particular site here, doping fitting bigger than one here. And because we have this energy hierarchy system that T is much, much larger than J, for the electron to gain more kinetic energy in this spin background, it's much more preferable to actually flip all the surrounding spins to the same direction so that the electron can tunnel around more easily. If the electron can tunnel, More easily, if the electron can tundle around more easily against the kinetic energy T at the energy cause of J by flipping a lot of spin, but in this particular limit, T is much, much bigger than J, so you can flip a lot of spins around. So you doping one particular electron in the system, the system would actually prefer going into a ferromagnetic state aligned, so to speak. And this is actually the famous Nakauka kinetic ferromagnets of doping and insulate. So, this is actually better known. One last thing actually is less known about the triangular lattice is on the whole doping side. On the triangular lattice, it's actually a non-bipartite lattice. You don't expect electronical symmetry around the insulating state. And in particular, in this case, if you dope a hole, now filling factor less than one here, this particular hole actually has a negative effective hopping. Effective hopping between the sides here. And you can consider this particular two paths. One involves two hopping bonds, and one actually involves an odd number of bonds here. And so if the hole can hop from this side to that side, it involves two paths. But one is even number, one is odd number. So actually, there's a destructive interference for the hole doing this hopping. And actually, that will suppress the overall kinetic energy of the hole. Kinetic energy of the hole if the background of the spin is ferromagnetic, because these two parts will be totally identical. So that's actually not good in this particular limit because that suppresses the kinetic energy of the hole. So the system, the surround, the background spin will rather turn into an anti-ferromagnetic background so that that can distinguish these two parts so that they can no longer fully destructively interfere, to release this destructive interference, so that the hole can gain more kinetic energy. Gain more kinetic energy. So, for the triangular lattice, instead of favoring ferromagnetism, doping hose actually favors anti-ferromagnetism because a host can gain more kinetic energy now by suppressing this interference process. So, that's all under zero magnetic field. And if you have a finite magnetic field, that the field exceeds the energy scale of J so that you can polarize all the background speed, but smaller than the hopping constant of the. Smaller than the hopping constant of the holes in this triangular lattice. Theoretical study actually have shown that you can form a bound state of spin polar on. Basically, is that the hole bound to a spin flip in this triangular lattice. And the reason actually that you want to form a spin flip binding with the hole is again related to the gaining of the kinetic energy of the hole. And if you have a spin flip in this ferromagnetic background here, then these two parts of time. Then these two parts of tunneling can they also you know is distinguishable and they don't actually destructively interfere and the holes can actually gain more kinetic energy by just prepared one speed. And so intermediate magnetic field you expect the formation of a spin polar and finally only when the magnetic field fully exceeds the energy scale of T and J here then you fully polarize all the spins. Basically in this case the magnetic, the Zeeeman energy wins over both the kinetic energy. Energy wins over both the kinetic energy and the super exchange energy scale. Then you just get a bare hole in the system in this fully spin hole or a spectrum. Okay, so this is what we would expect for a whole dope triangular lattice mod insulator. And here are the expectations if you can do an experiment. First thing is actually that you would expect to see a magnetization plateau if you plot the magnetization as a function of the magnetic field. Function of the magnetic field. First, the magnetization will increase with the magnetic field, and then it goes into a plateau here. And the energy scale between J and T here, you form the spin polaron with one hole gone to a spin flip. And until the magnetic field exceeds the energy scale of T, then you actually would flip all the spins in the background to fully get into this fully polarized state. So you have two session plateaus, that's what you would expect. And in particular, you actually expect very specific. You actually expect very specific values that this plateau should take. First, it's actually that for the fully spin polarized case, the bare hole will have spin one-half particle. And so you would actually have a magnetization plateau that is proportional to 1 minus xx doping density times spin 1 half. Instead, for the spin polaron, it's actually a spin 3 half particle. So you actually would have this particular case minus the spin flip due to the density. Minus the spin flip, the density is x, so you actually get a 1 minus 3x divided by 2, this particular plateau. So if you take the ratio, it should follow this particular doping dependence, that the magnetization plateau ratio will follow this particular form. And then finally, you would also, if you increase the doping density more and more, the spin polar ones start to overlap, you fully lose the spin polaron. And by the way, the spin polar is also an interesting metallic state because. Metallic state because it actually formed, it has a pseudo gap, it has a spin gap, although it's a metallic state. So, this is the experiment, what we have done. The first thing is actually you can measure the magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature, and you can actually see that it fits the Curie-Wise law very well in a high temperature limit, and you can extract the Curie-Wise temperature. On the right-hand side, I'm plotting the Curie-Wise temperature as a function of the filling factor. As a function of the filling factor, filling factor one is the mark insulating state. On this side is the whole doping of the mark insulating state. And the curivized temperature are all negative, showing that it's antiferromagnetic interaction. With more whole doping, you actually can see that the curiosity temperature becomes more and more negative, showing that the antiferromagnetic interaction actually gets intense with whole doping. And that's consistent with kinetic antiferromagnets that I told you about as zero-magnetic. And the next thing is about magnetization plateau. Now you can measure the magnetization as a function of the magnetic field at different filling factors. The mod insulating state is just like a parromagnet. And then once you dope away into the hole, into the electron side is still the same. Into the hole side here, you start to see the emergence of the intermediate optimization plateau. And if you increase more hole doping, the ratio of the two plateau also changes accordingly. Changes accordingly, and you can zoom in a particular case, then you can see the plateau only occurs at low enough temperature. With increasing temperature, it just turns into a paramagnetic response. Okay, so we have an intermediate magnetization plateau at about 2 to 4 Tesla over the doping density from A to 1, and it only occurs below about 5 Kelvin in the temperature scale. And we can further now determine the ratio of the magnetization plateau. I'm showing two examples. The magnetization plateau, I'm showing two examples here. One is about 0.1 doping, 0.09 doping, one is 0.11 doping. And you can actually take the value of this fully saturated plateau over the intermediate plateau, M2 and M1. And now you can plot it as a function of the doping density here. And you can see that this is the data, the dots are the data, the dashed line is the expectation that you can get from the spin polar model. And indeed, you actually can see it follows. And indeed, you actually can see it follows very well with expected dependence. And in this particular case, the factor 3 here in the numerator shows that it's a spin 3 half particle for the spin polaron compared to the bare hole, which is a spin 1 half particle. And this is a rough sketch of the phase diagram, that the spin polaron only occurs between two to four uh tester of magnetic field, and it for the doping density it only occurs in between about point A uh to one failing factor. To one filling factor over that kind of a doping range. And a very, you know, heavy whole doping we lose completely within color once in this material. Okay, so you may wonder if you just keep doping and more and more into the keep doping more and more holes into the system, and you can eventually get into some conventional fractional fillings of the holes. And what would happen to the magnetism there? And it turns out that actually, when you And it turns out that actually, when you have enough holes, and the coulomb interaction between the holes would drive it into a generalized litmic crystal, then the holes would arrange into a periodic lattice like this. And what we observe is actually that there's a strong suppression of the kinetic anti-proton interaction in the system. Once all the holes are frozen, that they cannot gain more kinetic energy. I think this is actually also showing that indeed a whole doping gives you kinetic anti-ferromagnetism, but once the holes frozen cannot gain more kinetic energy, then you Cannot gain more genetic energy, then you actually lose the genetic metaphor as well. Okay, so I hope I convinced you that there is a spin polar and a kinetic anti-ferromagnetism of a whole dope mod insulator. And the next thing actually I will talk about in this particular limit that you have a flat hubber band in the Molly layer and the dispersive band in the tungsten layer, and the additional electron that you throw into the system. Additional electron that you dump into the system will go into this dispersive band, so it's a charge transfer insulator. And I'll tell you the emergence of ferromagnetism here. And if I have some time, I'll also talk about the doped churn state, which is actually a metallic state, compressible state, but it has a churn insulated component in the system. Okay, so again, a little bit of background about this material. First, is that the moly-layer experience. Is that the Molly layer experiences a much stronger moral potential than the tungsten layer? So the tungsten band is way more dispersive, and the Moly band is split into just a lower and upper hubber band, which is very flat and holds the local moments. And if you dope electron into the system, the additional doped electron will go into the Thermistan band. So the Fermi level would now cut the Thermistran band at its value. And the delta is the charge transfer delta is tunable by the electric tube. By just looking at this, actually, what we have in the real space picture is that the MOLI is in a mod insulating state, so we actually have one electron, a MORA unit cell in the MOLI layer, and they form local moments. And then we have some additional itinerant carriers that is living in the tungsten layer. And the itinerant carriers can actually condo exchange, couple local moments, with a JK here taking the form of a super exchange. In the form of a superexchange. This T here is the interlayer tunneling coupling rate. So it's a T squared over delta, which is charge transfer gap, that determines the condocoupling between the itinerant carriers and the local moments between the two layers. And in addition to that, you also have the Heisenberg exchange between the local moments in the same layer and also the tunneling within the same layer for the itinerant layer. So this really just forms a, you expect to form a condo lattice in the system with one layer. In the system, with one layer of vocal moments, the other layer of it tender carries. And also the condo coupling, as you can see, is tunable by the gates. And our early experiment actually shows that you do see signatures of the condo lattice, and in particular, the heavy fermions emerge in this particular, in this electron-dope charge transfer insulator limit. And the signature is. Limit and the signature is actually there. If you measure the resistivity as a function of temperature in the low temperature limit, it follows the T-square dependence of a thermal liquid. And then it gets into a coherence temperature T star here. And basically, you destroy the condosing beyond this temperature and the local moments will emerge. And to further show that there is indeed a large Fermi surface that emerges at this doping density range, we can measure the hot. Doping density range, we can measure the Hall density. And as a function of magnetic field, this is actually the jump in the Hall density that Ellen was talking about earlier. That if you measure in the case that without any heavy fermions, in this particular case, the red curve showing that we have two holes per Mauryan cell. So the Molly layer is looked into a band insulator rather than a MOL insulator. In this case, you don't have heavy fermions and you have a negative coefficient for the Hall density and depth. Coefficient for the Hall density, and that corresponds to a small Fermi surface. But once you dope actually one electron per Moray unit cell into the MOLI, which is a MOL insulator, you actually, the Hall density totally changed sign to a positive sign here. And that's corresponding to a large Fermi surface for these heavy fermions here. Only until the magnetic field exceeds a certain magnitude that can actually unbind this condo singlet here, then there's a jump in the hot density. In a hot density, that hot density goes back to a small Fermi surface. We call it a light Fermilique in this case. So, this particular case is a heavy Fermilique. This is a light Fermi liquid. The unbinding is due to the Siemens energy from the Maharaj field. The condor temperature in this system can actually be continuously tuned by the gates, and in this particular case, the condor temperature can be tuned to nearly. The condo temperature can be tuned to nearly go down to zero by just tuning the itinerary carrier density in the system. Then you may ask, you know, there could be something interesting going on if you fully suppress the contour temperature all the way to zero by just tuning the density in the itinerant layer, and what would happen? And it turns out that once we actually go into this limit, when the quantum temperature fully suppressed to zero, the system turns into a ferromagnet. The system turns into a ferromagnet. And so you can actually see this is the Hall resistance as a function of magnetic view. You can see the anomalous Hall response, which varnish at about 2 to 3 Kelvin. That's the ferromagnetic transition temperature. And this is showing the Hall response as a function of filling factor at different temperature. The anomalous Hall response also burnished at about a filling factor in the itinerant carrier for density above 5%. So below 5%, itinerant carrier. Below 5% itinerant carrier density, the system tension to a ferromagnet. Okay, so we can also characterize the magnetic exchange energy scale by doing this exercise of measuring magnetic susceptibility at different temperature. And the magnetic interaction is actually ferromagnetic for total density below about 0.1. And finally, I want to mention just one last thing about the complication. About the complication that's happening in this system is actually that when you dope to about 5% filling factor, the system turns into an insulator. There's a metro insulator transition at a doping density above 5%. You can actually see that the condo temperature scale all the way go down to zero and now the resistivity turn into diverging with increasing temperature. So there's also an accompanying metal insulated transition in the system. So maybe just let me just sum up. So, maybe just let me just summarize all this complicated thing in a base diagram. I think that would be a little clearer. So, in our experiment, we always keep one electron per molar unit cell in the MALDI layer, so it's a MALI insulator. And in the constant layer, which is the itinerant layer, we tune the doping density continuously with our gate. And the magnetic interaction is actually positive. We have a positive theory-wise temperature over the doping density about zero point one. About 0.1, okay, and then it's negative elsewhere. And we have ordering, magnetic ordering, below about 0.05 density in the system. So it becomes a ferromagnet with anomalous Hall response. And above 0.05 density is a heavy fermion. It's a heavy Fermi liquid with a T-star temperature that drops continuously with increasing density. But at the same time, around this dashed line here, around this critical density of 0.05, Density of 0.05, where the system turns into a ferromagnet, there is also accompanying methane-solid transition happening. So, a high density is a heavy fermi-liquid, it's a metal, it's a compressible state, but below 0.05 density, it's actually a ferromagnetic Anderson insulator. That's what we believe. That due to the disorder, the system turns in the insulator, but at the same time, you destroy the condo-singlet, and at the same time, Singlet and at the same time, ferromagnetic Anderson insulated converge. Okay, and one final thing I want to highlight is also that there is some evidence of quantum criticality around this transition, around 5% doping here. And the evidence is actually coming from both an increase in the coefficient of A, which according to the Katawaki mood scaling is proportional to the band mass of the system. The band mass of the system. There's an increase of the band mass towards the critical density. But you also can see from the insulating side, we can extract the localization length. The localization length is actually diverging towards this critical density. So there is some indication that there is some maybe quantum criticality going on around this critical density that drives the system from a heavy fermi-liquid to a ferromagnetic Anderson insulator. How much time? Oh, we've got two or three minutes. Oh, okay. So, maybe one last thing I want to highlight with this rather complicated system is that what I have told you is that at high density, you can actually use a magnetic field to get the system from a heavy Fermi liquid with a large Fermi surface to a light Fermi liquid with a small Fermi surface. And then at very low density, there's a metal isolated transition that goes from a heavy Fermilique to a Fermi. Fermi liquid to a ferromagnetic Anderson insulator. And so the magnetic field in this high density limit goes from a heavy fermion liquid to a light Fermi liquid. But at some intermediate density, actually things can get a little bit complicated. We actually can see a state which is a totally compressible state, it's metallic, that has a very large horror response nearly quantized over E square and with a small Rxx here, but not quite zero. And so there's an intermediate state. An intermediate state, we think it is a doped child insulator. And we can do temperature dependence on this state. And you can see that at low temperature, there's very large Rxy, but Rxx is actually small but not zero. And you can compare this dope China insulating state, which has a compressible bulk, to a true Chinese. That the RxY will be quantized. We can just change the day a little bit to China insulator. And the Rxx is fully varnished. So in this particular RXX is fully varnished. So, in this particular case, it's actually a trend insulator with an incompressible bulk. And the interesting thing, well, we can further do some additional tests experimentally. I'm not going to get into the details. We can show that there's a quantum anomalous breakdown. And from non-local transport, we can support the bulk transport channel. And indeed, we actually have what we have is actually that we have a child insulator in the bulk, and then we dope additional carriers. It's a metallic state. So, what happens actually, what we spectrum. So, what happens actually, what we speculate happening here with increasing magnetic field and intermediate density is that we start with a heavy Fermilique with the local moment being absorbed by the free carriers. In a very high magnetic field limit, we break down the condo singlets and we just get a light Fermilique with a small Fermi surface adding a spin polar as Mark insulator. But as some intermediate magnetic field, we get into this interesting regime that with a small Fermi surface in a metal, but the system instead of going into a model. But the system, instead of going into a mod insulator immediately, it actually turns into a chin insulator. So it may suggest that maybe the condo interaction here is responsible for creating a trans band in the system. That we realize this is sort of all state with a transulator in the bulk and then doping some additional carriers into the system to make it a metal. We call it a doped trans state. Okay, so I think I just leave a summary and some outlook. One important thing is that actually. One important thing is that actually I have just a lot of people. You can read your summary slide. I think I better read actually that people will contribute to the work here. This is the work from John Deb with Jishan. And the spin polar loan work was done by 3 graduate students, Zeitang. And heavy fermion worked with on the lattice is done by a postdoc Manjing Zhang, mostly. And then we also have theory collaborators from MIT, Diane. Collaborators from MIT, Dian Fulscroup, Cornell, and also USD Santa Barbara, and HPN crystals from the famous Japanese group. And thank you for your attention. Going back to the summary slide. Yeah. Alright, this last part went a little bit too fast. Was X below 0.1 or above 0.1 where you saw the translator turn on?
