The first is a talk by Luka Matucci. After that we have a second discussion session about infinite distance limits. Then we're going to have a coffee break or gather time break, which is today only going to last 20 minutes. And the last 10 minutes of the break, there will be the mentoring program explained. So to make that more precise, local time, this should be 9.50 till 10. 9:50 till 10 and European CET time, this should be 17:50 until 18. So, maybe keep that in mind. But for now, our first speaker is Luca Matucci from Padua. I can't see that, forgot the title, but we quickly gonna see that. So, Luca, please share your slides. Okay, it's gonna be large field distances from EFT strings. Field distances from EFT strings. Luca, please. Okay, thanks a lot for the introduction. Can you see it? Yes. Okay, so very good. So first of all, let me thank organizers for the invitation and for giving me that possibility to present this talk. Can you see my pointer? Yes? No? Yes. Okay, thanks. So this talk is based on these two papers. Based on these two papers written collaboration with Stefano, Fernando, and Irene. And in particular, I will focus on the most recent one. So I would like to start with a very basic observation, namely the fact that the four-dimensional models that can be obtained by compactifying string theory or M-theory on some internal manifold are typically characterized by the presence of fundamental acts. Of fundamental actions. And by fundamental action, I mean an action which cannot be regarded as the phase of some complex field with, say, a canonically normalized, with a canonical kinetic term, or in other words, which does not admit, whose origin is not at finite distance in field space. Dover, these actions typically arise from the Typically arise from the expansion of some higher-dimensional potential in some basis of some appropriate homology group or the internal compactification space. So these axions are periodic and I will use normalization in which this periodicity is equal to one. Now the fact these axions are fundamental can be also understood. Oops. Oops. Oops, that's not does not work. Sorry, let me retry because it didn't change. No, sorry. Okay, let me try. Okay, now it changes. Good. Sorry. Sorry. So, the fact that these axions are fundamental can be also understood for the point of view of the corresponding axion strings, namely, strings around which the axions undergo an integral shift, which is set by the magnetic axonic charge of the string. And such strings are fundamental in the sense that they cannot be dissolved within some smooth solitonic object into some smooth solitonic. Into some smooth photonic object within the four-dimensional effective description. And as such, fundamental strings are typically associated with some higher-dimensional brain wrapped in some internal cycle. Now, come on, doesn't work. Doesn't change the slide. I don't know. The first time that something like this. Something like this happens to me. Maybe you can also export it to PDF with the different effects. Okay. Let me just try to make a final try and then maybe or just I can show without the full screen mode. Sometimes this work you hit the left and then right mouse button to go back and forwards. Sometimes you can Back and forwards, sometimes you can enable okay, but it might work, it might not work. Okay, so anyway, okay, let's hope that it works. So, I mean, given some axions, one can consider the corresponding possible axioneship symmetries. But as we heard, for instance, stressed by Miguel in his review talk, in quantum gravity theories we expect no global symmetries. Theories, we expect no global symmetries, and it is certainly true in spin models, in spin theory models. And then, such axionic shift symmetries can be at best preserved at some perturbative level in some appropriate perturbative regime. So, one is naturally led to consider some asymptotic regions or the field space of your effective field theory around some infinite distance points in which In which one can define a corresponding perturbative regime in terms of some perturbative parameters, some small couplings, with respect to which such an axonic shift symmetry is preserved at the perturbative level, while it is broken by non-perturbative corrections of this typical form, which are usually generated by instant corrections. Okay, so already from this very basic Already from these very basic observations, it's natural to wonder if the corresponding fundamental axionic string, so there is a fundamental string associated with the fundamental axion, which can populate this asymptotic region, which can enter the pagnetization, these asymptotic regions, can be used as probes of the structure of these asymptotic regions and can be. As and can be useful to characterize the corresponding turbulent physics. Okay, so in the description of the talk, I will try to argue that this is indeed the case. And in particular, I first show how such fundamental action strings, or better decides, subclass of such fundamental action strings, can be associated to paths to infinite distances in. To infinite distances in the field space. So, in order to do that, let me focus on minimally supersymmetric four-dimensional models, namely four-dimensional models presenting some minimal supersymmetry at the cutoff scale of the effective field theory, while the supersymmetry can be broken at low-energy scales. That means that the axioms will be completed, I mean, are completed by cada multiplets into cadda multiplets, which in particular can Which in particular contain also some saxionic patterns, some saxionic directions of these axions here. And then, if the four-dimensional effective field theory has such a corresponding axionic shift symmetry, then these Kerala multiplets can be dualized in a manifestly supersymmetric way into corresponding linear multiplets, which contain a bosonic sector in addition to the two-form potentials, which are electrical. Two-form potentials which are electromagnetic dual to the axioms, also, some dual parameterization for the sexionic directions divided by these dual sections, which are basically the Deja transform of these axioms defined by the Kern potential. Now, by using this dual formulation, which is by itself can only be defined in these asymptotic regions in which you have such an axionic shift symmetry. Shift symmetry, one can write down a manifest, supersymmetric supergravity action, which couples the string sector to the bulk sector, to the generic n equal to one, to the generic n equal to one bulk sector. And the string sector is coupled by using superspace techniques, in particular by using a Grisha formulation of such. Formulation of such fundamental strings, and in particular, contain a minimal coupling to the two form potentials set by this integer, which appear here in the shift of the axiom on the string, which, of course, have an interpretation in terms of electric charges of the string associated with these two form potentials and the supersymmetry. And the supersymmetry, namely the capacymetry of this green schwartz-like action, fixes completely, for instance, the cap into the gravitational sector through this tension. In particular, the tension has this form, which is fixed by supersymmetry in terms of the saxionic directions parameterized by these dual saxons. Okay, but now one has to face a problem. I mean, a problem, not a problem. A problem, I mean, a problem, not a problem, an important subject, namely the fact that in four dimensions strings are co-dimensional too. And then, as already mentioned by Miguel in his talk, I mean, they have a large back reaction, and for instance, they cannot be treated as probe objects. Okay, so generically, you cannot treat them as probes in some, say, Minkowski vacuum because they generically. Minkowski vacuum because they genetically will genetically destroy the asymptotic structure of this vacuum. And furthermore, as you approach the string, I mean, the fields typically degenerate, so one has to face the problem of giving a proper interpretation, for instance, of this term here, or the coupling of this brain, this string to the bug sector. However, these problems admit a natural solution if you If you interpret this coupling here according to the rules of effective field theories, indeed, an effective field theory, yes, there is a question. Yes, what is the typical magnitude of the tension of these strings? What is the typical study? The typical magnitude. I mean, you have m Planck square, but what is the magnitude of the plan? No, no, it's much, it's much lower than my much it's much lower than m plaque squared let's say it's in between the the the natural cutoff i will come to the to the i will discuss later the the the possible higher cutoff of the effective field theory and how it is related to the to the stream tension so maybe you can be ask your question uh after we discuss that relation okay so um so i was saying that uh okay um Saying that, okay, these quantities, I mean, this coupling must be interpreted according to the rules of effective field theories. And then any effective field theory has an associated cutoff scale. And then, as discussed already in the past and several papers, in particular in these papers here, the back reaction of The back reaction of, I mean, these papers considered more general brains in higher dimensional back theories. The back reaction of such brains, in our case of our string, can be interpreted in terms of an energy flow of the brain, or in our case, string couplings. So take, for instance, our string, then take a cutoff, UV cutoff scale characterizing this EFT theory, then the tension of the string appearing here. The tension for the string appearing here should be interpreted as defined a cutoff scale, and it is then set by the value of these scalar fields at the cutoff distance from the string. So, of course, if you change this cutoff, you change this distance, you correspondingly change the value of these fields because of the back reaction, and then correspondingly also the tension of the string will change. Such a change can be interpreted as an RG flow of the string tension. So the box is not working anymore. So maybe I can keep the okay, maybe it's not so nice, but I can look, I can keep this screen here. What do you think? Okay. You would have to make it a little bit bigger. Let's see if I may. Yes, I will zoom. Okay, so different inconvenience. Anyway, okay. So and now that we, I mean, we understand that it's clear that we. We understand that it's clear that we have to take into account the back reaction of such strings, which can be interpreted in terms of these algae flows. It's natural to divide the possible one half BPS strings into broad classes, in particular to focus on those one-half BPS strings, whose back reaction drive the surrounding scalars towards the Towards the weakly coupled region as you approach the string. As I try to stress, the string, in order to admit such a weakly coupled, I mean nice coupling to the bulk sector, requires that the back sector is in this weakly coupled region. So you need to require this around the cutoff scales, as you go very close to the string. And then you see that if the back reaction of the string, as you move close to the string, As you move close to the string, so as R goes to zero, the radius away from the string goes to zero, flows towards the weakly coupled region, then you have a string which later with such a weakly coupled description and such and then a controlled EFT description. And so, for this reason, we doubt this subclass of one of the PS strings, EFT strings. On the other hand, the many strings will The remaining strings will have a back reaction which generically enters some strongly coupled region that do not allow such a nice distribution. Now, this is a very qualitative distinction between EFT and non-EFT strings, but we can make it more quantitative by using supersymmetry, since we are assuming that supersymmetry is per se of the Katov scale and we have, and as I said, we are interested in directly. And as I said, we are interested in the back reaction as we approach the string, very close to the string. So, in this regime, we can approximate such strings as straight strings, by straight ones, and the back reaction, we can approximate the corresponding back reaction by using one-half BPS flow equations of the kind studied years ago, in particular in these two papers here. So, such To PEPA CS. So, such PEP reaction, some one-half BPS flow equations, admit a very simple description in the saxionic directions, namely the saxions as you approach the ideally the string. The saxions, this is the Euclidean space parametrized by the saxions, and the saxions move along straight lines. This direction is the one as you approach the string, and these straight lines are generated by. These straight lines are generated by the charge vector, the vector whose components give the charges of these strings. And now by using this explicit form of the Beck reaction of these one-up DPS strings, and we could check by going through a lot of examples in Sting and Theory models that all of these EFT strings, all the one EF strings. The one-aflated strings enjoy this property actually flow to infinite distance. And actually, we propose to this distant taxonomic string conjecture that basically all the infinite distance points, all the possible points which sit at infinite distance in the field space of the reflective field theory can be reached by such an EFT stream flow, so can be identified with endpoints of EFT stream flows. Stream flows of stream of flows in the field space generated by these EFT streams. Okay, so we see that there is a deep connection between characterization of these asymptotic regions in terms of these EFT strings. And I would like to comment on the relation with the with gravity conjecture. With the with gravity conjecture and the swamp distance conjecture. Okay, so first of all, I mean, as also as Miguel also mentioned, I mean, the gravity conjecture can be extrapolated to co-dimension to objects, but it's a bit tricky, precisely because of this Large Beck reaction. But on the other hand, we can nevertheless write down. We can nevertheless write down a gravity-like bound, which makes perfectly sense in terms of the quantities which appear, which are defined at the Katov scale in terms of the couplings appearing in the effective field theory. So this is the tension already discussed. And for instance, one can associate with the charges, the quantized charges characterizing the string, also a physical charge simply by taking Taking using the metric appearing, whether this is inversal, or the metric appearing in the kinetic term or the two form potential. And one can check, at least we check that in all the models that we could consider, string theory models that we could consider, that these two quantities satisfy this gravity-like bound. And this comes basically from the quite universal leading contribution. A leading contribution to the credit potential in these two breakdowns, which takes this quite universal form as minus log of some homogeneous function of the saxionic directions. But maybe even more interestingly, if you just assume this regravity bound and you combine it with the explicit formula, one half DPS flow equations, which just come from. We just come from supersymmetry. Then you find that as you move along a flow in field space generated by the Beckley action of the NFT string, then as I said, the corresponding string tension changes, but changes in this way. So basically, it decreases exponentially with the distance. And this coefficient here is And this coefficient here is precisely the coefficient appearing in the weak gravity bound. And then you see that at a certain point, the string will become too light to be treated as a semi-classical object. And then in principle, one should quantize it and should take in account all the possible fluctuations of this string, which should participate in the low energy dynamics. And this would provide a purely effectivization of the F terrorization of the swamp and distance conjecture, in which the infinite light modes come basically from an object which is already present in the fatty field theory. On the other hand, I mean, there could be additional infinite towers of light modes which could appear along this flow to infinity, this flow to infinite distance and which Which and actually, Verada have a modes which come for the UV completion for this effective field theory. And let me denote the corresponding lightest mass with this M star. So we have these two different mass scales, a priority unrelated mass scales. One is the string tension, which is fully controlled at the fourth-dimensional effective filter level. It's fully fixed by the structure of the fourth-dimensional effective filter. And this method. Field theory and this microscopic tower mass m-star, which is that instead, in principle, I mean, we don't have any idea from a purely four-dimensional effectivity starting point, we have no idea on how to fix it, okay, without knowing the UV completion of the theory. And so one may wonder if there is any relation between these two masses, mass scales. Mass scales. And quite surprisingly, we found that by going through a lot of, I mean, semi-large classes of streaming theory models, that there is such a relation. There is a quite intriguing pattern, which basically states that the along such an EFT string flow, such a flow generated by NEFT string, associated with NEFT string. Associated with an EFT string. This microscopic mass, tower mass squared, scales in Planck units like an integral power of the tension of the EFT string associated with such a flow. And this integer here, this scaling weight, actually, you know, the example we could consider only to three possible values, one, two, and three. Okay? So, Okay, so we promoted this observation to a possible second swamp plant conjecture, okay, regarding this EFT stream. And if correct, this provides some non-trivial UV information encoded in this microscopic Tawamma scale from purely FT data. Of course, it would be nice to have a way to fix. A way to fix the scaling weight starting from, I mean, purely FT data, but we couldn't find such a group. Okay, let me also mention, I mean, comment on the fact that if the scaling weight is larger than one, so in our case, it's either two or three, then this microscopic scale This microscopic scale is lighter than the string tension, and the corresponding infinite number of states, the microscopic ones, will dominate the realization of the swamp plan distance conjecture. On the other hand, if the scaling weight is equal to one, then EFTs three modes in general compete with this microscopic target. It is precisely the situation considered also in this paper. Situation considered also in this paper. And according to their emergence pin conjecture, then, if I understand it correctly, this would imply that all these EFT strings with scaling weight equal to one should be should correspond to some, for the 10-dimensional point of view, should correspond to some fundamental string in some dual frame. So Before concluding, I would like to illustrate this general remarks by using a concrete, I mean, simple but non-trivial example, which is driven by a theoretic compactification on a Calabiao three folder. This Calabiao three fold, which is basically, I mean, this was studied years ago, and it is basically an elliptic fibration of a P2 fiber, okay. Vibration of the P2 fiber. Okay, so let me first focus on the perturbative asymptotic region corresponding to the large volume de gem. Then the Dilemma saxions in this degime are the Keller moduli or this compactification, these two saxions here, and they move inside this axionic cone, which is nothing but the Kaleb cone of this compactification. Of this compactification, which has this simple simplicity form. This is this first problem. Now, in this region, the possible one-half PPS axionic strings can be obtained corresponding to these saxions, correspond to NS5 brains wrapping effective devices. So, the full con effective devices is generated by these two effective devices here. Two effective devices here, and the corresponding charges are denoted by the dots in this figure here. Okay, however, not all these BPS strings, not all these charges actually correspond to EFT strings as I defined in the previous slides, but only those which you obtain by restricting to basically the saxionic region, the saxionic. The saxionic region, the saxionic console. So, by restricted to this first quadrant. You can see this by considering the corresponding flows. If you remember, I told you that the back reaction of the string, the string flow associated to an EFT string, to a string, to a one-fBTS string, is given by a straight line, described by a straight line in the saxionic directions as you approach the string. So, and this straight line And this straight line is generated by the corresponding charge vector. So, take for instance this charge vector here, which corresponds to an aspiring brain wrapping this device. So, here, then it generates a flow like this, or any other vertical flow, starting from any point of the saxionic corner. Okay, so you see that it remains within the saxionic corner. Similarly, this other EFT string charge here generates horizontal. Generate horizontal flows and which are still inside the saccionic cone, while more general charges will generate flows like this one, which will again remain inside the saxionic cone. On the other hand, you can consider a BPS but non-EFT string like this one, which corresponds to an S5 brain dropping this device over here. And you see that it will flow to And you see that it will flow towards the finite distance boundary of the Kerala cone. So basically, it will approach some strongly coupled region, which you have to take into account worksheet instantaneous. And basically, your petulability regime will break down. Okay. So you can also check our claim about the scanning weight relating the microscopic tower mass and the tension. And the tension of the corresponding FT string, and we can check that this flow extending weight equals two, while these other two flows extending weight equal to three, confirming our statement. And we can also provide a very simple example of an EFP string with a scanning weight equal to one. This is just for the 10-dimensional. This is just from a 10-dimensional point of view, a fundamental string. In order to describe the corresponding flow, we have to add one more saction, one more saxionic direction, which is driven, and this more saxon is driven to infinity by the Beck reaction, while these two sections are kept fixed. And this means that the corresponding flow basically coincides from the 10-dimensional point of view to a small string coupling limit. And so this provides, since the screen weight is equal to one, the most simple analyzation of the emergent stream considered in this paper here. So let me conclude. So to summarize, I try to argue that to explain how the asymptotic regions of this kind of class of Kind of class of four-dimensional effective field theories compatible with Campton gravity can be really characterized in terms of this spectrum of these EFT strings. In particular, such EFT strings provide an accurate classification of the possible limits to infinite distance and basically allow to reach any point at the infinite distance. This is our proposal. And for the model, along such And furthermore, along such flows to infinite distances, the tension of the corresponding strings will decrease exponentially and with the distance, providing a purely activization of the Swampland distance conjecture. And okay, let me just conclude this slide and then I come back to the other question. And then even if Even if generically there are other towers, if it towers of modes which contribute to the swamp and distance conjecture, we observed that their mass, M star, is related in a very quite precise way to the tension of the EFT string corresponding to the flow in terms of this scaling weight, which takes just this. Which takes just these three values. Okay, I have two slides, but okay, maybe first Robert would like to ask this question. No, I'll wait until you're finished. Ah, okay. Sorry. So on the other hand, I didn't have time to discuss other interesting implications of our work. Of our work. In particular, it suggests quite universal, that a universal way to understand these asymptotic regions or the field space, of these theories, is through the interplay of different conical structures of the same kind, or those appearing in the context of the so-called positive geometry. And I think that this could be a good starting point to try to understand related. Stand related general question of both which could be both physical and mathematical and geometrical. In particular, it seems that all the EFT strings that we could construct in the string and theory model correspond microscopically to some brain configurations which can freely move in the internal space. It could span the entire internal space. So, in a certain sense, can capture Can capture a lot of information about the full compactification space, and they are truly gravitational. And this is a property which is somewhat analogous to strictly related supergravity strings considering higher dimensions in these papers. For the model, we observed that in the model that we could consider a completeness of the FT stream spectrum, then it's natural to wonder if. And it's natural to wonder if such completeness can be postulated more generically, such I mean, regarding this EFT string spectrum. So, basically, if the full discrete corner EFT string charges is always populated by actual physical objects. Sorry, Luca, let me just remind you: you have five minutes left of your time. Okay, I have basically finished. So, and So, and this is also related to the possible presence of stability conditions of microscopic nature, which are invisible to the four-dimensional observer, but and which seem to be harmless in the case of EFT screens. And let me just conclude with mentioning some possible connections with some recent works, in particular. Decent works, in particular, a connection with the Copodesian condition conjecture pointed out by these authors, a possible intrinsic connection with the modern spatialography pointed out in these papers. And certainly, I mean, another interesting direction would be to investigate further the implication on the constraint on. The constraint on the bulk sector coming from the consistency of the Wordsheet sector, the additional Wordsheet, not the universal one, but the additional Wordsheet sector supported by such EFT strings along the lines of what was done in these papers. Finally, this EFT string could have also some interesting phenomenology. There was a recent paper discussing very closely related strings. They called them accident strings, but they they Accident strings, but they appear to be, I mean, basically part of our VFT strings. And they just made a few comments about the possible phenomenology, and they announced some paper to appear discussing these aspects. So thanks a lot for your attention. Thank you very much, Luca. Let's thank our speaker. We still have some time for a few questions. Robert was Few questions. Robert was the first one to raise his hand, so please unmute yourself and ask your question. So, thanks for the very interesting talk. So, I'm a cosmologist, and I'm specifically interested in signatures of strings, because if your effective field theory has string solutions, then these strings will actually exist even today. So, I had two small questions. First of all, are these global strings or local strings? It looks like they're global strings. They're global, yes, sure. Global strings, they are global strings. Sure, sure, sure. And then the other question is, but they are fundamental, so they're not like global strings that you can construct by using like a field theory model, okay? That's that was a discussion. Okay, I understand it. Now, can you go back to this slide where you had the relate the flow of the tension as a function of this one? Okay, the one previous. Okay. Yeah, this one. So this. So this tau E0, is that an electronic square? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Actually, you know, to have a control description, you need the tension to be much low, much lower than the Planck mass squared, okay, but still higher than the cathode. Still higher with the cutoff scale. So the tension is, in any case, smaller of this plaque mass squared. Here, this zero here is the starting point. It could be of the same order at the generic point of the modular space. But in order to trick, to have some control on such strings, as I stressed, you need to start from the beginning in some asymptotic region, okay? Some asymptotic region. Okay, you need to be already in some teptubatic gene in which this tension is already quite smaller than the plague mass squared. See, if you could provide a lower bound on the tension, then you could actually constrain models via cosmology. The lower bound, well. Sorry, let me briefly chip in. Since we're running a bit out of time, maybe if more detailed questions, maybe we can discuss them later in the discussion session or in the coffee break. Let me maybe ask, there's one more question maybe from Thomas. Let's try to stick to time. Sorry. Okay, let me try. So, Luca, by looking at strings, since they're sourced by Since they're sourced by scalars, the axion and the saxion, I understand there's a link between sort of weak gravity and the distance conjecture. Would you expect the same not to happen for the magnetic dual objects, namely instantons? Because for the instantons, I think there's also a relation sort of between the range election and the distance traveled by the axion and the saxion. Could you come to similar conclusions? It would be nice. I mean, there is indeed a a mirror picture for, I mean, a com a corresponding picture for the instances, but we have not worked out the details yet. So also there you can, there is a similar distinction between, say, EFT instantals and BPS non-EFT instantons, which is actually similar to the distinction made here between Made here between extremal BPS particles and modern BPS particles. So also there it seems that there is an interplay between these different families described by corresponding phones. So it will be interesting to investigate that direction as well. Thank you. All right. All right. In view of time, I would say we end the discussion session here. So let's thank Luca again. And let me just point out, as Irena already pointed out in the chat, there's a Slack channel where you can continue the discussion or then later during the coffee break in Galvo Town. The next session or the next part is going to be a discussion session, which is led by Discussion session, which is led by Irene, Thomas, and Rafaela. So I would now hand over to the three of you for the discussion session. Thanks. Okay, thank you very much, Eric. Let me
