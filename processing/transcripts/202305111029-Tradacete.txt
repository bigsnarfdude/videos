About observations and balance practices. Okay, thank you very much. So, of course, I want to start thanking the audience. And then I'm serious. I want to thank Marcel and Maria and Newsen. And I'm really happy to have the chance to be here. I think the conference is very well. And it's actually very pleasant to have. It's actually very pleasant to organize this kind of conference, basically for two reasons. So apart from writing some proposal and getting it accepted eventually, after that, all the excellent facilities of this center are really helping you a lot, and you just don't have to worry about the nasty things of organizing a conference, but looking for funding and those things. And the second, and also very important. And the second and also very important thing is that we have Ladimin in the organization, which makes things also very, very simple. But you can versus taken care of. Okay, so yes, I'm going to speak about valuations on banana lattices. And well, before I start to cover the topic, I also wanted to share some thoughts about the way I see now the theory of panorama. Theory of minor vertices in general. So I remember that when I was starting my PhD, I could have, I had the feeling or some people approached me saying that this theory of Banach spaces and Banach lattices is very interesting, but it kind of has been for some time looking only into, right? Like there's plenty of very Plenty of very complicated problems that basically only the people in the area care about, and that there was kind of a lack of looking into other directions and being a bit more open. And my impression now is that this has changed a lot. And this week I think we have seen some talks which kind of showed the interplay with other topics. Other topics, thinking in particular of stable phase retrieval, for instance, but also the conversion structure. So we have like a, I think it's good for the area now that we have interaction with different communities and that you get different problems to look at, problems from your own area, but also new problems. And maybe Bena Paranasis can be helpful to address some other kinds of questions. And well, what I want to do today is insist on this idea of opening maybe connections to other lines. So, in particular, I want to focus on an interaction with a convex geometry. And for that, I will speak about evaluation theory. And so, let us start by recalling what do I mean by evaluation. So, let's take S to be a class. To be a class of sets. Okay, and I will say that evaluation on S is going to be a map which, well in this case, for today I will focus only on the real evaluations, but you could consider other possibilities, of course. So I would say that a map like this is evaluation on S if On S, if it satisfies that the following identity. So the valuation of the union plus the valuation of the intersection is just the sum of the valuations. Whenever the sets I'm looking at make sense, right? Whenever all these A, B, A union B, and A intersection with B are in this class. Okay? Okay so for for uh this is what I will uh call uh evaluation uh today and particularly uh well also some important examples where this can have been used uh are for instance the class when S is the convex values on Rn. So you can look like this, all right. Meaning, just compact, convex sets containing n-dimensional space. You could also consider the convex polytopes, for instance, also in our n. Or one could consider what we call the star sets, star bodies, or general star sets, also in R. Or general star sets also in our n. By star body, I mean, or by star set, I mean set which contains the origin, and every time I have a point in the set, the segment joining that point with the origin has to be contained in the set. So these are like particular classes of sets one might want to look at what are the valuations defined in those. And in particular, well, in the setting of both the convex bodies and the convex polytopes. Convex bodies and the convex polytopes. Evaluations on those have been a very useful tool in the theory, in the theory of convex sets. And in particular, evaluations, I would say, maybe start like at the beginning of the 20th century when there is one of this, when one of the first or was the first problem. Or was the first problem in Hilbert's list to be solved, not the first in the list, so it's I think number problem number three in the list, which is about whether you can provide the elementary definition of the volume of a polytope. This problem asks precisely whether if you have two polytopes, two convex polytopes with the same volume, whether is it possible or not to cut one of them into pieces? Into pieces and reassemble them to recover the other one. And so this is true for polygons, convex polygons, I mean in two dimensions, but then so that it's not true for dimensions higher than two, strictly higher than two. So this was the first of the problems in Henger's list to be solved. It was just solved. I mean, I think the list is from the year 1919. Year 1900, right? And then this was solved like two years after, something like that. Okay, so that's where evaluation started to be important because these were a tool that then used in his solution. Okay, so what are the typical examples we have of valuations? Well, the volume, for instance, the volume which we usually call maybe Lebesgue measure in RN. Maybe Lebesgue measure in Rn. Would you restrict it to the class of convex values? This is going to be evaluation, right? It's going to satisfy this property as any other measure. And in fact, this example, the volume, the volume in our n is evaluation, which also has some nice properties. So in particular, it is continuous. It is continuous in the sense that, well, in this setting, I'm going to look at the convergence of the metric, the Hausdorff metric. If you look at different sets, you might say that you can approximate one set by other convex sets in the house of metric when essentially when these things are close in the metric sense, right? So I said that two sets. Can, so I said that two sets, the distance between two convex sets is defined to be how do I have to enlarge one of the sets to cover the other. And I make this symmetric, so distance. And the volume is indeed continuous with respect to that notion of convergence, so that's that matter. Continuous with respect to the Causal. House of house of distance. But when I say continuous, I will most of the time I will refer to this curve. It is also another property that the value has is that it is rigid motion invariant, right? So if I have a convex set, convex body, and I move it around the space or I rotate it, the volume is not going to change. So that's what we call rigid motion invariant. Rigid motion invariant. And there is one extra property of the volume that I want to look at is that it is a simple valuation in the sense that it's going to be zero on smaller dimensional sets. So if I have some convex set which doesn't have dimension n, the dimension of my space, say that it lies in some hyperplane, then of course. That it lies in some hyperplane, then of course the volume will be zero. Okay, and we call that zero. We call that a simple valuation. A valuation which maps sets of smaller, strictly smaller dimensions to zero. And one of the beauty of the theory is a theorem due to Hadneger in the 50s, classical theorem 57. 57, which says that these properties actually characterize the volume. So if you have a valuation like this, so is the unique volume, is the unique valuation satisfying these three properties? Let's go one, two, three. Okay, which might remind you of something like uniqueness of some measures, like half measure, or things like that, right? Don't you believe it's positive as well somehow? Well, up to some constant, right? Up to some multiple, of course, yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Up to two constants. Okay. Um Okay, and this theorem, actually, the proof, it's a very geometrical proof, with a lot of geometrical arguments, I mean, but the flavor, it's kind of functional analytic. So one of the reasons I got interested in these kind of questions is whether would it be possible that we can provide an alternative proof of this fact just using Just using analytic tools and kind of keeping the geometry under the carpet, which I'm not confident sometimes with geometrical arguments. I have very bad geometrical intuition, so I prefer to have my epsilon data wrong. So yeah, that's kind of the philosophical reason why we got interested into this. And so far we haven't found an analytical proof of this, but well, we have just. This, but well, we understood some of the things I want to provide today. So one can go one step further, and if one forgets about this property of being simple, which is, as you can hope, kind of restricted, one can also characterize what are the valuations on the convex bodies which are rigid motion involving continuous and rigid motion involved. And that's also part of. Invariants. And that's also part of Hadbeke's proof. Well, what one can do is kind of generalize, consider the different versions of the volume corresponding to each dimension, right? And this is called Kermit's integrals, which are a particular family of valuations which are defined as follows. So you could take the volume of some. The volume of some, you fix your favorite convex value, and then you look at the following function, a function of t. So t is some real number, and I'm taking positive, and I'm taking this Minkowski sum of these two sets. This is just the Euclidean ball. And one can very easily check, relatively easily check, that this is always a polynomial in T of degree. In t of degree n. So if you write this down as some polynomial and you write the coefficients in a nice way, well, there's some normalization here. These are just the coefficients of this polynomial in T. It happens that this is called Steiner's formula. These objects here are the Kerma sitemas, okay? Are the German settlements. Okay? So I have that for every j is a valuation, continuous rigid motion invariant valuation, which is also homogeneous of degree n minus j. n minus j, okay? Say n minus j homogeneous. Right, so omega zeta would be the volume, and omega 1 would be kind of the surface, no, omega, n minus 1 would be kind of the surface area, if you want. But there's a geometrical interpretation of those. And what Heidegger's theorem tells you is that if you remove this property of being simple, Property of being simple, every evaluation can be written as a linear combination of those. So every, if B is a continuous rigid motion in variant valuation, then there exists some lambda j such that the valuation is actually this. Evaluation is actually these linear combinations of the Thermus integrals. Which, of course, all of these are passed out evaluations, and I do these linear combinations. What I get is a given evaluation and all of that form. But what Habiger tells us is that that's it, right? There's nothing else. Here, of course, this hypothesis is extremely important. Rigid motion invariant. Okay? Otherwise, theta. So, this is one of the classical and beautiful results of evaluation theory in the setting of convex bodies. And well, in convex bodies, you have the sets, you have the convex bodies, you have this Minkowski addition that I mentioned somewhere here, and you have this house of distance, and this. And this so this this this family of convex sets, convex values with this operation and this distance is what uh makes the root of what's called the Brun-Minkowski theory. And there is something called dual Brun-Minkowski theory in which you replace these convex values by star bodies. Okay, so let us, and that's what I'm going to look at, because you will see that the The connection with Ban Atlantis is coming right there. So maybe I should. So any questions so far? So what's the dual Bruminkowski theory? Well, what is a star set? I said I would look at sets living in Euclidean space. I would say this is a star. Space, I will say this is a star set if whenever I have, well, if the origin belongs to L, and for every point in L I have all txped for T, say, 201. This is what I call a star set. And to each of those sets, I can associate what I call the radial function. Function, which would be a function defined on the unit sphere, and which, at each point of the sphere, that is, at each direction, is going to tell me how large my set is. So, row L of some points x in the sphere is going to be the sup of those t positives such that dx belongs to L. Okay, measuring how long does my set go. How long does my set go in the direction of x? And we say that a set L star set is a star body precisely when this function is continuous. So positive continuous function on the unit sphere. Okay? Are you assuming L is bounded? Are you assuming L is bounded here? Well, now yes, right? If they are continuous on this compact set, they. But in the definition of a star set, in principle, you need not have bounded. But here they should. Okay. Well, it's very easy to check now that if I have two star bodies or two star sets and I look at the union and the intersection. Intersection, what happens with them? What is the radial function of the union? Well, it's going to be the max between the radial function of k and the radial function of L. And with the intersection, you have min. Oh, so looks like we are getting closer to Banabare situation. So, from this point of view, if I had a valuation defined on star sets, because the star body is determined by the radial function, I can think of this valuation as just a map on these radial functions, those functions in the space of continuous, I mean the space of the positive continuous functions on the unit sphere. Functions on the unit sphere. So that's what that which satisfies which property. Well, this becomes precisely this formula. Okay? And from now on, I can forget about sets and look at functions or elements in a bunch of lattice. And I'm going to use this formula to define. Formula to define what's the notion of evaluation on a banner lattice or on a vector lattice, actually, if you want. Okay, so that would be my definition. So let's say E is a banach lattice and my map on the positive cone of that banner glattis is evaluation if this. If these cause, okay, in this same colours. Okay? That's the definition we are going to work with. And well, by the way, there's another thing I was speaking about, evaluation. I was speaking about continuity. Well, it's not hard to check also that when I look at star sets, the Hubsorf distance between two star sets actually coincides. sets actually coincides with the uniform normal between the difference of the so the so like this if I have two star sets the distance the Hausdorff distance between K and L is actually the same as computing the radio function of k and comparing it with the radio function of L and then taking just the norm of the difference. So the distance is just the norm in this vanilla. In this vana glass. So, when I will say, when I look at continuous valuations, typically I will look at continuity with respect to the norm. Okay? And in this talk, I will only consider continuous evaluation. I would say that V evaluation is continuous when it is continuous with respect to the norm, right? The norm of my on my on my vanal lattice. Okay, but of course, one might be interested in looking at other sorts of continuity. We were looking at in Jan Hahn's lecture, we were having several notions of convergence structure. So one might be interested in looking at what are the evaluations which are continuous with respect to, say, for the order, which are order continuous. For the order, which are order continues, for instance. And actually, I'm not going to speak about this today, I won't have time, but we have been studying, for instance, valuations on species of Lipschitz functions, which are not band lattices. And of course, you have the norm there, and that makes sense to study valuations which are continuous with respect to the norm. But actually, we need to introduce different kinds of continuity with respect to some convergence and topology, right? Emergence topology. So, not even a topology, actually. So, yeah. So, sometimes these things are, so that would be kind of a question to try to understand what continuities one can consider for these functions, for these derivations. So, what I wanted to say Yeah, so what about this Hardwiger theorem? This Hardinger theorem in the setting of in this setting, or in particular in the setting where my well, my Banach lattice is the space of continuous functions. So what I was saying is that, in the particular case, E is the space of continuous functions on some compact space, but in particular the unit sphere, this corresponds exactly to valuations on the standard bias. On the style of this, right? And what about this uh theorem, which I based, right? The theorem of Hadwiger in this situation. Can one characterize in a nice way what are the rigid motion invariant valuations on star bodies? Well, now one has to be careful with the terminology of what is rigid motion invariant in the setting. What is rigid motion invariant in the setting of star bodies? Because I'm assuming I cannot move my star body around very much because I'm assuming the origin is in the star body. So what I will do is only consider those rotations, right? Which are living, of course, in the origin, are fixed. So linear pages, if you want. So one would wonder what happens with those valuations. And a colleague of mine, which, by the way, Of mine, which by the way, I didn't mention, but all the things I'm covering today are basically joint works with Nacho Janueva. So he proved in I think 2016, that's where I started getting interested into these kind of questions. He proved, he gave a characterization of evaluation. He gave a characterization of valuations which are rigid motion invariant on the space of on the starboards. Okay, so if I have, I was using this notation, right? Actually, a positive evaluation which is continuous and rotationally invariant, let's say, rotationally invariant evaluation. Then Then the math exists some function, theta, in positive numbers, which is continuous, such that the evaluation looks like this. So I take the radial function of k, I take, well, I look at its values on points of the sphere, and I take this map, theta. Take this map, theta, take this composition, right? And I integrate with respect to the Mach measure, well, high measure of the sphere. And one can check that every expression like this will yield a continuous rigid motion invariant valuation on the star bodies. And what uh the other proof is that these are all These are all. So for each continuous function on the positive reals, you get a valuation. So the situation is completely different from the Bruneminkowski case, where we had like only finitely generated space of rigid motion invariant continuous valuations. Here you have an infinite dimensional set or possible choices of theta give you different evaluations. Different variations. By the way, which are the simplest examples of valuations one can construct on a banagratis according to this definition? Well, of course, if I start with a linear, right? If this is just an observation, but if I start with an element in the dual of my banop matrix, Do about my band of lattice is going to define evaluation, right? So what is x star of this plus x star of that? Well, this is the same as they stay here, right? But of course, we know this is the same as the sum. So you get for free the property of For free, the property of pain evaluation, right? Uh, so in a way, you can think of this theory as a non-linear version of linear functions, right? It's like a. These things, of course, they are not linear. And I have this theta here, which could be whatever, continuous function, making like take the square of the function, for instance. It's not here. So the general. So the general one question one might ask is: okay, so now we have this nice family of functionals, not linear ones, but still nice because they're related to the lattice structure. What can we learn about the Banach lattice from those evaluations? Okay, so I will basically modify this. Okay, and well, one of my first goals in this setting was to see how relevant rotational invariance was to get. Was to get this kind of result. In other words, can I also provide some integral formulas for evaluations in this setting or in the general setting of analysis. And we could prove this kind of results. And in order to prove this, we kind of figured out several Figured out several properties of evaluation which were interesting, which were necessary in our proof. And I want to isolate these kind of properties that can be studied kind of independently, which kind of might be good to enrich this theory. So, as I said, the properties that can be of interest of evaluation could be, first of all, Could be first of all boundedness, some class of sets. All the things I want to look at are decomposition properties of a valuation. So for instance, if you're looking at a linear evaluation, every linear function can be split into what can be written as a difference of two positive ones. What happens with the valuation? ones. What happens with evaluations? Can you do something like that? Not linear, so you have to find out a different way, but turns out that sometimes you can do that. As I said, another property which was interesting for us is the look for representation theorems or classification, if you want, results. Um, what else? Uh oh, extendability property. So, whether you have a valuation which is defined in some class of functions, whether you can extend it to a larger one. This is also playing a role in these kind of arguments. And uniform continuity, that was also important. And by this, uniform continuity, I really mean the classical, not the vector lattice. Classical vector lattice notation. Uniform, I mean like a topological uniform continuity, right? So epsilon delta with the absolute independent of the delta, right? With the points. So uniform continuity on certain sets. So all these things were somehow ingredients that appeared in in our proofs of those results and maybe well I won't have time to go through all of them, but Have time to go through all of them, but let's focus on a couple of them and at least give you some ideas of how you can improve things without linearity, but which you would expect because this is not completely, I mean this condition style, which I have raised, but which is up there, is not completely insane, right? It still has some structure of the of the vector of the magnet vector matrix, of the magnet matrix you removed it. Vector lattice or banner lattice remotely. So let's look at boundedness and let's start by looking at the following results. So if E is a banner lattice and I have a continuous evaluation, and by that I mean now a continuous with spectral norm, then it is bounded on bounded sets on order bounds. On order bounded sets, let's say. Okay? So, what do I mean by that? Well, we mean that for every positive element I take, well, this thing, right? Oops. Oh, sorry. This thing is fine, right? So Fine, right? So bounded on order bounded size. And how can you prove this? Of course in the case this thing were linear, that's clear, right? Linear continuous map is not. This is one of the first things wonders in a functional analysis course. How can we deal with How can we deal with the non-linearity that we have here? Okay, so you see the argument is not complicated, but it's slightly less trivial than the linear one. So let's assume I have some function f, like that, some element here, and some family which are bounded by f. Have for which my valuation grows, right? Like, like let's say it goes to infinity. I mean, formally I would have the absolute value, but let's assume I have some increasing positive values which go to infinity, right? Of functions which are all of them over, right? That's negating this condition. Okay, so what I Okay, so what I'm going to do is take the function g to be one half of f. And let's use what we have at hand, which is this formula. So let's cut these functions fn with this function g, which we know this satisfy this identity. Entity, okay? So if I have, if you want a picture, so imagine this is my function f, right? I will have something like one over f, and I have a bunch of functions there, line here, that would be the fns, whose values, after I apply the evaluation, go to infinity. So when I do this thing, I get this. I get these two pieces of the fn's. Now you get the part of fn which is below the function g, right? Well, no, this is the part below g, and this is the part above g, right? And so I would get something like this, right? That would be would be fn sub g and I know this for every n okay so I know these guys they grow to infinity this is some constant thing so one of these two has to go to infinity so well because I chose this one let's assume this is the one going to infinity okay and what I will do And what I will do now is I'll take now G, well, let's call this G1, and then I will take G2 to be what? 3 over 4 times F, which should be, I'm not out of colours, should be some guy here, right? And then I do the same trick with that. So would I. So, what I keep getting is sequences of functions whose values under the evaluation grow to infinity, but which are closer and closer to some multiple of f. Right? And by closer and closer, I mean they're really in the uniform norm going closer and closer to f. But how can that be? I mean, if my evaluation is continuous, those, if I make a diagonalization argument, if you want to. Diagonalization argument, if you want, and I pick sufficiently fast these cuts with the fns, I still have something which must converge to the value of the limit, right, because of continuity. But on the other side, I'm saying that these are growing to infinity. So this is in contradiction, right? So it's slightly more complicated than the linear case, but still can be done. Yes? I don't know if you want to introduce it in karma big detail, but what happened if it is. What happened if you fix ff in g values? Well, instead I would take one half of f. One over four. Sorry. Okay, so they will go to zero. Yeah, and I will, so in any case, I'm making, so what I keep getting is functions which are lying in smaller and smaller. Maybe it's easier if one thinks of the constant function and then you see that they are like lying in smaller and in thinner and thinner strips, right? So they converge in the form. Yeah, that should have been a better picture. Sorry. Okay. So this is about order. Wow. Order bounded sets. Of course, what about non-boundedness? What if you start with a non-bounded set? Can you expect these things to be bounded? Well, in CFK spaces, Spaces, we have just proved it. But in general, this is not true. So, the simple example I can come up with is the following. So, take C0. I'm going to define a valuation here, which you take the sequence xn and C0 and you map it to n xn. n x n something like that right because xn are going to zero these things are really going very very fast to zero so these things will converge and one can check that this is a continuous valuation checking that these things are valuation is just easy because the order is given coordinate wise so I'm defining this coordinate wise so so this is going to be the evaluation but of course so this is continuous evaluation but of course if I look at the But of course, if I look at the unit vector basis, which is norm-bounded, then the image is going to be n, which is unbounded. So continuous valuations need not be bounded on norm-bounded sets. And well, actually, because of this observation, I mean, this example, you can actually carry this to any atomic analytics. Analytics, right? So if E is an atomic analytics with an unconditional basis, the order given by that basis, there always exists a valuation like this, which is continuous valuation without not bounded on a normal set. So, the atoms are an issue. Without atoms, we could prove the following thing. If E is a non-atomic, so let's assume I start with a bunch lattice which is defined as a K-do function space or some measure space without any atoms. And let's assume E satisfies a. Let's assume E satisfies A, so E is a banner lattice with a lower Q estimate for some non-trivial Q. Then any, if I have evaluation which is continuous, actually it's enough if it's continuous at zero, then it's going to be bounded and bounded cells. Normal Okay, recall that Laura Q estimate means that you have a for these joint vectors you have a control a lower control right you have something ordering like this for for these geometries Okay, and so we see that the fact that you get rid of add-ons is kind of important for this result to fall. And actually, thanks to Timor, we could see that also lower Q estimate is a necessary assumption. Without that, you cannot provide. I mean, you can find examples of variations which are not. Are not bounded on bounded sets. Okay. Yeah, so what about that's about boundedness. What about decompositions? That was also kind of surprising. So as I said, the As I said, when I have a banana lights and I look at a functional, a linear functional on it, I can write it as a difference of two positive linear functionals, positive and negative part, of course. What about valuations? Well, it happens that you can also do that. So if I have a valuation fine here, a genius, there is always. There is always, well, this two positive valuations, continuous valuations, such that I can write V as a difference of this job. So well here the proof is, I'm not going to give the proof of this, because it I'm not going to give the proof of this because it's quite long, but the natural guess is correct. So, what would be this big? Well, I'm using plus lapstar asking it. So, what would be the guess? Well, first of all, what I'm going to assume is that v is zero at c. Otherwise, I just translate things, subtract the value at zero. That's not a problem. So, let's assume. That's not a problem. So let's assume the valuation is at zero. And let's define d plus of some f as what? As the sub. Okay, you knew this. You have. I just look thinking that's a measure. So what is this? The sub of what? V of G, where G is smaller than F, right? Something like that. That would be their guess, right? That would be the guess, right? Well, that's actually what you get in the linear case, right? And it works. But proving that it works is surprisingly hard. I mean, what is hard to prove is that this is a valuation against it. This is the hard part, of course. That this thing is evaluation. I mean, this is, of course, a kind of, I mean, this reminds me more. Me more it reminds me actually not the composition into positive and negative parts but this fact that if when you have a function of bounded variation on the real line you can write it as a difference of monotone functions, right? And the proof is that that this thing I mean this is the same uh expression that you use in that case. Now this becomes increasing. Now, this becomes increasing if f and g were just real numbers, right? So I insist the difficult part in this, in proving that this works, is make sure that this thing is a valuation. And we couldn't find an easy way to do that. It's quite important. But at least we have the compositions, right? That's what I wanted to share. Okay. And then, well, since I'm going way slowly than I thought, maybe I should at least show you what is our representation theorem. What's the representation theorem that we got for general? Well, we got two things. So, one thing is that whenever you start with the Panagladis, which is Panacularis, which is order continuous, and you view this as some Ketter function space or some measure space, you can, with a fixed measure space, you can provide an integral representation with respect to that given measure space. And in C of k spaces, you get something, you get another representation theorem, integral representation theorem, but it's a bit more complicated because you don't have a canonical. A canonical measure on the compact set in general, but you can make one. So, this is the third part: representation theory, integral representation, evaluations. And we have two results, as I was saying. So, maybe I will just write the first one. So, suppose I have evaluation on well, this would this would work actually for any compact Compact space, but at least compact network space, the proof is the same. For an arbitrary compact space, one has to make some technical modifications, but let's assume I'm dealing just with the original situation of star bodies. So let's assume I have a continuous valuation, and I'm not assuming anything, any invariance, like I was assuming here, no rotational invariance or anything. Rotational invariance or anything, just a continuous volition. Then, what one can find, I mean, the theorem tells you that you can find some measure, mu here, positive measure, such that a function k, well, I mean k is not the first, but from Here, the reals, which is from Karateodering. Okay, I will explain what I mean by that. Meaning that it's a function of two variables. So when I fix the second variable, and I look at it as a function on the sphere, this is going. The sphere, this is going to be continuous for MDT. No, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no. I'm doing it the opposite. Just measurable, right? Just measurable. It is measurable. Miserable. Meal miserable, right? I think, yeah, well, never mind. And on the other coordinate, so five fixed points in the sphere, this is going to be continuous for almost, for mu almost every x, right? And there's some extra condition I'm not going to write down now, some integrability condition. But I have a function and a measure so that my evaluation actually looks like an integral of the following form. So I have, I'm integrating over the sphere, and I have k at f of t dot. Well, I wrote it the other way around, sorry. F of X that d mean of X. So, okay, so I have the valuation on a function is computed like this. So, I start, I look at f on each point, x on the sphere, right, and I paid it with x. And I paid it with x, and I look at this function k and that. This is what the functions gives me some scalar value function, and i integrate it with respect to me. And it happens that these are all, right? Every, I mean, it's quite easy to prove the other way around. If I start with something like this, it's relatively easy to see that this is going to be an evaluation. The hard part is to prove the existence, of course. Part is to prove the existence of constant those things. And then, to prove this, we use those ideas and something else, and a lot of measure theory, as you can expect. And for the, well, actually, here it's quite easy to recover that theorem in the case of, in the case evaluation is rotationally invariant. Evaluation is rotationally invariant. Well, what you get is that this function k actually only depends. Because of rotation, well, two things. First, the measure has to be also rotation and invariant, so you get the high measure of the sphere, and this function will only depend on the height, not on the point you're looking at, also because of rotation and invariance. So in the end, this is, strictly speaking, a generalization of that. Speaking, a generalization of that. Okay, and for the order continuous case, as I was saying, you can prove something similar. If I start with an evaluation where E now is an order continuous when I've gotten on some measure space, now I have the measure given, right? Given, right? So the integral representative I'm looking for is with respect to that measure. And that's what happens. I have also some function like this. Well, this is again if I'm not able to some function, okay, satisfying something similar like that, so that I have wait, I've got a news. I have I have uh I have I have uh something I miss okay and maybe in the last uh uh few minutes I have I want to uh compare these things so so of course once you get these theorems if you look at the theorems you learn a few things uh so So, in particular, you learn that these things are going to be defined not just when my function is a continuous function, but also for any bounded world function, I could also define the thing. And so, this is telling me that if I started with a valuation which is continuous undefined on the continuous functions on the sphere, I can extend it to. I can extend it to a continuous functions on the bounded Borel functions. But actually, the way things work is: I mean, the way we got here is because we could extend. I mean, the theorem is a consequence of the fact that we could extend valuations from the continuous functions to the larger class of bounded Borel functions. And that's where the measure comes from. And also, uniform control. Also, uniform continuity played an important role in that. So I just wanted to mention a connection with some topic which has been in the literature for some time already, which is that of orthogonally additive maps, right? What is the relation between valuations and orthogonally additive? Additive maps. So, of course, well, what's an orthogonally a map found on, let's say, in the positive part of some banner lattice? We say it's orthogonally additive if whenever you have, well, disjoint vectors, you can do this, right? No, these guys are disjoint. So, of course, if I start with evaluation, this is going to be orthogonally additive, right? Because if this evaluation, say you do this, but you have to do this translation of making sure that Comes. This translation of making sure that zero goes to C. Which is kind of a canonical modification you can do. Then evaluation implies automatically additive because when it's clear, right? So if I have two, if x and y are disjoint, then this is just the same as this. And because the And because the this guy is zero, fine, I could write it here, like that, and this is exactly the valuation property. Okay? So actually, valuations are in particular autograph. The other way around, it's true in many, many cases. Actually, if you start with the telecomplete. Tele incomplete. I mean, as long as you can decompose things, I mean, this isn't like a particular case, but it could be pretty simple. If you start with the TEDC incomplete, sigma-complete, then you get tones, right? Every orthogonal reality map is a duration. They are the same. But in general, they are not. And maybe let's just finish with this example, simple example. So take E to be the continuous functions of 0, 1, which was in a previous lecture this morning. And take the following functional. So to each function here, I will look at what's the minimum value of it. Okay, so this map it's going to be proctoral reality because well essentially because the interval 0, 1 is connected. So if I have two functions which are disjoint, right they have to both have to be zero somewhere, right? See them somewhere, right? If both are zero somewhere, it means all mark to zero, which is also this thing. But right, so so what in particular I get that. You have to consider two cases. I wanted to say that this is not evaluation, right? Of course, yeah. So it's orthogonal. Yeah, I would have to consider the case where one is just constant one. But what I mean is that. What I mean is that if I have two functions whose infimum is zero, here, everything has to take the value zero somewhere, right? If I have two functions which are zero, this guy also takes the value zero because they are this joint. So trivially, I guess this thing, all these joint vectors. Because I'm just looking at the meaning. These joint vectors, because I'm just looking at the mission. But if I want to prove the valuation property, I could always take a function, say, I don't know, a function which is, say, zero between, so I could take a function like what? S, right? Another function. Right, and another function like that, right? So that the sup is the constant one function. So phi of the sup is one, right? And phi of this is f, this is g, right? So phi of f I can make it to be zero, and phi of g I can also make it to be zero. Zero. Right? But of course, whatever is the F, I'm not gonna make this, right? I cannot make it file of F. It's already one, the other one is here, right? The other one is here somewhere, right? So that would be it, right? This is zero. That would be eight, right? This is zero, but that is one, sorry, and this is this is not evaluation, right? And that's uh yeah, so I wanted to tell you many other things about valuations on LP spaces, for instance, Lipschitz functions and lattice of convex functions, but I think I will stop here. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your interest. There are any questions? So in the proposition that you, as you can mention yourself, you proved a little bit more than Gauche state, right? You proved that if your variation is continuous with respect to uniform convergence, then it is bounded on Lord Brown set. So there is in the linear case, there is a stimulus which was already mentioned by Nietzsche and Gutimer: that if you have a linear function with an operator and a particular functional, then it is continuous with respect to uniform conversions if and only if it is bounded for the bounded set. So could it be true for valuations as well, or is there an obvious current? You start with a valuation, which is Bounded on order bounded sense, let's say. You want to get continuity out of that? No, because you really get linearity then. Because you could say your evaluation activates at certain heights and then at certain heights when your functions take certain values, let's say, your evaluation is not continuous. Is not continuous, but still complex. Well, we can maybe I can so if you look at this formula for the general representation, uh it is kind of it's some kind of a deformation of uh the uh tool, right, of the order dual. So every relation is some kind of deformation. So every relation is a kind of formation kind of made up of a bunch of elements of the term. Exactly. So what you have here is that, of course, well, even the balance space dual, right? The balance space dual of the contiguous functions are the measures. And what you're doing here is kind of, I mean, actually the proof goes through constructing a bunch of measures at, let's say, for each value of t, you get some measure. And you have to glue them. Measure and you have to glue them in a nice way. So that's actually a very good point because I would hope that a similar thing would happen for a general gana glattis that you look at the linear functionals on that lattice, right, or the continuous ones, and you kind of glue them. I mean, you try to first, starting from evaluation, you want to construct a bunch of linear functionals and to glue them together in a nice way so that A nice way so that you recover the valuation. That's kind of the philosophy. And I guess a general theorem could be proved with this aim. But so far I only have these two cases which are quite different. I mean the hypothesis as you see are quite different, but in the end you get something similar. I mean of course here this is a bit different, right? But I'm fixing this measure, but still this looks like Measure, but still, this looks like functionals perturbed and mixed together somehow. Yeah, yeah. I would love to have like a general theorem saying that you start with a valuation, you construct a bunch of linear things, and then you recover the valuation by doing something with these linear things. What has to be specified, what you mean, by doing something. In this representation of the defined side, you said that it extends to the pound ep function. Extends to the boundary Berl functions. Have you thought about expanding it to the actual biju? That's a good question. I wanted to ask, and I forgot. Thank you. So, yeah, I don't know. I don't know in general. I think in this case, I mean, maybe you can extend. The problem is the continuity, which continuity you look for. Maybe Wix are continuity, maybe something like that. I'm not sure. But this is a very natural question. You start with your evaluation on a banner lattice. When can you extend it to the second dural, right? I wanted to mention this, but I don't know. The ideal general occupy the original space in the second rule. That would be that, right? You know, bounded URL indicates functions or not. Require norm, I suspect, to be order continuous. Valuation has to be not normal continuous, but order continuous. To that, I'm not sure. I suspect. I'm not sure. Uh here all the continuity is quite different. Quite different. Here the continuity is the same as non-conting. I was wondering whether there could be any useful Schouquet theory, which is in that case of if somehow if you look at all validations of a norm in post-parameter something like that, you could determine the extremal points of those. Actually, you mentioned this here at some point. You mentioned this idea at some point. I was giving a talk about these things, and you mentioned exactly. It's quite natural to do this, because if you can determine the external points of that set and relate it to this kernel that you would have written down there, then the existence of the measure presumably just possible. We really work very hard to get the measure new. But you could do the problem, trying to determine this. The problem is that we're trying to determine this external extreme. You show existence of this measure, but maybe you don't explicitly. Because we construct the measure explicitly. In this argument, we construct the measure explicitly. But you're right. I should explore this as fashion. But of course the challenge is to determine the extreme of points. Yeah, because in the convex body situation, Convex body situation, that's clear. You have five, I mean, you have finitely many, and these Kermes integrals, they are kind of the extreme points of your code of positive relation. Yeah, I mean, they are finitely many.
