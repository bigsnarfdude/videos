Okay. So, first of all, I'd like to thank you for this kind introduction and also invitation to this meeting. Unfortunately, I cannot be there physically, but I'm happy to participate online. So my talk is not directly related to the fluid dynamics, but in The fluid dynamics, but in spirit, maybe something related to the kinetic question. So let me give you a brief outline of my talk. First, I'll give you some motivation of my talk, and then I'll talk about this some emergent dynamics for finite number of chromatoscillators, and then I'll give you the emergent dynamics. The emergent dynamics for infinite chromato oscillators. And then you might wonder what's the difference between finite and infinite chromato oscillators. You will see some transparent difference between the finite and infinite. And then I'll give you the final take-home message. Okay, so the first episode. So I'm addressing the following question. I'm addressing the following question. Is the mean field approach the only way to deal with a particle system with all two couplings and large system size N? Because we open, suppose we have a big interacting particle system with all tool couplings, and then the number of particles is sufficiently large. Then we most of the time we directly approximate. Time we directly approximate this large park system using corresponding the mean field Kinetic equation like Blassov type equations. So now I'm addressing it's the only way to study the dynamics of large interacting particle system. Okay, so so let me give you some brief You some brief introduction. So, the particle systems with the ultra couplings. Okay, so here n is the number of particles. The bracket n is the set from 1 to n. So, this is a common notation used in the control theory. And capital Q is the state vector. The state vector, the generalized position, and P, capital P, is the generalized momentum. Okay, so I use the physicist notation a little bit. Then the first order dynamics with autocoupling basically is often written in this way. So the time evolution of the ice position of ice particle is Ice particle is given by some forcing gamma i depending on qi and the average of this position. Some kind of average. Like here, for example, it's a weighted average. Or you can view this average like some generalized sense. So from this first dynamics, the dynamics of ice particle. Dynamics of ice particle will be affected by others through the average, through the average. Okay. For example, the second order dynamics, so Qi dot equals Pi, that's the physics law. Pi dot is gamma i. Again, the forcing here only depends on the qi and pi, and then the average of q and p. Of Q and P. Okay? So the effect of neighboring field particles on the test particle are given via some kind of average, ensemble averages. So I'm interested in this kind of intact empiric system. Okay. Then usually we take a mean field approximation in this case for the when the When the system size capital N is sufficiently large, we often approximate these large particle systems by the corresponding kinetic equation. For example, you take this empirical mean, empirical average, empirical measure, then you assume that this empirical measure as n goes to infinity, weekly maybe it converges to some function f. function f we call that the one particle distribution function or if you have a second order dynamics then you also assume assume that this empirical measure approach to converge to weakly to some f then by using so-called pbgky hierarchy you can identify the following these kinetic equations okay support Okay. So but when you use this BBGKY hierarchy, we use the many unjustified assumptions like molecular chaos and so on. So once you have this target kinetic equation, then we somehow we justify this formal limit using some analytic tools. Okay, so this is the standard procedure to approximate To approximate large particle system by corresponding Kinney equation. So, my motivating question is: in order to study the large particle system with the all-to-couplings, do we always need to rely on this mean field approximation? So, in other words, just using the kinetic equation is always a good way to A good way to study n goes to infinity. Okay. For example, if you have this particle system with the finite system size n, you take formally, you take n goes to infinity, and then the formal limit system will be the infinite system of ODEs, for example. Okay, so can we deal with this infinite? So, can we deal with this infinite system of all these directly without relying on the kinetic equations? Of course, in physics literature, there are some infinite system already there. For example, Smorobchowsky coagulation equation for the polymer chemistry. For example, if I denote XK of If I denote xk of t like a concentration of particle with mass k in a certain volume at time t, then Smolochi equation is given here. So you see that this k takes the whole integer, this whole number, natural number. So you have to deal with this infinite sum here. And also as a special case of this Smolotchowski Smolochovsky coagulation equation. You can also, there is a so-called Beckodoring cluster equation proposed in 1935. C sub R of T, that's the expected number of R particle clusters. So this is a dynamic system for this expected number of clusters. So their dynamics is given in this way. So you see. Even in this way. So you see clearly this infinite sum. Okay. And also recently, Wang and Xu from Harvey Institute of Technology, they also considered the infinite particle cooker smell model, like here. Okay. So we have a good reason to study the infinite system directly without little. Directly without relying on the corresponding kinetic equation. So, the goal of my talk will be the following: for given the Kramoto model for finite number of oscillators, here, nu I is so-called the natural frequency of I oscillator, kappa is the coupling strength, n is the number of oscillators. Then, Then, my goal is to propose a dynamical system for an infinite set of chromato oscillators and also to study its emergent dynamics and look for different features compared to finite chromoto model. Okay, if infinite system, the dynamics of infinite system, some of the dynamics. Some of the dynamics will be the same as a finite dimensional case, but today I'll tell you something different. Okay. So that's the end of my first episode. So let me switch to the second episode. So before we jump into the infinite set of chromatic oscillators, let's first review what's known for a finite chromato oscillator. What's known for finite chromoto oscillators? So you can, okay, so let me just briefly explain what the chromotomator is. Suppose we have a finite number of oscillator rotators moving around the unicircle, then the position of ice rotor is given by this polar form e to the i set the i. e to the i set i and then this phase we call the set i to be the phase of the position then the fake the the dynamics of phase which is the the time derivative this is a frequency is given is equal to natural frequency plus this sinusoidal coupling okay so you clearly you see that if coupling is a zero then the whole dynamics is just a just a It's just a rotation motion on a unicycle with natural velocity, natural frequency. So if you increase kappa large enough compared to the natural frequencies, then you will see some coherent motion. Unfortunately, I cannot show you a video, but But if the coupling strength is large enough, for example, in the left figure, you see some collective dynamics among these chromato oscillators. Before I move on further, let me give you a definition of phase locking. Some phase vectors exhibit phase locking means their relative phase. Relative phase approach to some fixed number. Okay. So for all ij, their relative phase approach to some constant state, relative state, that we call this system exhibit the phase locking. But if you do the numeric simulations for all initial data, as long as the coupling strength As long as the coupling strength is large enough, you see certain phase locking phenomena. So, you want to believe this phase locking will emerge for all initial data as long as the coupling strength is large enough. In fact, this is not true. You can find some count example, even though the coupling. Even though the coupling strength is sufficiently large, some kind of initial configuration cannot reach the phase locking. Okay? So somehow we have to relax. We have to relax. We have to give up our use per hope. Instead, we have to relax our admissible initial data to the generic initial data, not all initial data. So the question. Initial data. So, the question is: how to prove that? So, before I show you some theorem, we need some preparations. So, for given configuration seta, phase configuration, you take this convex combination of e to the i seta j. Remember, e to the i seta j lies on the unicircle. So the So, the disk is a convex set. So, if you take a convex combination of these endpoints, then clearly you see that this number, this average, belongs to the unit disk. So, therefore, you can write as a polar coordinate, R e to the I phi. So, the R is always between zero and one. For example, if all oscillators concentrate one same value, then One same value, then capital R must be equal to one. We call the phase synchrony. If the set J is uniformly distributed along the unit circle, then R is going to be zero. That is called incoherent state. So somehow this capital R measures the degree of synchronization. So if R is close to one, then you have a better, you have synchronization. Synchronization. And if you divide this dilation by e to the i seta i, you take an imaginary part, then you get this dilation. Certainly, the right-hand side, this quantity is there in the chromoto model, one over n, summation j from one to n sine this guy, you see this guy. So some So, somehow you can rewrite the chromotom as this mean field form. Say, you see that the dynamics of set I only affected by this average quantity capital R, capital phi. Okay, if capital R, capital phi are constant, they just solvable ODE. That is called the Adelaide equation. The Adelaide equation for constant capital R, constant capital phi, but this capital R and phi are function of zeta J, the other ones. So it's not constant anymore. Okay. Anyway, so there were a few approaches. There were previous approaches to get the phase locking for genetic initial data, but unfortunately, quite long. But unfortunately, quite a long period, there was some restriction on the diameter of initial configurations. So if configuration is confined in the quarter arc, then you can show this some exponential synchrony. And then years later, we can extend this range to the half circle. So if initial configuration lies on half circle, Configuration lies on half circle, you have an exponential phase locking. This finite chromatomodel has a good structure, so-called it can be written as a gradient flow with this potential. So, what one can prove is that if the phase vector is uniformly bounded under this assumption. Bounded under this assumption, then this phase vector converge to some equilibrium point. Okay, so finally, around maybe 2016 and 2018, if initial configuration satisfies this generic condition, then for large coupling strengths, how large it is? This amount, okay? Then we could. Then we could show that this phase vector approach to some equilibrium. So this implies the phase locking as well. Okay, so for finite chromato oscillator, basically we have very good understanding at the moment. Of course, there are also lots of open questions that we don't know. Since I don't have much time, let me just jump on to. Time now, let me just jump on to the main thing: the last topic, third episode. That's infinite chromoto oscillators. Okay, again, we have a finite chromotome model. Now we want to study n-ghost infinity. Of course, if you just take n-ghost infinity, then this sum doesn't make sense. Okay, so it's not well defined. So we somehow So we somehow we change the kappa over n by this uniform kappa over n to kappa ij. Okay, so this somehow this coupling strength depends on i and j. So we can figure it out. That's easy to think of this infinite klamoto model like that. Of course, in order to make sense this sum, you have to put some assumption on kappa ij. Assumption on the kappa ij. Okay. So here is our assumption on the kappa ij and initial data. If initial data is lies in L P space, this natural frequency vector, infinite vector, lives in L P space. And then kappa ij, we assume that is non-negative. And this submobility condition. Okay. Condition. Okay. Then you can find the LP solution because this LP is a Banard space. So you can view this as a ODE on a Banard space. So the standard Cauchy Division theory can be applied to ODE system on a Banard space. So that gives you the local verpogenies and also this. And also, the velocity is uniformly bounded that gives you global verpogenous as well. So, the global verpogenies is not a big deal here. The interesting is the asymptotic dynamics of this infinite system. In particular, this infinite system has a good structure. For example, if covering matrix kappa ij can be decomposed as a Can be decomposed as a symmetric one Aij times kappa J. A symmetric one lives in L P P, Kappa J lives in L Q, P and Q are held to conjugate each other. Then this weighted sum, this weighted sum satisfy this balance law. And also it has some kind of translation invariance. If you if you If you change to this rotating frame with a constant velocity, frequency, and then this fluctuation also satisfy the same form of infinite chromato system with a possibly different natural frequency vector. Okay, so this phase vector frequency vector and the time delivery. Frequency vector and the time-derivative frequency vector are uniformly bounded a priori by assuming this infinite matrix kappa K as this finite norm in this sense. And also you can define the phase diameter and extreme phases in this way. Then they are Lipsis continuous, so therefore they are almost everywhere differentiable. Differentiable. So let me show you some results on the dynamics. For example, we consider homogeneous ensemble. Homogeneous means all oscillator have the same, has the same natural frequency, say nu. If nu is not zero, then a natural frequency vector does not live in L P, P is not. L p, p is not infinity. So we have to work within L infinity space. However, if ν is zero, zero natural frequency, then we can work with any setup in L P by suitable assumption on kappa ij and initial data. Okay, so here's the framework. This coupling matrix kappa ij. Kappa ij satisfy the following positivity like this. So some this normalized one can be bounded below by some L1 sequence and the phase configuration is confined in the half circle. Then you can check this phase diameter is non-increasing because maximum phase always Phase are always non-increasing, minimal phase are always non-decreasing. So, therefore, the phase diameter, as long as the phase diameter less than pi, the diameter is not increasing. Okay. But that does not mean the phase diameter tends to zero. Okay, so I show you some, and also this condition. Also, this condition is not artificial. You can find some explicit example. For example, kappa ij is a split, it can be split as a product of these two numbers, a ij. They are positive sequence and summable. Then you can find this kappa j tilde in this way. So under these assumptions, F1, F2. F1, F2, the phase diameter is non-increasing in T. Okay, that's not surprising. This happens for finite chromato oscillator case. And if zeta is a phase locked state, the only phase locked state diameter less than pi, that's the only tribute, this one point collapse, this concentration. Now, suppose we have a two increasing sequence. Suppose we have a two-increasing sequence I n, jn, such that the eventually this coupling matrix tends to zero. Okay. And along this sequence, initial data, also the approach to the extremal phases, then you can show that the phase diameter is non-decreasing in this case. So, therefore, if you call So, therefore, if you combine this non-increasing, non-decreasing, that means it's constant. That's a surprising thing. Under this special situation setup, the phase diameter is constant along the flow. So, this doesn't happen for a finite chromato oscillator case. So, here's the So here's an explicit example. If you take a kappa ij to be like that, then at the end, what you can get is the following: this phase diameter is greater than equal to this. Okay, this should be true for all k. So k goes to infinity. You can show that the phase diameter of set of t is greater than 2 pi over 3. That's the exactly initial phase. That's the exactly initial phase diameter because it takes three pi over three, negative pi over three. So the so this is the example. So this is the unique feature of infinite chromatos later case. And also under certain good conditions on this coupling matrix, there's a symmetry and the summable, then the frequency approach to zero. Okay, the idea is to use. The idea is to use a Lyapunov functional approach. You take this Liafuno functional, and you take, then it satisfies this Liafunov estimate, and the time derivative, second time derivative, always bounded. And then by using Babara's lemma, you can show that the time derivative of Lyapunov function approaches to zero. That means frequency vector approach to zero asymptotically. That gives you Asymptotically that gives you complete synchronization for heterogeneous ensemble case under extra summation on the coupling matrix, this sum has a positive infimum for all. Then, under this well prepared setup, you can show that the phase diameter is bounded by some non-diameter. Is bounded by some number gamma. You see that the gamma depends on one over the normal k, this quantity, one over kappa k. So somehow this is called the practical synchronization. I cannot show that this the phase infinite phase vector approach to some equilibrium state. I cannot prove that. I cannot prove that, but instead I can bound the diameter by one over coupling strength somehow. This is called the practical synchronization. Okay, so I have two minutes. So let me summarize. Okay. Okay. So here's a take-home message. So we address the emergent dynamics of infinite chromato model with n equals infinity. n equals infinity, we show that existence of quasi-stationary state and emergent collective dynamics. This kind of approach can be workable for high-dimension analog of chromoto model. Okay, so thank you very much. So that's the end of my talk.
