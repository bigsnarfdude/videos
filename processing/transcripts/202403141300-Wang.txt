This talk is about attributed graph alignment, which is a statistical inference problem on graphs. And this is a joint work with two of my students. Zhao is my current PhD student. Ning Zhang is a former master's student, and my colleague Wei Na Wang at Canagi Mainlong. So this problem So this problem is motivated by the fact that nowadays there are a lot of correlated data. In particular, there are correlated graph data. For example, the set of users, the friendship network from Linking. And then the same set of users might have also registered in Facebook. And if you look at the friendship network of these two set of Of these two sets of graphs, they're highly likely to be very similar. And imagine one of the companies wants to release some of the data for research purpose, and before they release data, they remove the user identity with the hope that will protect privacy. However, because there exists other correlated data that are publicly available elsewhere, you might be able to You might be able to de-anonymize users' identity by just looking at the two graphs and figuring out the vertex correspondence. So that is how, one of the ways to motivate why people study such problems. And moreover, there are also many other applications in data science and machine learning where you can have correlated graph data. For example, you can have two different acquisitions of
