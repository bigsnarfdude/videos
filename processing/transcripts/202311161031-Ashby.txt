I know that these things take a lot of time and energy and effort, so I think it's worked really well and it's been really nice to see it one face-to-face rather than online. So guys for that. Okay, today I'm going to be talking about some modeling I did during the pandemic looking at the role that immunocompromised hosts can play in facilitating pathogenic evolution. A bit of background: I really have a background in evolutionary theory, and most of my research today is focused. Of my research to date is focused on answering questions within broader evolutionary biology. So, looking at, for example, how do different environmental or genetic factors affect co-evolutionary dynamics between hosts and pathogens or parasites? So, for example, when do we see negative frequency-dependent selection versus directional selection? Thinking about the role that parasites and pathogens can play in the evolution of mating strategies and sexual selection, thinking about niche evolution or microbiome evolution as well, and then thinking. Evolution as well, and then thinking about the role that infectious diseases can play in shaping immunity across the post-lifespan. So, a lot of these questions are really, like I say, focused on an evolutionary biology angle rather than thinking about, say, particular infectious diseases or mapping data to models. So, that gives a little bit of a background on where I'm coming from. The work I'm going to be talking about today was led by my postdoc Cameron Smith, who's now at Oxford and is published in this book. Oxford and is published in this paper here if you want to find out more details. So, I like to think of this as a bit of a detective story and how we can use mathematical models to try to unpack some of the mechanisms that may be a little bit harder to see in some of the empirical data or some of our observations. I'm a big fan of neon noir and also classic noir, so I don't know if anyone recognises. I'm sure who recognises this, what this film might be. Any guesses? Marty's probably a good guess, he watched. Maltese Falcon. Good guess, you want it? I think it's Maltese Falcon. Anyway, it's Humphrey broke up as an investigative. Anyway, so I'd like to think of this as a bit of a detective story and trying to unpick some of the patterns that we saw during the pandemic by uncovering some of the clues that we had at the time. So I want you to cast your minds back to late 2021 when Delta was the dominant strain. I think in the UK and early fall, it accounted for over 99% of infections at the time. So really, everything was pretty. So, really, everything was pretty much delta. And then we saw Omicron, I mean VA1, and then sweep to fixation very rapidly at the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022. So, why is this kind of interesting? I think during this kind of time here in early fall, most people probably thought that the next variant of concern was going to arise from Delta. Millions of infections happening, loads and loads of mutation supply. You can think of that mutational space being really thoroughly explored around. Thoroughly explored around where the dominant strain of the delta was. And then the other component we have here is that as soon as Omicron emerged, we ended up seeing a very rapid selective sweep. So the two ingredients there are really high mutational supply, and there was definitely very strong selection for immunovention. But then we didn't see Omicron arising from Delta. It didn't descend from Delta. It descended from a much earlier branch in the tree. So this is taken from this paper. This is taken from this paper, so it's much earlier in the pandemic. But we see that Omicron came from way over here as opposed to Delta being over here. So, why didn't Omicron descend from Delta? That's essentially a key question. The way I like to think about this is the most likely cause is that Delta was sat on some local fitness peak in this high-dimensional fitness landscape, just simplify down here, and Omicron was at some distant peak. And the PAT delta was. And that PACT Delta was doing pretty well at the time, but couldn't get away from this local fitness peak. It couldn't get all the way over to where Omicron was. Or to some other variant. So there are three main hypotheses as to where Omicron came from, and Jesse mentioned the first of these the other day, that perhaps SARS-CoV-2 jumped back from humans into an animal host, perhaps one of the rodents, evolved there for a while, and then came back into the human population, accumulated enough. Human population accumulated enough mutations during that time to facilitate immunovas. I think it's possible, but I don't think there's much data to really support that. I think this last one over here has much better support, which I'll get to in a moment. The second one that people talked about, I think the paper was eventually retracted, was talking about the fact that Omicron might have evolved in an isolated population somewhere, perhaps in Africa, and then eventually spread into the wider population. I don't think this really has great support. Population. I think this really has great support because it doesn't explain why Omicron would have accumulated so many mutations in that time relative to other variants. And then the final one, which I think has the most weights, and I'm going to focus on here, is the idea of evolving in an immunocompromised host. So these are some data looking at, and there are many studies like this actually looking at longitudinal infections in, very prolonged infections in immunocompromised hosts that say have cancer or HIV. Cancer or HIV. And often these people will be treated with things like convalescent plasma. So these here, you can't really see the legend very well, but these are just essentially reference strains from around the same time as this one immunocompromised patient. This is showing divergence. So these mutations are all causal dees here, over about 150 days for this prolonged infection within this one immunocompromised individual. And you can just see clearly that there's a really extensive divergence. Extensive divergence and accumulation of mutations. And these just aren't, you know, just randomly dispersed through the genome. These are predominantly adaptive because they're spike protein. So this is really strong evidence that those immunocompromised hosts are potentially facilitating evolution of viruses. So this is one particular example, but there are some other examples of that as well. So what do I want to do with the modeling? It's to try to say, okay, well, these data I think are pretty good, you know, pretty simple. Data, I think, are pretty supportive of this idea that immunocompromised individuals can speed up evolution. But the question I want to ask is: when do those immunocompromised hosts matter? When do they promote the emergence of mobile variants? So we went about modeling this. I'm going to just give a very high-level overview of the model. We went about modelling this by splitting our population into two types of hosts. So we have immunocompetent or otherwise healthy hosts who have relatively short infections, say on the order of seven to ten days, and then you have a sub-population. Days and then you have a subpopulation of immunocompromised hosts who have relatively long infections, so they might be on the order of 10 or even 20 times as long. So we saw in some of the data that some of those infections went on for 150, 200 days in fact. These are the only differences between these two types of facing model. We're not worried about mortality here. We're really thinking just about adaptation from the virus's perspective. So we don't encounter any other, or we don't assume that there are any other differences between these host types. Host types. And then this is the basic structure of the model. We have individuals split into these two different host types, and then they can both be susceptible to a particular variant or affected by it, and then they can recover. This is a little bit of a different structure. I'll talk about this in a few moments because we have overlapping classes here for our susceptibility classes. So when individuals are infected by variant I, they move from here to here, but they are also taken out of the susceptibility classes for other variants based on. Classes for other variants based on their extent of cross-immunity between these variants. In terms of the antigenic space that we're working with, we've just assumed a very simple one-dimensional space here. So you think of these as being adjacent variants arranged in a line, and there's just one mutation different between each of these variants. In principle, it could be two mutations different between all of them, but you may as well just assume one. So a mutation can take you from one to two or two to three and so on, but there aren't big jumps in this space. And then we use. And then we use that one-dimensional antigenic space to construct our idea of cross-immunity here based simply on distance. So, strains or variants that are close together, we assume that they have a high degree of cross-immunity. The further away they are, the lower the extent of cross-immunity. So, if you're going to approach this type of multi-strain model, one approach that you might like to take here for two strains is tracking a full infection history with non-overlapping classes. And this is much more akin to the classic. Like in classes, and this is much more akin to the classic SIR model where you have these discrete compartments. So, you could maybe start off with everyone being susceptible to both strains one and two, and then they could follow either of these pathways where they get infected by strain one or strain two, and they recover, and then they get infected by the other strain, potentially with a lower transmission rate here, indicated by this smaller arrow, due to cross-immunity, and then they recover from both. So, this is great, but it also means if you have many strains, for example. Means if you have many strains, for example, if you have something like 30 here, the number of equations is just going to explode. It's really difficult to keep track of. So an alternative is to use overlapping classes. So this is less commonly used. The idea here is that an individual would start being susceptible to strains one, two, and three here. So they're in all three of these different boxes. And then when individuals are infected by, say, strain one, the size of that box, the number of individuals in that box would shrink. But then a proportion But then a proportion of individuals will be taken out of, or assumed to gain cross-immunity to strain two. So this one shrinks a bit, and strain three, that one shrinks a bit as well. So this is a bit of a different structure, but this means that you don't have to keep track of quite as many equations. So what I'm going to do is just show some results with and without immunocompromised hosts and think about what happens to the antigenic evolution of this pathogen here. So we've got time going from left to right. So we've got time going from left to right, it's antigenic space is going back into the page, so these are different variants, and then the proportion inverted going vertically. So this is an example of what happens in our model if we have no immunocompromised hosts. So all of these hosts are the same here. And what we see is basically just a succession of waves. This is just a propagation through that antigenic space of successive waves. So the build-up of immunity is driving evolution here, pushing you through these different variants. And this is These different variants, and this is, I've referred to it as antigenic drift here just because it's kind of akin to antigenic drift on the flu. These were originally set up as flu models. I actually hate the term antigenic drift because it's not drift, it's selection. But I will go with the common nomenclature. And then what happens if we have a subset of immunocompromised hosts? You might be thinking these grafts are very similar, and that's because they basically have no effect when you just have immunocompromised hosts. One thing that they can do, which we don't have here, is if you assume that there is more rapid adaptation. If you assume that there is more rapid adaptation, it can make this a little bit faster. But they make up such a small proportion of the population that they're not qualitatively really changing. So if you remember, the whole motivation of this was to try and think about why did Omicron not descend from Delta? Why did we not see evidence of antigenic evolution in Delta when it was so dominant? It's not just immunocompromised hosts on the own, because here this would say you should be getting antigenic evolution. Would say you should be getting antigenic evolution governance. There must be an additional ingredient, and I think this comes from a fitness value. Okay, so this idea of a fitness value means that there's essentially epistasis between mutations. And so if you imagine delta being on this side and omicron or something, another variant of concern over this side, they both have a relatively high transmission rate. So think of those as peaks in this fitness value. Between them is representing a subset of those mutations. A subset of those mutations and having some but not all of those is maladaptive. Okay, so this has an effect of reducing the transmission rate at the between-host level, but crucially, it doesn't necessarily change things at the within-host level. So, just because something is maladaptive at the between-host level doesn't mean it's maladaptive within-host level, or vice versa. So, the idea here there is then that the immunocompromised hosts don't, because they have prolonged infections, they allow you to traverse this fitness valley. Traverse this fitness valley, whereas if you don't have many immunocompromised hosts, you kind of get stuck on one of these salts. So, if we run those simulations again, now without immunocompromised hosts, but with this fitness value, we end up seeing a big first wave, but then things pretty much die out. You get a tiny bit of antigenic evolution in this model, but nothing goes beyond that first peak in that bitless land state. So, everything essentially dies out. There's no replenishment of susceptibles in this model as well, so that's why. Well, so that's why everything dies out. If you had demographic turnover or if you had mining immunity, then you would have repeat waves, but you would stay on this side, crucially, wouldn't be propagating through that antigenic space. Now, if we look at what happens when we introduce those immunocompromised hosts, we see this big jump from one side to the other. So essentially, we've traversed that fitness value and we've come out the other side. And so evolution within those immunocompromised hosts has allowed us to jump from one side of this antigenic space. From one side of this antigenic space to the other. So I refer to this as antigenic shift. Again, just drawing the parallels with flu, just to emphasise the difference between the previous examples where there was a gentle, gradual propagation through that antigenic space, whereas here there's a big jump. So when do we see this kind of outcome? If we think about varying the strength of cross-immunity and varying the strength of epistasis, so here this just means that the depth of that fit. This just means that the depth of that fitness valley is greater. So we've got deeper fitness valleys here and shallower fitness valleys here. And the strength of cross immunity between variants is increasing as you go to the right. And the colour here is just showing that when we have darker regions, you essentially get these big jumps. And when you have the lighter regions, you've just got a gradual propagation. So drift versus shift, you like to think about that as drift in this region and shift in this region. So we see here that when you have relatively strong cross-immunity between strains, Strong cross-immunity between strains, you don't need as much of a fitness valley in order to see this antigenic shift happening. Whereas when you have relatively low cross-immunity, you need to have quite a deep fitness valley in order to see this effect. And that's because here, if you've got low cross-immunity, the next adjacent strain also has relatively high fitness, regardless of the strength of this intrinsic fitness. Then, same kind of idea here: the shading is the same here, but we're varying the proportional. Same here, but varying the proportion or percentage of the population that's immunocompromised, going left to right. And then the relative infectious period. So, here, as we go up on this scale here, we're saying that an immunocompromised individual has, on average, a longer infectious period here, 20-fold, 10-fold, 1-fold. So if we have more individuals who are immunocompromised, you essentially now have a sub-population that's much larger, and transmission between those immunocompromised individuals can allow you to facilitate. Individuals can allow you to facilitate the cytogenic shift, they become less important. When you have a very small proportion, they need to have much longer infectious periods. So, there is a potential surveillance or treatment kind of implication of this. If you're able to reduce the effective number of individuals for immunocompromise, or at least ones who are circulating within the population, then, or if you're able to reduce the average period for which they're infected, you're much less likely to get these big jobs in that antigenic space. Antigenic space. So, what's a kind of tentative conclusion from this? I think the modelling supports this as well as the general sort of idea of immunocompromised hosts facilitating evolution during those longitudinal studies. An immunocompromised host could have been the source of Omicron, but it's not just sufficient to have those immunocompromised hosts on their own. We need to have some additional ingredients, and those additional ingredients, I think, come through this. Goods, I think, come through this topology, if you like, of that fitness landscape. So there needs to be an additional fitness valley that those immunocompromised hosts are actually allowing you to traverse as opposed to just speeding up evolution per se. I'd also say when I did this model just as Omicron first came out and thought, wow, this is potentially really profound. You know, maybe we need these black swan events to get antigenic evolution in SARS-CoV-2. And then we saw BA1, BA2, BA4. Omicron did something completely. Omicron did something completely different to Delta. That makes me think that Delta was maybe just in a weird corner of this mutation space. And things around it were not antigenically very different and therefore did not spread. Whereas Opicron seems to be very readily able to evolve antigenically. So that kind of completely torpedoed my big prediction as to what was going to happen for the future of SALSPT. Okay, this meeting, remember in the title it said progress and next steps. Title, it said Progress and Next Steps. So, I wanted to think a little bit about what kinds of things we can look at to the future, and again, thinking about ideas about some of the clues we might see in data and how they might inform some of our models, and then how we can look at things through an evolutionary lens to understand adaptation at different scales and the consequences of that adaptation. So, this question here I think is quite interesting. So, how does within-host adaptation to immunocompromised hosts, or even more generally, a subset of some hosts within a population, Some hosts within a population affect the different epidemiological and immunological outcomes in the broader population. So, for example, in immune competent hosts. So, I was at a meeting a few weeks ago in London called Disease Models and Mechanisms. I realized at the time that when I arrived that when they say models, molecular biologists don't mean mathematical models. So that came back to bite me a little bit because it's an incredibly molecular set of talks. But there were some interesting. But there were some interesting tidbits of data in there. This one particular stood out for me. This is a preprint. I think it's been accepted now. But Lucy Thorne from Imperial was presenting these data. So thanks to her. This is showing essentially interference stimulated genes for different variants and controls here. So samples of SOLS-COVID2 from early 2020. And it's showing RNA expression versus those controls and protein expression versus those controls. And protein expression versus those controls. You can think of this essentially as the extent to which the innate immune system is being suppressed. So these are all of our sort of original variants of concerns pre-Omicrons, alpha through to delta, and then these are our controls. We see in all of these cases, they're all suppressing innate immunity. But then Omicron is doing something completely different. It's pointing in the other direction. It's not suppressing innate immunity at all. In fact, it's worse than the ancestral strain. And then, if we look at what happens to sub-variants of Omicron, the exception of BA2, which kind of point in the other direction, over time we saw BA4, BA5 starting to go back to suppressing innate immunity, so matching the kind of pattern that we saw for those earlier variants of concern. So, this data to me suggests that PAPS PA1 was indeed well adapted to the innate immunity of an immunocompromised host, but was maladapted to the standard innate immunity of Standard innate immunity of immunocompetent hosts. So there is a sort of double-edged sword to this idea of, you know, infecting immunocompromised hosts isn't uniformly good in terms of adaptation because they're adapting to that within-host environment of a particular type of host. And so while we should definitely, you know, I think we need more surveillance of immunocompromised hosts during pandemics because they can essentially be these hitri dishes that are allowing evolution to unfold. Evolution to unfold, but it's not uniformly good for a virus. So that's kind of the tip message. Okay, just to acknowledge everyone again, it's this Lucy who provided those data, Pamero, who did all the work. Thank you for your attention. Jane? Thanks.
