Thank you. Thank you very much. And of course, I would like to thank the organizers for this organizing this very stimulating meeting with many old friends. And yeah, I should stress that my talk will be about topological recursion. And unfortunately, again, in my talk, it will not meet non-commutative geometry, but it will meet matrix models and some very Uh, matrix models in some rather universal way, and I hope that eventually it would serve a first step towards non-community Germany. Okay, so let me start. And of course, I should say that this talk is based on a joint project with Maxim, Kazarian, and Peter Dudin Borkovsky, who are here, and Oris Michkov, and Series Chadri and Poanov here. Okay, so let's start. Okay, so let's start. So this is the plan of my talk. So I will start with a very brief introduction to keep integrability. And I hope that many people here are familiar with that. And I will give some kind of definition and explanation why I like it. Then I will briefly remind you some basic facts about topological recursion and XY. Topological recursion and XY swap relation, which were discussed in the lecture series by Maxim. Then I will give some details about two examples of topological recursion, very basic, very important examples, Kamsevich-Switten and Bruzang-Switten tau functions. And well, I will switch to PP indegreeability of end-point differentials. Again, it's closely related to what Maxim said us. Maximum setup and then in the Kippy setup, I will reformulate the XYZ vaporization. And it appears that many complicated formulas which were presented to us by Maxim are much simpler in the Kp integral case, and in some sense, we These formulas can explain something about the Xbox web, at least to people who are familiar with matrix models, certain matrix models of Kamsevich type. And well, what is particularly important for me is that this approach allows us to come back from topological recursion to matrix. So topological recursion originates as a description of matrix model, as an attempt to solve a variety of. That attempt to solve the various constraints, W constraints originated from the matrix model in a universal way. And now we have a more or less universal understanding, at least for genus zero spectrals, how to starting from any topological recursion to interpret the matrix integrals as the XY swipe transformation. And I will finish with one of the main results. Any topology. That any topological recovery on a regional spectral curve is KP integral. Okay, so let me start. Let me say a few words about PP hierarchy. So on this workshop, we had already several different integral systems. And in my talk, I will focus only on the KP hierarchy. And for me, today, integrable means KP integral. So So TP hierarchy and in general the theory of integral hierarchies of selitonic type was actually developed by the Kyoto school. And this topic is very beautiful because it's related to several other very important topics such as representation theory and infinite dimensional Lie algebras and free field formality. And if we restrict ourselves to the Kp integral hierarchy, it was introduced by Sat. It was introduced by Saturn. Then, the solution, there are different ways to describe the solution. One of the ways is in terms of the tau functions. So, for me, today, a tau function is just a formal series, an infinite set of variables called times, t1, t2, t3, and so on. And the co-hierarchy can be represented in terms of a keyword of bilinear identity. So, we have two copies of a tau function, that's why it's called bilinear, and we have two independent. And we have two independent sets of variables, t and t prime, and we require that this residue should be equal to zero for any independent sets of t and t prime. Here we have a shorthand notation. So these guys describe the shifts over t variables. So this is a series of negative powers of z, this is a series of positive powers of z, and we just request that the product has no term. Has no term proportional to one of z. Okay, so these bilinear digit quotes all non-linear PDFs of a TP hierarchy. And the simplest of them is the Kp equation. Here we have. So here again, you see it's a bilinear combination of the tau functions. And now we consider partial derivatives of a tau function. And to get the original, the standard form of Regional, the standard form of the Kp equation, and it takes the second logarithmic derivatives, the second derivative respective to one. And this is the Kp equation, which follows from this, where U is just the second logarithmic derivatives of L okay, so we have some equations why they are important and interesting. There could be different answers to this question, and one of To this question. And one of them is that because the space of all solutions is given by an infinite-dimensional Grassmannian, so-called Sattle-Grassman. So any point of the Saturday Grassmannian responds to some tau function. And this is equivalent to free field description. In this case, the free fields are just three charged fermions. So all we have are three fermions. And in terms of so any solution to this KP heart can be. This KP hierarchy can be described in terms of so-called basis vectors as a ratio of determinants. So the free charge fermions immediately leads to the determinant of formulas. And basically, whenever you have some determinants, it means that behind them you have the KP integrability. And of course, there are many reductions of the KP hierarchy. Reductions of the Kp hierarchy, and the most famous of them is the KDV hierarchy. And from the point of view of Kp hierarchy, it means just that our tau function does not depend on even times. So if this equation is satisfied for positive k, then we say that our tau function is a solution of a k d v parity. Okay, so Okay, so Maxim already discussed topological recursion. Topological recursion is a universal procedure which allows us to start from small amount of geometric data, the spectral curve, to Meromorphic functions, x and y, or to meromorphic differentials on it. And starting from with people, you get an infinite set of differentials, symmetric, meromorphic, and differentials. Miromorphic M differentials on the spectral curve for any G and any M. And these differentials for G on X and Y can give you interesting geometry or physics invariant. And what I want to stress here is that topological recursion originates from the verastial constraints and spectral curve description of correlation functions of matrix models. Matrix models and developed by many people. And essentially, one of the main results of this project for me is that now we have all the way around. So if we do not apply the topological recursion to a solution of the various circumstances, but we can start from the topological recursion immediately present an. Immediately represent an answer in terms of a metric center. And the question we will answer today is: what is the general relation between topological recursion and Kp? And of course, we know that there are many examples when topological recursion gives you some particular solutions of the Kp hierarchy. And the observation is that it's always the case, at least for the genome zero spectrum curves. Okay, here's the formula for topological recursion. I will probably skip it. I just want to stress that we have two functions, x and y, and they row not symmetric. So you can, if you permute the rows of x and y, the answer will be different. But the answers for topological recursion procedure that permuted x and y is related to. Y is related to the original topological recursion in a universal way. Here's the formula. It's, I would say, a bit more complicated than the formula which was given by Maxime, but essentially it's equivalent to that. Again, I will not discuss this formula in details. Here we have some graphs and so on, some operators. But for Maxima, I again want to stress that this formula is Formula is finite formula. So for any given energy, all the sums and products are finite products. And indeed, you can, starting from expressions for the dual correlation functions, you can obtain the correlation functions on the other side of x, y, y. Okay, here's the description of formula. Again, I will skip it, but let me see if you. But let me say a few words about particular examples of generating functions which can be described by topological recursion. The most famous example is, of course, given by the Kansevich-Wittental function. And the Kansevich-Wittental function, again, as it was discussed already on this workshop, describes the intersection theory on the modularized places. So we have a delivery mark for classification of the modularized places. Of a modular spaces, well, it should satisfy a stability condition. And on the mathematical physics side, or theoretical physics side, it corresponds to a two-dimensional topological gravity. And we consider certain homology classes on these spaces, and we construct the intersection numbers for all possible g n, k, one, to kn. So we have an infinite set of numbers, rational numbers, and we want to investigate. We want to investigate all of them simultaneously and to do that, we construct the generating function this way, just summing over all k possible k or possible g and m, introduce one additional parameter h bar to trace the topology, and we introduce infinitely many variables t, formal variables t and according to Witten's conjecture, this is a tau function of the kid. This is a tau function of the KDV hierarchy. It means that it satisfies the bilinear identity I wrote on the first page. And this is the theorem of Kancevich. So this generating function, after a simple change of variables, is a toll function of a KDV error. And It does follow from topological question. Well, yes. Well, you need, well, if you well, first of all, you need to identify this generating function with something coming from topological recursion. And if you know that this given topological recursion gives you these intersection numbers, then you immediately have a Numbers, then you immediately have a proof of. So from our results, it in particular follows that the topological recursion for the angering curve is KP interim, but it well, it's kind of too simple, but yes, it it Too simple, but yes, it falls from the general theorem. Okay, so this is the first example of a generating function which can be described by topological recursion. The second example, again, the Zanko-Switten Tau function, which was mentioned in this workshop, and it's very similar to the Kamsevich-Wittental function. The only difference is that you need to introduce the so-called normal theta clusters. So there are certain classes of homology, and you construct the generating function. And you construct the generating function exactly in the same way. You just introduce some additional classes. And I wanted to stress that the properties of this generating function or tau function are different. So for example, a genus zero part is trivial here. But again, we have the same relation to K D V color, to impinge colour. So again, after the same change of variables, what we get here is a tau function, a solution of a hero to bilinear. Resolution of a hero by Linux entity. Here are the series expansions for these two tau functions. And you see that this one is kind of more complicated than the second one. And what is particularly important for me is that both these tau functions can be described by matrix interpretations. So by very simple matrix models. So the first one is given by the famous Kansevich matrix model in the Meevo parametrization. Model in the Meevo parametrization. So if we substitute tk with one over k trace lambda to minus k, then the asymptotic expansion of this integral exactly gives you the expansion of the tau function. And here we integrate over the space of recognition matrices. So d phi is the standard measure, the space of recognition matrices coming from the hard measure. And how we interpret this integral? We interpret it in terms of asymptotic expansion near the kit. So, the asymptotic expansion near the critical point. We consider the critical point, we take the Gaussian term, we can the perturbative term, we expand, and what we get is a series, exactly series in these variables. And what is maybe less known is that for Prisanko Sven model, we have a very similar description, again with the same rules, the same measure, but the potential is slightly different. And now Now, one of the results of our project is that we now know how to restore these formulas in a universal way for the topological recursion. So both these tau functions can be described by topological recursion. So for a Camp Sergei Vietnam tau function, this can be described by topological recursion on the Airy spectral curve, this very simple spectral curve, and the relation differentials generate the intersection. Differentials generate the intersection numbers in this way, and the Brusango-Switzer function corresponds to the basic curve. So, x, the function x, is the same, but instead of y, we take one of y here. So, topological recursion corresponds to some procedure around the zeros, basically, of dx. And here we have just one critical point that equals to zero. So, the procedure is very simple. The x transformations again very simple. Transformations again very simple. But what I want to stress is for both curves, the dual topological recursions are trivial because dy in both cases have no zeros. So the whole answer is given by the transformation of the trio dual differential scale. So the whole answer is basically given by the The whole answer is basically given by the what remains when they substitute the trivial initial data here. Okay, so we have two examples of topological recursion, which are given by integrable systems, by matrix integrals. And now I want to say how one can relate in the endpoint differentials on the spectral curve to the Spectral curve to the deep integrability. So, again, let me start with the geometric setup. So, we have some curve, smooth, complex curve, which we call a spectral curve. And we consider some symmetric n differentials on this curve. And we do not assume that these differentials come from topological recursion. All we assume is that all these differentials are symmetric, meromorphic, with no poles on the diagonals, except. On the diagonals, except for g n equals to 0, 2, and 0, 2 is the standard differential, so it's symmetric and meromorphic, but it has a second-order wall on the diagonal of this B residue equal to 1. And so we have these differentials for B3 non-negative G and positive M. So we combine them in this way. And what we do again. What we do again, first of all, we need a definition of a regular point. So, a point sigma, a point O on sigma is called regular for the system of differentials. If basically, if the differentials are regular at the multi point on the n-cortex of the spectral curve for possible G and M, except for Gm equal to 0 and 1. equal to zero one and for again for jn equal to zero two we have some expression we we should subtract the double double pole contribution and the condition of regularity is independent on the choice of a local coordinate and we have no condition for 0, 1 and for any regular point the point is regular so we have a terror series expression. Zero series expansion, and we have a coefficients for any radial point and any local coordinate x at this radio point, we have coefficients f. And using these coefficients again, as Maxim did, we construct the function of t variables instead of a function of the variables on the spiritual curve. And this t variables. And these T variables we would like to associate with the variables signed so by individual coloring. Okay, so we have a free energy and we construct the candidate for tau function. And the theorem tells us that the integrability property of such function does not depend on On the choice of a point and the local coordinate of this point. So, the Kp integrability is an internal property of a collection of differentials. If this is a tau function, I mean the Kp tau function for some choice of a regular point and the coordinate of this point, then it is a tau function for any other choice of the point in the local coordinate. So, if the differential The differentials on the spectral curve are Kp integrable somewhere when they are Kp integrable everywhere, except for non non these are the formal parameters. So you have the differentials, you construct the coefficients, and you construct the function of t this way. Here I'll just Here are just formal parameters which we would like to identify the times of the KP hierarchy. So, again, you start from some collection of differentials, you construct, you expand them at any point with any local parameter x, you construct the coefficients f, and using these coefficients you again construct a function of t variables. Well, not exactly, because for different choices of the points on the curve and different choices of a local parameter, the tau functions will be different. So, correspond to any set of any set of integrable in the sense differentials correspond not just to one point of the sector's menu, but some some manifold on the sector. But some manifold on the circular space. It does not give you a unique tau function, it gives you a family of tau functions. Depends on the point of expansion and the choice of a local parameter. Well, the choice of a local parameter is just given by some simple action of the vertical group. So it's yeah. Yeah, so change of local spectral perimeter, the radio point provides a symmetry of Kp character here. And in some sets, it's given by an element of the subgroup of Gel infinity. Well, hasn't got the subgroup of Gel infinity. So to any sets of integrable to integrable differentials on the spectral curve, we associate not just one point. Associate not just one point of a subtle restraint, but some manifolds. Okay, so this is the general way to identify the differentials on the spectral curve with tau functions. And now I want to describe how all such TP integrable differentials can be d described in terms of one just one function or one differential. One function or one differentials, one differential dependent on two variables, two points on the spectral curve. So, for a given formal power series tau of t, the kernel k of two variables, x1, x2, you define it in the following way. So we just take tau and we substitute tk with a simple muvotype parameterization and we divide by this difference x1 minus x2. Difference x1 minus x2. And if tau is a tau function of Ki-Piker, then K is called the Baker Hyuser kernel. And well, it's a sum of this power term and formal power series in X1 and X2. And it is quite well known in the theory of Kp integral system that all correlation functions can be described in terms of this unique function of two variables. So again, So again, we have three fermions, charge three fermions. So the formulas of determinantal region, and they are given here. So if tau is a tau function, then all these correlation functions, the derivatives of log of tau, are given by this simple formula. Again, it's just you take a connected part of the determinant. So like relation functions. So like relation functions are given by determinant, which follows from a fermionic description and the weak theorem for the three fermions. And these guys are connected correlation functions because we take the derivative of log of tau and all you need is just to extract from the full determinant the connected part. And this is what is what is done here. And again, Again, as known for Kp integrability, the Terminanto formulas completely specify the Kp integral structure. So we have a lemma, one of the ways to describe Kp integral tau function. Well, a form of serial tau is a Kp tau function if and only if this determinant of form of holds. So to prove. So to prove KP integrability, one just needs to check for that for any n so that there is k such for any n, these formulas satisfy. And well, if we describe this, if we originate from the correlation differentials on this paper curve, then we can interpret this kernel as a natural geometric. kernel as a natural geometric object on the spectral curve and we can be the kernel well it's natural to consider it as a half differential in both variables and in this case it can be described in this again well-known formula for this differential so probably h bar is here yeah and again the the for the differentials the came for the kp We came for the Kp integrable differentials. We have this description. So, all differentials should be given by these combinations of a bakery here, the camera. Okay, so one of the main results about the XY swap equation can be formulated as this theorem. The XY swap equation preserves KP integrability. Fabulation preserves Kp integrability. If the original system of differentials is Kp integrable, if and only if the dual system of differentials is Kp integral. So all these complicated formulas which express omegas in terms of omega dual essentially describe one of the well, describe a family of symmetries of Kp curve. So Symmetries of Kp are. So if the original differentials are Kp integral, then the dual differentials are also Kp integral. And I would say that's completely not obvious from these formulas written in terms of differentials. So you apply some operators and it's at least I don't know how to trace the gib integrability on that level. On that level. So, and a very important observation from our point of view is that the Kp integrability restricts the topology of the spectral curve. So, if omega 0, 2 has no other pulse than the diagonal and omega j n satisfy the kpin durability property, then the spectral curve was rational. So, if we apply this very simple construction for the Uh, for the if you apply this very simple construction for the generating function in terms of relation differentials, when you need to have a rational spectral curve to have a chance for keeping the capabilities. For higher general spectral curve, it does not work already for omega 02. Okay. Okay, and from and it immediately follows that if the differential sonic adjust produced by topological recursion ITP integral, then that perfect curve should be rational. Okay, any questions so far? Well, you can expand it radio points. So, in both of these cases, you have two nice points, zero and infinity. One of them is radial, one is not. So, you always can choose you expand at infinity, it's a regular point. You have this consequence fit in tau function and results with function. Okay, so as I promised, there is a simple way to describe the xy sparrows for the kp integrable case, and it is given by the integral transform. So let us consider an integral transform of a function. An integral transform of a function f check of that. So we have a function and we apply this integral transform. Again, it made of x and y, two functions. And as usual, we apply that, we consider this integral as an asymptotic expansion. It means that we take the expansion at the point z. That and what we have here is the Gaussian theorem plus some corrections. And essentially, we compute the Gaussian integral. We compute the Gaussian integral and so some infinite series of correction and what we get is a formal series in the power of square root of h bar, but actually only even powers of square roots of h-bar survives. So we have a h-bar series. So, we have a H bar series expansion. Again, with coefficients given in terms of x, y, and different combinations of their derivatives. And at least as a form of series and h-bar, this integral is well definite, and this is how we define it. And so, the question is: if the system of differentials The system of differentials RKP integral in the complicated formula for the translation between correlation differentials, they can be replaced by much simpler determinants. And for these determinant formulas, all we need is to describe the transformation of the Baker-Racher kernel. And this transformation for the XY swap correlation can be described in terms of the Can be described in terms of the integrals of this type. So, first of all, let us consider two integral transforms which are inverse to each other. So, if for some function, the transferred function is given by this asymptotic expansion of this integral, then the inverse transform is given by exactly the same integral with some sign changes and the rows of x and y permuted. Again, the integrals are The integrals are formal integrals, so if you want the symptomatic expression for a small absolute value of h bar. Okay, and now the observation tells us how one can relate the bakery right here as a kernel for the original and the xy swapped correlation functions in the case of. Relation functions in the case of on one side of x-wab divide, you have kp integrability. So if the dual Baker-Sergic kernel is known, then the original Baker-Serge kernel is given by the asymptotic expansion of this integral. So all we need is just to apply the asymptotic expansion with respect to each of this variables. And the inverse transformation again is given. The indulgence transformation again is given by the very similar formula for the rows of x and y permuted. So if you know that you have integrability, at least on one side of xy duality, then the whole xy duality is given by these formulas. So you take the Beaker series kernel and the spectral curve, and you transform them with this simple Simple integral transformation. Okay, so what happens in the simple case? The simple case is when one on one side of the duality, the answer is trivial. So we assume that omega dual zero two is the standard one. And for all g n zero two, for all stable. Stable pairs, G and M, omegas are trivial. Then again, K is just a hole. And over here is just where this integral. So K is given explicitly in terms of X and Y. Again, it's a formula valid for any radial point. So it works almost everywhere on the spectrum curve. And K is given explicitly by the. And k is given explicitly by the asymptotic expansion of this double integral. Okay, so this is a transformation of the bakery CSA kernel. And what about the transformation of a point of a subtle person? As I told you, the Baker CS kernel completely defines the tau function, so it can be the transformation of the BKR CSU kernel can be reformulated as a transformation. Can be reformulated as a transformation of a point of Saturday transponion for all points, but for some points we have a particularly nice reformulation. So assume that x prime, y prime, where primes are derivative with respect to local coordinate, has a pole of degree at least three at z equal to zero. Then the transformation between the points of the Saturn Grossman, the basis vectors for the points of the Saturn Grossman, is given just by Soto-Grossmannion is given just by this simple integral transformation. So, if we know the point of the Soto-Grossmannion, so to be precise, we need to consider again some dual point corresponding to the negative times. So, if we know this guy, then on the other side of XY swap correlation, the point of the Saturn-Grass-Mannion given by this simple transformation. Transformation. And I want to stress that the so-called PQ duality describes a relation between two minimum models coupled to two-dimensional gravity. And the relation precisely of this form was derived in the context of Q-duality by Rachel and Marshakov almost 30 years ago. And this case of Q-duality corresponds to a polynomial x and y. polynomial x and y. So if x and y are polynomials, when you have a physical interpretation of the corresponding models and again where I describe by the Peter function, the reduction reduction is given by one of these polynomials, say by x on one side, by one on another side, and you also have a string equation. And in particular, what these guys did is write Guys, did is that they proved that if this point of settle Grimanian satisfy the corresponding cutsworth operators, cutswarts constraints on one side, then this transformation exactly gives you dual cashwarts operators. And because of the uniqueness of the solution of these cashwarts operators, then it it proves that. Then it proves that indeed this is a formula for PQ duality. So it was 30 years ago, no topological recursion at that time, but exactly this transformation was constructed for a certain family of a key P integral systems. Okay, so as you can see, these integrals are very similar to the matrix models. Models. I showed you function and Grisanko's witten tau function. So this is a transformation of the point of a Saturday's Mannian. So you can naturally describe it as a transformation of the matrix integral transform. And for example, if we So we consider the case when y is a radio irrational point. That means that dy has no zeros. So the dual side of xy swap relation is trivial. So, and we can see the system of differential differential constructed by topological recursion. So, we have topological recursion, we have some x and y. We have some x and y, and y is rational. Then the corresponding partition function at z equals zero is a kp tau function. And for this tau function, for this k p tau function associated to topological recursion, if x prime, y prime has a pole of degree at least three, the point of a start of Grashmanian has a very explicit expression. So you start yes. So you start with more or less arbitrary x and rational x and y rational, and you get an answer for the tau function associated to some special point on the spectral curve. And two families of example. So first we consider x. Well, in both cases, we consider monomial x and y. So here, x. y. So here x is z to minus r divided by r and y minus z inverse r greater than equal to 2. Then the associated partition function is known to be a string solution of Gelfandki hierarchy or higher K D V hierarchy. And on the numerative side, it corresponds to the intersection theory of Eaton clause. And if we apply And if we apply our formula to this spatial curve, what we get is the point of Gasmanian given by this asymptotic expression of these integrals. And this immediately corresponds to the so-called generalized Kantevich model. So we start from topological recursion and we immediately reproduce the generalized Kantsevich model describing the section number of different losses. And this example is well known, but Is well known, but the second example is probably not well known. So again, we have x the same, but consider y equal to minus z. And the corresponding point of the Southern Brassmannian is given by slightly different integrals. So you see the difference, first of all, you have slightly different potential, and then you have the power here is different. Over here is different. And it appears that in this case, the matrix model we get is the so-called well, there are different names. We can call it higher Brazilian Switzerland model, higher Brazilian Switzerland. So and because of because of this guy, because of this we don't have minus one here, so we have additional Ugarithmature. Additional logarithmic term. And it appears that this tau function also has a very nice geometric interpretation. So it corresponds to intersection theory of psi classes with so-called R theta classes in the modular spaces. And in particular, for R equal to 2, it is reduced to a generating function of psi classes and combination of cup packages. Yeah. Yeah. On the previous slide. Yes. To orthogonal polynomials. Well, in general, these guys are not polynomials. These guys are not polynomials, they are formal series in one over z. And well, they are related to some, should be related to some orthogonal polynomials, but you don't see it in this story. Okay, so this is how one can relate. Relate matrix integrals to the topological regression, or better to say to xy swap relation. So if you have xy swap relation, in the KP integral case, it always can be described by some matrix integral transform. And if you transform something trivial, then the whole answer is given just by matrix and view. And this is the source of most known matrix models of Kantevich type. Models of Konsevich type in mutative journey. So, if your problem is given by microcentral Kansevich type, that it means that first of all, it's given by some topological recursion, and then on the do side of this topological recursion, you have something extremely simple, maybe even trivial. Okay, and now coming back to do to KP integral here, I'd like to finish with the formulation of the most general. Finish with the formulation of the most general statement we have so far. So we start from geno zero spectral curve, this is necessary, and we consider a standard Berman kernel given by this formula, just double pole, where z is a global affine coordinate on the spherical curve. But the x and dy can be more or less or d3. So these are very meromorphic differentials, and it's even sufficient to consider some local. Local behavior. So it's sufficient to assume that dx and dy are definite in the vicinity of some points. And we have as a formal series any formal series at these points. Then the system of generalized topological recursion differentials, that is the differential constructed by this generalized topological recursion, definitely today by Maxine, for any such input. For any such input, is KP integral. So you start from any x and y, you construct a relation differential, you expand them at any regular point with any local coordinate, and what you get is k-pitau function. And yes, and the corollary, a system of differentials produced by the generalized topological recursion is kpinible if and only if a spherical curve is rational. So if you apply So, if you apply this very simple, very naive recipe to construct the tau function of differentials, just taking the expansion at any point. Then, to get keeping, you need to work on a genome zero spectral curve. And there are many open questions. So, yeah, so maybe I should. Yeah, so maybe I should mention some of them. So there's a question about integrability at the non-regular points. So we expect that some interesting integrable properties associated to non-regular spectral points. And there could be other integrable systems more general behind the story. So it's known that at least in some At least in some cases, one can associate multi-component hierarchies with the output of topological recursion. And we only see the one-component Kp. It would be very interesting to understand what kind of tau functions we can get from topological recursion. So we can get many of them with arbitrary x and y, arbitrary point, arbitrage. Local parameter, but we expect that all these L functions are in some sense special, they should satisfy some universal properties, and it would be nice to describe them in some abstract way. Of course, not only KP and logical recursion, there are different versions of the Recursion: There are different versions of topological recursion, and we know that some of them are associated with BKP hierarchy. It would be great to understand how the BKP hierarchy originates from the topological recursion with additional structures in the universal way, well, similar to what we have for KP. And for me, particularly it's interesting the question about what It's interesting a question about what the matrix models. As I said, the matrix models can be interpreted as a tool which describes XY swap relation in the KP integral case. And it's not quite clear if we can construct Metex models for any topological recursion, but I still I think there is hope that it can be done. The hope that it can be done. And of course, an open question is in probability for high general spectral curves. And we expect that there is a chance that our results can be generalized to high general cases and with some theta deformations. And this is work in progress with Burgichkov, Peter Dunin-Barkovsky, Martin Kazaran, and Siroj. Casarea and Sir Shadrim. So, thank you.
