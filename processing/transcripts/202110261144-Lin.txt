Perturbative quantum gravity effects are sometimes important for the purposes of very subtle quantities. And these effects, these sort of wormhole effects or maybe half wormhole effects, are on the one hand fairly universal. For example, the page curve just requires unitarity. Also, some stuff about random matrix statistics. But on the other hand, they are highly theory dependent. So, for example, in SYK, if you change the couplings a little bit, the details The couplings a little bit, the details of some of these things will change quite a bit. And so, gravity, on the one hand, sort of knows a lot. It knows about the page curve and so forth, but it also sort of knows very little. And just to be a little bit more concrete, here's sort of two examples. One is the spectral form factor, which we've all heard about a lot. Another one is the sort of more quantum noise that Douglas talks about, which involves overlaps of end-of-the-world brain state. Of end-of-the-world brain states, say an SYK or whatever. And in both cases, the details of these curves are quite sensitive to the particular couplings that we choose. Another comment I'd like to make is that we expect that this is true not just in a theory like SYK where there are random couplings, but in a theory with a fixed coupling like super Yang-Mills. And the goal of this work is also to make some comments for the latter case, not just for the SYK case. Not just for the SYK case. So stick around for that at the end. Okay, so we're going to try to make these comments a little bit more precise by asking whether the black hole interior can be reconstructed with limited knowledge of the couplings. Okay, so the idea was that somehow in gravity, the interior is very sensitive to the particular choice of couplings because of these effects. And so if we restricted somehow our knowledge of the precise values of the couplings, we might find some island or something. Find some island or something which would prevent us from doing bulk reconstruction. And in particular, we're going to try to see that the inability to do bulk reconstruction is a non-perturbative effect. So there are some perturbative effects that correspond to maybe your uncertainty about the matter theory and so forth. That's not what we're talking about. That would be relevant in some sort of crude engineering reconstruction method like HKLL. But here we're trying to talk about sort of the limits of what you can do in principle. Of what you can do in principle with bulk reconstruction. Okay. So we're going to define setup, then we're going to do some bulk QES computations, and then we're going to discuss the replica wormholes. And we're going to do this mostly in toy models, but we expect that a very similar analysis will actually hold in higher dimensions when you have a factorization problem, et cetera. And that will be discussed again at the end. But this will also have some implications for chaos. Have some implications for chaos, and there'll be some interesting relate interplay between the Los Schmidt echo and this sort of new, sort of a slightly different way of quantifying chaos than the usual out-of-time order correlators and these wormholes and so forth. And we will discuss that towards the end. So let's define the setup. So the idea is that we have some black holes which are prepared in some particular states. You know, for simplicity, we could choose the thermofield double with some temperature beta and some Lorentz. Temperature beta and some Lorentzian time evolution it. Okay, so that's our choice of the black hole state, and we usually just consider that state. But that state depends on some couplings. Okay, the couplings are J, and J could be marginal couplings, they could be the couplings in SYK, they could be even irrelevant couplings, let's say in some conformal field theory where you turn on some little irrelevant couplings. And what we're going to do is we can consider a reference system who Consider a reference system which parameterizes the particular choice of J. So, for example, if we just have one single real coupling, the reference system has a Hilbert space, which is the Hilbert space of just a particle. And the position of the particle, let's say, measures the value of the coupling. And we can simply consider an entangled state. Okay, so this is one possible way of correlating a black hole state. Microstate, a black hole state with some element of what we call the journal. The journal records the coupling. Okay, there's other possible ways, but this is one way that we can, no one forbids us from considering this entangled state. Now, if we started computing, if we trace out the journal and we compute the density matrix of the journal, sorry, if we trace out the system, the black hole system, and we compute the density matrix of the journal, we will find that matrix elements. Will find that matrix elements are given by overlaps of thermofield doubles with different values of J. Okay? So in particular, these overlaps, we're going to argue, will decay at very large times. And this journal will become roughly diagonal. But there will be some corrections which are given by wormholes, and that will be important for unitarity and so forth. A second possible way in which we could correlate the Could correlate the black hole system with a reference or with a journal is sort of just by classically correlating the states with the random couplings. So this would be relevant if, let's say, Alice prepares some black hole, she flips a coin to determine which coupling she's going to use to prepare the black hole, and then she writes down the value of the coin flips that she used to choose the value of the couplings. In this case, the density matrix of the journal is totally. In this case, the density matrix of the journal is totally boring. It's just exactly diagonal. And there's nothing really super interesting to compute in terms of the entropy of the journal. However, by purifying the second setup, so by including the environment in which, so when Alice split these coins, right, what actually happened was there's now entanglement between the environment and the joint journal system reference. And if she purifies that description, we will return again to some. We will return again to setup number one. So, actually, this sort of second choice is not really that different from the first choice. Now, let's discuss very quickly some of the entropies that we would get from these calculations. So, in either case, when we trace out the journal, the density matrix for the system will be the same. Okay, so if, but, but the interesting thing is for the quantum case, the journal union, the Journal union, the system is in a pure state. So that means that the entropy of the quantum system is the same as the entropy of the journal. Okay. And in particular, it's not so hard to see that the entropy of the system is obtained by averaging the density matrix over the couplings with the appropriate with the P of J that we mentioned in the previous slide. So it's what we could call an annealed entropy. Okay. On the other hand, if we look On the other hand, if we look at the entropy of the system conditioned on the journal in the classical case, we will get the quenched entropy. Okay, so I guess Raphael just discussed this in his last slide, but this is some operational way of talking about these two entropies, right? Some way of discussing it where you explicitly have a quantum system. These are just some trivial sort of equalities that follow from the definition of the matrix. They don't depend on any sort of gravity or anything like this. sort of gravity or anything like this. Okay, but now what we're going to do is we're going to attempt to compute the entropy of the journal using the QES formula. Okay, so to do so, that's equivalent to computing the entropy of the two quantum dots. And in particular, if we use the QES formula, we can find the entanglement wedge of the journal. Okay, so by using the QES formula, we can find the entanglement wedge of the journal. Entanglement wedge of the journal, and by complementary recovery, we can then infer what the entanglement wedge of just the two dots is when we don't have access to the journal. So we can infer what parts of the bulk we're allowed to do reconstruction with if we don't have access to the precise values of the columns. Okay, so we're just going to do a straightforward application of the QES, but there's going to be some. Of the QES, but there's going to be some subtleties because this mattered entropy term is going to be a little bit complicated. The area term is going to be totally trivial because we're going to consider a setup where we just do marginal deformations to the theory. And in that case, the stress tensor in the bulk is zero for all values of the boundary conditions. And therefore, the area term is the same as it would be in the usual setup. Okay, but in order, so the entire So, the entire action of so all the action sort of about the journal and so forth is going to be related to the matter entropy of the system. So, now we're going to discuss how to compute the matter entropy in a situation where the bulk CFT is entangled with the journal. And that means that the boundary conditions of the CFT are somehow entangled with the journal. Okay, so there are going to be three cases. One is when we consider the entire ADS region. When we consider the entire ADS region. Okay, this is the trivial surface. So this is relevant for computing the entropy of the two sort of SYK dots or the entropy of just the journal. A second possibility is when we have two dots, the same setup, but we're going to consider an island. And then the third possibility is the sort of peninsula setup. And these will be more apparent soon. Okay, to specify a little bit more about the bulk theory. Specify a little bit more about the Boch theory. We're going to choose a Boch theory which is a matter BCFT, and the boundary conditions of the BCFT are going to be labeled by the couplings. So one very simple realization is if we have a free boson in the bulk, right? And you imagine turning on some sources on your boundary theory, right? Turning on some marginal source, which changes the Dirichlet condition of this. Of this boson in the bulk. Okay, so this just follows from the standard differentiate dictionary of ADACFD. However, we're going to assume that the matter theory is exactly a free boson just for simplicity. This might be a little bit suspicious because there's a global symmetry in the book, but we're essentially going to ignore this fact. Okay, so first let's compute the First, let's compute the matter entropy of the entire ADS region. If we are interested in that computation, we're supposed to compute overlaps of the density matrix. So previously, we had a formula that said the overlaps of we take the journal density matrix and consider overlaps, you know, matrix elements, they're given by overlaps of the thermofield double with different J's. With different J's, right? Okay, so if we want to compute the Rennie entropy, that's going to involve many factors of this. And we're going to have to look at it. We're going to have to consider a set of boundary conditions as indicated here. So we have a different boundary condition here and here, here and here, and here and here. So this would be, for example, for the Rennie 3 entropy, right? And then we sum over all the indices. So we sum over the values of the bound. So we sum over the values of the boundary conditions with the measure that's given by P of J. So that's what we're instructed to do. We can, of course, this picture has a replica symmetry, which we can quotient by, and we get just a single copy. So we have a single disk now with n copies of the CFT, and we have inserted some boundary condition changing operators, which change the boundary conditions of the CFT from ij to ij plus one. To ij plus 1. Now, this is simply a two-point function which is fixed by conformal symmetry. So it must have the form that's indicated below. So all we've done, again, is we've computed the matter running entropy of a matter BCFT, not including any back reaction from Graphy. We're just doing semi-classical matter entropy computation. Computation. Okay. We're going to then continue this to n equals one, right? And try to get the matter entropy term in the QES formula. Okay. However, so the only input from the particular matter theory that we're going to need that we're going to need for this particular setup is the dimensions of the operators. However, let's, even before discussing those particular dimensions, we can make some general comments. So in particular, the two-point function, when we continue it to large Lorentzian times, Continue it to large Lorentzian times is given by a cosh, right? It's given by a cosh t, and it decays exponentially in time. This is just because the wormhole grows and so forth. And this in particular means that the off-diagonal elements of the Reni entropies are getting very, very small. And whenever that happens, you have a very dangerous situation. Because if you have many, many possible matter boundary states, you can have a situation where the entropy, the naive. The entropy, the naive bulk entropy is getting very, very large, right? So let's simply now try to evaluate it for the case of a free boson. Again, okay, so the main input that we need is the dimension of the boundary condition changing operator, which changes the boundary condition from x to x prime, right? So we were considering a problem where there's some boundary condition, let's say x, oops. X, oops, and some boundary condition X prime. And then there was some boundary condition changing operator, which changed that boundary condition. And the dimension of this operator can be calculated by first taking this picture and transforming it to a strip, right? So now you have a strip with two Dirichlet boundary conditions, one with x and one with x prime, and you're simply computing the energy of the ground state on that strip. So that's given by the simple formula. By the simple formula, and it's familiar from string theory as the mass squared of a string stretching between two D-brains. So we're thinking about now the target space interpretation of the free boson theory. Okay, furthermore, we need to specify exactly how we're going to sum over the couplings. So we need to specify a measure over the possible Dirchley conditions of the boundary. And we're going, a simple choice is just assume that it's Gaussian. Is just assume that it's Gaussian. So, in particular, we're allowing for all continuous values of the Dirchley conditions, but weighted with this Gaussian with a parameter m, which controls the width of the spread of this Dirchley condition. Okay, so now we put all the ingredients together. We have to do a bunch of Gaussian integrals. We get some formula. This Gaussian integral, of course, gives some determinant. The determinant is complicated, but you can do it in some limits. But you can do it in some limit, and then you get this formula for the entropy. So, if you haven't been following for now, you can wake up again and just remember, just look at this formula. So, this formula is the matter entropy for the entire ADS region in the situation where the matter CFT is entangled with some journal. And it tells you that the matter entropy is growing logarithmically with time. And of course, this is a problem if you go to very This is a problem if you go to very late times, because when you go to very late times, this can be bigger than the entropy of the actual black hole system. Okay, so we expect some sort of unitarity problem at very late times. And as I've said already, this is because these states were semi-classically orthogonal, or they're becoming orthogonal at very late times. Now, why are they becoming orthogonal? The reason is because we are taking a Hamiltonian, evolving it forwards in time, and then changing the Hamiltonian. Forwards in time, and then changing the Hamiltonian slightly and evolving backwards in time. Because we've changed the Hamiltonian slightly, the evolution will not exactly cancel. This is the sort of Lauschmidt echo or the scrambling effect that people have discussed previously. But the interesting thing is here, it's becoming a paradox because at very late times, you're finding a situation in which all these states are orthogonal. All these states are orthogonal, which is not allowed by unitarity. So, obviously, we're all conditioned what to expect. The thing to expect is that there is an island in this computation that should be accounted for. Okay, so now let's consider the same calculation, but for not the entire ADS, but just for an interval of ADS. So, we're computing the matter entropy, again, of a B CFT in the situation where the boundary conditions of the CFT are correlated with the journal. Are correlated with the journal. Okay, so we have a very similar diagram, except that we, in addition to the boundary condition changing operators, which are these black dots here, we also have these twist operators that we have to insert. Okay, so now this is some four-point function, and in general, we can't evaluate a matter four-point function. Okay, however, we can evaluate this, let's say, in an OPE limit or in some very special theories, okay. In some very special theories. Okay, so in the OPE limit, that would be the case in which, let's say, the twist operator gets very close to the boundary operator, the boundary condition changing operator. So on both sides, right? And this we expect to be relevant for very, very late times, in analogy to the evaporating black hole setup. Okay, so in other words, we now need to do a calculation where we have a single twist operator. Where we have a single twist operator and a boundary insertion. This is basically the so-called peninsula calculations, right? Where you have, let's say, two-sided, you have a two-sided thermofield double and a journal, and you simply think of the you simply consider the entropy of one side union with the journal, or equivalently, one side without the journal, right? The entropies of both things are equal. Okay, so let's go to that case. Again, the picture is like this. You do the quotient, you get now, it's a matter three-point function. Okay, so it's actually a two-point function in the sense of a BCFT, right? There's a there's an insertion of a single twist operator and a boundary condition changing operator, but when you double this because it's a BCFT, it's like a three-point function. Okay, so that's still fixed by conformal symmetry, and we can evaluate it precisely. And we get some pictures. I won't go through the details of the calculation, but you get some pictures where you find some. Where you find some QES. Okay, so this is some picture of the dilaton plus. So this is the picture of the dilaton plus the matter entropy. Okay, and we're supposed to minimize this and we find some minimum, let's say, right here. The different lines are different values of the matter central charge relative to the value of the dilettante on the horizon, let's say. Value of the dilaton at the horizon, let's say. So there's some dimensionless combination that appears. For example, you can adjust this by changing the temperature of the two sides or by adding warm free bosons to the theory, etc. So you find some QES at slightly, in this case, we're doing a one-sided calculation, it's slightly to the left of the horizon. And that just says that if you have a situation in which, so if you had no matter whatsoever, the QES would be exactly. Whatsoever, the QES would be exactly at the horizon. If you don't know the couplings, then you expect to be able to reconstruct a little bit less than what you would have been able to reconstruct when there was a journal, right? Because now you don't know exactly what couplings were. So your ability to do reconstruction is slightly worse. And the fact that this curve has shifted slightly to the left, the minimum curve is slightly to the left, is just reflecting that fact. Okay, so in particular, the island looks very similar. The island looks very similar to the case of the evaporating black hole, right? So, in fact, what I'm discussing now is the very late time limit where we go to an OPE and doing the CFT calculation, and you get some picture like this, where again, we're assuming we're in an OPE limit where these two points are conformally very close to each other relative to the other separations. Okay. Okay. Let me summarize slightly because Summarize slightly because there was a little bit of a technical that was getting a little bit technical. So, what we started with was a setup where we entangled a black hole with some journal. Okay, the journal recorded the precise values of the couplings of the theory that were used to prepare the black hole. We then computed the matter entropy of the sorry, we computed the entropy of the journal. When we computed the entropy of the journal, we used the bulk QES prescription. At early times, we can assume At early times, we can assume that the entanglement wedge of the journal is nothing. In that case, we just get the semi-classical matter entropy when we compute the entropy of the journal. However, as time gets larger and larger, we find that that semi-classical entropy grows. So eventually there's some island that forms, and when the island forms, the entanglement wedge of the random couplings contains the interior of the black hole. The interior of the black hole. And conversely, if we look at the entanglement wedge of the two black hole systems without knowledge of the couplings, at early times, it contains the entire ADS region, but at very late times, it contains everything up to the island. So the black hole interior is not contained anymore in the two black hole system. This is very similar to, let's say, the West Coast model or the East Coast model, if you think of the journal as somehow being a bath for the Black. Bath for the black hole system. The only thing that is slightly different is that the way in which the bath interacts with the black hole system is very subtle in our case, right? All the interaction is just mediated by the fact that the couplings are depending on the couplings of the black hole system depend on the journal. But the journal, for example, the value of the couplings in the journals are not evolving with time in any straightforward. Not evolving with time in any straightforward manner. Now we can discuss the replica wormholes that appear in the island computation. These are actually not just sort of, this is not actually sort of just the technical point, but there's some conceptually interesting features of this wormhole. So first let's consider just the disk ready to calculation. So we're computing again. So we're computing again the entropy of the journal, which is an overlap of two thermofield doubles with different values of the coupling. According to the ADS-CFT dictionary, we can evaluate the effects of the matter by just using this formula, by the differentiate formula. So we turn on some sources. This is for a free field in the bulk. And we simply choose these sources to be piecewise constant. So chi r, for example, is just turned on in this blue region. And let's say This blue region, and let's say it's exactly zero on the red region. That would be the case where the Dierschlett condition is just the standard x equals zero condition on half of the disk, and there's some non-standard Dierschlet condition on the other half of the disk. So sort of one really nice simplification is that for the case of a marginal deformation, so for the case of delta equals one, you can actually do this integral exactly without needing to go to the on-shell solution for this. To the on-shell solution for this tu. T of u is the Schwartzian mode, which specifies the shape of this cutout. So, for some general shape of the cutout, you can actually evaluate the effect of the matter. And what you find is that this integral just reduces to some local expression in the two times at which the interval, at which the source was turned on and off. So, in other words, the entire effect of changing the boundary condition is summarized by just inserting a two-point function at these two black points. The dimension of the two-point function depends on the value of the Dirichlet boundary condition. The changing, it depends on the change in the Dirchlet boundary condition relative between j and j prime. And as you can see, the dimension scales with x squared. So if you change the boundary conditions a lot, that's equivalent to inserting a very heavy operator. If you change the boundary conditions very little, If you change the boundary conditions very little, then the operator is very, very light. So, if you like, you can think of this two-point function as some sort of like domain wall, but it's not a very thin wall, it's a very thick wall. And it's basically telling you where the gradient of the field is, right? So, here, the field phi that corresponds to this source has some particular value. It then changes its profile in this sort of thick wall region, and then it asymptotically approaches J prime. asymptotically approaches J prime. Okay, so this fact, that's just a picture, but it's a picture that summarizes this equation. Okay, now we can try to find the wormhole that corresponds to this geometry. So we're going to assume now that the wormhole has a form that schematically looks like this. So here is one of the boundaries, right? So one of the boundaries has, again, some piece that is blue and some piece that's red that corresponds to the Some piece that's red, that corresponds to the different values of the coupling, one boundary. And then on the other boundary, we have the same thing, except that sort of complex conjugated. So this is relevant when you're computing the overlap, right, of beta j, beta, j prime, and then absolute value squared, right? So one of the factors is one of the boundaries, the other factor is the other boundary. And this would give you, for example, the Reni-2 entropy. This would be the relevant wormhole to compute if you were interested. Compute if you were interested in the Reni-2 entropy. Now, we can find this wormhole by sort of a similar set of tricks. So, we again, what we do is we take, we assume that the wormhole is given by some piece of the double trumpet geometry. And we can take the double trumpet, we can then unquotient the double trumpet. So, we consider all the many images of the double trumpet on the Poincaré disk, right? When we do that, that means that the sources that were turned on and just means that the sources that were turned on in just two places on the trumpet, right? In the previous image, there was just two, there was a red region and a blue region. I'm not sure, the blue region is gone here, but there's a red region on both sides. And when you unquotient it, you get a sum overall, a bunch of images, right? These are all the images of that region. Okay, so in order to evaluate the matter partition function on this geometry, you have to use the same formula, but have Use the same formula, but have a source which is periodically turned on and off. Turns out you can still do that integral and you get this expression. But the interesting thing is, in a certain OPE limit, you actually get a very simple expression, which is just a product of two-point functions. So again, what the picture is, the picture is telling you a 20-minute warning. Is when you have 20-minute warning. Cool. The picture is that you essentially have two domain walls, one on each side of the wormhole, and that supports the wormhole. Okay, so that's pretty cool because it also relates to a previous wormhole that was discussed by Douglas Stanford with a different interpretation. Now, I would like very quickly to discuss the SYK results. So you can try to analyze the SYK model at large Q. The SYK model at large Q, or you can analyze it at finite Q at and finite N by exact diagonalization. And the idea is that in computing the Renny II entropy, you should sample the overlap squares of the quantity, the overlap squares of the thermofield doubles. That's what you were instructed to do when you wanted to compute the Reni-2 entropy. But there are two ways to sample it. One is the correct way, which is you first compute the overlap squares and then Compute the overlap squares and then you do the disorder average. That's what this integral tells you to do, right? A wrong way to do the integral would be to first compute the overlaps, so this overlap here, then average, and then square the resulting quantity. That would be like a calculation in which you forbid the wormholes from appearing. So those are two numerical ways that you could do the calculation. And when you do those two ways, you see very clear plots where at early times, At early times, there's good agreement, which means that if there are wormholes, they are extremely sub-leading. But at late times, the wormholes dominate. Okay, so the gap between this orange line and the blue line is an indication that there are wormholes that are dominating. And in particular, if you didn't include the wormholes, you would rapidly violate the sort of unitarity bound. I will also say that that was a plot that we made when we changed all of the couplings, but you could ask. Changed all of the couplings, but you could ask what happens if you just changed one single coupling. So, you know, all you can imagine that you have a fixed SYK theory with fixed couplings, and you just have a single unknown coupling, and you're entangling the black hole with that single unknown reference coupling. In this case, you still end up with a very similar story, and it's true even if the coupling that you turned on is irrelevant. So you take a q equals 4 syk, you add a q prime equals 8 interaction. Q prime equals eight interaction, and you're uncertain about the exact value of that q prime equals eight interaction, you will still find an island, you will still find wormholes, et cetera. At least that is the okay. Those things were not confirmed exactly, but they're consistent with the numerics that we found. Okay, in the snake of time, I'm going to skip this. There's also a nice relation with the spectral form factor, so you can reinterpret the smooth spectral form factor as a sort of journal computation. But I would like to emphasize also now some general comments about the factorization problem. So even we studied this in JT gravity, right, where it's believed that JT gravity, even with matter, may or may not be dual to an ensemble of boundary quantum mechanics theory. With the case of no matter, of course, we know for sure, but if you add, say, some matter in the bulk, it's not so clear whether it's dual to an ensemble theory or not. To ensemble theory not, but we can always consider an analogous setup in a higher-dimensional system like n equals four super Yang-Mills, where we've varied the exact precise value of G squared, the Yang-Mills coupling constant. In such a situation, the very general comments that we made along the way still apply. In particular, there will be a unitarity problem with the black holes at very, very late times, right? As long as G squared is a continuous number, so that means its entropy can grow. So that means its entropy can grow. The entropy of the journal can, in principle, be infinite. And we expect that at very late times, the semi-classical answer will grow without bound. So this means that there must be an island in the black hole computations, at least at very late times, possibly earlier. And then in order to explain the island, you would probably have wormholes that are very similar to the ones that we just discussed, except higher dimensional versions. So instead of having some S1 where you have half of the S1 be one... Where you have half of the S1 be one value of the coupling constant and the other half some different value, you would have some torus. But morally speaking, we expect that the equations could probably still be solved and you would find wormholes. Another sort of set of questions is related to irrelevant deformations. So we showed numerics that suggested that even when you have a very tiny irrelevant coupling, say for SYK, and you turn it on with some very tiny uncertainty, if you wait around for long, Uncertainty. If you wait around for long enough times, because of the effects of chaos, this little perturbation will grow, right? And the states will become more and more orthogonal at very late times. This will again lead to a unitarity problem. And as the numerics show, it means wormholes. Now, this is quite strange because the only thing that signals the effects of an irrelevant perturbation in the book is if you go sort of very close to the black hole singularity, the irrelevant perturbations. Singularity, the irrelevant perturbations grow. So it's tempting to make some speculations about this, but I think I will leave it there. Thanks for listening. Great. Thanks for a great talk, Henry. We have some time for questions. I have a question. If you don't mind my not raising the problem. Hi. Um, hi, this is really interesting, Henry, but let me just ask a very low-browd question. Um, sort of the lowest ground way of sort of diagnosing sensitivity to like members of the ensemble is to compute some kind of variance. And is there a way of formulating what you've done as some kind of variance? I don't know, the location of the island or something like that, rather than having a problem. Something like that rather than having to think about the entanglement, you know, rather than thinking about the having a journal system. Is there maybe this was the yes. Yeah, good question. I don't have a sharp answer to your question. I do think that, so this slide is supposed to connect the spectral form factor and the fact that the spectral form factor is very wiggly with the Wiggly with the usual Reni-2 computation of the journal. So, yeah. In particular, the Reni-2 entropy is some smoothed out. So, let me just say this really quickly, which is you take the coupling constant to be the overall normalization of the Hamiltonian. So, you pretend that you're not 100% sure about how you overall formula. And then, when you go forwards and backwards in time, you don't perfectly cancel. Perfectly cancel the Lorentzian evolution because the value of the coupling changes. So then, in general, you get some spectral form factor where you smooth out, you're instructed in computing the Reni-2 entropy to smooth the spectral form factor out a little bit in Lorentzian time, right? So you take the this equation says that you take the spectral form factor, which is usually just z of beta plus it right squared, and you multiply. Square and you multiply t by let's say lambda minus lambda prime and you average over this number a little bit. So that's effectively like averaging over the time in some window. And then you get some smooth answer, right? Yes. And that's supposed to be the Rennie 2. I think that's interesting because the Renny 2, yeah, the Rennie 2 is supposed to be a smooth quantity, which it's already smoothed out, right? Whereas the spectral form factor, without doing any disorder average, factor without doing any disorder averaging is very some is very erratic sort of function so it's sort of relate i mean it's some quantity like time averaging will smooth it out yeah yes um but but is there i mean sort of into in terms of something more detailed like you know in reconstructing the interior i mean is there some way of computing a variance i don't know the position of the island or some uh you know just as a rather i mean maybe this is just my own Maybe this is just my own lowbrow way of approaching it, rather than thinking about having this whole journal system as a quantum system. Like, you know, that just, well, the toggles, you know, are somehow classical. Yes. Sorry to interrupt. I think we saw something like that in comparing the average of the second reni versus. Ready versus the second ready of the average, yes, that's like a kind of variance, exactly. Yes, yes, yes, something like, yeah, and I guess that's right. That seems like, I mean, it's not, there's something like a variance going, a variance going on. I guess the question is: is there a way of thinking about, you know, actually the interior geometry, you know, that you can see it moving around as you change? Is it the actual. Is it the actual location of the island that fluctuates, or is it the operator you use to reconstruct the interior that fluctuates? I mean, what actually depends on the choice of the boundary coupling? Yes. Yeah, that's a good question. We can partially sort of, I mean, I think all the things I'm going to say are not going to be fully satisfying, but we can, for example, say the press mail. I mean, because I'm going to give sort of The Pets map, I mean, because I'm going to give the PETS map, right? Yeah. Um, we can, for example, study a sort of PETS map, right? Where you use a PETS map with one particular choice of coupling, and then we try to apply that PETS map on a system where the coupling was slightly wrong or slightly different. And then what we see is that the PETS map succeeds if the two states, if the couplings are very close to each other, the PETS map will succeed. But if the Sure. But if the coupling is too different, then you will create this wormhole that will be analogous to what we were just discussing, right? Where you get these like a wormhole supported by these sort of thick brains. Yeah, good, good. That sort of indicates that your bulk, I mean, when you try to reconstruct, when you try to apply code that was optimized for one set of couplings on a system that wasn't the right set of couplings. Wasn't the right set of couplings, you get some mistake. Yeah, so that suggests that the PETS map has large variance or something, at least at late time or something. I think it suggests that if you compute the overlaps of some reconstructed operators, that there will be some fluctuations. Yes. And those fluctuations are somehow associated with the wormhole and the island and so forth. Okay. That's a helpful comment. This is really interesting. I have a lot of questions, but I'll step back and let somebody else. Thanks. Any other questions? Well, I guess, Steve, if you want to ask another one of yours. Yeah, all right. I hope I didn't sort of quench the discussion, but the comment you made about the singularity is interesting. Could you talk a little bit more about the way irrelevant couplings grow toward the singularity? Yes, I think, well, let me say something which I guess is not in this paper, but let's say it's in various papers. I think in one paper on one-point functions, also a little bit. Functions, also a little bit in my paper with Ying and Huan on symmetries and so forth, which is in nearly ADS2, if you turn on some irrelevant coupling, right? So you turn on some irrelevant coupling, of course it shrinks. The value of that profile shrinks towards the horizon, but it grows again towards the inner horizon. Again, towards the inner horizon. Yes. And it gets very, very big. And so it's tempting to think that the reason why the yeah, let me say something which I think is actually not correct, but let me say it anyway. It's tempting to think that the island is protecting you from seeing the region in which the irrelevant couplings are getting very big, because after all, you don't know the value of the irrelevant coupling. So it's tempting to. So it's tempting to think that those are related. I think in detail, we haven't been able to find, well, not just in detail, we haven't really been able to make a sharp connection. But it's weird that, you know, turning on a tiny little irrelevant coupling will have a dramatic effect in your bulk reconstruction. You know, in particular, you can take a very high-dimensional operator. We wouldn't even usually include it in our description of the Our description of the bulk, right? We would just totally ignore it. But somehow, if you're interested in very, very late times, this irrelevant operator will totally spoil your ability to do bulk reconstruction. So like, yeah, if you somehow made n equals four on the lattice and you weren't exactly sure about the details of the lattice, you might not be able to do a black hole reconstruction at late times. That's interesting. I would have guessed that such a That's interesting. I would have guessed that such an irrelevant coupling would not have smoothed out the spectral form factor very well. Yeah. And so it might be that the, I mean, I, because of some comments that Chenna and Malda Senner made, I mean, it's tempting to associate something about the singularity with that noise and half wormholes and so on. And so it would be interesting to understand the different places that irrelevant operators. Places that irrelevant operators do their damage. That's an interesting remark. I just, we thought about using locally relevant operators as a way of creating an ensemble, and we were scared off because there aren't that many relevant operators. You have to average over a lot of stuff to get smooth statistics at relatively early times. And there aren't enough relevant and marginal operators to do that. Relevant in marginal operators to do that, and so that's uh well, that's interesting. But okay, thanks, that that's room for thought. Okay, I think we're out of time, so let's thank Henry one more time for a good talk.
