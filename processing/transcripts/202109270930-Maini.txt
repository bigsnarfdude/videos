And Thomas for the invitation here to give this talk. And this is going to be a joint talk with Paul and Khalesa. And we're going to be talking about modeling cell migration and developmental biology. And in particular, we're going to be looking at the neural crest, cranial neural crest. Neural crest, cranial neural crest. So, to begin with, what we will do is give a little bit of a sort of introduction before we then focus in on the particular research that we've been doing together for about the last decade. Now, I must say right at the start that this will not be a polished conference type talk. Instead, it will be a talk in which It will be a talk in which we tell you how the research happened and how the interactions occurred between the two of us and our two groups as we move through the different problems. Okay, so the next slide, please. And so as I mentioned, it is a collaboration between two groups, so with Paul's group, with Rebecca McLennan, Jason, Kathy, Jess. Jason, Kathy, Jessica, and Jen. And then on the Oxford side, with my colleague Ruth Baker, and actually four generations of graduate students. So it shows you how long we've been working together. So Louise Dyson, Lina Schumacher, Raza Ginunate, and Duncan. And towards the latter part of this work, Helen Byrne's been involved in the course of provision with Duncan. With the dog. So, next slide, please. Okay, so I'll hand over to Paul. So, unmute. Yes, so thank you, Philip. And I echo Philip's sentiments to Hans and Thomas. Hans gave a great introduction to collective cell migration in the last part with dictostelium, and I've always been amazed by that. By that. And, you know, I think we know quite a bit because some of these systems of collective cell migration have been well studied when the cells themselves are more tightly packed and they have interactions and are closely knit or even attached to one another. And we'll see examples of that throughout the conference with Drosophila border cell migration, where you have a small cluster of cells that makes its way from one end of the Makes its way from one end of the Drosophila embryo towards the middle with Denise Montel's beautiful work that we'll hear later. And the zebrafish lateral line, where you have a collective population of cells that move in roughly a straight line along the flank of the zebrafish to set up the mechanosensory system. And in breast cancer, cancer example, where you have a population of cells that starts fingering out into That starts fingering out into the microenvironment. And that's been characterized very, very nicely in some beautiful drawings by Peter Friedel and Alexander, where they've shown the cluster and solid strand and strand being protrusive and with a lumen. But what has intrigued Philip and I for the last number of years is the idea that what happens to these concepts? Happens to these concepts when you have loosely connected cells that explore, but they contact one another not by broad lamellopodia touching one another, or they're not linked through cell adhesion or connections, but they contact through thin phylopodia that come together by touch. And that's exemplified in the front here, where you can see a cell that's interacting with other cells. With other cells, like Hans's beautiful movie showed us the neutrophil pushing those other cells out of the way as it went, crawling on in the embryo, a very immature extracellular matrix, but also interacting with other cell types like endothelial cells and mesoderm in this case in the early embryo. But if you look at this cell in the front, it's striking because of the number of thylopodial protrusions and thin. Phyllopodial protrusions and thin protrusions that it has. And as you go back into the stream, you can see the morphologies are quite distinct depending on spatial position. And so this has been perplexing to Philip and I. How do you start to think about the questions that Hans proposed of who is leading whom and what are the communication signals that are necessary or required for this population to move collectively? And that's really been the focus of our work. Really, been the focus of our work, and I'll turn it over to Philip to give you a background on some of the modeling. Okay, thanks. Well, should maybe could this be made a bit bigger, please, so people can see the names. Thanks, Paul. Yeah, so when I mentioned at the beginning the neural crest, and we're going to look at cranial neural crest, it's important to realize there are a number of different neural crests. And so, here's one example, which is the gut, and where you have neural You have neural crests coming out and they line the gut, and you've got a growing domain, and the cells have to come out from the neural tube. They've got to cover the whole domain. And if that doesn't happen, then it means that the mechanical properties of the gut are not correct. And the result of that is that you get The result of that is that you get this thing called Hirschprung's disease, which is manifest with like a big bloated stomach due to this enlarged colon here. And some very nice work by two theoreticians, Kerry Landman and Matt Simpson, together with the biologist Don Newgreen, analyzed this and what they realized. They realized, so we have the next slide, please, by looking at experiments where you had between chick and quail, literally doing cut and paste experiments between donor and host. Was they then did a mathematical model of this, so we have the next slide, please, which shows that it's a fissure. It's a Fischer-type model. So N1 and N2 are the two different cell types: one from host, one from donor. And here you see the domain is modeled as one-dimensional. You've got diffusion. You've then got proliferation. And then you've got the growth, growth with speed V. And then what they did by analyzing this mathematically and also numerically. And also numerically, they constructed parameter spaces in which you got proper invasion. And as a result of that, they were able to show that, in fact, this is driven by proliferation. And so, if you were going to analyze this problem from a biological point of view to try and figure out what's going on, you might think that because cells are not getting to the end of the domain. Are not getting to the end of the domain, there's something wrong with the movement, and that could be true. But you might not think that there's maybe something wrong with the proliferation. So that gives you an added target to look at. So next slide, please. I mean, this is just showing you the sort of types of phase planes they come up with where you could get really. Up with where you could get regions for full colonization and regions for partial colonization. So, this is a very nice example of where modelling and biology combined together by biologists and mathematicians working together to give a new insight into gut neural crest migration and invasion. So, next slide, please, Paul. Uh, Paul. And so, what's important to point out here is that not only does each species have different neural crests, four neural crests, between species there are differences. And so, there's been a huge amount of work by Roberto Mayor and his colleagues on looking at Xenopus. On looking at Xenopus. And in Xenopus, what you have is a sort of collection of cells, a tight group of cells that move along. And they have this idea of contact inhibition co-attraction. So the idea here is that some cells inhibit. So one group of cells inhibit another group of cells, and the other group of cells attract. And the other group of cells attracts them. So you've got that one group of cells attracts the other group of cells. That group of cells repels the first group. The first group attracts the second group. The second group repels them. And you get that movement that way. And so next slide. And that's been analyzed in a number of mathematical models, ranging from single-cell models like this, in which actually. This, in which actually details of the mechanics have been put in, and details of the cell shape have been put in, and then scenarios have been captured like what would happen if you had neither contact inhibition nor attraction, you would just get the whole thing spreading out. If you had one or other, you would get certain aspects of the invasion, but not so much. But then if you look at the rightmost figure, If you look at the rightmost figure here, when you've got both happening, you get this compact group of cells to invade. And so while this model looks at the individual cells and, like I said, looks at how the shapes change, and this goes back to again Hans's nice video of the cell shape changing, etc. This takes that into account with the mechanical model. With the mechanical model, then at a more at a higher level, so next slide, please, is work by actually a number of people who are here, you know, Kevin Painter, Alf Gersh and Jonathan Sheridan and Bloomfield. And here, the idea is to look at this in the context of density. And what you have here is you have crucial to this is this non-local. This is this non-local term, the non-local signaling, and that's coming about precisely because you've got this long contact interactions. And I'm not going to give the detail of what the G and various things are here, but what's crucial in this is that not only can this give rise to that sort of movement of invasion, it can also give rise to all sorts of patterns. To all sorts of pattern formation. So, again, the idea here that biology leads to new problems in mathematical modelling leads to new mathematical problems and therefore new insights. And of course, there have been so many people who have worked and contributed to cell movement, and many of those people are here. I've only mentioned two. Here. I've only mentioned two or three people because really, it would be impossible to mention everyone who's worked on the different areas of cell movement, cell invasion, and to mention all the different types of models that have been proposed. So I apologize for not mentioning everybody's names. But what I hope this has done is give you an idea of the different levels of modelling. So here you've got an integral differential equation model. Differential equation model, which is looking at the density, how the density evolves in the Landman-Simpson Newgreen model, it was a PDE model on a growing domain, looking at how the density evolves. And then in between was the work of Roberto Mayor and his colleagues, which actually looked at the single cell level and looked Cell level and looked at how individual cells interacted with each other and how the shapes changed. So, next slide, please. Right, so Philip talked a little bit. I'm sorry. Philip talked about the neural collective migration. And I just wanted to highlight that the significance of the neural crest in biology. There are multiple. Crest in biology. They're a multipotent cell population, meaning that they give rise to neurons and glia, melanocytes, bone, and cartilage. So they're extremely important for organogenesis in the vertebrate embryo, and they're also very highly migratory. This is a view of the head showing that there are discrete streams that are forming, that the neural crescent are arising at the dorsal neural tube, making a long distance journey to target cells. Distance journey to target sites such as the branchial arches in the head, which you'll hear us talk about. This gives rise to BA1 is the lower jaw, this is the neck, and these cells contribute to the early cardiovascular system. Now, that makes them very clinically relevant because nearly one-third of all birth defects are neural crest-related. There's over 66 different malformations that have been categorized. I'm just showing a couple of those that are. A couple of those that are facial deformations, such as cleft lip or cleft palate, that people may be familiar with. They are not huge deformations of the face, but they are significant. And currently, the way that you or physicians treat these are through a number of corrective surgeries that try repair. And so it's important for us to figure out what are. To figure out what are the signals driving these cells so that we can tell the physicians to put in tissue scaffolds or build dynamic scaffolds or stem cell-based therapies that might be able to make these repairs. Now, the neural crests are also ancestrally related to a couple of very aggressive cancer cell types, melanoma and a childhood cancer, neuroblastoma. They're both very difficult to predict and difficult to control. Predict and difficult to control. And so there is this beautiful link between cancer and development using the neural crest. And because of this ancestral relationship, it's thought that perhaps melanoma and neuroblastoma are predisposed to being more aggressive because of their early relationship as a highly migratory multipotent cell population. Now, back to Philip. Back to Philip for a description of our modeling. Okay, thanks. Paul. So, as you saw there, the domain in which these cells are moving is a curved domain, and it's also a growing domain. And of course, it's three-dimensional. So, what we did, as of course, you always do when you do a mathematical model, is try to simplify things. So, firstly, we decided that since the Decided that since the depth was about three or four cells thick, that we are going to ignore that depth. And so we're going to consider it as a two-dimensional problem. And then we're going to ignore the surface, the curvature. Okay, so those are model simplifications. So basically, now what we have is Now, what we have is a rectangle, flat rectangle. And we know Paul and his group had measured the length of the domain. And what they'd shown was that over, roughly speaking, a 24-hour period, the length went from 300 microns to, roughly speaking, 1300 microns. So, what we did was we said, right now, We did what we said right now. We'll have this rectangle, we'll have it growing in the x direction, and we had data points on the growth so we could fit the length to the curve, the growth curve provided to us by Paul. And now the question becomes: we have this growing domain, we have cells entering from one end, how can we get them to the other end? them to the other end. So that was our, and I must admit that when we started doing this, which I think was literally nine, maybe even ten years ago, I thought, well, this will probably make half a doctoral project. And we're now coming to in the middle of the fourth doctoral theoretical project on this. So it shows you how much I know. So we start off since. Since in this particular cranial neurocrest, the neural crest cells are not as proliferative as in the gut. So we're ignoring proliferation. So now you've just got diffusion and a very simple calculation with mean field, looking at mean square displacement can show you that in fact you cannot invade. You cannot invade the domain in a collective way on that time scale, just with diffusion. So it was known in the literature, and Paul knew as well, that the growth factor VEGF, and I think Paul will talk a little bit more about that later on because, again, there's links to cancer there. That VEGF is produced by the ectoderm and it is And it is something that the neurocrest cells consume as they come out of the tube. So that would set up a gradient. And this would mean that you would get a cell-induced gradient. So then our question was, could that be sufficient by giving a biased random walk to allow for invasion to occur? So what we did then was we said Then, we set up a reaction fusion PDE for the VEGF, and I'll mention a bit more about that in a few minutes when we go to the next slide. But before we do that, I want to mention that, of course, with any PDE, you need to have boundary conditions. And we don't know what the boundary condition should be. So, what we did when we started this project was we used Was we used homogeneous Driesley boundary conditions. In other words, we said, let's assume that the VEGF is zero on the lateral boundaries. And so if it's zero on the lateral boundaries, then it'll be a maximum in the center of the domain. And that means it will stop cells from leaving the corridor laterally. Corridor laterally, because the gradient will point inwards from the boundary. Now, we have no biological reason for doing that. It was purely a modeling construct. And what we will see later on in this talk, and this is what I meant when I said this was going to be a warts and all talk rather than a polished conference talk. Conference talk. Later on, we will see the role of the boundary condition and how important boundary conditions may be. So then we model the cells as discrete entities. So we have them as disks. They come into the domain. We assume that they stochastically push out philopodia in three different directions. In each of those directions, In each of those directions, they measure the concentration of VEGF, they compare that with the concentration of VEGF at the center of the disk, and then whichever position that they sampled that was larger and the largest and larger than at the center of the domain, they moved in that direction. Moved in that direction. If it wasn't larger, then they move randomly. And we had them move with a fixed speed. So, in other words, that's the simplest possible way that you could model chemotaxis for a single cell. So, we have the next slide, please. And so, this is just the equation for the chemoattractant. So, C is the VEG F. So C is the veg F. So we have it growing, and we is because the domain is just growing in the x direction, we rescale by one over length squared here. This length, this is just a curve. It's essentially a logistic curve fitting the growth curve that the experimentalists provided us. So that's the So that's the diffusion part. Then the reaction part, so we have each cell has got its center at xi, yi. And this is just a phenomenological consumption term that just says maximum consumption is the center of the cell and the consumption dies off exponentially as you move away from the center of the cell. From the center of the cell. And then we have the overlying production. And again, this is phenomenological. So chi here is a constant. All we're doing here is have a production term that is saturates. So in other words, what this would mean is if nothing else was happening, you would have the domain would just have just have a constant amount at C equals one of KO attractive. And when you formulate the model reaction diffusion equation in a growing domain then using Reynolds transport theorem or whichever way you want to do it, you end up getting this dilution term where dot means t-derivative. So that's just in there. So next. Next slide, please. So, having set up this model, we found that it didn't work. So, the verbal model of you set up a cell-induced gradient, and then you respond to that cell-induced gradient and move. It's a very beautiful and elegant verbal model. But when you actually put the mathematics in and put in And put in values or parameters that are reasonable biologically, you find that it doesn't work. So, what we have here, we have at the beginning, the domain is roughly speaking 300 microns long, and then we have it growing. So, at the start, you've got VegF everywhere, and you see the zero boundary condition giving you that blue frame. Frame. And then the cells are these little yellow dots, discs that are introduced. And that little line is a philopodian that's sensing the chemotractin. And what you can see here at the beginning as the domain starts to grow, and I didn't put a video on here because I get nervous doing videos over the internet, but Hans showed it's perfectly fine to use them. What do you consider? Them. What you can see here, so what happens here, the cells move into the domain, then when there's space available, we let another cell move in. And it looks very good at the beginning. You can see that this gradient of VEG F forms and the cells start to invade. But then notice that the VEGF is decreasing now and going to zero. And in fact, this is observed. And in fact, this is observed experimentally as well: that the veg F starts to diminish and disappear near the neural tube. So X equals 0 is the entrance from the neural tube. And then you can see as the domain goes out further, there's a few cells invading, but we're not getting the collective movement that we require. That we require, and lots of cells are at the end x equals naught, and they're just wandering around moving randomly because there's no signal for them to move to. So, this is then where we used our mathematical modeling to generate hypotheses. And what we did with the next slide, please, Paul, was we assumed then, so again, here's the old model that doesn't work, and in the Model that doesn't work. And then this new model, we made the hypothesis that there were two cell types. One was the yellow cell type that was chemotactic, and the other was the white cell type, which were followers. So these were cells that they didn't have any chemical signal to link to. So what we said was: suppose they Was suppose they stick out a philopodium and they contact a leader, then maybe they could attach to the leader and move with them. So the way we implemented that in the code was that if you grab onto a leader, then you just start moving with the velocity of that leader. And then the next cell that comes in, if it attaches to another cell, which in this case To another cell, which in this case would be a white cell follower, it will move with the velocity of the follower. And so, in that case, you can see now that you start getting these lines, these chains of cells. So, the conclusion we came from this, or the idea we came forward, which we then went back to experimental lists and said, we asked them, are all We asked them: Are all the cells of the same type here? Because our modeling is suggesting that there may be different cell types that have different properties. Is that true? So that's what we asked Paul and his colleagues. Right. And so nine years ago, the state of the art for gene profiling was laser capture micro dissection. So we went into the So we went into the tissue, we cut out the lead cells, we segregated them from the trailing cells here, and we looked at 100 different genes that were involved in cell motility and cell migration. And surprisingly, we found that there was a distinct genotype for those cells in the lead than the cells that were followers. And so that was a nice thing that we had not been concerned. Thing that we had not been considering, two different cell types. And so we came up then with the model of leaders and followers, where leaders were responding to the VEGF and communicating signals of guidance to the follower cells. Now, this led us then in a series of experiments after meeting with Philips group and asking, what are the simulations that you can potentially run and predictions that you can make with this model? Predictions that you can make with this model. And so we started to ask a series of questions. The first one being: What happens if you go ahead and ablate the follower cells? What happens to the leaders? Do they need a pressure, a population pressure from behind, which had been thought to be a potential model, is a population pressure pushing these cells to the target? If you ablate those followers, what happens? And so we went in, we labeled And so we went in, we labeled our neural crest cells, we confirmed the immigration of the leaders, and then we ablated the follower population. And what you can see in the biology is the leaders were quite happy to migrate towards the target site, but they don't migrate as a cluster, even a small population of the leader cells. They spread out along the migratory domain. And you can see that recapitulated in the model. Here's the population of cells in simulation. Here's the population of cells in simulation that have been let out. They stopped the followers from coming out, and those leaders spread out to a more of a stream migration that recapitulated the biology. So that was really very intriguing to us. So population pressure is not required for the neural crest cells, at least in the head. Now, the second experiment that we tried was asking this question about transplanting. This question about transplanting cells from one position to another, which you've seen from Don Newgreen in the chick gut. We labeled our neurocrest cells. We then let those cells come out, and then we transplanted leaders to the trailing position. We moved them back to behind. And if they are endowed by the neural tube with signals to be leaders and predestined to be leaders, one would Predestined bee leaders, one would expect that they would naturally just move past all these other follower cells and go to the target. But that's not what happened. Those cells that were in the lead transplanted back to the back, were not able to reach the target in a reasonable amount of time in development, and they intermingled with the other population. And so, in the simulations, you can see that here are the transplanted leader cells put back into the back together. Back into the back together with the microenvironment, which we did in the actual embryo, so that they have a population of whatever signals are in the microenvironment with them as neighbors. And those cells are quite happy to remain in the back. And if they haven't caught up with the leaders, then they're left behind because they're quite happy with the signals that they have there. The last experiment that we did was to ask this question. We did was to ask this question about plasticity. So we took the follower cells and we transplanted them into the lead position. If the follower cells have some distinct genotype that we found from this gene profiling to be followers, in other words, have more properties for cell adhesion and less properties for cell migration and invasion, then we would expect them to. Then we would expect them to, if they were transplanted into the lead, just to remain there. So we took our trailing cells, put them into the lead position, and were very surprised to see that they were invasive. They were able to reach the target. And also, after a short amount of time, about four to six hours, after we profiled these cells, they showed all the upregulation of the genes characteristic of a leader cell. A leader cell. So that was a surprising result to us. So it turns out the model simulations do not agree with the experimental results there, because when you take transplanted trailing cells and you put them into a lead position here, in the model, remember that they are responding to only the leaders. And so they keep looking for leaders, but they don't find any. And so they remain just in that local position there. Just in that local position there. And you get the other cells moving out. These cells are not responding to the VEGF, and so they just stay there and remain in that position. So this caused us to pause and reflect and think about how can we potentially revise the model to agree with the experimental results. So I'll let Philip tell you about that part. Okay, thanks, Paul. So one thing to point out when Paul mentioned about how when we decided to do these. We decided to do these experiments was that we would meet up first of all. And as Paul said, he would find out from us what experiments we could do on the computer and then try to figure out which one of those he could replicate in the lab. And then actually, we would not meet with each other because, after all, we're separated by the Atlantic, and we didn't want to influence each. Influence each other. So we would meet six months, 12 months later when all the experiments were done, and then we'd present them to each other. And so basically we were following this, which is over in the UK, is called virtuous circle or cycle sometimes. The hypothesis generate hypotheses, making predictions, testing them experimentally, and then refining the And then refining the hypotheses and making predictions. And in my opinion, sometimes we can learn more when the model is wrong. Because, for example, the verbal model of the VEGF being the chemoattractant and you only need one cell type, that turned out not to fit the data. And so that suggested that there must be cells of different type. And we learned from that. And we learned from that. And now, this particular experiment here, where we had hard-coded the leader type and the follower type into the mathematical model, and that didn't give the result that agreed with the experiment that Paul just mentioned. Suggests, then, as Paul says, that there's a plasticity that cells can switch phenotype. So, next slide. Slide. So then what we did was we decided to examine this switching. And next slide, please, Paul. And then this was with, Supaul, you maybe want to describe this. Yeah. Right. So the question then is, if the follower cells are not necessarily listening to VEGF, but they're listening to leaders, can they respond to VEGF? Can they respond to VEGF if presented with an ectopic source of that signal? And so we waited for the lead cells to come out, and then we presented VEGF to the follower cells just adjacent to the neural crest stream. And we were able to show that we could get a number of cells divert off the main trajectory, the main stereotypical migratory pathway, and coalesce around the VEGF source, suggesting that our Suggesting that our previous transplantation of the follower cells to and their ability to read out the guidance signal was accurate, that these cells were plastic enough to read out an ectopic source of VEGF and respond. We also then, on the suggestion of Philip and colleagues, place the VEGF directly in the migratory stream. Now, these are cost cells, they are secreting VEGF. They are secreting VEGF. It's not a bead to impede the flow of the cells, but it's a loose collection of cells that are secreting VEGF. And what you'll notice is that the leaders are quite happy to continue moving on, but the follower cells are coalescing around that source of VEGF. And that acts to break the stream and break the collective migration. And so that's really neat. The follower cells can respond to an ectopic source such as Vegal. An ectopic source such as VEGF, and perhaps another signal, another chemical signal. So they are able to respond and not just responding to perhaps lead cells. It's found for more investigation. So that led us back to the modeling. Okay, thanks. And so now, this is now, you can see, first of all, This is now, you can see, first of all, if you look at the simulation, so a new graduate student, Linus Schumacher, did these. So there's a new color scheme. So now the yellow or the sort of orange cells are the leaders and the purple cells are the followers. And I'm sorry, I don't know why the colour scheme changed, but also we changed the boundary conditions. And I told you before, we don't know what the boundary conditions are. Boundary conditions are. So now what we have is simply zero flux boundary conditions. So zero flux boundary conditions for VegF and zero flux boundary conditions for the cells. And what you can see here, and in fact, Paul's just showing the results again on the left-hand side. And in fact, you don't really need a mathematical model to figure out what the results are going to be here when you start putting the VEGF. When you start putting the VEGF source, and what we did was we simply put a rule on the cells that the follower cells, if they are in an area where there is a certain amount of VGF above a certain threshold, they then become leaders. So then they'll move up the gradient. And so what you see happening is that you end up getting these two clusters forming, which is what you would expect to happen. Which is what you would expect to happen, and which is what happened experimentally. And then the next thing that Paul asked us was given are that we have this plasticity where leaders can become followers, followers can become leaders. The question arose, Paul asked us, how many leaders are necessary? Now, with this level of Now, with this level of mathematical model, we can't answer that question because that question, the answer to that question, really depends on the parameter values. And we simply do not have the data or the sophisticated model in which we could have accurate values of parameters to put in, to come out with an answer to this question. With an answer to this question, but we can give a qualitative answer: namely, what would happen if you increase the number of leaders or you decrease the number of leaders? And this is what we did in this paper here. So what we did here, you can see here that as you move down on the left-hand side, the number of fraction of leaders is increasing. Is increasing, and you can see that by there being more purple, sorry, by there being more orange and less purple. And what you can see here, and then a sort of more statistical analysis done on the right-hand side, is that what we find here is that if we increase the number of leaders, we still get invasion. They all invade, to roughly speaking, the same point, but the number Same point, but the number of cells that invade decreases. And you can see that by looking on the left-hand side, by the fact that the pictures are becoming less dense. There's more space in there. And on the right-hand side, you can see by the numbers. So the prediction that this made is that if you were to increase the number of leaders, you Of leaders, you would still get invasion, but fewer cells would invade, so it would be less efficient. So, too many leaders isn't good. So, that really caused us to pause for a bit and ask this question, if we can go in and now, with the more sophisticated gene profiling methods, look closer at the lead cells within the group of the population. Within the group of the population, are all those cells expressing the same genes? Do they have a similar transcriptional signature? Is it molecular heterogeneities from cell to cell? And so we used an approach called single-cell RNA-seq. We isolated the leaders from the follower cells by glass needle going into the embryo and separating those cells and then fact-sorting those cells or using a flow. In fact, sorting those cells or using a flow cytometer to separate the fluorescently labeled cells. And what we found was that there was a unique transcriptional signature. Now, instead of looking at a thousand genes, we were able to look at a little bit less than 10,000 genes. About 1,000 of those genes were upregulated in the lead population that are here in the red. And we're just naming a few of those genes. And about 400 of those genes were down-regulated in the lead. Those genes were down-regulated in the leaders. And so we had a much more sophisticated gene profile of those lead cells. We've since that time gone in to use an approach where you don't need to isolate the cell populations from the embryo. You can cut out the entire tissue and then try to use the information that you have from a previous single cell analysis or even going back to our laser microdissector. Even going back to our laser micro dissection as information to define the different cell types that you have by cutting out the entire migratory route of the neural crest cells here in the head. And so now instead of looking at a single stream here going to the neck, we're looking at all four of the streams in the head to the heart region. They're called branchial arches one to four, if you remember. And what we found surprisingly is that there is a conservation. Is that there is a conservation of a subset of these genes that were enhanced here in all four of the streams? So that increases its impact, significance, that all of these streams have a conservation of this leader, neural crest signature. Here are their followers, quite distinct in the map here. And I'm showing you a couple of those genes like RBM38, Kazald, and UNRSN, where you can see. And NRSN, where you can see a very nice tight segregation of that expression here to the lead population. And so we can go back and have gone back with a number of these genes to look by using multiplexed fluorescence and C2 hybridizations to confirm their expression within the leader population. But this gives us an idea that there is a conserved transcriptional signature of the leaders. It's quite rich, and it's conserved in all four. And it's conserved in all four of the branchial arch streams, which is quite exciting. So, the question is: what's the functional significance of these leader neural crest genes? Now that we have a subset of the 900 genes, you can imagine that it's going to be difficult and challenging to go through all of those, but we're trying to characterize them first by validating their expression profiles. But I'm just going to show you evidence that there is a functional relevance to these genes. Relevance to these genes. This gene, for example, Aquaporin1, is enhanced in the lead population. You can see that if we look at count the transcripts, the RNA expression, it's higher within those lead cells than it is in the followers. Aquaporin-1 is a water channel protein. It allows water transport through the cell. And it turns out that if you knock down aquaporin 1 expression, it reduces. Expression, it reduces the distance migrated. You can see here the cells in the control knockdown here, it's called a morpholino to target that specific aquaporin I gene. You can see that's where the cells are getting to. But if you knock down aquaporin I function in all of the migrating neural crest cells, not just the leaders, they only get a certain distance from the exit point. And so that's quite exciting that if you knock down aquaporin one function, knock down aquaporin one function, it impedes their distance migrated. Now, this was recapitulated by Philip and his group now. And Philip, do you want to just mention what you and Rasa started to do with modeling now at a different scale? Okay, thanks. So before doing that, I just want to mention that in that slide where Paul showed about the genetic sort of Sort of gene analysis and how you compare that. I mean, this links very much to that lovely introduction that Hans gave. So, as well as looking at some aspects of these genes, this now gives you a sense of the multi-scale nature of this problem in terms of then how are these genes interacting and then how is that leading? And then, how is that leading to the sort of function that we're seeing? So, it's very much stressing what Hans said: the multi-scale nature of this problem. And so, this is work then done with the third generation of graduate student, Raza, who literally will be graduating, getting her degree on Friday. And Raza, this has worked with Paul and Raza. Paul and Ruth Baker and myself. So, what she did was look at a number of key features that appear to be regulated by Aquaporin One. So, these are cell speed and also the effect it has on the philopodia. So, remember, I told you that in our model to begin with, we had the cell sort of send out three philipodia. Three philopodia, and then depending on what information they got from that, do something. So, then what we did was we asked the question: well, what would happen if, for example, it only sent out two philopodia? Or what would happen if when it sent out a philopodium and started to move in that direction, that that philopodium didn't retract so that it stabilized. So that it stabilized, so they went for a longer period of time in that direction. So she analyzed a lot of this. I'm not going to show you all the simulations that she did, did a lot of simulations, but what came out of that was that it was, first of all, this stabilization, this sort of going in one direction that was the key thing. That was the key thing, and part of that going in one direction is the creation of a tunnel. And so, the idea here was that the leader cells were actually boring a hole through the matrix and the surrounding cells. And that not only meant that the leaders could move more efficiently, but it also meant that the followers who were looking around trying to follow. Looking around, trying to follow, if they suddenly got into this hole tunnel, it's easier for them to move. So that's what came out of one aspect of her study, one of her chapters of her thesis. And that stimulated us to look at a different scale now, a faster time scale, so that we could measure the phylopodia dynamics within cells. So we started to look. So we started to look then by using spinning disk microscopy where we could capture now not at a five-minute interval that we typically look at for migrating neural crest cells, but now at 30-second intervals. And so Kathy McKinney was looking at the phylopodia dynamics. And in knockdown of aquaporin I function, you can see that they're significantly affected and also in overexpression of the phylopode aquaporin one. And what Kathy found was when you overexpress And what Kathy found was when you overexpress aquaporin I, that you get a longer survival or a stabilization of the phylopodium and recapitulating that enhanced expression of aquaporin-1 in the lead cells. Now that caused us to then look and think about Philips' simulation results that suggested that there was a tunnel forming, but how could this be in the tissue? Remember, there's an ECM, even though it's immature. ECM, even though it's immature, it's still there, and mesodermal cells. So, when we overexpressed aquaporin I and looked at phosphorylated FAC or focal adhesive kinase to see whether the cells were increasing their attachment to the matrix, we found that they were increasing their attachment. You can see the number of puncta of phosphorylated FAC is increasing versus the control. And when we used a gel that was fluorescently labeled, we could see that if we overexpressed aquaporin one, Aquaporin one, the cells were really chewing up that gel or that simulated ECM, suggesting that they're degrading the local matrix and increasing their attachment when aquaporin I was enhanced. And so this really gave us an idea that aquaporin I is functioning as an invasive property of the cell to get through the lead position there. And what we think is going up. And what we think is going on then is aquaporin1 is stabilizing that leader neural crest cell phylopodia, resulting in the invasion. So remember that it has to move through a loosely connected mesoderm and extracellular matrix. What we think is going on is the aquaporin-1 is responding to recruit the water channel proteins to initiate the phylopodium, then stabilize it, which was from our time-lapse data. That's increasing. Lapse data that's increasing the attachment and the degradation of the local matrix to then push that cell, or at least get that cell to create a small or a large enough hole to get the rest of the cytoskeletal machinery in there and that cell to move forward. Now, the mechanics of that would be beautiful to measure in vivo, but very challenging. So, this is where we're at, at least right now, is showing that aquaporin-1 is functionally relevant to the leader neural crest cells and may represent an And may represent an interesting target for both the development of a potential gene that might be involved in the invasion process, but also it turns out Aquaporin 1 has been shown enhanced in a number of invasive cancers. And we'll talk about that a little bit at the end. So maybe we could take a break there, Paul, maybe, because I'm just wary of the time because we started a bit early too. People have questions. People have questions or something, or should we go on? I mean, it's up to Hans and Thomas. Well, I haven't gotten any questions yet, but as you know, I always have some. So, see, Philip is already blushing. Can I ask one question? Maybe you'll come to this, but at the end of the day, End of the day, what really identifies a leader cell? I mean, you've shown the gene profiles, etc., but what is it that triggers expression of this at the outset when they're leaving the neural crest? Is there some signal that they come with that makes them leaders or because they're very plastic? Right, so it's the microenvironment that's. Right, so it's the microenvironment that drives it. So, if you look at the pre-migratory neural crest cells and cells that have just emerged from the dorsal neural tube and you compare their gene expression profile, it's very distinct. These cells that are in the neural tube and just getting ready to leave or just have left have high expression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition markers. These cells that are a little bit downrange of them have a much more higher profiles of cell micro. Higher profiles of cell motility genes and cell migration, and quite a bit of difference. So it turns out that if you take these neural crest cells, pre-migratory neural crest cells out of the chick embryo or out of the neural tube prior to their migration and you put them in a dish and you look at the leaders versus the followers in the dish after they've moved, you cannot see a difference in the leader to follower. Difference in the leader to follower gene expression profile. But if you add in ectopic VEGF, you can recover a portion of that leader profile. So it looks like it's completely driven by the microenvironment and not predetermined from signals in the neural tube. Okay, good. Are there other questions? Thomas, did you say you had one? Yeah, I wanted to ask a question. Just clarify this tunnel formation about the This tunnel formation about the size scale. So, are you talking about tunnels where the philipodia can just get through, or bigger things where the entire cell, including nucleus and so on, can go through? Right. So, I think it's initially that the space is such that we don't see any actin cytoskeleton machinery in this thin phylopodium. It looks to be completely driven by osmotic pressure. Osmotic pressure and these water channels being recruited locally. This thin phylopodium is about one to two microns across and can stretch up to 30 or 40 microns. But that degradation that you're seeing now is really interesting, is that it's degrading the matrix. And so we think what's happening, it's creating a larger gap for that cell to squeeze through. Okay, are there other questions or comments? I mean, people in the audience should feel free to ask them because frequently this leads to some clarification that seems obvious to the speakers, but not to the audience. Since we are a little bit ahead of time, We are a little bit ahead of time. We could take a five-minute break here if you wish. I mean, it's up to you two, Paul and Philip. Do you want to continue directly or do you want a five-minute break and then we rejoin? Don't mind either way. Yeah, I'm happy to press on because I think a lot of the fun stuff is coming up. Okay, well then let's carry on. Okay. So So it's actually very timely because Hans mentioned that he always asks questions, and this is exactly what happened here. So I think it was 2017 or maybe 2018, Paul and I visited Hans in Minnesota. And what Hans said to us was that, well, you have your domain growth and you measure the And you measure the size of the domain, and then you measure it at different time points, and you get the sort of logistic curve and all this sort of thing. You're implicitly assuming that the growth is spatially uniform. And is that true? And that's part of this paper here. That's the only thing that we can do. That caused us to pause. You know, we came back from that meeting thinking, wow, there were a lot of questions that Hans asked that we didn't simply know the answer to. So we went back to the literature. Turns out that back in the late 90s, Sarah Guthrie and colleagues had labeled the mesodermal cells, not the neural crest, by making a transplant of quail tissue into the chick that had been pioneered by Nicole Ledoren. Pioneered by Nicole Le Doren because the quail nuclei have a way to distinguish them. And so they transplanted the cranial paraxial mesoderm, it just means the mesoderm adjacent to the neural tube, and let that egg reincubate. And what they found was that the transplanted cells of the mesoderm, now, not the neural crest, were able to reach the target site here in the lower jaw, the branchial arch 1. Branchial arch I. And the same with the cells in branchial arch II. That meant that the migratory pathway of which the neural crest wells were on was actually moving. But they didn't have a way to visualize those cells in time and look to see what those measurements were or look to see what the dynamics were. So that became possible within the last couple of years because of the generation of transgenic quail by Transgenic quail by Rusty Lansford's group at Caltech with Scott Frazier at the time. And we took advantage of that transgenic quail, which had every cell in the quail embryo that was fluorescently marked. We could then come in and separately label the neural crest cells. So we could follow the neural crest cells with every other cell, including the mesoderm in the embryo. And what we found was that time-lapse imaging confirmed Sarah Guthrie's results. And Sarah Guthrie's results that the mesoderm was, in fact, moving and it was migrating with a direction and a speed, but the neural crest cells were moving faster and straighter than the mesoderm was moving. So the mesoderm is on the move. And the question then becomes, if you look at proliferation, what about proliferation of these mesodermal cells proliferating as they're migrating? As they're migrating, and what's the tissue density? So that if there is proliferation, is the cell density constant or not? That would imply if the cell density is constant, there's a tissue growth expansion. And what Kathy did then, Kathy McKinney, who had done the time-lapse experiments, did was go in and label by BRDU labeling proliferating cells. She then segmented the Segmented the number of images she collected so she could highlight the BRDU positive cells in the mesoderm and ectoderm and then map them to the first or second branchial arches. And so down here, she's showing you the schematic of regions within the mesoderm that are higher in proliferation and lower or and/or have the proximity of cells or the cell density in orange. And what Kathy is showing that initially. And what Kathy is showing that initially this migratory domain of 300 microns is actually has higher proliferation that is becoming localized to the distal tip of the tissue where the eventual branchial arch is going to really mature and come together to form part of the face. And in green are the neural crest cells. So you have initially, you have more or less a uniform growth that is then. That is then becomes heterogeneous on that domain to the front. You can see that still expanding at this timeframe as the neurocrystals are moving. There's a lot less growth of the tissue or proliferation behind them. And then when the cells are reaching the target and invading and colonizing the first branchial arch, you can see it becomes more uniform through there. So the cells are chasing a moving boundary that is proliferating. That is proliferating and expanding by tissue growth expansion. And so, then this led Raza to do some experiments of just looking at different growth profiles. And so, the idea here, if you look on the left-hand side, the different colours, these are just one-thirds. So, well, first of all, you've got uniform growth and then form growth and then here we have the leader follower model and you get the growth that's just the sort of standard model and then what we have here is for example that the distal third grows more than the the other part of the domain or the distal two-thirds has got enhanced growth. Got enhanced growth, etc. Or sorry, distal half or distal two-thirds. And then we did it the other way around, where let's assume that the domain behind the cells grows. And again, by going one-third, a half, two-thirds, etc. And then we looked at the sort of invasions. And one thing we saw here was that, in fact, the ability of the cells to invade. Ability of the cells to invade in terms of their sort of structure and coherence doesn't really change that much, apart from down here, although we haven't analyzed this in a lot of detail, and that still needs to be done. But what it looks like is that it's having some effect, but what sort of surprised us was that these different digital growth profiles don't really result in very much. Really result in very much difference. And the proximal growth profiles don't really involve result in very much difference. There is a difference between the two, but we haven't really explored this. I mean, this is one of the problems we need to look at in more detail, explore this in more detail. And another aspect of this, which I don't know if Paul's going to touch on, is the fact that we think that. Is the fact that we think that the neurocrest cells themselves might be stimulating the mesodermal cells to divide. So that it's not simply the case of imposing a growth profile on the system, it's actually an interactive thing that's happening. And this is just showing taking And this is just showing, taking the distances traveled. And so you can sort of see here, in terms of density and distances traveled, there's not that much difference. But the one thing that we haven't explored in detail that we need to explore is although from just looking at the simulations, it doesn't look like there's much difference in. Look like there's much difference in the coherence or the connectivity of the movement. We still need to analyse that, put some special statistics on that, and we haven't done that yet. Okay, so now we come to the boundary conditions, and I've kept telling you that we don't really know what the boundary conditions are. Okay, so what we've Okay, so what we've done in this case, so all the simulations I've shown so far have shown the whole corridor between Rombomir 4 and Bankille Arch 2. So now what we're doing is we're saying, well, actually, the domain is larger than that whole corridor. I mean, there's Rombomir here, 3, Rhombomere 5, etc., etc. And so what should the boundary conditions be between? Conditions be between those two. So, what we did here, so this is the thing that we've been looking at, where in part A here, there's an inhibitory boundary along the whole stream. So, in other words, there's a zero flux boundary condition. And then we asked the question, what would happen if, in fact, there's no inhibitory boundary? So, these are becoming internal boundaries now because we're looking at larger domains. We're looking at a larger domain, we're now looking at internal boundary conditions. And so the problem that we've looked at up until now has been problem A, where the boundary condition is essentially zero flux. So now we ask the question, what would happen if there was no boundary condition? So cells can do what they want to do. And then what would happen if there was a partial boundary condition? So inhibitory boundary condition. Condition, so inhibitory boundary condition for a certain length, and then no internal boundary condition after that. And so, in order then to analyse the cell behaviours that we would get out of that, what we did, so next slide please, Paul, was again very simply, we thought we will break the domain up into three regions. So, this is region one. So, this is region one. So, if all the cells remain in this region, it means all the cells have stayed in the corridor we want them to stay in. And then this is region two. So, what we see here happening is some of the cells have moved out of the corridor, but it's still not too bad. And then this is the third region where the cells are just everywhere. Where the cells are just everywhere. So that's why we defined our sort of spatial spread of the cells laterally as they're moving along. So next slide. And then so what RASA did, and again, the results are to some extent as you would expect. Here's the these are the simulations essentially we did before, fully constrained. Before fully constrained boundary, get a nice invasion. Here's where you don't have any boundary condition for the cells, and so they do spread out a bit, although a fair number of them can still grow, can still go. But clearly, this is not what you see experimentally. And then now, by looking at different aspects of the partial. Of the partial inhibitory boundary condition. You can see here that we're getting a reasonable amount of coherence. The cells are moving a little bit outside the confined region, but not much really. So, what we can do then is we can vary the confinement region and basically analyse these results. So, next slide, please. Slide, please. And so here's what we did. So here is if the length of the internal confinement boundary as it changes. So whether it's 100 or 200 or 300, etc. And these blue means here they're all in the confined region. So for example, if the length of the internal confinement boundary The length of the internal confinement boundary is 1,000 microns, which means it's all confined, then they all invade. If the length is a little bit, if there's no boundary condition, then you see there's a bit of movement out of the domain. And now I see that what I've done is I've mislabeled this. Done is: I've mislabeled this. This should be for having tunneling and chain migration, and B should be just for chain migration. And what you can see here is that it's at certain levels of confinement that you see a change happening. And you can see it particularly here. Particularly here. I mean, this is the fraction of follower cells not in the chain. And what you can see is that if there's no boundary condition, a large fraction of followers are not in the chain, which basically means the whole thing is disintegrating. It's not proper invasion. And you see that average holds until you get to about 500. To about 500, and then it suddenly jumps to zero. And in the other model, in the tunnelling model, we see the same thing happens until, again, roughly speaking, three or four hundred, and then it suddenly drops. So it's not really a monotonic decrease, it's more like a phase transition, which is sort of suggesting. Sort of suggesting that, regardless of the model we use, chain migration or tunneling plus chain migration, and I apologize for getting these the wrong way around, but as you can see, it doesn't really matter. What this is telling us is that in order to confine the cells, we need a partial internal boundary of maybe of the order of 400 microns. 400 microns. That's a prediction of the model. So, this caused us to think about this because the neural tube signals control the neural crest cell exit locations. That's quite a bit of work over the last couple of decades have been able to flush out what those molecules are that are restricting cells from exiting from these. From exiting from these odd-numbered ROMeres, such as R1 and R3 and R5, it's actually signals in the neural tube controlling their exit locations. And some of these signals are secreted, so they can be secreted into the very local microenvironment, say within 100 microns of the distance from the exit point. So, those factors, such as ERB B4, you can see if you knock that down. You can see if you knock that down in the mouse, the cells take a wrong turn. They can exit in the anterior or the posterior position and cause a chain across those two discrete streams. But they don't have a widespread invasion of that neural crest cell free zone out here more laterally. It occurs near the neural tube because you've actually inhibited the signals that control that local decision. That local decision or the ability of the cells to make a right or left turn. Now, Roberto Mayor's group in the last few years has looked at another molecule called Versican in Xenopus. You can see its expression is very distal to where the neural crest cells emerging from the neural tube, much more distal towards actually the target site near the branchial arches. And its expression is in between the migratory streams here and reverberate. Migratory streams here. And Roberto has very nicely shown that it can inhibit the streams from mixing, but much later on. So we were wondering then, what are the signals that are closer to the neural tube, but out of the area of the influence of a secreted signal from the neural tube? So we profiled the tissue in the neural crest exclusion zone here adjacent to Ramomir 3, compared it to the migrating neural crest cells, and we came Neural crest cells. And we came up with about 50 different potential inhibitory factors that were either secreted or membrane bound. And I'm going to show you some evidence for a couple of those. One of them is Colect12. It's a member of the Colectin family. It's a secreted factor in the mesodermal tissue now, not from the neural tube. And it turns out that its expression is very restricted. You can see it in white blue here, very restricted. See it in light blue here, very restricted to the region adjacent to Ramamir 3 here, and for some distance, but not all the way to the branchial arches. And the yellow are the neural crest streams here. Here's the stream going to the second branchial arch. Neural crest cells avoid collect 12 protein on stripes. You can see them forming nice collective migration through the channels here. And then when you go ahead and knock down collect 12, either individually or Either individually or with another of the candidates trail. You can see that now the neural crest cells are moving out, but they are invading this area adjacent to the neural tube, but downstream from right adjacent to the neural tube exit point. But they're more into this mesodermal area that's a little bit farther downrange and they're starting to become or be able to invade. So we think that some of these factors may be stronger than others. May be stronger than others, but it gives us an idea or some candidates to now test that perhaps we only need this confinement within the first four to 500 microns from the neural tube. And as long as the chemotactic signals are strong enough and the communication between leaders and followers are strong enough, that this can persist all the way to the target site or within range of the target site. So that So that makes us think that the communication now is very important between leaders and followers. We can have local inhibitory signals that shape the exit points of the neurocress cells and their initial segregation from the other streams. But this communication between leaders and followers is very important. And so this has been very exciting the last year or two working with Philips Group. And so Working with Philips group, and so what I'd like to share is some thoughts about that. So, what's the evidence, the biological evidence in the Neural Crest, that followers really need to communicate with leaders? Well, we've talked about VEGF. It turns out if you knock down VEGF after the leaders have gone through, the followers don't care about VEGF. And you remember, I showed ectopic sources of VEGF placed adjacent to followers will make them divert. Make them divert, but they're not listening to VEGF. They don't have the expression of VEGF receptors. So it's clear that they're not tuned in to VEGF. So they need some other communication signals. So we've visualized communication by touch, where a cell that's a follower cell here in pink will contact a leader. It will retract that phylopodium and then move in the direction of that contact. So communication through contact with. Communication through contact with the leader cell. We also have published evidence of a secreted factor, angiopuetin 2, which is a common factor in the cancer community. Angiopuetin 2 for endothelial cells loosens their junctions and allows them to respond to VEGF or a different growth factor. It's expressed by the lead neural crest cells. It's a secreted factor. It's then deposited and sequestered into the microenvironment. And it is sequestered into the microenvironment. And you can see its protein expression here along the migratory pathway. It turns out when you knock down angiopleetin 2 production by the lead cells, the follower cells change their behaviors very dramatically. Instead of having a directed movement plus some diffusion, they change their behaviors to become much more of a directed motion, meaning that they're not extremely. Motion, meaning that they're not exchanging neighbor positions with the local others and exchanging positions with the leaders. So we think that's important because some of the leaders may invade, others may take their time in back of another's, but that there may be a switching of one leader to another to get through a particular, to create a particular channel or a tunnel. And so you'd want to exchange your neighbor relationships. And so angiopuetin II seems to stimulate the chemokinetic behavior. Stimulate the chemokinetic behavior of those follower cells. Now, more recently, we've been intrigued by fibrinectin. Its expression is very enhanced by the lead cells. And I go back to these experiments by Rovasio and Champal Thierry back in the 80s. They were looking at fibrinectin and neural crest cells in vitro. And what they saw was that if they had fibronectin in the actual two-dimensional microenvironment, they saw differences in. They saw differences in the fibrinectin depending on whether or not the neural crest cells had interacted with that fibrinectin that they had placed into the extracellular milieu. And so you can see here their pictures of B and C are showing a fibrous network of fibrinectin, very dense, seems to be unorganized. But as the lead cells encounter that fibronectin, you can see That fibrinectin, you can see what they're doing is they're starting to align the fibrinectin as the lead cells move through. And they postulated back in the 80s that this was providing then an alignment of the fibrinectin for the follower cells to then move along and move forward. And that was a means of communication between the leaders and followers, was a creation or a Creation or a remodeling of the extracellular matrix microenvironment. So we became interested in looking in vivo now with our modern tools. And it looks like that in the early embryo and along the neural crest migratory pathway, that the fibrinectin is not a dense fibrous network. It's actually very punctate. And if you look at ahead of the neural crest, Look at ahead of the neural crest cell migratory front, where you can see the mesodermal cells sprinkled here in blue and the fibronectin in green. It's very punctate in its distribution. So ahead of the leaders, marked here in red, are the neural crest, but behind those leaders and amongst them, you can see that the fibrinectin is starting to become assembled into a fiber. And so this made us hypothesize. Made us hypothesize that perhaps the neural crest cells are, the lead neural crest cells are encountering punctate fibrinectin. They are adding to that fibrinectin by secreting more fibrinectin, and also they are remodeling that or assembling that such that follower cells can respond to that. Now, we've had a couple of sledgehammer approaches to looking at this. One is to either knock down fibernectin production. Fibronectin production by the neural crest cells, and then measure the distance migrated. And we can see that if we knock down fibrinectin, we get a significant reduction in the distance migrated here and on the left-hand side. Or if we inject, microinject exogenous fibrinectin into the microenvironment, we can dramatically slow down the neural crest cells and reduce their migration. Migration. But this doesn't look at the cell-fibernectin interactions. And this is again now we'll return to Philip and his group to look more closely at that different scale to give us some ideas of what we really need to pursue in terms of fibernectin and its distributions in the microenvironment and to test this hypothesis that it's being assembled. And what are the parameters that we might need to measure? We might need to measure in terms of its assembly and the fibrous nature of the fibrinectin. Okay, Paul. So then, and this is work now with graduate student generation number four. So that's Duncan Martinson. And actually, most of Duncan's thesis is actually on collective movement in angiogenesis. And the last part of his thesis, in collaboration with Helen Byrne. Collaboration with Helen Byrne and Ruth Baker is addressing this problem that Paul mentioned along with, we've had a lot of nice interactions with Lance Davidson. And the idea here then is he's included, well, there's four things here. He's included three of them. We haven't done chemo taxes yet. What he's done is have volumes. Volume exclusion put in there through cell cell contact inhibition of cells, and then have haptotaxes and contact guidance. And basically, what Duncan has done is take the puncta fibrodectin puncta, populate the domain with the fibrodectin puncta, use those almost as like Gaussian sources. In sources, and then sum them all up to present a sort of continuous fibronectin signaling domain, and then put in different rules about how cells move up those gradients, and how they could secrete more fibronectin, and how they might align the fibonectin. Align the fibrinectin, very much following along the lines of the work actually that John Dallin, Jonathan Sherritt, and I did a long time ago when we were looking at collagen alignment, flux-induced alignment, and wound healing. And then by putting all these things together, so going on to the next slide, and studied the effects of all these. And I'm not going to go into the details partly because he's Partly because he's writing this up as we speak for his thesis, and also because I knew that by this stage we're all getting very tired. But if we go to the next one, we can show a typical sort of simulation here. And here we see at the beginning, so A, so the black cells are leaders and the Leaders and the red cells are followers. So, another change of colour for leaders and followers. And the idea here is that we have the leaders are the ones that are sensing the puncta as they move along. And then it's a non-growing domain. And then we can either have them realign the matrix or not. That realign the matrix or not realign the matrix, produce more fibronectin, or not produce more fibronectin. And there's no internal boundary condition. So you can see here a very nice simulation as you go from A to B, C to D, where without any internal boundary condition, we get perfect invasion, which is fantastic. Which is fantastic. But remember, these are rule-based models, so there's a lot of stochasticity. And this is one simulation. So if we go to the next slide, please. So here's another simulation with all the parameters of the same. And what you can see here happening is that you're getting a divergence. You're splitting it into. You're splitting it into two. So, this would be a case where we would need an internal boundary condition. So, what Duncan's been doing is generating, literally generating millions of pictures like this with different parameter values, and then doing a very, very detailed statistical analysis, correlation analysis, etc. And I'm not going to present all those details. Going to, I'm not going to present all those details, but he's done a really very in-depth study of what would happen if you have different combinations of leader properties and follower properties, how they interact, a huge amount of analysis. And I'm just going to summarize those really in one slide. So we go on to the next simulation. So we and these are just some of the And these are just some of the conclusions. So, we're in the process of working on this, and in future, be able to present, focus on this, and present a lot of detail on this. But what we're finding is that contact guidance seems to enable cells to follow the leaders very well, and it increases invasion distance and helps alignment. Alignment. What we find with haptotaxis is that that helps to cluster cells together. And what we find an unusual finding with volume exclusion is that it can mostly one sees volume exclusion as enhancing migration because it forces cells to be apart. And what we To be a part, and what we find, however, is that the interaction of these different guidance cues is quite complicated. And that when haptic taxes dominates, then volume exclusion will enhance migration. But when contact guidance dominates, it will hinder migration. Migration. So that the interaction between these different cues is not simply simply sum them up together, it's actually a complicated non-linear function of all these interactions. And what he's found is that contact guidance and matrix remodeling are sufficient to enable collective migration. And so, what I've done here. And so, what I've done here in one slide is summarize a huge amount of computation and a huge amount of statistical data analysis that Duncan has done. And we're hopefully once he's written up his thesis, we will write that up for publication. But some of the key things to come out of this then in his next chapter. This, then, in his next chapter, which he's writing at the minute, is to then use the model to make predictions of what would happen, for example, if you changed the initial density of the puncture or you put in sort of internal boundary conditions. So, next slide, please. Please. Yep, so Paul, go ahead. So I think the things that we've brought together so far today have been a chemotaxis with VEGF and a cell-induced gradient model that has leaders and followers. We've introduced some functional relevance of the leader neural crescell genes and their discovery. We've put that together with domain. With domain growth and the importance of linking domain growth with the movements of the neural crest cells in the mesoderm. And we have looked then at the broader impacts now of these later neural crest cell genes. I just wanted to share some recent evidence now that we've now done a comparative profiling of chick and mouse. And it turns out that the first two branchial arches in the mouse, we see a conservation of some of the A conservation of some of the neural crest leader genes. So that suggests that now we could potentially use a mammalian system to knock down those genes specifically in the migrating neural crest cells to identify novel neural crestopathy genes. On the cancer side, we're quite excited because some of those genes that I mentioned, like aquaporins and some of the others, have shown up in a lot of gene profiling of invasive cancers from glioblastic. Invasive cancers from glioblastoma and the neural crest derived cancers. So we're using a high-performance screening assay to look at 45 of those genes. This is a plug-in stopper mechanism rather than a traditional scratch wound assay. So we'll seed the, we're seeding C8161 of very aggressive metastatic melanoma cells into the chambers, removing the stopper, and doing that for a number of 45 genes. 45 genes, knocking them down. And we've got some very preliminary results that we can affect migration by knocking down. This is gene one or gene two, that we can inhibit migration. So we're excited that there may be a shared relationship between the neural crest genes and some of the other invasive cancers where they've just been looking at gene profiling and don't have a lot of in vitro or in vivo data. And I think. And I think we have a couple of further references that Philip wanted to mention as well, too. Yeah, so these references are actually already out of date. So the top one here is a critical commentary. And so it actually describes a bit about not only the work that we did, but how we went. Because one of the referees' comments we got from this paper was: Could you discuss? Paper was: Could you describe the day-to-day working that you had with each other? And so we described that in that. The second paper was actually in a special issue to honour a birthday issue for Hans. That's more looking at the mathematical side of things. Now, what's not in this are the sort of later parts of the work that we talked about, things like the effects of the boundary condition. The boundary condition: how big should the boundary be? Should there be a boundary there at all? Fibronectin stuff, that's not mentioned there at all because we haven't done any of that when we did these commentaries. And so, as Paul mentioned, what we've seen here is that we've got domain growth, which is non-uniform, which is not imposed. It may be affected by the players themselves as they move along. The cells as they move along. We've got cells changing phenotype. That's a dynamic process that's been affected by the signals. And as a result, it's changing how they move in response to the signals. And it's affecting the signals, which is then affecting their behaviour. So that's another feedback loop. We've got multiple signalling queues. Got multiple signaling queues. We've just looked at VEGF, and now we started looking at fibronepton. And now, because this is a workshop and not a conference, we should say what we haven't done and what other things one could look at. So, for example, here when we've talked about the movement of the gradient or the movement in response to the veg, the fibrous. The um, the fibonectin, we haven't put any mechanics in, so there's questions there. How are these cells responding to these signals? What are the mechanisms and how are they moving up the gradient? Are they creating other signals like stress signals? Are they aligning? We were talking a little bit about. We were talking a little bit about aligning the flux-induced alignment of the fibrinectin. But what about the fact that these cells would be exerting traction, traction-induced alignment? So there's a whole area of mechanics that we have not involved in this. And part of the reason for that was that we didn't have experimental data on which we could. On which we could do this. But if we'd had more people, certainly that would be an area that we would want to do approach from a modeling point of view. And it's an area that many people and many people who will talk today and throughout the week have done. So that's another thing. And another aspect, which again, Hans mentioned right at the beginning, we talked a little bit about, Paul talked about the bioinformatics stuff that he and his group had done. That he and his group have done, and the fact that they've now got these genes, they've related them to certain functions that are going on. There's a whole issue of how do we bridge those scales? How do we get models for all the interactions that are going on inside the cell that's enabling the cell to have the properties that we are just imposing here as rules? Imposing here as rules. So there's a huge amount of extra stuff that needs to be done here. Moreover, we've done this on a flat two-dimensional domain. We're in the process with a couple of graduate students now of looking at the effect of a curved domain and looking at the effect of the third dimension. But what I hope you've seen from this work is that in going through and doing this, Is that in going through and doing this, we've sort of answered some questions, but we've raised a lot more questions that need to be answered, both from a mathematical modeling point of view and also from the experimental point of view. So I'll stop there. I don't know, Paul, if you have anything else to say to sort of round the whole thing up. No, thank you, Philip. So thank you, everybody, for your attention and happy to. Everybody, for your attention, and happy to take more questions. Well, firstly, thank the two of you for a really inspiring talk and discussion. And I hope many of the young people listening get an impression of how productive the interaction between a mathematician and a biologist can be when it works right. And it works right. Now, of course, the question is: how does one get into such an arrangement? And that's something that has to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Paul and Philip knew each other from, well, almost graduate school or 13 years, yeah. Well, you didn't quite overlap, did you? But anyway, so okay, so the floor is now open for questions. Uh, questions. Uh, and sorry, Hans, I should mention that Paul and I had been talking to each other a lot about collaborating for many years before we actually came, arrived at the stage where this was a problem that we saw we could work on. Yeah, and that brings to mind a problem that young people on either side will face. On either side, it will face, and that is that there is always pressure to produce in your area. The more, the better, as one of my friends said, he was called in by his chairman before he came up for tenure and said told to publish as much as you can in the next few years, quote, for those of your colleagues who can read or can count better than they can read. Anyway. Read anyway. So I do have one question because I don't see any. There's a real opportunity, and you touched on it, Philip, because you have some information about what is happening at the very microscopic level in terms of cell movement, the phylopodia, et cetera. And then at the other end of the spectrum, you have these very You have these very high-level descriptions in terms of volume exclusion, contact guidance, et cetera, et cetera. How do you bridge those two levels? Do you have any concrete thoughts on how somebody wanting to get into this might start? Only the vague thought of mechanics has to come into it somewhere, but I don't. Other than that, not really. Not really. I mean, I'm hoping that maybe there might be some talks during this week where we could find out something about that because it has to somehow have maybe the structure of the cell there and then looking at how the cell deforms. And I must admit, that's an area of research I'm not up to date on how far people have got in terms of with mesenchymal cells. Mesenchymal cells, how they move, how they deform, etc. Because I haven't worked in that area. Paul, do you have any thoughts on that from the experimentalist side? I mean, what sort of things could you do that would help to bridge that big gap? Yeah, so I just wanted to say. Yeah, so I just wanted to say that these guys right here, Rovasio, thought that these cells are stretching the matrix. So we can go in and time-lapse image the cells and then look to see how they are very locally deforming their morphology and the fibrinectin. So we're going to run the time-lapse, stop it, fix the tissue right on the microscope stage, and then stain for fibronectin to overlay the last position of the cells with the fibrinectin. Of the cells with the fibrinectin, and then also do a gene expression profile of some of those lead genes right there with that. But that's about the best we can do right now. And then there's been some emerging mechanical ways to do this. I haven't been convinced by AFM because it's very, very local, very local. But I think there's some other emerging techniques that might be used. I've noticed there's a question from Helen. Helen Byrne. Helen, would you like to ask the question? Yeah, I mean, you can read it, Philip. So I was just really, again, more from a sort of philosophical point of view, because everything you've presented. Points of view because everything you presented, like I think the modelling provides insight. And does that always happen? So maybe I could start answering and then Paul, you could head in. So the first thing I should say is that when we started off with the chemotactic guided invasion, I certainly thought that that would work, that simple model. Work that simple model, and I didn't realize that it wouldn't work. And then we'd go down this route of having to have different cell types and all that sort of stuff. My feeling was we'll get that to work in 2D, then we'll look at 3D and curved and all this, that and the other thing. I think the other thing is that certainly when we talk to each other, there's a lot of times where Paul Of times where Paul can do experiments where we just say, no, we can't model that. And there's a lot of time when we can tell Paul, you know, we can do this thing. Can you do this experiment? And the technology isn't there. So there's a lot of time spent where basically talking to each other, where one person can do something, but the other person can't. Other person can't. And it's finding the problems that both people can look at. And I think what you're saying, Helen, is then if the model and the experiment don't agree, there's no guarantee that the hypothesis that that generates is going to be amenable then to testing experimentally. And I think, I guess, we've been. And I think, I guess, we've been quite lucky that some of the hypotheses have been able to be tested. But, Paul, what do you think about? Yeah, I think that out of all four of the DPhil students, each one has suggested experiments to us that we didn't anticipate. And they were actually getting better biological insights than we would. And maybe it just caused us to step back and say, ha, you're right. You know, we should have thought about that, but we didn't. But they had a completely Thought about that, but we didn't. But they had a completely different perspective. And once they grasped biology, they were making really keen insights. Yeah, and in part of that was actually the students who were visiting the lab and spending time with Paul and his collaborators, and that helped a lot. Thank you. I think Kevin's got a question now. Hello, Philip, Paul. Yeah, I really enjoyed that talk. I've heard you both speak. I've heard you both speak about this, but I really enjoyed this kind of back and forth dialogue. I thought that worked excellent. I kind of hesitate to use the phrase that you kind of sounded like an old married couple, but it did come across that way in many ways. There was a kind of question that I had about, I kind of heard something and then my connection went a little bit bad at that time. So I was wondering if you could just sort of fill it in. You said at one point about a potential interaction. About a potential interaction between the neural crest and the mesoderm, actually, that you could think that the neural crest was possibly stimulated proliferation. But I wasn't quite sure whether or not you'd kind of really investigate, you'd actually investigated this, because it doesn't sound to me something like it's trivial to work out whether or not that would be enhancing or kind of actually retarding the invasion process. So, do you have any more insights? Process. So, do you have any more insights into that? The best I can tell you, which is really intriguing, is that some of the genes that we picked up in the leader neural crest cells are expressed by the lead mesoderm. So they're responding to some signal, and I don't know what it is, but some of the genes are being shared. So the motility genes in the lead neural crest cells are being shared by the lead mesodermal cells. And that's got us really thinking about: okay, then what's us really thinking about okay then what's driving the mesiderm okay thank you yeah i mean kevin you this is a very good point because we're we're sort of considering the masoderm and the tissue as being this sort of passive thing and we just put rules on it but it itself is an active growing and dividing um thing and Thing and one could imagine maybe having a model where you actually have not only the neurocrest cells as the individual cells moving around, but actually having the mesoderm cells as being individuals. And then you somehow having to move through that. And then that's where Hans's thing comes of, you know, how on earth do you do the mechanics of that? In other words, In other words, how did you, of that particular picture that Paul has there, could one have a mechanical model for each of those three cells that allows that cell to push through it? Your Paul Anthelope, your results on the effect of osmotic pressures is extremely intriguing because I've thought for a long time that it would be a I've thought for a long time that it would be a lot easier for a cell to move if it simply lets in some water at the front and pumps it out at the back. And I hope Sean Sun will tell us more about that later in the week. But to carry on with this business of extending a phylopod, is there any hint at all that not only can one of the neural crust cells extend the phylopod and squeeze between the other cells? And squeeze between the other cells, but could they potentially actually induce cells in front of them or squeezing them to contract? So if you could basically say, I'm coming through, get out of my way, that would make it a lot easier. I never thought about that, Hans. Yeah, I think what we've seen is that a follower cell can reach out and contact the leader and retract that phylopodium. But it is causing a, from the visual analysis, it is causing retraction of that leader cell, then move forward, which then the follower cell then follows that position. So I haven't thought about that it's actually causing a contraction in that cell ahead of it. In that cell ahead of it. I need to think about that and look more at the time-lapse data. But my recollection of looking at the data from the late 90s and early 2000s was that that contact produced two responses. One was a contact, one was a contraction, but it was also that we saw some lead cells reach back and contact the follower. So there are two different behaviors that emerged from that. But what I was referring to was if Referring to was if a leader cell actually induces a change in the mesodermal cells. So if by extending this pylopodium, they could change the osmotic pressure at what, you know, change the channels, et cetera, or I guess open them so that the mesodermal cells shrunk somewhat. That would make it much easier for them to pass by. Pass by. Yeah, well, certainly that Aquaporin 1 was really looked at in exonal processes. That's how we got dialed into it. And it was potentially thought to play a role in the retraction of a growth cone by the changes in osmotic pressure. There'd be a very rapid reduction in that growth cone in response to an inhibitory factor. That's Bernt Frisch's work. And so I think we haven't looked at that. That's a very good. I think we haven't looked at that. That's a very good suggestion to look at the mesoderm perhaps and retracting by stimulation of aquaporin 1 and recruitment of water channels. We have to look at the localization of aquaporin 1 or some of the other aquaporins on the mesoderminal cells. Very cool. Yeah, we could do that.
