Okay, I will talk about something related to tangible equation and topological reference and internal functions from some boreal information methods. So my talk will be sort of it is very related to the talk by your session this morning. And also kind of, yeah, so my talk can be regarded as some kind of supplemental one to his kind of kind of introduction to the proposed configuration other relation to some class algebra. Cluster algebra. Okay, so basically, so my talk will be based on my paper on four years ago, related to some report. So, this discussed some relation between topological regression and theoretical function. And also recently, I wrote some paper with Marinha, which discusses some retargeting structure in a photo recursion, for topological repartition function. Actually, so this is not a mathematical ligorous discussion, but I obtained some very nice formula on Obtain some very nice formula on area deliveries. And also, in the last part is some form going to work with Yellowbos and Oregon Urani or Diramo. They are Ukraine friends. Okay, so anyway, so let me explain my motivation or background or goal of this talk. Okay, maybe I don't need to say much about topological regression because Vincent already explained the idea of the topological regression on Tuesday. So basically, so this is some. So basically, this is some kind of draft box or some machinery which produces some analog correlated and free energy automatics model from a given initial data, which is called the spectral art. And it is, the output is known to be related to some many interesting topics. For example, as in text friends, this usually computes some denominator invariants quite long with them, I would think. So it is related to topological spring theory. And also, by taking some generating function, we So, by taking some generating function, we encounter some integral system, what's our function, some integral hierarchies. And by taking the generating function of this omega gen, what WGN in my talk, we can also solve some differential equations by some WTV theory way. And also, it is related to some other topics. But actually, so we are interested in some properties of these outputs. In particular, today I want to discuss some so-called resurgence property of this. Property of this partial function, so which is an exponential generating series of these three energies. So if g was not defined in truth, so it is kind of omega g zel. So I will explain the definition later. But actually, so this is an analog of the Platon function of the matrix model. But this is divergent series in H by in general. So we have to take some boreal formation and so on to make some this formal object to analytic one. Object to analytic one. Then we want to discuss the stop phenomenon applying to this divergent series. And this is one of our main interest of my motivation. And the goal is I will give some heuristic I will explain some heuristic arguments which allows us to derive certain formula on some Stokes phenomena for this partial function. Function. So there are two expression formulas proposed by Pasquet Schiapra and Glou Marin recently. And I will derive such a formula by using some relation between topological regression and public versions. So, okay, so this is the goal. And this is the context. So first, I will review the topological regression again. So we can explain the topological regression for AR beta. And so I will try to explain what happened for topological. What happened for required for elliptic picture? And after that, I will also tell you some idea of the boreal summation and resurgence because I think many some of you are not familiar in the story, so I will try to explain the idea. And also propose the main conjectural formula of pathetic chapter and human. And finally, I will try to derive such a conjectural formulas by using the method of quantum charm and the vector VKB and using And using the relation to the unrevised. So, this is our contents. Okay, let me tell you about the topological regression for elliptic spectral graphs. So, okay, so as I said, so topological regression needs some input or some algebraic graph. I take the family of elliptic graphs defined by this equation, but I choose so this is a family which is obtained. So, this is a family which is obtained by solving some enriched equation for you by imposing this condition. Finally, so in when we land a topological recursion for higher GA score, so we have to fix some A cycle or B cycle. So, it is related to the choice of omega 02. And after fixing some tolerable marketing there, in both part of the cycle, A cycle period is some kind of some given parameter, and I consider some familiar very difficult satisfying this condition. Farming of verification satisfying this condition. And so this can be regarded as some initial data for spectral curve or the topological recursions, which was explained by Vincent. So we need some complex, sorry, Liam surface together with some two monomorphic functions of omega 02 by this data. So basically, so we are taking some value parameterization of this spectral curl. Of this spectral curve. And in this case, we have to. So, this compact luminous surface is torus for complex space of complex numbers divided by lattice of failures, which is defined by usual formula and omega b for the ellipse curve. And x and y are given by pay function with pay prime differentiation. It is known that this satisfies this equation if we choose appropriate g2 and Uh G2 and G three. Yeah. And I I define omega zero one as a Y beam as usual. And omega Zero two in this log I will choose this one. So the condition for omega zero two must be it is metomorphic algorithm diagonal and holomorphic at everywhere else. So this pay function uh is a candidate. It is symmetric because the pay function is even function, it has double polar on diagonal. But I add some constant term. But I add some constants term to normalize this W02 along the cycle. So actually, so this is bi-differential. So I take one of the variable and integrate along the cycle, then we get the one form in the other variable, and I require itself. So this is the con uh this is how this construct is chosen. And eta is obtained by second period. So this is the input for the topological request. And For the topological requirement. And to run the topological requirement, also let me go. So we need to know where is the lamification point and where is the local involution and lamentation point. And in this case, it is realized by half paddles. It is corresponding to the three single cells on the right-hand side of this defining equation on C frame. And the sigma z in this case is just a simple prepping of the sign because pay function is equal function. Okay, so this is. function. Okay, so this is related to the coupling name volume because x is resulting about y change is assigned. Then for given data so as gene change explains we can plan the functional regression by this form. So this part, maybe I should say, so this is defined by some residue, some sum of all residue or overall ramification point for certain object. And this one was denoted by k, so this is an expression. K, so this is explicitly given like this. And otherwise, yeah, as means as explained, so this is. And the trigger must be the local evolution appears here. So this is somehow combinatorial or a complicated object, but it has some origin in the mathematics model. Okay. Actually, one form is a BRB denominator, but so you see from this. denominator but you see so this V and sigma Z sigma Z can be written by other function Z as I showed in previous slides this is a product differentiality so you can divide by one common data conversion so this is where you define Rica and as we can explain so this is Ricardian relation for 2g minus 2 plus Z so once you get omega 0 1 omega 0 2 then we get omega 0 3 and so on so this is the structure of the topological regression and as omega And as omega G0, so it is also called Fg in the context of the topological regression, so it's defined by some formula. So this is also again defined by some of a residue. Omega G1 is a differential one form, and I multiply the perimeter of omega 31. So we can get some, we can define the registry. And actually, we don't need. Defined the residue. And actually, we don't need to care about the lower end point because omega g1 has no recipe at the ramification points. And anyway, so this is a very defined complex number. And so if you apply this topological requirement in the previous example, so we pass few free energies, it is expressed. And we are interested in the property of the generating C's. Or maybe I forgot to mention, so actually the goal. The goal will be analyzing this power series. But this G was slightly different from the one appeared in the store. So I'm considering generating function of omega G 0. It's not a partial function of the AB structure. This is just a remark. And we are interested in generating series of such kind of UIs. But before going to the next Next step. So let me explain how this regression looks like when geometrically topologically. So the decarsion is called the topological regression because it reflects some degeneration of some topological subjectivities. So you can understand or you can imagine the left-hand side of the topological regression is related to or I don't know it's a cut you can think about it here some contribution from uh some GFG Some G Lima surface or some surface with some n plus one marked point. And the right hand side of the regression looks like some is corresponding to some surface which is obtained by some degeneration. For example, the first one, the left, the first term in the right hand side in the topological regression is related to the degeneration of one handle. So if you twink this handle to line like this, then G dus become Then g does become minus one from the previous one, but you uh uh the number of marked points increases by one, so and so you get g minus one plus two. And this part is related to the k itself, k. But I didn't write I didn't write k in the previous formula, but this part is for the regression content k. And the other one is similar, so you can take some one of them. One of the um one of the cycle and rebridge, and you get some this disjointed new surfaces and not corresponding to the right hand cycle. So, this is a structure for topological requisition. And next, I wanted to discuss some idea of the body summation, and I will propose the main convex formulas in the wiki of red teacher and the global um given Okay, let me tell you about the idea of the volume summation. So it's a machinery or some framework which can assign some analytic objects to give some formal or divergent series. So it's a combination of two operations. So Borel summation is first you have to take apply so-called Boreal transform, so which is nothing but the term white inverse transform. And after applying that, you have to detail transform. So it's like a 20 minute operation because This will like a trivial operation because we are taking inverse Laplace transform and Laplace transform, but it's non-trivial for the divergent series, as I will explain later. Um anyway, so this is the key identity. So this says this formula is uh obtained by some property of the gamma function. Um anyway, uh so this formula says that so this monomial is Laplace transformed to this monomial, and zeta and h bar are some Laplace pure variables. This implies that in bars, the This implies that the inverse Laplace transform of this monomial in H bar is given by some monomial divided by table factorial. So if we apply this timewise inverse Laplace transform to divergent series, so if the coefficient of the divergent series grows factorially, then this m factorial can kill the divergent region, some convergent series. So we can have a chance to obtain some analytic objects. So this is the idea of probability summation. And let me do one, show you one. Let me do one, show you one example, which is related to the topological record. So if we apply the topological record for this degree two polynomial, sorry, colour defined by this degree two polynomial, then we get the this number out of f, actually for this is xg. And actually, it is well known. And uh actually it it is well known that so this spectral graph has some uh um so this arise from the actual matrix model. And uh it is related to the Euler characteristic of the module space of genus G Dman surfaces. And it is known that such a Euler characteristic is written by Bernoulli number in this specific form. And this parameter nu, sorry, I forgot to mention but this nu must be non-zero convex number, so in this sorry. Complex number, so in this it appears here. And this identification is easy to do half the year and cannot. So this is a very long formula for Euler characteristic. And in the context of topological regression, maybe nobody is a fast guy who proves this formula. And I forgot to write the defining equation for Benunia or not. Put it like this. It doesn't have all those order greater than 3 or 5 and so on. So anyway, so this is a definition of the value number. And you see, so this must have a finite radius of the convergence. So anyway, so so without factorial factor, so this cannot be convergent. So so this has a zero radius of convergence as I see it. So okay let us take the let us consider the Borel sum of this object. As I said so Borel sum is first we have to apply the so-called Borel transform, which i denoted by b curly b um which is nothing but the replacement of this h bar to the Of this h-bar to the dual monomial divided by some factorial factor. And then you can show that by using this defining relation of the relative number of right-hand side, it is up to some non-essential terms, it is written by this one. Actually, so this is a kind of analytic continuation. So this is a germ defined around the origin and it's global. This looks like this. And then, okay, so all. And then, okay, so original one was divergent, but we have this expression. After taking the Laplace transform, we can obtain the so-called Borel sum. So, S is a Borel summation of the data, and it is composition of Borel transform and Laplace transform, like this. Yeah, and I say, for example, if you look at the Wikipedia page of band G functions, this is nothing but the integral to obtain logo band G function in other Laplace grant. But also, Raspberry. But also in Victoria, there is some remarks. So to obtain integral representation of the band G function, so we have to impose some condition, reality condition on the parameter. Actually, so the previous one can be regarded as some so-called starry expansion of the boundary function. Anyway, so depending on the real part of parameter nu, we have some two different expressions of oil zone. So actually, so this is related to the slope penalty. So, this is related to the slope phenomenon. Anyway, so Borel Sam can have this kind of discontinuity depending on the angle or phase of the parameters. This is caused by the so-called volatile singularities. So, I mean, okay, so we want to take the Laplace transform along a positive Legal axis, but if some singularity appears on a positive real axis, while Laplace contours, this doesn't make sense. To us. This doesn't make sense. In the case, we cannot obtain the boreal information. And actually, you can see that this has some periodic singularity at growth point on the zeta plane. It has some periodic singularity. So and when the other part of nu equals zero, for example nu equals i or minus i or something, then this singularity appears on the real axis. So we can explain the Borel sound. So that's why the Borel sound changes their expression discontinuously. And this Discontinuously, and this is actually some kind of stock spectrum. So, this is indeed a stock spell. And in the previous example, such a discontinuous change of the correlation can be understood as a contribution of this correlation like this. So, for example, maybe I should write. On new frame, the new is a parameter in our spectral clock. On new frame, so the other part of new is zero logus is like. Is zero logarithm is like this. And when parameter new is on this line, then we cannot take the volume summation. But we can define the volume sum in this region and this region, and we can compare them. And I denote the volume sum of S in this region by S plus, I think. Yeah, S plus. When mu is in this region, then 2 by 1 is. Then 2πi mu is like this. And if you find the volume in the other region by s minus, so they are different by the residue controls. Because if you vary the parameter new from here to here, so here then this sequence of singularity hits the integration control, and then you have to take the residues to computer analytical. And in this case, so these residues are easily computed because. Residues are easily computed because we have expressed the formula of the Borel transform in the previous stage. And actually, so this is the resulting formula. So we can compute the residue at each point exquisitely and we obtain this formula. So this means that this F, Boreal sum of F in this region is analytically continued to the other region. Then the is not identical to the Boreal Summit. Is not identified with the volume we define in other regions, but we have some collection terms. So, this is the phenomenon. And actually, so this collection terms is consistent with the so-called reflection formula of the formula of the band G function. So, this one, actually, so this is a so so so this can be understood as a stokes phenomena as I said. So Stokes phenomena that I said. So actually, the polar sum of some divergent Cs is known to be 12 original divergent series as asymptotic expansion after each button steel. So S plus and S minus, both of them have the same asymptotic power series expansion, but they differ by this exponentially small terms. So this is nothing but the Stokes phenomenon. So there is some exponentially small terms behind the divergent fields. And this becomes. So you can now you can understand this similarity, sorry, this Stokes phenomena are Sorry, these stock phenomena are kind of obtained as a contribution of singularities on the model frame. So, this is the idea of the resurgence so we can understand the stroke phenomena in terms of singularities on the model frame. Actually, so today I'm not going to explain much about it, but there is a way to understand the Stokes phenomena as some operators in a disagent analysis, which is called the Stokes automorphism. So, roughly speaking, it is the composition of S plus and S minus in S plus is volunteering in this region, and we are asking that this asteroid continuation in this region, it is volunteer with what? So, this is a operator actually to define this operator mathematically rigorous, we have to explain more because what is the source of this map and what is the output of this mark. So, to define it, we need to explain about some cells. To explain about some theory of simple retargeting function and so on. Maybe, yeah, it's important, but I don't have time to explain about it, so I will form it here. But basically, it maps to a given divided series, it computes them, roughly speaking, right-hand side. So it's a kind the output is a so-called trans series, not a power series, but a trance series. Trans-series, not a power series, but a trans series. And it can be decomposed into several pieces coming from continuous of these Borel singularities. And this K is the level of these Boreal singularities. And actually, so we can take the exponential of this one because you see, so as operator, so this F is backward to F itself plus something. So this means that this operator S, so photomorphism starts from identity plus some exponential points. Start from identity plus some exponential collection charts. So you can take the log, which defines the so-called alien derivative. And actually, so this is a deviation of the for dimatosis. So in our previous example, so actually so this residues computed by a residues evaluated at which generalities are are nothing but a sum of the uh alien derivative. But it is expressively computed and and this is as I said so pathway is given. But As I said, so fast break is scarable. But and actually, in this case, the obtained trans series maybe trans series is power series with this kind of exponential small factor. And this power series factor is not divergent at all. So iterative A derivative kills such a convergent series. Because as I said, so arei derivative captures divergence or some contribution from singularity on the polar frame. At least original series is convergent to. Original series is convergent, it doesn't have C Right on the radial derivative x trivial. So it's a good action if this in this case. And anyway, so by taking the exponential, so it is just one plus from some of this. So this is nothing but the action of so-called frequency. Right? I forgot about this three in the next slide. Oh yeah, yeah. Uh okay, so b by the way, so do you have any question about the for exclamation? For exhibition. Then now I can explain the main conjecture formula which I want to discuss for heuristically derived later. So there are success of topological regression is my main object, but it is also related to the topological string theory because holomorphic anomaly equation. So topological regression function function of free energy is known to satisfy holomorphic anomaly equation. By top form of economic equation by BCOB. And in that sense, we can apply several methods developed in topological strain theory. And for example, there is one big conjecture in topological strain theory. So you can, if this F is obtained by some generating function of some free energies, lot of free energy or grommet invariant of certain target space, X, for example, some target-free manifolds, then it is not expected that it is divergent. That it is divergent and it can have a model transformer, it may have a singularity. And this singularity is expected to be realized as a failures of miradual clarity. This is a conjecture mentioned by Draka and Marietta and other later. So they are con they confound this conjecture by looking at some target approximation of the voltage transport and so on. Maybe there is still no reverse proof. Maybe there is still no reverse proof. But yeah, so this connection is widely believed. But in our setting, actually, phological regression is, as I said, related to the phosphoric screen. And we can understand the light hand side as a period of y dx, omega 012 topical reaction. For example, maybe I should say, in a previous example, so this volume singularity to pi nu is also. By a new is also related to the period of our spectral curve. I forgot to mention. Yeah. So this is our spectral curve, and it has some two simple ramifications point of a new is known zero. So this has a non-spring. So we have some square root of mu and the minus of sprain. So u and you have one cycle. And actually so the period along with this cycle of y dx is nothing but a 2 by mu. So you get nothing but a two file so you can compute over this field of the integral by the value rate the integral around the mean so actually this is register one is relative by x um so it is consistent with this con with this conjecture next um so i omit uh i'm not going to explain detail but uh actually so there are several works on santa maria strength skipper blonde developed some method to solve uh holomorphic and Method to solve holomorphic anomaly equations non-part of particles. So namely, they try to obtain what they developed a method to obtain trans-series solution, which is not only the power series, but also some exponential small terms. They try to construct such a trans series solution of the homomorphic equation. And Good Marinho also develops the method to compute the higher-order function chance. Projection terms. And eventually they came up to the following conjecture. So, because the grandiose solution or the holomorphic normal equation can be expected to be obtained as an effect of the slopes phenomena. So, for example, if you consider some differential equation, a solution of the differential equation, its analytic continuation should be a solution of the same differential equation. So, in this sense, the transitive solution should be obtained by some analytic continuation of the original free energy. Original free energy. So, in this sense, the computation of the Pranced solution is expected to be related to the computation of the stock spend of the time, Y are derivative in other language. And basically, the conjecture from topological storing theory is the following. So first of all, so first of all, we we expect that topological storing application. That topological storing or regression, particular function adds some nice Borel transform. I mean, mainly I forgot. So, to define the idea and derivative, so we have to we would like to have some singularities like false or some branching from similarities, but I don't, we don't need some essential singularity or much more wide singularities to define some registry or some nice idea and derivative. Actually, there is a class of so-called research and simple researchers. For the retarget, simply retarget functions, we can define the alien limit. And we expect that topological regards or topological functions should fly in the class. Then we may discuss what is the idea. And as I said, so this people obtain some method to compute what far value. One instance on some currency is fast, and the result is the following. So enough, so I'm So enough, so I'm restricting their conjecture. So I'm showing their conjecture in our example, namely some elliptical. So it has only one genus. And in this case, we expect that the boreal similarities are realized by A period and B period, or YX, as I said. And when the boreal similarity is coming from A period and A D and the variable at other points, it's the same as weighted Japan 4, which I explained in the previous slide. In the previous slide, I discussed with the waiver example that this should hold in general if we consider the radial derivative of A cycle. But on B cycle theory, which has not appeared in the previous example, because the previous one is genus cell, but if we consider some heritage or higher genus spectra, we have probably have some several similarity periods, and it is expected to be all similarities. And the answer, conjectural answer for the idea that we want it is like The answer for the idea that we participate is like this pointing some shift of the free energy. And so this is maybe a so actually so this is kind of where you find run the goals of the following side by generation. So because of f starts from one of the sparse, that's f1 and so on. And if you see there are some combinations, they have exponential n u minus. Exponential value minus h pr. So maybe nu is a p of right for the x, a p of y dx is exponential to non-products. 2 pi i times mu. So this period is 50. But since nu is the a period of this k times h1, if we consider this combination, then it is known that what you can easily compute the leading term has to behave like this as a plus some. Some things in the higher order. So, this will be obtained. And by the cyber-fitting relation, it is known that the topological regard still satisfies the cyber-fitting relation. So, you see, this is expected Francis structure because we are discussing the similarity coming from B-cycle videos. This naturally appears in a Francis parameter here, because we are taking some residue. Because we are taking some residue or some branching, some average of some branches after multiplying this Fourier factor or a plus factor, so we obtain this kind of exponential or a similarity. Anyway, so this gives two conjectures why. So the second one, so Gumalino's conjecture is mainly on this B-cycle singularity and which published during almost one year. And which published in almost one year as a whole. And actually, so there is also some parameter A which cannot be fixed by solving differential equation, so holomorphic anomaly equation in this case. And these are called some Francis parameter or some Stokes constant. And we also have to fix Stokes constant to obtain actual value. The goal of my talk is to derive this formula here. Is to derive this formula heuristically by looking at the validation between topological graphs and the pandemic equation. So, what was the motivation for this conjecture? Motivation. Motivation. What is the detuition for? How did you come to this formula? I didn't. So but Gul Marino uh tried to solve the um so anyway, so so this cause of Santa Maria et al. is uh obtained some method to solve Obtain some method to solve homophic equation of perturbative free. And yeah, eventually we they want to understand some research structure of the perturbative free energies. And then Human developed some method to compute higher transistance and they obtain this working. But do you want to understand how this obtained by I cannot explain now, but I just try to Now, but I can so relate I can uh roughly explain it. Anyway, so this shift of structure is related to some uh something which I will explain soon. So these jobs are being a solution of the Panama function. Okay, so now I want to derive previous formula, let me explain some relation between the Polish gun regression and the Hanover equation at the quantum. So before that, maybe uh I think it's better to say something about the Pander equation. Um so Pandory equation is uh if you know well maybe just right but okay let me let me explain explain very briefly. So it is uh some special function, uh new class of the special function. So it's not maybe now it's not known, uh very important non-linear differential equation. And it is all Equation. And it is analogous or some non-autonomous version of the wireless trust equation. For example, so you can maybe you know this analogy. Yeah. So this T, so G2 is constant in this virus first case, but it is it becomes some independent variable. So this is. And mainly I will talk about fundamental wine range. And actually so while stress fair function has several So, wireless trust pay function has several nice properties. Like it is written by some ratio of some entire function, which is called wire stress sigma function. And also, it is related to the theta functions. So, it's an entire function, but pay function has a follow, but it can be controlled by this other set of the theta functions. And there is some other robust function which is nothing but the tau function of the tangible equation. The boundary equation. I'm defining equations by this function. Twice localism is deliberate in mass solution. And usually, in the literature of the boundary equation, this H bar is set to be one, but this H I add H because without this H1, it is difficult to relate this to optical regression topic. And actually, so there is another nice property which is most important, maybe in this talk. So, boundary equation has some isolation. So, Pandora equation has some isomodalomic information discrediting. Yeah, so actually this is related to the talk by the question. So, in the Panderbay one case, it is known that it is that it describes the isomodomy role of this particular second-order linear differential equation. So, I'm writing it's a scalar form. And it has some upper right singularity at the x equal to q, and this q will be the solution of the partial equation. Equation. And it contains H. H is a function p and Q. And actually, so this H will be the Hamiltonian. And this is equivalent to the logarithmic fast derivative of a tau is nothing but this argument. So this is also consistent with variation. Anyway, so if we since this depends on parameters, uh depends on parameter t here. By the way, it it's it has irregular singularity at x equal to infinity at one half five over two. So you have some five stokes directional and the infinity and you have some five stokes multiplier that are attached. And in finish a priori it can depend on some parameter t because t or q or p are clear parameters in the differential equation. But if if q and p satisfy some P satisfies some differential equation, appropriate differential equation, then we can resolve the stock spatially. We can deform this differential equation by keeping some stocks multipliers. So this is isomorphic deformation. And if we consider the isomodom deformation for this one, then Q and P must satisfy some Hamiltonian system with this type of depending on Hamiltonian and the DC device to the particle value. So this is a This is a so I will use this isomorphological property to derive the omega. So before that I would like to now explain about the relation between topological recursion and equation. But to explain the relations I need to analyze the so-called quantum curve, which was also discussed by Vincent. Okay, now let us recall. We are considering this elliptic curve with some fixed Curve with some fixed aqueous parameter. And okay, so this is some just a recording of the notation. So we are interested in the generating series and its exponential free nature and participants. And in my paper in 2019, so I first constructed the so-called quantum curve. So this appeared in a detailed talk. So we are just taking a preliminary of all my GN, WGN in my talk, and diagonal. And diagonalizing it, and change the coordinate from z to x, then to satisfy some differential equation. And in this case, since genus is one, so we don't have an ordinal differential equation. Instead, we obtain this partial differential equation. And this is kind of analogous object in BBC equation in GFT. I'm not going to explain about it, but we have some H uh depending, some shading like operator with some. Like operator with some T differentiation. And this also has some nice property. Okay, so this is a kind of WKB type solution of this partial differential equation. So we can discuss all our models which is related to the model coefficient. It is defined by some term wise analytic continuation of this type of type of WPV solution around the SIP1 cycle. And then each term Then it turns out that since we are discussing partial differential equation, not ordinary differential equations, these both symbols become some kind of operator value. So the borough symbol or term wide analytic continuation along the A cycle is just a multiplication by this. So this is because WGN, omega GN has some trivial A cycle model, A cycle period, except for G equal 0 and G equal 1. So omega 0 1 only has this So mega zero one only has this cycle model and only cycle model domain. So this becomes a shift of variable. So new parameter new is shifted by plus or minus h by depending on choice of this side. So this is because as I note here, actually so B cycle period is related to the derivative by nu. So this happens o also for higher G and N. Higher G and N. And you can, for example, you can imagine that if we replace this multiple integral by E cycle penalties, then this can be converted to any sc or the derivative, and you have n factorial, so it becomes some shift operator. So this is the last idea why this shift operate happens. Okay, so we want to obtain some isomodomically deformed objects. So as I could tell you is okay, so nu is key-dependent, so it is monodromically dependent. So it is monodrome preserved. But B cycle monodrome is not preserved varietal value. So this multiplication is depending on T. So to choose such a T depending or some operator value is monodromic, I take the discrete freight of it. So this appears in the sectional store on the model. And this is also the idea of the uh resobi sorry, you know of resob annotation to obtain the um atomodo. And isomodo solution. So, in that context, they use so-called DBZ solution of the DBZ equation or conformab with some degenerate inversion. And this is a kind of analogous object in topological regarding. Okay, so if we consider some discrete House transform like this, then the previous SI group model is preserved on the B-cycle model becomes some just a multi-free page. So I mean, so as I said, the B-screen is a good model. So, as I said, B-cycle model is shift this parameter new by nu plus or minus H1, then this discrete of red card must appear as a model of this gigantic object. Actually, so there is a way to rewrite this discrete of free series by some H-bar power series with coefficients depending on the data functions. And so it makes this division very defined, but I don't have time to explain. But anyway, so we can. We can now expect that this is some isomodrome with a formal object because we have some case angle monodrome with this. So these are T dependent. And actually, there is some exact WTB philosophy or our realization of the guy-to-science tool. So we expect that stocks data or monodromy data and so on should be written by such a terrible. I mean so the uh I mean so the uh formula dynamic continuation along the a second ground V section. So it's a kind of idea of R B analization. And if such a R B analyzed monogramy is T independent, we may expect that this is some isomology formed. And indeed it satisfies the isomology system, which is associated with the Panther band, which I showed in the right article. So this will be the full S3. Distributed free C will satisfy this partial differential equation. And then, as a consequence, well, essentially, these two statements are equivalent, but as a consequence, the denominator appearing in this y is a tau function. Namely, twice logarithmic derivative solves the final y equation. Why in other words, logarithmic derivative of tau is 120 h. This is what I'm changing. Is that what I obtained in 2009 paper? And as I said, this is some topological recursion version of the key formula, but before that I have to say. Okay, so I discussed only part of one case, but it is now generalized to another part of the equation. It is known that there are six point of equations, but there are several higher order analogs. And there's many of them are covered by L Barnes and the Dragon and Marshall. And actually, so this is the kind of sheaf type of formula. And in originally, for gamma, you almost easily obtain this kind of formula by using conformal in the case of parallel basics. So this suggests that topological regard should be related to conformer field theory. And also some AGT theory is also related to, we may expect to give To. We may expect to give related to the Necroson position function. But in Panube one case, the corresponding Kohoma block should be some irregular singular rather than irregular singular and also ramified Kohoma block, meaning such an object. And it was not known for a long time. But in this year, the Pompa finds some candidate of such a performer block. Um actually so maybe now we can discuss how this is related to the performance process. How is this related to the performance of so uh maybe at least I will mention about it in the last slide, but at least uh we can control the function for one. But uh maybe I should say so this is all power series valid because so everything is defined by the power series in H bar. So this is some kind of formal solution of the Poundway define question. So no boreal mobility is known and no convergence of the Fourier series is known, but Long, but from now let us do some heuristic arguments. Now, I want to discuss how this solves the following. Okay, let me explain how we can arrive at the human conjecture first. Okay, so in my paper 2019, so not only the construction of the home algebra function, I also discussed some conjecture what you Some conjecture or heuristic argument of the computation over the linear stock state of this isomorphism with the equation. As I said, so this is, this has some five stocks multipliers, and this should be some T independent because of the partial equation. And actually, so there is some cycle relation, so the total multiplication, the stock multiplier, must be one because of the consistency condition. So actually, so only two of them are. So, actually, so only two of them are independent among the five stocks multiplied. And these two should be related to the integration constant involving the boundary mine, which is the second one. And I so in this sense, these stocks data are very important because it is some conserved quantity of the boundary equation. And I discuss some heuristic arguments to compute such a stock status by some philosophy of the vectors of UKB, developed by Walls and such. Development by Ros and Saddra, Historia K, and developing the fun. And my conjecture is the following: so to compute the stokes multiplier, so we have to first we draw some stokes, which is spectral network and stock. And in our case, we have a stock sculpt like this, and it has some three ramification points. And from each ramification point, we have some three stocks colors. And actually, such WKB tells you that if the Stox graph doesn't have But if the Stokes graph doesn't have a subtle connection, like this is a picture with saddle connection. So if the subtle connection doesn't have a, sorry, if Stox graph doesn't have such a saddle connection, usual WKB solution can be boarded somehow at each region. So in this case, we don't have a proof because we are taking some solution of the partial differential equation and we are taking some distributions with C. But let us assume it. Let's assume that. In fact, WTB compute, as I said, some stock state as a period of volume symbols of the quantum curve. And as I said, so the volume symbol, so the previous slide says that essentially, so these two exponential new over H bar and exponential row over H bar are kind of both simple. Our current double isomodoro DE. Actually, so this if we use the If we use WKB leg or abilization of the right-hand of a line scale, we can parameterize theta by this by these ball symbols. It's fish tree. And for example, so here, for example, if you want to compute the stock multiplier, then you have to compute the analytic continuation from here to here. And Chikaioto Manikaization says that. Analyzation says that in the analytic continuation, so you have to add some detour paths to compute the I don't have to say. So this detour path contains some information of the stocks multiplied. This is a path between essentially this is the same as a ball's connection formula. And for example, if you consider the analytic data path from this to this, then this path can be deformed to the V-cycle model. So the No no no. So the stock's data attached to zero direction is given by B cycle for simple features called. This is the idea of the computation. And for example, if you want to compute to minus two direction, sorry, this is minus two, minus one, zero, one, two. So this is how I'm happening. And then in this case, so the analytic continuation should be related to the base side group. So we have this simple hope. And for example, And for example, if you want to compute the stocks multiplier in this direction, then you have to across three across three stocks gaps and you have some three symbols and so on. So this is a very combinatorial way to compute. And actually, so this satisfies that desired cycle relation, and also this agrees with some style propositions. So this is conjecture, but I believe this is true. Namely, so I think. Namely, so I think we can fix the or fix the key after to read the gun. And as I said, in this case, we cannot use the WQP because we need to have some subtle connection on the recycler. But after varying the parameter T, we get some other configuration of the stocks graph, and we can do the same game and compute the stock state. Okay, so this stocks data looks So this stock data looks different, but just we are just varying the parameter t, which is an independent value of the pound variable one equation. So namely, so this variation of t should be isomorphic. So this implies that the tar function parameterized by u and low in this case, and in this case, are different. So they must be ruled in a certain way, in such a way that this In such a way that these sorts data are identical. Actually, now the class arrangements are here. For example, so you can relate, for example, S minus 2 and S minus 2 prime, for example. Sorry, I'm not writing prime after. If you try to relate this to this, then you have to multiply 1 minus something factor. So this is nothing but a class advanced formation. So actually, so in terms of this one was denoted by x gamma, I would think. That would think. Actually, so here, omega is not omega equal to one in this case. So actually, it is hidden here in this case in variants. Anyway, so this is nothing but a cluster formation. And it was also known as a Bilabala Farms formula in a context of the self-two PV. Okay, okay, so now we expect that this is a correct way to relating the TAR function because this is obtained. function because this is obtained as a consequence of isomonodonym. So this implies that this parameter nu is replaced by the other parameter nu tilde by this. So this is required due to the isomodrooming. But not only that we also it's natural to multiply this factor. This is consistent with additional thoughts. So this is actually some kind of syntactic transformation. Maybe I forgot to mention. So, nu and low are expected to be log target coordinates on a space of monodrome integer. And it is a symplectic transformation. So, there is a generating function. It is nothing but the dilo in this case. And its exponential should appear as a free factor between the tau function. So, it is very natural because, as I said, so tau function is the generating function of the model. The generating functions and models, right? And also, this idea was developed by CDOTO and Verizon Production, as also said this discussion. It's very six. But if we put this factor in front of the tau function, then we can look at the Fourier component of both of them. So recall that the original partial function was obtained as a self-fourier component of the term. That the zero Fourier component of the top. And now you can look at the zero-fourier mode because it has some expansion exponential, this parameter and this is also shifted. So you can look at the zero-fourier component. I mean, just look at the coefficient of this guy this guy, then you discover the Gumarino formula here. So G Gumalino's formula was described by any other derivative, but By any other derivative, but after expanding it, so we have we can check we check that this here this agrees with the Guillermino formula or recovers it. So in other words, this formula is a kind of generating formula of the Guillermarian's conjecture from a disexo-Kayan telegraph. This shift to naturally appear because star function is defined to get transport and so on. And not only that, Yeah. And not only that, so in Good Marino's formula, so there was some stocks constant A in front of this radiant value term. And actually this is related to the omega, VS invariant. So as I said, so omega is one, so it's not appearing or it's hidden here, but it should appear here by the NT block and also here, and then omega should appear here. So this is uh also expected by many people, uh in critics uh In physics in logical screen theory. So, roughly speaking, many people expect that Stokes constant in topological impartial function is described by the BC in. And this is so our proposal is consistent with such a conjecture. So, this is how we can derive the fast rate, no, no, no, do marriage problem. Finally, let me explain about how to derive the fast. About how to derive the aspect of formula, which is related to the A-cycle A derivative. And actually, so this is the ongoing work with Ukrainian friends. So at least our motivation is not coming from the participative capital formula, but we wanted to compare with compare topological regression partition function with some irregular control network. But topological regression partition function is defined as some H per C. Defined as some H series, and for homeworld blocks are defined as some large T expansion. So we have to consider some larger T expansion of the topological recursion of free energies and so on to relate this to objects. And on the way, so we obtain that if we choose appropriate A cycle, so which will vanish at t or infinity in some sense, if we choose such a nice A cycle, then we can compute the series expansion of three energies. Especially, and reading down. Explicitly, and the reading term is the same as the waiver frame. Actually, this and this vector lambda is appropriate power of t and this coefficient is genuine, so essentially the Russian number. So, this fourth root of six can be absorbed by discalating this chapter number in that um appropriate way. We don't know what rational this rational number computes what, we don't know, but uh maybe there might be some Maybe there might be some interesting reading interpretation. But anyway, so since maybe I don't have time to explain, but actually if we compute the free energy, namely the generating function, generating series of this kind, then the divergence only happens in the constant star. So if we switch the order of the dimension, then so if you each particular So if you H1 degree increases, then T degree or lambda degree also increases. So the only constant term is divergent CD and H. So the Stocks Penomena can we may expect that Stokes Penomena can happen because of this patient CD, which was already mentioned or studied in my previous slide. And this agrees with Pasque Disciple's model. Okay, so if we believe this only contributes to the SOAS phenomena for A-side. The source phenomena for A-cycle for the singularity, then we can read this pass-quef. This is how we can derive pass-quick disk-pass formula from our example. And not only that, actually so this formula itself is also important because it is used to qualify for the gap condition in the frame. So this is usually used to fix the holomorphic and use in a holomorphic hosmonic question. And actually so uh our frame is also Actually, our frame is also satisfied this form of the Ganomar equation. And I checked that this is satisfied and this condition and this condition because we computed G and it agrees with some strange expansion obtained by conformal books and so on, by tan by tune. Anyway, so um and th this also uh I say this also I would say this is also consistent with recent, or sorry, it's not recent, but there is some important work on find way B C O B correspondence. They also proposed some expansion of RG stabilizer function, which is a kind of some analog partition function in a similar case. And our computation also agrees with this result. So I believe so. So, I believe so now maybe we may now discuss numerous relations between topological regression and from homework process and the negative type of functionality. I only checked February of a few times, but I'm not sure how to do the fluoride we need. So, thank you for your attention. In your previous slide you said there wasn't you had to take a specific A cycle. How do you choose that? So to maybe I like the sounds right okay so so I can So I consider this spectral curve. I assume that μ is T independent to take some isomatologically deformed equation. So we also want to consider some large T limit to computer F. So when T tends to large, this Y tends to large. So to keep new, so it's like a mass shrink. So after rescaling X and Y in some parts of T, so we get Some parts of T, so we get uh some um anyways, I don't know how to do it. So anyway, we need some rescaling, and after the rescaling, we impose that largely limited some shrinking or pinching. And I take A cycle as a budgeting cycle. Then allows us to compute series expansion. This is the idea. And I think this idea also works for other spectral curves. I haven't gotten computation but. How do you know that it corresponds to opinions? You said that it corresponds to pins? Yes, yes, yes, yes. How do you know that? Oh, because, as I said, so this mu must be T constant, so we have to shrink, like this exactly. So s so you have the pointful gap conditions uh discussion towards the end. Yeah. So but but I I guess still there are still or multiple contiguities in the main. Uh in this case, I think no. I don't know. I said Crane tried to do it at US 50 or so, which is a team. But in which model, I'm not sure. Well, okay. Sounds I don't remember if it's geometry it was talking about, but it sounds paramount. Maybe topological recursion is related to the non-compact one, I guess. At least what we can show is: okay, topological recursion, I can obtain this expression by purely from topological recursion without guessing some qualifier gaps. So, and okay, so this is obtained by topological regression. And now you can look at the number of holomorphic. You can look at the number of holomorphic ambiguous chunks in each G. And actually, the number is less than the holiday gas conditions. So it's kind of over-determined condition to solve the problem of economy. But we know that Polish Galica satisfies both holomorphic anomaly and his point of volume theorems. So this implies that the existence of the solution of the Holomorphic Canon equation. The solution of the following question. At least in our case. Yeah, yeah. So constraints are bigger than here's overdetermined, but uh some miracle happens. So this uniquely fixed sheet. This is one dialogue. So it it's kind of full gap condition. So in the in the department string point of view it's like the agile. To also go to string point view, it's like a manifold goes to the cutifold point, and marginalized specs becomes a manifold. So, here, I guess we call it cutful, yeah, but it's how you take a limit where you expect your genus multiplied because singular gene. So far, right? Yeah, you can't say yes, yes, yes. So, do you expect that this is actually clarity? Would it be there for any event where you change the gene is that would make code singular or is that? Um I have to confident more carefully. I have to con consider more carefully, but um uh so my l roughly speaking, so the idea to obtain the formula is following. So so we have some three ramification points in in the beginning, but uh each link one of the cycles. And also we also take t gets to infinity, so locally it looks like uh forgetting this other. Then uh maybe stoxigraphy is not relevant here. Maybe stop graphic is not relevant here, but this looks like weigh-butted spectral cards. So that's why weigh-build radars should appear in terms of. And maybe this kind of idea can be applicable for other spectral cards. But I'm not sure if what happens in higher degree covering and higher application providing. I'm not sure what's happening. Maybe we can discuss. What touch on the future directions which were in your last slide so that you didn't have time to tell? Sorry. T sons, I was wondering if you didn't have time to tell us there are several works on, for example, recall step, and many people are studying from two parameters. If we are studying some two-parameter transit solution of the Pan-Level equation, and it looks different from our expression, so maybe we have to populate. This is what I want to see in the past. The second one is the last part is heuristic, so we have to prove many things. And the last third one is which I said. So there are similar ways to construct a parameter function for maybe one is a topological regression and one is an equivalent for positive function. And AGT confirms the topical equation after they give you. The whole banana equation after dealing with this with Fourier transform. So maybe we may, but it's interesting to relate these objects rigorously. This is what I find interesting. And also, maybe I didn't, I forgot to relate this. I talked similar, I gave a similar talking two weeks ago, but in that case, I discussed some relation to previous structure, but for today I didn't, so I have to give it here. And the bifomorphic anomaly, so it is some module. So, which is some modular form. Module form plays a special role in topological regression. And also, part of the equation itself might be have some nice arithmetic property coming from this conjugate or horror. Nothing is known, but I think it's interesting. So, this is what I try to say. Thank you for that.
