All right. Okay. Hi there. First off, I want to thank all of the organizers for organizing all of this and definitely for having me here and giving me the opportunity to speak. This is actually my first time speaking in front of a professional audience, so it's a little intimidating. But I'll do my best to explain the problem and the proof to you guys. The proof to you guys. If you don't know me, I'm a student of Alan Dow's. I've been working with him for a few years now, and also Will Bryan. And this is the type of the problem that I wanted to present to you. So I want to give you an example of a countable Frechet space that is not H-separable. And I will probably stick around here just so I can reference my notes if I need to. So, most of this stuff or the words in there, I assume you guys know, but I'll describe things like MH and H separable. So, here, let me come over here and then describe what's going on here. So, what I have to present to you is a pair of results. And I'll list them out here. One. So, that's a little big. That's a little big. ZFC says there is an MH separable space countable, which is not H-separable. And then the second one here is a consistency result: it is that P P equals B or B equals C implies that there is a fresh A space which is not H separable. All right. So, like I said, I Like I said, I assume everybody knows what separability means and maybe even selectively separable. But for H separability, maybe I should give you the definition of selectively separable just in case you don't remember it or you never learned it. So selective separability is a property regarding dense sets. And this sort of thing goes back to some work of skeepers, even. Work of skeepers, even in I think the 60s. No? Oh, no, no, I'm sorry. Sorry, 99. No, I'm thinking of a different paper. I'm sorry. So this is actually a paper Skeeper's years ago. Yeah, you guys all just seem old to me. No, no, no. No, so this goes back to some work of Skeeper's in 99 with his selection principles that are pretty well known. I think. That are pretty well known. I think this one is based on S fin A B. But the property goes: if you have a sequence of dense sets, so n in omega, dense in x, then you can always find a sequence of finite sets. A sequence of finite sets through those dense sets so that the union of the FNs here is dense. And so this is selective separability and in And in a paper of Bela Bonanzinga and Matvev, and I think this might be the one with Tkraczyk, they renamed these properties to M separability and H separability. So this one right here, selective separability, is now renamed to M separable. And the M is for Menger because it's related to the Menger property with regards to open covers. Covers. Now, H separability is very similar. You also have a sequence of dense sets. Write it like this. And given any one of these sequences, you can find another one of these sequences, Fn, through the DNs. So that now, not the union being dense. Not the union being dense, but for any open set in the topology, the U hits cofinitely many so this is not empty cofinitely often. Okay, so this is M and H separability, and then we have some weakenings of these properties, which are prefixed with a little M here. So M M and M H. And there's also something called R separable, which is similar. But these are the same things, but we require the sequence of D. Require the sequence of DNs to be descending. Okay. So So, the problem that I'm interested in, or that I was interested in, is the question of does there exist an X which is MH and not H? And not H. And we originally started working on this problem a few months ago, maybe. I was looking at some stuff regarding compact sequential spaces, and in a paper of Lubemier's, I found this question about whether there is a space that's mh and not h. And I kind of said, that's interesting. It seems like it should be solvable. And it was kind of difficult. And it was kind of difficult. But so we worked on this for a few months. And I think about two months ago, Lil Brian over here actually found a paper on the archive, also by Lubermer, which solved the problem for us. So we had been doing many of the same things, and it was really cool to see the proof laid out like that. But so we went ahead and modified our proof a little bit. And instead, we showed, okay. Instead, we showed okay, so they showed it for P equals C, and we send it to say, okay, well, now we can show this for P equal B or B equals C, just like I mentioned earlier. So the answer is yes. And this is a paper of Bardilla, Maisano, and Zdomsky. Zdomsky. And this one is up on the archive. I don't know exactly when it's getting published. I'll shut up. Well, you're my advisor, so you can ask questions all you want. Okay. So, I guess what they really showed here is that there is such an X which is both zero-dimensional, alpha four, and fresh A. And the reason Frechet is popping up so much is because Frechet for countable spaces implies that the space is also MH7. That the space is also MH separable. I'll go through that. So, first off, just to get a little familiar with H separability, we have a couple of things here. They're pretty obvious. So, second countable or pi weight less than B is going to imply H separable. And this is not too hard. You can essentially just line up your dense sets and your base, or a base of size of the pi weight, and kind of diagonalize through here and get a bunch of these rows that correspond to finite subsets of these DNs, which hit all of these. Hit all of these u n. So you can, because the pi weight is small, you can find more and more and more, and then find a function that dominates all of them and get a family of these finite sets that then gives you another one of these little finite set sequences. Okay. So the other thing is that what I mentioned, that fresh A implies. implies mh separable. And this is actually pretty useful because we use it to get this example of space. So countable fresh eater. Quick sketch of a proof here. If you take some point X in your space, and your space is fresh A, well, it's going to be in the closure of something. Well, it's going to be in the closure of something, and you can write down this sequence that converges to x. Now, if these are all isolated points, then all of your dense sets are going to have to contain all of them. So, if you have a dense set, it necessarily contains a bunch of isolated points. So, if isolated here. And so, you can just pick finite, finite, finite out of each out of that sequence that then can. Out of each out of that sequence that then converges to x. And you can then extend this to the rest of the space. But if you don't have isolated points here, it's a little bit trickier. So what you do is you label all of these in some sequence S1 or S0, S1, S2, and so on. And then because all of your setups are. All of your sets E, or I'm gonna forgot to write these down. So let EN be a sequence of dense sets decreasing in X. And then we're gonna pick these I n's out of the corresponding E n's. So I n will be a sequence. ends. So I n will be a sequence passing through the E n's that converges to the corresponding S n here. And do this all the way through. Okay. And this kind of looks like something that's called the Aaron space, which is similar, but that is non-Frechet space specifically. Specifically and the point X here is then in the closure of this sequence, S clearly, but then these form open neighborhoods around the S's, and so we get that X is also in the closure of the union of these I n's. Of the union of these ins. Okay, but now because X is fresh A, we get that there is a singular I that sort of diagonalizes through these and gives us a and converges to this point X here. Okay, and then you can take the again, just like when we took the rows with the sequence of dense sets D and then the base U, we can take the columns here as the finite sets for our MH separability. And now we got this for this point X here. And again, like I said, we can extend this to the rest of the space because space is countable. Space is countable. Okay. So let's jump right into part result then. So I'm going to give you the fresh a Frechet not H separable space first. Okay, so let me lay it out this way. So the idea is to build a recursion of length B. Yeah. Um um which I okay sorry this was the one or the CFC? No, this is the one that's relative to um p equals b or b equals c. The uh the zfc one is a little bit um uh it's similar, but we don't try to get freshly, obviously. Um so this guy. So, this guy weaves together a couple of recursions to get fresh A and violate all of these H separable tasks for fresh A plus not H okay and we have a long list of tools here, so let me go through them one by one carefully. So, let me go through them one by one carefully. So, we have a it's always good to start by enumerating your space. So, we're actually going to work with the set Q, the rationals. I'm just going to enumerate it as Q sub L for L in omega. And so, this is part one here, two, we're going to have a sequence of. We're going to have a sequence of topologies, tau alpha. This one is going to be of length b these are topologies on X ascending. We have a family. A family, or not a sequence here, sorry. So this one is just a set. A family of dense sets E T and the T is going to run through the Cantor tree actually. That's a technical point that is useful later on. But these actually form a partition of X into density. Into dense sets. All right, so we have this. One of the other important things that we have is a bunch of families of converging sequences. I'll write them as i alpha, script i sub alpha. These go from zero up to b. And these are, these are going to be, I'll call them promised. Promised about converging sequences. Okay, so each one of these just consists of a whole bunch of countable subsets of X. And we'll actually specialize these a little bit to I alphas of Q's. And these will be. Of Qs, and these will be sequences converging to a particular queue. Oh, sorry. Okay. And then there's a couple more here. Almost done, I promise. We have more. So we have one more, a partition. So we did a partition into dense sets first, and now we have another partition of X minus any particular one of these QLs into clopen sets. This will be script U here, and countably many Klopin sets. So I'll index it U, Q, N. Q N Yes, I have a couple of assumptions later on. So I'm just listing out all of the items since there's a lot of them first, and then adding in the assumptions afterwards so we can have everything in our brains. That's the I alpha, the U alpha Q. I alpha Q is there an I alpha Q for each Q or is there yes yeah so I alpha is at stage alpha we have this big family of converging sequences and they converge all over the space but we're going to want to look at each point of the space individually so I alpha 2 will be a subset of I alpha 2 yes yeah and actually yeah I guess I can say that here Actually, I guess I can say that here. So, this is a subset of I alpha. Okay. So, that's that. And then we have this partition into clopens. I'm going to make the stipulation that they converge to Q in a moment. And last thing, I'm going to have a, where is this? A sequence of elementary submodels. Of elementary submodels and so these are for X less than B here and reals row C, which kind of pair along with them. We'll choose these as we go into the proof. As we go into the proof, not less than these reels will help us violate H separability and also get fresh A later on, but initially therefore violating H separability. I'm going to name one more thing. This shows up later, but we're going to have these things T sub I, and these will be subsets of the Cantor tree. And what they are is the set of all T so that for a given sequence I, I intersect with that corresponding dense set. With that corresponding dense set is not empty. Okay, so these will show up later on. And that's everything that I. Capital I's live in an I alpha. So at some stage alpha, we're looking at all of these promised converging sequences, and we want to make sure that we can extend the topology so that they stay converging, right? Because I want to promise that they are converging. That they are converging. Okay. And I said I'd give you some hypotheses here. So first off, I want to obviously make some restrictions on the sizes of these topologies. So for all alpha less than B here. Tau alpha, I alpha. These guys are going to be of size less than B. And I like to think of this as never add more than you need to, right? Make sure that you can always keep going. Next, we have: I want to make these tau alpha closed under complex. Under complements, I'm going to get a whole bunch of Kloppen sets. And so the topology generated by these is going to be zero-dimensional. Tau alpha is supposed to be topologies. Yes. So isn't then this going to be finding something if every open set is a lot of this problem. Yes, yes, sorry. Yes, sorry. Yes, sorry. I should say a base for the topology. I'm going back and forth between base and the topology itself. So, yes, the bases for the topology are going to be of size less than B, and the topologies will be generated by these. I'm using T alpha because it's in my notes, but I want the topologies themselves to be closed under complements so I get zero-dimensional at the end. Yes, space, sorry. Oh, and I also want to start with tau zero. Give me a starting point, is the standard rational topology. And I also want to give myself a start with I0. So I0 is going to be accountable. Is going to be accountable family of converging sequences with the with a couple of properties here. That's a Campbell family of converging sequences so that for every QL here. The for every QL and every T in the Canter tree I can find an I at the beginning which converges to that Q L in the zero to point. In the zero topology and is contained in ET here. So it's contained within one density and it converges to this QL. I think that's good. The partition of E E was given already at some point. The E T's? No, the E that happens your partition into that set. Yes. Have you already constructed that at least for that part? Yes. Yeah. The E T's. They were given before you did anything, is that right? Yes. Yeah. So the E T's are just a fixed family of dense sets that are indexed. Fixed family of dense sets that are indexed by the Cantor tree. Those are right. And they have nothing to do with D. That's just what I have to do. Yep. Yeah, exactly. They will help me do stuff related to B later on, but that's just fixed for now. Okay. Okay, and sorry, I have to go over to the next square here. Also, for every one of these i's in script i alpha here, I make a restriction on that ti that I defined earlier. Ti will be either a chain. A chain or contain no infinite chains anti-chains there for some reason. Okay, and then very last thing here. So for every Q. So for every q in x, we will eventually pick these things r q alphas. These are the iq alphas, which Dr. Dow lovingly calls the rings to rule them all. And they are a sequence such that R alpha q. R alpha Q converges in the zero topology to this point Q and for all I in I alpha of that particular Q, so this is where we're restricting to a subset of the I script I alphas are R q alpha mod finite swallows up every one of them. Oh, and then there's one more thing. I also want these to be mod finite increasing RQ alpha when beta is less than alpha. Okay. Yeah, there's a little star there. Did I not write it? I didn't. Yes, mod finite. So the R alphas are accused work mod finite. I had some pictures that I forgot to draw. Okay. So come over here. Okay, so come over here now. All right. So I want to know how to accomplish all needed tasks. Those arc models need not be all neighborhoods. They just need some subsets converging. Yeah, so I will have a whole so in the first case, zero. Are they in that case neighborhoods? Or not? Yeah, they consist of uh so the RTRs are also sequences. Yes, yeah, sorry. Did I hope I thought I said that well they're called rings to rule them all because of a picture that I forgot to draw here. Yeah, a lot of people like token. I like token. Yeah, so they are they are choices of uh promises. They are choices of promise converging sequences, and they need to mod finite contain all of the ones converging to a particular queue. Okay, so how to accomplish all of the needed tasks carefully. Yeah, insightful analysis and intricate combinatorics, as I was told yesterday. Day. Yeah, hand it out at the end of the conference. So I'll do a little bookkeeping in advance. And so we're going to run through all alpha less than B, but I have two big tasks to accomplish. I want to get fresh A and I want to violate H separability. Separability by making these open sets dodge finitely many or finite choices of finite sets through dense sets. And I need to handle that for every such choice of finite sets. The way that we'll do that is by essentially making a particular set closed discrete. But I want to do this in advance and say, all right, I'm going to do the H s. Say, all right, I'm going to do the H separable, the not H separable bit along some particular subset of B, and then the fresh A bit along the complement of it. So, and I just arbitrarily chose at limits, do not H separable, and at successors, do the opposite, do the, or not the opposite, do fresh A. Fresher. I can't do the opposite. That'd be inconsistent, right? Okay, and then we have a little limit here. So this is the key. Key. So this is going to be how we extend the topology. So given a particular alpha, we're at some stage of the recursion here. And a set B, which is almost disjoint from every I in the current script I alpha and a current set of choices. Current set of choices for rings to rule them all. Oh, no, no, it's a little too far. Q's in X. But the second thing you find is the first. Sorry. If you're almost determined from the ring, then you're also almost disturbed from the converting sequences, not the rings. The rings are not promised to be converted. Yes, but they are almost contained in all the rings, right? So if you are almost disjoint from all the rings, then you are also almost disjoint. No, B is almost disjoint from every one of the promised converging sequences, I. So I don't know what you watch from the okay. Oh yeah, the end is not in the comma. Okay, I see. Yes, yeah, there's a comma there. Okay. Not almost disjoint from both of those, just the first one. From both of those, just the first one. And these guys are pairwise disjoint, but not almost disjoint. So given this, I can say there is a function b alpha from x into omega. And this is going to be how I choose. Choose the sets for the next base. So there is a function here which does such that one so for every I in I alpha at q, so for every I alpha at q. So for every one of these promised converging sequences to q, and make sure that i is mod finite contained in the preimage of the image of that particular q. So I take a point q and I push it forward and I give it a label, n, and then I pull that back, and that'll correspond to a big neighborhood of q. Corresponds to a big neighborhood of Q. Okay. And then two, the RQ betas minus that set B that I mentioned earlier will also be mod finite contained in the same thing. Okay, and so this is I have a single ring to rule them all, and this guy will be finite out here and again contained within this big neighborhood that I get from pulling back an integer. You say neighborhood, do you mean in some topology, or do you just I'm going. Or are we going to just I'm going to make it a neighborhood? This is how I extend the topology. I say, all right, this is just some function that I'm defining in a particular way. It'll be according to a recursion. And I declare it to be continuous afterwards. Last part: V alpha restrict to B is One to one. Okay. So I for the sets in B, I want to make sure that I pick each one of the points in that set almost disjoint from every promised converging sequence to be disjoint. And so it can be closed discrete later on. Okay. And then so at the end, once you have all of this and you have your The end, once you have all of this and you have your fee, you're going to build tau alpha one is generated by tau alpha union all of these phi alphas those are ints phi alpha inverse of it uh yes. Yes, so this thing right here is an n. It's an integer. Not omega, sorry. Q in X, yeah. Okay. And then like I said, once we have that at the alpha, we declare it to be continuous, and that gives us the base for the next apology. Okay, so how do we actually do this? This is the actual work. The actual work. So in advance, we'll fix a set of functions f alpha from omega into omega or B. And this will be increasing. Increasing mod finite and consist of increasing functions, monotone increasing f's Okay. We'll also pick a guiding reel here, and this is the row alpha I mentioned and I want. And I want this to not be in the model M alpha. So pick it out of, just pick some dominating real here that dominates all of the previous row alphas or row betas. And so what this is, is I have this cantor tree here, and I have a whole bunch of And I have a whole bunch of reels that I might have used already in making things close discrete and preserving crochet. And I want to be able to stability for H separability. And so this right here is row alpha. So what the F alpha do. So, what the F alpha do is the F alpha are there to help us make B closed discrete. So I'll define a B alpha. This is the set of all QL here so that there is some initial segment of the current guiding reel that contains that QL and L is going to be less than F alpha at the length of T. So I'm running up this tree and I'm looking at all of these dense sets and where they where they intersect Q and picking only a And picking only a finite chunk from each one of these dense sets. I think of them as columns sticking out of the tree. The tree is maybe horizontal, and then the columns are vertical, and you just pick a finite chunk, and the F alpha mediates that. Just because we choose finite sets for age separability. H separability. It seems like you can play a strong part. I suppose you could, yeah. But here you're getting this is a violation of h. This is a choice of h's that does not work. Yes, yeah. Yeah. What I want to do is make sure that any finite choice that you can. Make sure that any finite choice that you could possibly give me through the dense sets. So, this is a choice to give you. Yeah. And so I'm choosing larger and larger finite chunks from the dense sets ET. And you don't get to choose. I mean, if you want to show that you've got to show the privileged choice. Well, I'm choosing fixing the F alpha, and those are mod finite increasing, right? And so they will eventually cover all of They will eventually cover all of the possible finite choices. Oh, you mean finite? You're choosing initial segments of finite choice. Yes, yeah, sorry. That wasn't clear. Okay, so given this B alpha, we can use the lemma to find a phi alpha a phi alpha that will make this be alpha closed discrete. Close the screen. Okay. Now I also want to preserve fresh A. And I have a couple of cases here. So for fresh A, I have to deal with Cases here. So for fresh A, I have to deal with B equals C and P equals B independently. So we'll deal with the B equals C case. Am I running out of time? No, no, no, no, no. Oh. Sorry, I didn't see that. Okay. Okay. So, for fresh A, we need to make sure that any closures are obtained by taking limits of sequences. Limits of sequences and so I want to run through all of the power set of my space here and enumerate these as a alphas for alpha less than c and C and C equals B here. Sorry, I need to go to a new page here. So now I want to add sequences i. So these are going to be new ones that will go into my script i alpha. My script i alpha and build my script i alpha plus one to i alpha and I'll do these one for each queue and if I can do it I want to make sure that I do it through um uh A alpha so that I sorry I want these to converge to Q with respect to alpha. And if possible, I want them to be no, no, instead contained inside of Contained inside of A alpha. So if this doesn't happen, the I is not contained inside of it. We can always thin out I to a sequence that does. That does pass through A alpha. Sorry, I'm losing track of myself here. Oh, um, and while choosing the eyes, um also make sure that we satisfy the inductive assumption that T T sub I is a chain, or we can even strengthen it to an anti-chain, and this way it will contain no infinite chains like we wanted it before. Okay, so while we're looking at a particular A alpha here, and I want to preserve fresh A, I'm going to look at all of the QLs one at a time and And my set i alpha plus one of q. So I will have already chosen a bunch of possible converging sequences for this q and I want to pick them or I want to check if they are in the closure the alpha closure of A alpha. I have my topology tau alpha and I want to pick this. I want to I want to sorry. I want to consult both my enumeration of X and the script i alpha plus one of q's. And to do this, I'm going to look at the set A seek. Seek Q is the set A not Q, sorry, alpha Alpha with all Q L so that Q L. So that QL is a limit point of A alpha in tau alpha or relative to tau alpha. And I want this to be witnessed by script i alpha plus one of q or of q l here. Of QL here. So there is a sequence I converging to QL as relative to this topology tau alpha here. So now we're going to apply a slightly modified version of the lemma. And the way it works is we're going to have our set B, I'll choose that. Set B, I'll choose that to be this set of potential limit points here. And I want R to not be in here. And instead of getting a function from x to omega I want a function from x to 2. Tell me, are you a limit point or are you not? All right. And the same conditions from before that the rings are contained mod finite in the Pre-images there. Same as before, but I'll slightly modify three a little bit and get that the alpha of r is equal to zero and the alpha applied to b here. Is one. So either you are or are not in that alpha sequential closure. Now, given this function phi alpha, we get that Our set at the space at this stage is fresh A essentially because we've built it that way. Whenever we add an open neighborhood, we make We add an open neighborhood, we make sure that it misses the closed discrete set that we've talked about and preserves all of these converging sequences with respect to the rings to rule them all. That's a lot to write down, so I'll just say that. We've ensured that what I've said, that you've ensured that the rings still rule them all. Capture enough of the promised converging sequences. Okay, so that was fresh A for B equals C and fresh A for P equals B is a little more intricate. So we're going to start with How much time do I have? Not much. Oh, three minutes, but we can a little bit in. It's fairly long, so I will try to sketch it quickly. Start with an elementary submodel N of H C plus of size less than B and And with an intersect B of countable cofinality and then from here we have this claim that R. Oh, sorry. I forgot to fix a couple of things here. I'm also going to put a set A, subset of Q, the space, and R, which is going to be in the final topology in the closure of that set A. And we have a claim that R is in the closure of A relative to this. A relative to this topology tau mu at an earlier stage given by n, the elementary submodel n. I don't know if I can really sketch the proof of this that quickly, but we get that it's in this mu closure and we can use this. I don't have much time. Use this to get sequences converging to R, i.e., they witness the fresh a bit in N and then by The elementarity, we can get witnesses higher up in the chain than later than mu here. Okay. The way this works is that we look at the magnetic field The way this works is that we look at all of the sequences J converging to R in N and look at again sequences J here the set T J of all of these T's where J hits that particular dense set. Particular dense set. And we can then split this into three cases based on the structure of TJ, on what TJ looks like. And the cases are if TJ is a singleton, that J is completely contained within a particular dense set versus Versus it's covered by finitely many branches of the tree, or it is just a single branch, or sorry, not covered by finitely many branches. I want to make sure that it's not covered by finitely many branches, or TJ itself is a co-final in one of the branches. Sorry, I think I'm a little out of time here. I can't really describe all of this in the next two minutes. So I should probably stop. How much time do I have left? If five minutes would help you, I'll take five. I'm not sure five minutes would help me here. Sorry. Sorry. All right. So, well, we can postpone it to the working sessions if people are interested. We could definitely leave one of the sessions. Okay. All right. So, okay, so let's stop here. Any comments or questions? Yeah, so we should take it. I have a question just quick. What was the role of the elementary submodels that you chose? Because you picked this function outside of the model, but then you never mentioned the model again. So I think you were when you were these convergent sequences, they were sort of added by some government in the model. You mean the MCs or the N? Well, the MCs, yeah. The MCs. They were just to get a new reel, which was a branch through the tree that allows me to. That allows me to pick a closed discrete set somewhere else. So the F alpha is dominated all. Yes, and the F alphas dominated all of those branches. But when you were adding the convergence sequences, how many did you add and what did they correspond to? Fewer than B many at every 10 at every stage. Were they somehow tied to the model? No, not really. I don't think so. Really, I don't think so. Right, well, well, uh, so yeah, um, any other questions or comments? Um, yes. So how do the age separability and mh separability compare to the strategic versions? Like selective separability, you mean? Sorry? Do you mean the selective separability? Yeah, right. Well, the H separability is about hitting finite sets or Finite sets or co-finitely many of those finite sets. And actually, I don't remember exactly how M separability relates. Yeah, you just form it like a game version. I actually do not remember how M separability relates to H separability. Not sure I can answer that. Sorry. Okay, thanks. Any other comments, questions? Have you tried in addition to get alpha three? No, I actually have not thought about alpha three at all. I noticed alpha four in your paper. Yeah, because alpha two is impossible. Alpha four is known. So maybe with your message, it's no, we were just trying to extend a little bit, and then we haven't thought about alpha three at all. Thanks. I have another question. So, in particular, if continuum is at most LF2, then you have either B is C or P equals B, right? So, is there a chance that this could be a ZFC theorem? Have you tried this Schella method for constructing this completely separately? Is that useful here? To get a fresh A? A ZFC example, yeah, Fresh A. Um, it seems difficult. We have thought about it a little bit, um, but It's a little bit, but the approaches that we've gone through so far are not. It seems like you have too many things to do all at once, and you can't guarantee that all of those sequences will converge. All right. Well, anything else?
