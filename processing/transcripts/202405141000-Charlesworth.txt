Hello, welcome to the Reflections on the History of Modeling and Theory, one of the podcast series from the new Society for Modeling and Theory in Population Biology, SMTPB. That's at smtppb.org. So the goals of this society are to provide a forum for discussing theoretical issues, tricks. Theoretical issues, tricks of the trade, and new approaches to strengthen the connection between practitioners across our field and across the world, to build a community through meetings, workshops, and other events, and also to foster the career of modelers and people who want to learn more about theory in population biology. So, this particular podcast is a series in informal chats. Informal chats with leading figures who have really shaped our field and who can reflect and give us their insights about how modeling and theory has changed in population biology over their careers. So we are joined today by Kaylee Charlebois. She's our technical wizard and one of the graduate students from the University of British Columbia. By John Wakely from Harvard. John Wakely from Harvard, and we are all welcome, delighted to welcome today Brian Charlesworth from the University of Edinburgh. Brian is a professor emeritus at the University of Edinburgh. He did his undergraduate at Cambridge in Natural Sciences in 1966, followed by a PhD in genetics in 1969. He was a postdoctoral fellow at Chicago, followed by Followed by positions at Liverpool, then Sussex, then Chicago, before eventually moving to the University of Edinburgh as the Royal Society Research Professor there and the later head of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology. He has received many awards, including the Fellow of the Royal Society, Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, and really all of the kind of All of the kind of medals of high distinction from the various societies in our field, including the Darwin Medal from the Royal Society, the Frink Medal from the Zoological Society of London, the Darwin-Wallace Medal of the Linnaean Society, and the Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal from the Genetic Society of America. He's, I think, by the Scopus count, it's always hard to know, has over 370 publications that. Publications that have earned him an H-index of 90 and has really shaped my, forget the numbers, he's really shaped the understanding that I and many people have in the field of so many subjects in population and evolutionary genetics. And that goes from understanding age structure and populations and how they are subject to selection to understanding mating system transitions between daichi and hermaphroditism. Daishi and hermaphroditism, understanding sex chromosome evolution, understanding shifts from isogamy to anisogamy, evolution with recombination, multi-locus dynamics, and really kind of discovering a new field of how molecular signatures are influenced by hitchhiking at surrounding sites as they purge deleterious mutations, a phenomenon now known as background selection. Now known as background selection. So, through these, and this is just the tip of the iceberg of the many areas that Brian has contributed to our theoretical understanding of evolution. Thank you, Brian, for being with us here today. Thank you for this flattering invitation. You seem to know more about my work than I do. Yes, thanks, Brian. So, our first question we wanted to ask you is. So our first question we wanted to ask you is, when did you first realize that mathematics was such a great tool for providing insight into biological questions? Probably when I was in high school, embarrassingly enough, we had a genetics course. And of course, genetics is inherently, as Sturtevan and Beadle said in their textbook, A Mathematical Science, you have a mathematical prediction about what. Mathematical prediction about what should happen in a crossing experiment, and you go out and look and see whether that's verified. Then I got interested in evolution, and I read a book by a guy I think he's totally forgotten, somebody called Carter, G.S. Carter, Cambridge lecturer on evolution. And he had some very elementary population genetics in it, and that kind of tweaked my interest. You know, pictures of soil rights, distation. Pictures of solarites, stationary distribution curves, and so on. So much less boring than the sort of names of the bones of skulls and that kind of stuff, which you learn in undergraduate biometry, high school biometry classes, and a lot of undergraduate ones as well. That's kind of got me started. Had you also had you had training in mathematics? Uh very little actually. Last last formal course I took when I was sixteen. I took when I was 16. That was at high school. So I didn't do any maths at university at all. So I'm largely self-ill-educated in mathematics. I would not describe myself really as any way a true modeler in the sense that that's what I started out wanting to do. I always started off thinking of myself as an experimentalist. I sort of gradually drifted into modelling. Into modeling in order to understand things better. I think that's very inspiring, especially for the many students who feel like they haven't had perfect mathematical training in order to enter the field. So, you know, I think that really opens up possibilities for many people, and you clearly have become one of the strongest theoreticians in the field. Yeah, well, if you look at the kind of maths, I do it's pretty. Of maths I do is pretty much high school maths, really. A bit of matrix algebra here and there, a bit of calculus here and there, but nothing very posh. But isn't it part of the issue that we all learn a lot of math in our schooling, and then it only takes this much more to apply that math to something very interesting? Yeah, I mean, I saw Wright didn't really have any strong mathematics. didn't really have any strong mathematical training, to be honest. Or Jim Crow, for example. So I think Holane and Fisher had fairly tough mathematics courses, but I'm not trying to compare myself with them anyway. So I think if you want to figure out how to solve a problem, you know, there are places these days it's easy to look stuff up on Wikipedia, for example. You don't even have to go to the library. Yeah, it's those questions that really drive. Once you have a good question, then it's just a matter of looking around to find a way you're approaching it. I can't conceive of ever having been able to do anything like the work, say, Kimura did in deriving all that diffusion equation stuff back in the 50s and 60s and 70s. I mean, that's pretty hairy stuff. Pretty hairy stuff, the solution to the general solution to the drift equation with these Gegenbauer polynomials and all that kind of fancy stuff. It's totally beyond me. So you mentioned Carter. Were there other people who really inspired your early career research? Yeah, well, I got a lot out of reading Douglas Faulkner's very good textbook of quantitative genetics. And he thought of quantitative genetics as population genetics and what we now think of as quantitative genetics. So it's very much as introduction to elementary population genetics and then the sort of quantitative trait inheritance tacked onto it. And it's a very readable book even now. I came across it in my college library when I was an undergraduate and then we did a certain amount of quantity. Certain amount of quantitative genetics in finally a genetics course which I took at Cambridge. But it wasn't very well taught, the population genetics there. It was taught by a man called George Owen, who was a PhD student of Fisher. And he'd kind of lost interest in research by the time we were there. And I'm pretty sure he gave his lectures by having a pile of papers. His lectures by having a pile of papers, and he would start one year the lecture course with where he got up to last year. And he spent most of his time chasing poltergeists and actually ended up in Toronto running an institute for poltergeist research, believe it or not. You're not joking. Real poltergeists. Well, I don't know there is such a thing as a real poltergeist. He thought they were real. So, who did you? So, who did you train with in your PhD? Well, my supervisor was John Thodo, who was largely famous for being one of the first people to try and map quantitative trait loci just using conventional markers and working on analysis of disruptive selection experiments. But he was a totally hands-off supervisor. So, I got much more out of interacting with the other graduate students and reading. Interacting with the other graduate students and reading in the library, the genetics library was very good because they had reprints going all the way back to the very beginnings of genetics, some of them signed by the great names in genetics. There was a slip of paper in one of them, which I'm very sorry not to have stolen, because it was signed by Bridges Muller and Sturdivent and Morgan. I wish I'd nicked it, but. I wish I'd nicked it, but I didn't. I suspect it's not still there. We'll have to take a look. Somebody will have to take a look. And there was, you know, very good PhD students there, so we talked a lot. Bad mother supervisors, that kind of stuff. And I think a lot of students learn a lot more from each other than from the professors. The professors yeah, well, the tradition in Britain in those days was sort of John Maynards put it, you could put it, you could be around, you know, no real active sort of suggestion of what you should do. You just got on with it in some way. My PhD was pretty boring, so let's not talk about it. Well, but to follow up on that, could you describe or is there a particular project you were working on or moment when you had Project you were working on, or a moment when you had a kind of an aha for yourself that you really could solve something? Well, that really came later when I was started as a postdoc. When I started with Dick Lund and I had a clue what I was going to do, and again, Dick was, his philosophy was to let people be around. He would rarely tell people what to do. And he was very scrupulous, in fact, about not taking any credit for anything which is Any credit for anything which his postdocs or PhD students have done independently. So I was sort of scratching my head a project. And in fact, what I did start doing was measuring linkage disequilibrium in Drosophila. Because Lunton and Franklin had come up with this kind of crazy idea that the genome is highly in linkage disequilibrium because of strong balancing selection. Strong balancing selection, and he thought this was the solution to the genetic load problem. So I thought, well, we could try and test this by measuring linkage equilibrium between aliza and markers. It was probably somewhat optimistic. So that was what I did experimentally for a couple of years. And then I was talking to Tim Prout, actually. He was visiting the lab, and he said something about, I don't believe in Malthusian parameters. So I said, well, you know, what do you mean? He says, well, they're just sort of hand-waving. He says, well, they're just sort of hand-waving. So I sort of, there was another person, Ted Giesel, who was working on trying to model effective size in age-structured populations. So there was a sort of, I thought, well, maybe we could try and sit down and make a proper model of an age-structured population and see what comes out. And that got me into that. And I actually pretty easy to sit down and write out the equations to show. You sit down and write out the equations to show under what conditions there is such a thing as a Morthusian parameter and how it relates to what actually happens in a population of age structure. So you went just then from linkage disequilibrium to a conversation with Tim Prout to age structure. Is there a thread running through that? Not really. I mean, the idea was to test Lewnton's theory. Tim was, as you probably know, I mean Tim was, as you probably know Tim, a great character and he was visiting and Lernton gave him the manuscript of this paper with Ian Franklin about the congening of the genome. And Tim comes into the lab one morning waving this menu to say, BONADASH! And so that sort of, again, you know, can we test this idea? Can we test this idea? And in fact, when you do look for linkage disequilibrium, it's very difficult to find it between Onaci and loci because they're not very closely linked. But actually, Lawnton's theory would have predicted strong linkage disequilibrium even between loosely linked markers. So essentially, it destroyed Lawnton's theory. I wasn't the only person to do this. Mukai and Chuck Langley had also independently been estimating LD. Deborah actually was involved in the project as well. As well, as a sort of sideline on her postdoctoral work. But there was really little connection between the two, except one was purely experimental, the other was purely theoretical. Brian, I want to know what my reading list has on it tomorrow. Do you have a favorite paper of yours that you think people don't know about? That you think people don't know about, but they should? Well, for some I don't know about myself. The one I gave that some thought. There's a paper which I did with Chuck Langley and Wolfgang Staffin in 1986, and that was in genetics. And it said basically two things. One is a selective reason why you might have suppressed cross-sectional. Why you might have suppressed crossing over among functional highly repetitive sequences like telomeric and centromeric sequences. And basically, the idea was you want these things, you need the right copy number. And so if you have too much crossing over and unequal exchange, you get the wrong copy number. So there's a selective advantage to suppressing crossing over around centromeres and telomeres. The second was, given that you've suppressed crossing over, You've suppressed crossing over, there could be a mechanism for accumulation of more repeats in the regions of suppressed recombination, basically because if you undergo unequal exchange, you end up with an absorbing boundary where you end up with just one copy. But if you suppress recombination, you're not vulnerable to that loss of the repeats. So we thought that was kind of a neat idea. So we thought that was kind of a neat idea, but it sort of fell flat, I would say, partly, I think, because it's beyond the comprehension of molecular biologists who can't think in population terms, as you probably have encountered this problem. And I don't think anybody in the population genetics community was interested in the problem. So it fell sharply between two stools. I thought it was a nice piece of work, and Wolfgang actually went on and did some. Wolfgang actually went on and did some deeper theoretical modeling of it and showed it really does work as far as the repetitive sequences accumulation lower combination regions are concerned. And of course the empirical evidence for that is overwhelmingly strong. This is actually what happens. But it's history. The world passed it by, but you're welcome to go and advertise it to all your friends. And this is only one of many of your papers where it really preceded the major empirical effort or expansion of our understanding. And so centromeres have been studied substantially in the last 10 years in our understanding of repeat evolution in centromeres. So I like this idea that the reduced recombination is really needed in the centromereic regions to avoid. Regions to avoid collapse of the number of repeats. We also pointed out that there was evidence that if you have crossovers near centromeres, this causes non-disjunction. This was actually work done by a chap called Ed Garber at Chicago, who's another interesting character, actually. And in Astadago. which is now called Microbotrium. He pioneered the genetics of that system, in fact. And he had a nice paper on that. And this is now widely accepted in human genetics and fly genetics that crossovers near centromeres can cause non-disjunction, and the mechanism is quite well understood. He didn't know what the mechanism was, obviously. At the time. At the time. Thank you. So it's another reason for suppressing crossing over near-centrum is you end up with the wrong number of chromosomes at some rather small but measurable frequency. Right. So Brian, today it seems, you know, as much as ever there's a role for theory in biology and genetics and evolutionary biology. Do you have any advice for people who are just entering the field now, just getting started? Entering the field now, just getting started. Well, yeah, I mean, you might go and work for a hedge fund. No, well, if you want to. I mean, you just have to have a. I think there are lots and lots of problems. I don't think there's a problem in finding a problem. It's just, I think the main thing is to try and find something interesting which hasn't been done before and which you can actually do. I mean, that's one of the big problems in science, is finding something that's both. Science is finding something that's both interesting and doable. We had a faculty member in the genetics department, John Pateman, who his view of science was, well, everything that's worth doing has been done, and everything sorry, everything that can be done has been done, and everything that's worth doing can't be done. That's really not good advice to give to give science to someone. It isn't even true. But it's kind of a, you know, it's a lucky dip in some sense, finding stuff which is both interesting and actually doable, especially within the course of a PhD. I mean, I think a lot of PhD students come to grief because they just, you know, end up with something which looks very interesting, but they can't really do anything much with it, or else they can do something with it. It's really boring and they get browned off by the problem. I don't have any. I don't have any real advice on how to find something which is worth doing and doable. It's kind of a bit of a lucky dip, I think. Yeah, that seems true anytime. I'm wondering if there are ways you think things have changed, you know, nowadays versus previously. Oh, I think it's a lot more difficult now, certainly in the sort of population and evolutionary genetics era, because with all experiences. Because with all the expansion of sequencing and stuff, it's not good enough for somebody to sit down and be able to scribble some algebra. They also have to know all this stuff about bioinformatics and sequencing technology, etc. I mean, it's totally beyond me, and I'm always amazed at what my colleagues can do in that respect. And, you know, there's a huge range of different. And there's a huge range of different skills I think you need now. I mean, in my day, genetics was largely a matter of looking down a microscope and pushing some flies or looking at salivary chromosome bands or worst case scenarios running electrophoresis gels in the lab, which even I could learn how to run a gel with a few occasional lab mishaps due to absent-mindedness. But now, I mean, it's it's very demanding, I think. It's very demanding, I think. You have to have a broad range of skills, and it takes a lot of energy and time to acquire those. So I think it's a lot more difficult. I agree. I want to go back to the point about how do you find, identify those good questions. But one of the things that really stood out, I think, in your career is just how closely tied empirical. Closely tied empirical work and theory were. Yes, I spent a fair amount of my time doing work in the lab, actually. I mean, probably more time than doing the theory. I used to do a lot of work with flies, breeding experiments and counting flies and looking at saliva gland chromosomes. I haven't done any of that for years now. My back is kind of giving out, so I Is kind of giving out, so and I really lost the appetite for sitting in a bench for hours on end. But I think it's good to do that in some ways, because one of the problems of being a real theoretician is you've got to have an exaggerated respect for the quality of the data. When you actually collect data yourself, you know what all the kinds of problems that are lurking there. And when you do an experiment, you're never quite sure. Well, is this? Quite sure. Well, is this result really true, or is it just some kind of screw-up somewhere, which I haven't thought about? At least that's always been my worry. Yeah, that makes sense. And to some extent, the questions that you then are like, yeah, could this be something else you can address sometimes more easily through theory by changing all of the possibilities and seeing if it still will work? You mentioned collaboration, I think, as something that it may be incumbent upon new theoreticians to do. Are there other ways you think that things have changed? Well, computation, of course, computational power is ginormous compared with what was available when I was starting. I mean, Deborah and I were. Deborah and I were among the first graduate students at Cambridge to use a computer to analyze our data, mostly analyses of variance programs. By God, was that tough. The computer was located in the University Mathematical Laboratory, which was about a half an hour bicycle ride from the genetics department. And the way it worked is you would tie it. You would type in your code on punched tape in what they call flexi writers in the mathematical lab, and then you'd feed these things in and the machine would process it. It probably had about 1 20th of the power of a mobile phone or 1 200th, I don't know. And then you'd cycle back, and then you'd come back the next day and look for your output. And of course, usually when you write program, it's all full of errors. Full of errors, so take days to actually get something to work. I'm surprised you kept keep adding that for punched cards. I mean, it was a nightmare. I mean, it got better with punched cards. That was quite a pleasant advance, but terminals didn't come until mid-80s. I mean, we didn't have terminals at the University of Sussex remote terminals until about 1984. And that was kind of bliss. That was kind of bliss in a way because it's so much easier to write and debug a program than when you had to fool around with punched cards. The worst with punched cards, you know, you go down the stairs, you trip and drop the whole bloody pile, and then you have to spend sorting them into the right order. I think that's an ongoing issue, isn't it? I was just in preparation for this this morning, reading your paper on background selection, 1993, and you have a line in it. And you have a line in it. It says right here: the program was written in the C language for a Macintosh 2 computer with a Tektronics RP88 coprocessor, which probably was like a very fancy thing at that moment. It was, it was quite good, actually. Yeah. Yeah, that was Martin Morgan actually did the programming. It was nothing to do with me. But yeah, the desktop computers were just kind of blue. Computers were just kind of bliss compared to that crappy old technology. And they were just as powerful as a mainframe by then. An old-star mainframe, obviously not a supercomputer or anything. So that's been a huge change. It's a double-edged sword in some ways, I think, because now there are all these sort of off-the-shelf simulation packages like Slim. So now, in So now, enthusiastic amateurs, as you might say, can get into doing simulations. And without actually a guiding framework, I think simulation can be a really dangerous thing to do because you don't know what to expect. So you take results at face value, you don't really know how to interpret them, etc. So I firmly believe if you're going to do simulations, you should have some idea what you expect from some rough. From some rough theory, that what's going to come out of it at the other end, otherwise, you can run into trouble. I won't name any names. This is being recorded. Yeah, right. One of the things that I feel has changed over the last century is just how subdivisions. Over the last century, is just how subdivided biology is, where you're getting more and more trained in molecular genetics or biochemistry or population, evolutionary population biology, or community ecology, population ecology. Anyway, how does the splintering of fields, how do you think that has influenced theory for the good or the bad? Well, the good stuff is, of course, with the molecular revolution, you can actually apply classical population genetics theory to the real world. Before you could look at DNA sequence variants, there was limited areas in which you could analyze selection acting on inversions or study sickle cell hemoglobin and that kind of stuff. In and that kind of stuff based on bacheloria, the usual suspects. But to apply, for example, the infinite sites model of molecular variation, until we had a reasonably good base of DNA sequence polymorphism data, there really wasn't much you could do with that theory. You know, there's that famous passage in Dick Lawnton's 1974 book about the. 1974 book about the elaborate machinery which has been constructed by the theorists, and you've fed in the electrophoretic data and there's a sort of clashing of gears, and you know, nothing much came on the other end. And so now the field of population genetics at least has got the ultimate data. I mean, there's nowhere else to go except DNA sequence for data. And if we can't do a good fist of analysing that, well, Do a good fist of analyzing that. Well, we might as well pack up our bags and retire to Florida or somewhere. So that's, I think, a huge benefit. The downside, maybe, is there's just so much data we don't know what to do with it. And as you say, you know, it requires so many different skills, computational, technological, etc., etc. Technological, etc., etc. It's, you know, getting into a situation like physics, really, where it requires teams of people to to actually produce a single paper. And that's fine, except I think it can be a bit demoralizing for a lot of people involved. You know, you see all these genome sequence papers with God knows how many people on it, and you know, you know, one of them is, you know, like. You know, one of them is like some guy at the Large Hadron Collider who's responsible for tightening the bolts on the magnets or something. You're not feeling you're seeing a broad picture, I think. I don't know what the people involved in these big teams actually feel about this kind of work, but it's any advice that you could give people starting out about how People starting out about how to keep that broad picture in mind, or just to know enough about different areas to synthesize? Well, I think something which strikes me is a lot of people don't actually try and read the classic literature these days. They sort of assume that something which was published more than, say, five years ago is kind of irrelevant. And I think one thing one is a good thing for PhD programs. thing for PhD programs, and some of them do, I know we did it at Chicago and I know other people do it, is to encourage students to read classic papers and get a broader picture of where the field has come from and realize that not everything was discovered in the last five weeks or whatever. Some very important things which you should know which were discovered a long time ago. Discovered a long time ago. One of the nice things about Drosophila genetics, as opposed to population genetics, is that the people, even at the absolute cutting edge of the field, people like Scott Hawley, have an enormous respect for the old masters, Bridges, Marlowe, Sturtevan, those guys. Whereas I think people in other branches tend to forget there's a history of the field. There's a history of the field, and they think the latest thing is the only thing which matters. I think in PhD programs, it's important for students to get a good perspective on where the field has come from, as well as, of course, knowing what's going on at the present. It's a hard act because there's so much now. I can understand where the problem arises. Well, that leads very well, I think, into what will be the final question of this interview. It really comes through in your work, the constant reference back to classical population genetic results and work. And you have initiated a number of what turned out to be very fruitful lines of research with lasting importance. Many of the theoretical things you have done underpin analyses of data today. Pin analyses of data today, you know, from molecular data, signals of selection, and so on, to properties of age-structured populations. And I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how and whether you saw these things at the time as new areas for research, and how it allowed you to see these as good problems to work on? I I don't I'm sort of I never really I'm not one of these people who has a sort of organized plan of what I'm going to do next really. I sort of um kind of wander into things and I mean we discovered background selection by the back door so to speak which was Martin Morgan was running simulations of a modifier of Simulations of a modifier of the rate of stalfing introduced onto a background of deleterious mutation. And we thought we'd just check that everything was working properly by instead of putting a modifier with an effect, it just put a neutral mutation in it to see whether it followed the rules which neutral mutations were supposed to follow. And we discovered they didn't, that the Soljon time in particular was considerably less than what the diffusion equation Diffusion equation result predicted. So I thought, oh, well, we screwed it up somewhere, you know, so we checked it all through and it looked fine. And suddenly sort of light bulb went on. Well, actually, yeah, maybe the deleterious mutations are doing something which pulls down the effective population size. And that's why it's not obeying the rules, which, of course, started us thinking about that. So, you know, it was entirely serendipitous, I think, to be honest. Dipotus, I think, to be honest. It wasn't something we set out to discover. Uh um but we we had an observation and I think this is actually quite common in science. You find something which doesn't quite fit. So you think, well, you know, something going on there. I need to try and understand what it is. And so, you know, it's kind of problem solving, really. Something gets your attention. And I think it's always, I think somebody said, you know, tragedy or Somebody said, you know, tragedy or exceptions. Maybe it was Sturtevan. You know, something which looks funny. Let's try and think it through. The other thing which also happens is people accept things. When we started out, breeding system evolution was all for the good of the species. It's absolute dogma. It's absolute dogma. And, you know, I used to think about it for a few minutes. Even when I was an undergrad, I thought this doesn't really make a lot of sense. But I didn't, Deborah and I didn't do anything much about it. But later on, we started thinking, well, you could actually do things which don't require the good of the species. And I think it wasn't just us, there were quite a lot of other people involved. The whole tenor of work in mating system evolution has changed completely since the seventies when the since the seventies when the the good of the species, which is still, I think, quite a concept dear to a lot of molecular biologists, but you know, it's vanished almost entirely from evolutionary biology in the naive sort of way. I mean, there's still arguments about how important group versus kin selection is, but it's conducted at a totally different level. So, I mean, looking for anomalies and challenges. Looking for anomalies and challenging accepted thinking, I think, are good ways to find things which are worth doing. Obviously, you can go too far. There are irritating people who are constantly trying to create a new paradigm. But there's always scope for cracks to be filled in the edifice of science. And there are things which people have overlooked. Everybody Overlooked, everybody makes mistakes, and so I think that's a way for forwardists to look for those cracks and anomalies and try and deal with them. Thank you so much, Brian. Is there anything else that you would like, any parting words of wisdom or anything else we haven't asked yet? Honestly, we seem to have covered a fair bit of ground, I'm not sure. We have. Got words of wisdom. I mean, I would certainly like to think that we've got lots of enthusiastic young people coming into the field, but I realize that it's got ever increasingly difficult for people to get proper jobs in science and that kind of stuff. But I hope they'll have the courage to face up to the difficulties. Well, I think it's inspiring to. Well, I think it's inspiring to learn about careers like yours where, you know, without a strong math background, that didn't keep you from becoming one of the most influential theoreticians of our age. So thank you for this conversation today. Well, thank you a lot. It's been a lot of fun.
