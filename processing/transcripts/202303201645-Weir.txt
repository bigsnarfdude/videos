This is from a lot of people summarizing a bunch of the stuff that we're doing at our office. I just wanted to point out we have a big aerosol group as well, and I'll talk about aerosols for like all five seconds. But they exist when we state constituents or composition, they're included. And I'll try and be a little controversial today, so that's all on me. Because you're being recorded, though, right? Yeah, oh yeah. I mean, Yeah, oh yeah. I mean, you've met me before. Now it's gonna get a little... Alright, how do I move forward with all this stuff? And I gotta keep you awake. Right? It's not this. It really wants me to shine. Oh, it worked. Thanks. Um oh I was Googling today and I had to include this. This is like almost exactly a decade ago. Kaya's right there. I'm right there a little skinnier, not any taller. But thanks for inviting me. This place is wonderful. I'm glad to be back. Hopefully, we can be back here. Hopefully, we can be back in another decade, maybe less. Part of this meeting that I thought was wonderful is this paper came out of it. All the authors are in this picture. And this was some particle filtering work where we looked at collapse and high dimensions. And that was about the last time I did anything theoretical. And that's the last theory you're going to see in this presentation. But I just wanted to highlight this. Um but I just wanted to highlight this because I love that meeting. This one's off to a great start. You know, here we go. Okay. So mainly the thing that I want to talk about is this thing we're calling R21C Chem right now. This will be our first all-atmosphere chemical reanalysis, right? So from the surface to about 0.01 hectopascal, right, about 70%. Hector Pascal right about 70 kilometers. It will use, and I'm going to have to define some of these terms for you. We'll run GEOS CF retrospectively. CF is our forecasting model that uses GEOS chemistry. And it will use our data simulation system for constituents, CODAS. I'll talk a little bit more about that. Meteorology, we use this approach called replay. For the sake of a shorter talk, you can think about it as a nudging. Can think about it as nudging. Basically, we keep our math constrained to a reanalysis. Usually, that's MERA2. The R21C comes here because we're developing a new one called R21C. But all the examples you'll see in this talk are from World 2. We're going to run it 25 kilometers horizontally. We'll have 72 levels. And we will, so we do have some capability to do about 12 kilometers. Have some capability to do about 12 kilometers for the data assimilation with carbon. The chemistries will trick you when you're doing that globally. Aerosol is the same system we use. And we'll talk about updates to the aerosol system at the end of the next slide. And obviously, some speakers have touched on this, the coupling of aerosols and chemistry is important. That's something that we're still working on for this reanalysis. We're going to try and do as much as we can, but To do as much as we can, but with the understanding that you have limited time. So, CODAS is this thing that I've worked on. There's three papers that we've used it in. There's not really actually an official documentation paper for it. But basically, what I did is took our ozone assimilation that we use in the NWP systems and just found everywhere where there was an O3 and deleted it and generalized it to take NW. Deleted it and generalized it to take anything that we want to give. So it's tracer agnostic, right? And you can give it anything that's a point observation, a point sample like MLS, or something that has an averaging kernel like Tripwire Me or CL. And it is publicly available right there. It's part of GSA DAS, which Ricardo maintains. You can use whatever type of fancy system you like that's supported in the GSA DAS. System you like that's supported in the GSI. We stick to 3D bar because it's good enough for our purposes. And it's the backbone of several existing and upcoming products and I'll talk a little bit about those. So yeah, just some heritage for the products that we've developed already and that will go into R21C Chem. MERO2 is very well known, right? This is a MEP analysis, but it has stratospheric aerosol, tropospheric, water vapor, and aerosol. Work water vapor and aerosols. There's the carbon work that I've been working on. That's the carbon species, white CO, CO2, and methane. Meriti scream is something we just released. This is a reanalysis of MLS. So it has stratospheric water vapor, we'll talk a little bit about that, N2O and some other reactive species. And GOCF is our forecasting full chemistry model. Model, and that will assimilate NO2, an SF2, and also the 9.6 micron 3-band from Chris. So yeah, the idea is that with our 20 minutes in chem, rather than having all these separate systems where people are like, wait, where do I go get it? That's all going to be together in one place. This is a figure to overwhelm you. So these are the data streams that we're planning on using. Dark is Using dark is pretty much set, light is overlap periods where we'll do tuning and bias correction. And dashed is places where a product should exist, but does not currently. And we would assimilate it if we could get our hands on either the JPL Tropis retrieval or a retrieval from NOAA that seems a gold. So that would be great. So you see a lot of the air quality stuff on top, OMI, ozone, NO2, SO2, the stratospheric chemistry, both bands of MOPIT will transition to tropomi once those are decommissioned. And the legacy of methane, right, and CO2. So that's our rough plans. So that's our rough plans. Just put it all out there. And you know, this is just to sort of beat you over the head with it. The whole goal here is to take all of these different data streams, all these different science applications, and to put them all in one place. So, some examples for you. The carbon assimilation, we assimilate CO2. We assimilate CO2, methane, and CO, right? And the idea is to produce time-varying fields, 3D fields. It's just a little example showing you, for instance, OCO2's tracks over 16 days. The dots here are not to scale, right? It's got a 10 kilometer swath both. So if I had drawn them to scale, you wouldn't even see them on the screen. So it really highlights the need for assimilation. We're very far away from. We're very far away from something like MODIS, where you have a wall-to-wall coverage. And what do we have here? So this front is mainly 50 kilometers. I'll talk about how we're moving to 12. It has an observationally informed flux package, right? So we use ODIAC for fossil CO2. This takes inventory data and disaggregates it spatially using nightlights and power. Spatially using nightlights and power plant locations. We use NPVI for MODIS to determine vegetation and then net ecosystem exchange by radiated power for burning. We apply surface growth with NOAA, although we might move away from that. But the main point of all this is to say that we have a prior that is very good. When we stick it into inner comparisons with flux inversions, we With flux inversions, we beat some flux inversions. Okay, so I'll come back to this later, but for CO2, we actually know a lot about fluxes. For CO2 as well, our assimilated products, so when we assimilate our CO2, this is available on GuestSys. This is a level 3 product. You can also see visualization still there. And despite some inflammatory things that I'll say later, we are still. We are still doing flux inversions. Suresh is working on this, and this is still part of our plan. So this is just to show some of the climate action that we've been supporting. This is our stuff getting shown by Al Gore Kopp. That's Zerbukin up in the top, the former head of science at NASA. That's Karen St. Germain. She's had her science. She's had earth sciences now. There's a couple articles in the press about it, and we've had these few papers. So maybe another title of this slide would be that pretty pictures are important and very important. Okay, so now I'll get on to the controversial stuff. So, fluxes are unverifiable. No one here verifies fluxes. They verify concentrations. There's a few fluxnet sites, things like that, control releases. And this is mostly for CO2, but I'll make the argument for this on other gases. Except for a few kilometers within a few hundred sites across this globe, you cannot verify fluxes. It's just another estimate with its own uncertainties. Own uncertainties. You do do an indirect verification through concentrations. And our priors, which I think I don't want to name names, there's people using their thoughts here. They shouldn't even really be called progress, right? Like, we use nightlight data, we use all this data from MODIS to construct these things. They are data-constrained and they are quite good, many cases. Are quite good in many cases. If you think you know the transport perfectly, you are fooling yourself, right? When you say you're verifying fluxes by looking at concentrations, that's saying you know the transport perfectly, and that is just catly not true, especially from an office that produces realities. They are horrible. They're not horrible. They are very flawed, and anyone who Very flawed, and anyone who works on them will tell you that they are flawed. So, and then, okay, now we'll get really controversial. Fluxes don't matter at all. Okay? What matters is processes. You know, if you tell me that the flux out of some grid box that's one by one or four by five is this number, that doesn't make a bit of difference. What matters is, is it the tree growing more? Is it soil organic carbon changing? What matters. Carbon changing. What matters is the processes. So those are the things we have to get a handle on. And over the past 20 years, I haven't been here that long, but have we really made much progress on whether there's a CO2 fertilization effect, a longer growing season, forest regrowth? No. It seems like we have even more possibilities. So what really matters is that we nail down the processes that are changing the levels of That are changing the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which are warming the planet. Doesn't matter what the flux is. So, yeah, exactly, knowing exact fluxes everywhere is only half the problem to the Paris Agreement. You have to know what to do. If you knew exactly what the fluxes were but didn't know why, it wouldn't help you. So yeah, our argument is to assess processes with constant. To assess processes with concentrations, right? The verification happens on the concentration level. You assimilate concentration observations. You're not assimilating flux measurements. You're doing everything on the concentration level. If anything, the inversion of the grid flux level is a distraction. And so we have this perspective paper. I encourage you to read it, to write horrible things about it in the literature. The whole point of this is to start this. Point of this is to start this debate, right? Is to argue over this and to not say, oh, it's just fluxes. No, it's certainly not. And then on top of that, there's been a recent NASA RFI about greenhouse gas monitoring, and they talk about this all the time, right? We need to increase resolution. Okay, so I sort of disagree about plumes for CO2. We understand CO2 plumes better than anything else in the world, but I love Nicolas. But I love Nicola's slide showing how even at nine kilometers things are washed out, right? Those happen to be the signals we know the best in the world, so I don't think we need to estimate them. But we have to push down to higher and higher resolutions. You're just not going to do a one-kilometer global inversion. I mean, there's just not enough computing resources in the global system. So this is just a snapshot of our This is just a snapshot of our 12 kilometer assimilation run using OCO2 for CO2 and tropomy for methane and CO. I liked this with the eastern seaboard, even at 12 kilometers. If you know much about American geography, and I'll forgive you if you don't, nobody lives there in Pennsylvania. That's a power plant. That's actually not New York, that's power plants in New Jersey. And the Hudson River Valley is a very cool place that a lot of people are moving to. Very cool place that a lot of people are moving to, but certainly a comparable number of people don't live in the Hudson Liberal Valley as New York. So these are all power plants, and at 12 kilometers, you can actually start to see them. So I think I'd actually agree with Nicola that the 12 is probably still too coarse. There's a famous scientist that works at Goddard, Compton Tucker, and he has a 12-kilometer MDVI product that's widely used, and he doesn't even want to release. And he doesn't even want to release it because he says, I want to go down to the tree scale. That when you really are starting to do actionable science, it's when you can tell me, where's that tree? Where's that tree? And how is it growing? So this is all just to show that we're working towards a higher resolution. And yeah, one kilometer would be great, but if you're trying to infer fluxes and run that back for a year, have fun. So, okay, more stuff. Mario 2 Scream, this was a product that Chris Origin led. It's, you know, most of the stuff we're doing here, 50 kilometer replay of Maritu, we do something cool where we turn off the stratospheric water vapor and then assimilate MLS water vapor. So there's BRAN, there's a reanalysis out of Bella. Out of Belgium. But as far as I know, this is really the only realistic data-constrained reanalysis of stratospheric water vapor and tropospheric at the same time in the same system. It's at 50 kilometers, which is way higher resolution of Ram. It's publicly available also on GuestDisk. This is just a little example plot, and then this will be a nice transition into the next plot. This is the tape recorder, right? So this is drop. Right, so this is tropical water vapor anomalies at the tropopause, near the tropopause. And the one shows you just a model where we have a stress for the chemistry model, no simulation, we run it. The middle is MERI2, and MERI2 is sort of ridiculously bad because it just relaxes to a climatology and a stratosphere. And the bottom is our work with MERI2 Scream, which really starts to show these. Which really starts to show these deep variations that we expect to see. And we were pretty pleased with this. And then, if you look on the very bottom, you see this giant signal here. And I think some people might know what's coming. So that was Hunger Topic. And so this is a movie that works. Yeah. And this will just show water vapor. It's masked out at a number we never really see in the show. Out at a number we never really see in the stratosphere. This is about 26 kilometers. You see the volcano go off, and you see this just huge perturbation of water that they're like nothing I've ever seen before. The thing that we think is really cool about this is this is a case where the constituents really feed back on the meteorology. So, the right plot, to give you like just sort of a general overview, says that if we had had this in Mera2, we basically And MERI2, we basically would have had to make no analysis increments to the temperature. The water vapor temperature effect is exactly what MERI2 was missing and had to correct. So this is a case where you really could have gotten a nice impact on the net assimilation system had we had this on. Unfortunately, MLS is going to die in about a year, and we have not launched a replacement. But I will say there is an instrument on a space station, Sage 3. We've done some other work. I don't think I have it here, but it does surprisingly well for solar occultation. And it does sort of capture Hungary Tonga, so there is some future with that, but it's really sad to see this instrument go. This is more of Chris's work, just part of the thing. Just part of the thing that we're really excited about with this reanalysis is it allows us to identify these extremes and to quantify them in quite a remarkable way, right? So he's highlighted in different colors. Early 2019, this is a dynamically driven anomaly that Gloria Manning has written about, but I don't think there's been much talk about what this exactly was. We usually can tell, right? Can tell, right? We've got sudden stratospheric formings, these are common, right? Strong polar vortices, we've got the Australian Neederspires and the Honga Tonga version again. So that's just sort of highlighting all the fun things that we can do with Scream. Okay, so CF, which is actually just some really impressive work. I'll show a movie. This is surface ozone from CF at 25%. At 25 kilometers. Here's some documentation. You can see everything on the FLUID website. The CF provides, I think they're going to be the prior for Tempo. They provide a ton of support for field campaigns. This is just a really great tool, and it's great to see our office pushing this hard in a constituent direction. And so, this will be the chemistry. And so this will be the chemistry backbone of everything that we do, right? The chemical mechanisms here, geos chem, that many people are well aware of. This is an example slide. So if you're running a reanalysis, or actually really any analysis system, you can't predict volcanoes. So eventually your list of volcanoes is going to run out and you're going to have an eruption and the system, if it doesn't have A system, if it doesn't have a way of accounting for that, it's just not going to have the volcanic signal. So, what Christoph did here is he assimilated OMI SO2. So, the trial run has no SO2 signal from the Malbola eruption. And when you actually see the thing, you can see that the assimilation does really quite an impressive job capturing the SO2. Capturing the SO2 signal from the Mauna Loa eruption. This is still quite recent, right? So it's rare that in these talks we show something from the past few months. And so yeah, all of this we would be missing in our SO2 if we didn't have assimilation, right? Because we just don't have volcanic eruption. You can't list every volcanic eruption that's going to happen. You're going to miss some. Move on. I guess you have to have an obligatory COVID slide. So we had a paper about CO2 that we used our system with and highlighting the potential reductions in CO2. And also Christophe had this paper about NO2 and ozone. And it just really highlights the versatility of our system to do all these things in the same place. To do all these things in the same place, and here with the WMO channels, like no duplication of effort, right? It's all using the same methodology, same systems. So it's really great. Okay, so that's all R twenty one C. After that, we will be moving to Jedi. This is a a joint effort from a whole bunch of different centers. And it will be the basis of And it will be the basis of future coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations. So, you know, in the net world, that's really important to move to a system where we're actually able to do these together. And I would assume that also we'll have our land surface model coupled. We already do run the land surface model, so we already have some coupling in that regards. Constituents. It's interoperable. You can take your UFS or a UFS or your FE, you know, whatever FE3 flavor you have. And so it should, hopefully, when everything gets all together, be this system that you can do a lot of things with a lot of different systems. We do do aerosol data simulation. I wanted to touch on this a little bit. One of the great upgrades that's coming in with Jedi is that typically this has just been A or D, right? It's just been. Just been AOD, right? It's just been a 2D correction. They're moving to a state variable that is vertically resolved. They're going to assimilate different wavelengths and be able to assimilate things like LIDAR. And they've been refactoring to a next generation system called Part 2G, which is also available to the public. I will wrap up. Hopefully, we'll get questions. I hope I. I hope I was provocative enough. So, GMAO maintains a number of state-of-the-art systems, including models and simulation projects. Our code is all there for you to get on GitHub. Probably going to be difficult to run if you don't have a supercomputer. You can download all these products on Guest Disk or the Gmere website. They're publicly available. The GMIR website, they're publicly available documented in literature. We are working on increasing coupling resolution and fidelity with R21C coming soon and further interoperability with each other. That's it. Raise your hand. I'm going to have to ask the question. So if flux are not important, how do you go from the concentration to the processes? What is the transfer function that you're using there to get an informed understanding of that phenomenon? That's great, and that's the obvious message. Right, so in that paper we said, well look, you can do mass balance. There's some things about the cube and some internal aspects of geos where like, yeah, maybe you can do mass balance, but not for the next 10 years. So that's one option that's not likely. You can do parameter estimation, but that is just as expensive. But that is just as expensive, if not more expensive, than a flux inversion. And also, if you're looking at a biospheric model, much of what it's giving you is spin-up. So you can't really estimate parameters live, right? You need to go say, okay, well, I want to adjust this parameter. And you can do but I mean, what I would argue is what we've been doing for 200 years. For 200 years, which is science. And it's to say, my concentrations look funny here. They don't validate well to this. Well, what could be the answer? Well, maybe my biomass burning is wrong, right? If you look at our seasonal cycle of CO at alert or at barrow, it's way too small. It's probably because we don't have enough biomass burning in the yard, right? And that, then saying, oh shoot, we're missing. And that, then saying, oh shoot, we're missing all this biomass bringing, how do we fix that? You've then identified a process and fixed it. And meanwhile, you'll get different fluxes, right? You've changed your flux ass. But I would argue that you do science, what we've been doing for generations, which is to, you know, look at all the different possible explanations and try and pin it down to that thing and then adjust that thing. But isn't that what we're doing in our flex inversions, right? You know, you're adjusting our. Inversions, right? You're adjusting our biomass burning, or we are going to adjust. Well, that's what we were trying to do. Do we? I don't know. I mean, I don't. You are certainly adjusting for CO2 net ecosystem exchange in a four by five box. I don't know if that's I don't know if that's addressing a process, if that's saying, well, it was biomass burning, or it was soil carbon, or it was this or that. I think that's where we start to really get some great gains. I'm not saying we're doing it, so just saying we should leave open the possibility that there's more to a flux inversion. To a fluxing version. I think, so the paper that we wrote is much more tempered. And I think in that, what we say is that flux inversions are an intermediate step. They're helpful. They're certainly a thing that we need to analyze against. But the true goal is processes. The true goal is understanding what the heck is trying to do. What the heck is driving biospheric uptake, and dear God, can we make sure it doesn't turn off? And I think, you know, as we go to, as we move away from getting at these sort of new fluxes and start looking at capturing the diarrhea variation of fluxes, right, you have no choice but to start thinking about the processes of that. Yeah, and that's where we are headed. With OCO3 and it would have been wonderful in GeoCard. Yeah, one short question. So why can it proceed as follows that you have a look at specific processes in a way where they differ? For example, going back to CO2. Photosynthesis as a source thing and the CO2 respiration is day and night. Photosynthesis is day. So CO2 respiration is rather CO two respiration is rather constant over the day. If you are a little bit more specific about the beyond where you know that they act differently grassland forests, so if you go into detail, I think there should be a chance to make finally sum up to CO2 flux and others. Yeah, and I mean that's what Dylan alluded to, right? What Dylan alluded to, right? So, for satellite data, for the most part, all we have right now is 1:30 over past time, right? So, we only see it at a specific time. OCO3 does get a bit of a diurnal cycle, but I mean, we're still doing, and that's a great example, we're still doing science there. We can't really make heads or tails about some of the signals we're seeing with OCO3. And we're not going to make heads or tails out of them by doing flux inversions. We're going to make heads or tails out of them being like, well, what could this possibly be? Well, what could this possibly be? Could it be that I have too much diurnal respiration? You know, I mean, maintenance respiration does change diurnal, right? So there's a lot of, you know, is this too much maintenance respiration? Is it too little heterotrophic respiration, right? And that's exactly what we should be doing. And I think it is sort of what we do. That is really the history of science, right? Okay, so thank you. Thank you very much.
