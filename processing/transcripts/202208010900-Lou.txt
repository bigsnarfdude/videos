is from Shanghai Teorgian University. As we all know, he was at Harstead University before and he's an expert in diffusion. And he will speak on asymptotic analysis of principal values for time-theoretical operators. So, again, go ahead. Okay, thank you, Chanvong, for the introduction. Okay, thank you, Chang Vong, for the introduction. Thank you to the organizers for the invitation. Yeah, so as Chang Veng said, I recently moved to Shanghai about seven months ago. I would like to welcome all the older friends and new friends in the audience to visit Shanghai when the international travel becomes all safe. So today I'm going to talk about So, today I'm going to talk about some principles and value problems. I'm sorry that this is a bit away from the theme of the workshop, but somehow it's also connected. So the problem which I'm interested is the following. Suppose you have a time periodic operator, probably in the simplest form, in partial phi, partial t minus d Laplace phi. La plus phi plus a zero order term c of x t and is equal to lambda phi. This lambda is a eigenvalue. So we know this has infinitely many eigenvalues. And if the function c is say continuous and time periodic, say with unit period, the principal eigenvalue is the is the among all eigenvalues, there's one eigenvalue which has a Eigen value which has a least real part, and it's selfish, it's real and also simple. So, this is a follows from so-called Klein-Rutterman theorem for compact positive operators. The question is the following. How does this principle given value depends on the diffusion rate D? There's a long history about this. Unfortunately, I will be able to review the Be able to review all the results. I apologize because some of the people in the audience actually made very important contributions, but I'll mention two references. One is Peter Hess. He wrote a great book on parabolic operators, and I want to pay tribute to him. And another paper which inspired this research was the paper by Harrison, Mishankov and Project. Uh, Mishakov and Project in JMB over 20 years ago. They start this question because of the motivation, because of motivations from the competition for ecological models. So recently, we run into a similar situation for some reaction diffusion models for infectious disease models. So I will start to motivate our all well, I will give the old motivation for disease models a bit. For disease models, a bit. Maybe this will take about five to seven minutes or at least. So the model originally we gave in 2008 within the Allen exactly is worth the following. So suppose you have two kinds of, you divide the population into subclass. So which is one is called S, called susceptible populations, and the other is called I, is called infect populations. And assume Populations and assume these two populations do the random work. So, suppose this is omega, we do the random work for both populations. And assume, and so this means that this S will be contacted. This beta is a so-called disease transmission rate. So, there's a contaction, so this is called infection mechanism. Infection mechanism. So it will become infected. Then assume the publication will be covered. Okay. In 2008, we assume this contact rates or the transmission rate depends on location. For example, in suburbs, airports, hospitals, maybe the interaction, because it's so crowded, the interaction, all the contact between people. The contact between people are much more frequent than those in, say, suburbs. Okay, people live in suburbs, what it means, right? In suburbus, you rarely see your neighbors until Sunday or the weekend, right? Okay, so it's really we don't see each other that often in suburbs. So it depends on location. So under this assumption, Under this assumption, there's one important concept in fact, this is called reproduction number, so-called basic reproduction number. It turns out that this reproduction number is nothing but so-called related with a piece of eigenvalue for elliptic operators. It's related by the say minus di. This di is the diffusion rate for the infect populations. Gamma is the Gamma is the recovery rate. Beta is the transmission rate. And this lambda is eigenvalue. So we all know this is a self-joint, positive self-joint operator. So we know there's infinite many eigenvalues because the transmission rate and the recovery are both positive. So we know these rates, these eigenvalues are all positive. And so there's a smallest eigenvalue. For this particular For this particular model, the basic number, reproduction number, is nothing but the inverse of the small segment value. And it turns out this R0, they call R0 is the threshold value. So that's no issue. Unfortunately, even though this model gives some predictions, which are biologically meaningful, but there's one particular But there's one particular prediction of this model, which we quite feel puzzled. The prediction is the following. If beta over gamma is non-constant, then R0 is strictly decreasing in di. This follows so-called as a variational characterization of the R0 because it's a self-joint operation. Mathematically answers no issue because di appears here, right? DI is lost. here right di is larger so di becomes increases it will the implies r naught decreases it implies a more unlikely unlikely outbreak of disease so so this looks like a perfect mathematically for the biologically it's a bit against our intuition It's a bit against our intuition because what is DI? DI is the infect rate. This is the diffusion rate for infect populations. So they got infected. So intuitively, we feel if the infect populations move faster, the disease should be much easier to have outbreak. Easy to outbreak have outbreak, our narrative should be bigger, it's opposite against our intuition. So, so we were puzzled by this. So, how to address this? So, recently, there's a different modeling approach to try to address this issue. One possible way is to consider time periodic. So, in 2012, Ray Pen and Xiao Chan considered. Ray Pen and Xiao Chan considered extended model and considered the case where, say, the transmission rate beta may be time periodic, or this recovery could be time periodic. This biology, this makes sense because we human beings do our behavior. So, for example, we work five days a week. We work five days a week, rest two days a week. So, this is a certain time period, or we work in the daytime and rest at home in the night. So, it's like 12-hour period, right? So, time periodic could make sense because of human behaviors. Now, here comes the basic repression number for the time periodic model. It is given by the by the principal given value, the inverse of so so look at this. This is at a joint, this is a time period operator. Omega is a frequency. I load this way using exactly using the way Harrison, Michakov, and Peter Project load in JMB to. Uh, 2001, the way you know, put the frequency here, okay, and put the diffusion rate here, okay, and ask how the basic repression number now depends on these parameters. Shelton and Raypan also prove this R0 is the special code value. There's no issue. The question is, one of the main question is: is R naught still Are not still decreasing in DI or not. If you read the paper by Harnesson in Tuesday and Constantine and Peter in JMB 20 years, more than 20 years ago, you know, this is not true anymore because there's at least two possibilities. But it turns out there are at least three possibilities. So I'll tell you. So I'll tell you what the situation is. So suppose this is DI, this is R0. One possibility is decreasing. This is not surprising because this is like the gamma only depends on X, beta only depends on X case. So we know this must be there, this case. And if you And if we read the paper by Peter and his collaborators, Harris Vivian and Constantine, we know this also could happen. It is the simple situation could be increasing and then decreasing, right? So recently, we found this another situation which could also happen, and actually could be quite frequent, is the following. Is the following is that it's decreasing and increasing and decreasing, or more complicated than this. So in other words, if we add the time periodic condition, the situation becomes more, there's more possibilities. But biologically, this makes sense because look at this part. This part and look at this part. So, what this means is that for some ranges of the diffusion rate of the infect population, R naught could be increasing in DI, which is at least intuitively looks more natural in certain situations. So, here's the buzzword. So, including camp. So, including temporal variation, maybe more realistic sometimes. So, how do we prove this or how do we get these three possibilities? Because it was not obvious, at least to me, the middle one is not obvious. So, the way to do it is, it turns out this is related with a question by Vivian and Constantin. Vivian and Constantine and Peter in the same paper of GMB in 2001. So they ask the following question. Suppose you consider a linear time periodic parabolic operator, omega partial phi partial t is equal to di La plus phi minus gamma phi plus random phi. And they conjecture that the principal eigenvalue is Moronton. Value is monotone increasing in the frequency. If you read the paper, this actually they have even numerical evidence, numerical pictures to support it. It turns out this is true. Three of young colleagues and myself wrote a short small paper in Proceedings in 2019. In 2019, we proved that if we fixed the eye, the principal eigenvalue is increasing in the frequency. I don't have time to talk about this. It turns out this is related with the so-called incomplexable fruit. Questions? Roughly speaking, this omega is very much like the speed in the drift of the time derivative. Okay, so this is somehow related with some conjecture by Henri Brasigi and his collaborators and Amel and Nadreshiwary in 2005. But I will not go deep. I will not go deep. I will not go much into this, but this is our starting point to understand, to get these three pictures. So, how do we do it? The way we do it is the first step is fairly straightforward. Essentially, by the same proof, one can prove the R naught is decreasing in the frequency because R naught is one over the principal eigenvalue. One over the principal eigenvalue, so that's not a surprise at all. So, it's a quick extension. But this is not what we want because what we want is we want to understand are not the powders depend on di, right? But this only tells us it's decreasing, so in omega. So, it's like a function of two variables. So, this R0 is like a function of omega and di. Of omega and di, we know it's a monotone decrease in the first variable. What can we say about its dependence on the second variable? That's a that's a question, right? Usually, there's no chance one can do it, right? But it turns out one can do it for this case. There's three values which are important, which we call an upper bar. This is like the time average, time space average. Average and there's another number which calls a star. This is like a time average and a space minimum, minimization minimum. This one, this number is even a little stranger. It is the following. Suppose this is x direction, this is time direction. This is time direction. And suppose the period is equal to one time direction. So consider any one period function, x of t. Now we integrate the function gamma over the curve, over this curve, over this curve, divide by the integral of beta over the same curve, and then minimize over all pure functions in this set. It turns out. Set. It turns out these three numbers have the following relationship. Oh, I write here. They have this relationship. It turns out these three numbers are pretty enough to show these three pictures, to show these three pictures. How can they happen? So I'll just quickly go over it. The way to do it is to consider the level set of this. Of this piece of n value as a function of the two variables. So, so this A is like the level, the level or the energy level or some whatever. So, this A could change, right? A changes, the level set will change. Now, because the piece of eigenvalue is the monotone in omega, so this is really a graph. We can draw this as a graph. Now, once we know. Now, once we know this is a graph, we can ask what are the two ends of the graph, or what is the domain of the graph, or how does the graph look like? What is the topology of the graph? Usually, this looks like impossible because the principal eigenvalue, if we look at this principal eigenvalue problem, looks like how can you tell the level set, right? There's no chance, it looks like, but. No chance, it looks like, but it turns out that one can do it. So, the answer is the following: suppose this is a diffusion rate, this is a frequency. Now, if we assume a lower bar is equal to a star is equal to a upper bar, then the level set starts from here and go to infinity. And each one has a horizontal, no, each one has a vertical asymptote. Has a vertical asymptotes. So the topology of this k, the topology of the level set of the principal eigenvalue in terms of the two variables diffusion rate and frequency is very simple in this case. Now, what does this tell us? What does the level set tell us? Right? It's a natural question. So it turns out, if we fix the frequency, If we fix the frequency and draw a horizontal line, and if we look at this, the simplest situation will be for the horizontal line to intersect each level set exactly once. That's a simple situation. So, what does that mean? It intersects with level set exactly once. If you have experience of If you have experience of climbing the mountains, for example, in this case, suppose this is the top of the mountain, and this is the bottom of the mountain. And if we come down like this, the simple situation is to go over. to go over the sea level exactly once or right you know if if if we are if we we if we don't miss make mistakes right so if we go down so you you run into the sea level each sea level at the most once so this is exactly corresponds to level set in this case and this is case where uh a lower by is equal to a star so if Bi is equal to a star. So, if you look at the other situation, look at this case, these two values are the same. For this case, all the level sets are different. It is all the level set will converge at the origin. This looks a little strange, right? So, if you do the same, if we do the same thing, draw the horizontal line. So, the possibility is to run into the level set, level exactly twice, or it doesn't cause a level set, right? It doesn't check level set. So, what this means, if you use a simple situation, is this is like this is like the top of the mountain. Mountain, uh, mountain. Sorry, okay, I'm a bit rush. Okay, mountain, mountain. So, so this is the situation you go up the mountain and coming down. Now, the middle situation is actually the genetic situation, it is exactly these three values, they are not. Is exactly these three values, they are not equal to each other. And this topology, this topology of level set, is a combination of the left and the right, because some of the level set go to the origin, some of the level set will go to infinity. So if we want to draw this, the one possibilities is the if this is r naught, this is di, this is going down, going up, and coming down like this. Like this, so of course I cheated. Okay, one way I cheated is, for example, what happens here? What happens here? Because there's some level sets which meets at the origin, right? It turns out this is a singularity because origin is like a singularity. So it turns out the question is that what happens this limit when the diffusion rate goes to zero, when the frequency goes to zero. To zero, when the frequency goes to zero, what is the limit of this principle? It turns out, for example, when d go to zero, omega over square d go to a fixed number, then this eigenvalue goes to the so-called critical value for the Hamino-Jacobi equation. So this is time-periodic Harmino-Jacobi equation. So, in other words, this time period HJ equation is very much like a first approximation of the original problem for this double degenerate, double zero limit. Okay. All right. So, so that's pretty much how we get these three pictures. Okay. So, so recently, I only have a lot of time, so I'll finish. Okay, a lot of times I'll finish. I'll stop after this page. So, recently, we considered a more slightly more general situation. What happens if we include the first traditional term? And your students can consider principal eigenvalue for this. And you can still ask the question: how does the principal eigenvalue depend on the frequency, omega, diffusion rate, or even the drift rate, alpha? This we don't know much, unfortunately. So, unfortunately, we only know a little bit about this case. For example, what Ray Pen, Maoling and Shang Liu and I did in 2011 last year, and also last year in transactions. We made a bit small progress if we incorporated the drift. The drift. So I'll finish with one thought. Maybe. So previously, a lot of analysis or difficult analysis are focused on the small diffusion limit or larger drift limit. I usually try to call this called local analysis or called asymptotic analysis, which is in my title. So, but as you can hear, But as you can hear, probably from, I hope I make it a little bit clear. I feel that nowadays we need somehow global analysis of these principal eigenvalues. For example, to determine the topology or even geometrical structures of the level sets, for example, of these principal eigenvalues in terms of parameters because of the potential applications in biology. So I'll stop here. Thank you. I'll stop here. Thank you. Questions or comments? So you are in the picture where you have three possibilities. The middle one gives you this one you are talking about. You are talking about or this one, which one? This one? Um, yeah, this one. Okay, so what do you think? Is there any uh upper bound, say, on the number of critical points, or do you think it can be arbitrary? Uh, that's we don't know. Uh, Peter, that's a really tough question. Uh, we only know this is a simple situation, but we don't know how complicated it can get. So, so what's that's why what I'm saying. So, that's what I say. I only know the topological structure of these level sets. Unfortunately, I don't know the geometrical structure. In other words, I don't know the crickle points of these level sets. So, that I don't know this either, unfortunately. Now, when you go ahead. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I cannot hear you. You were saying something, so I just want you to finish. To finish, you start with the sentence, I interrupted you. Go ahead for some reason, sorry, I cannot. Let me try again. Let me try to hear what Peter says. Can you repeat again, Peter? Just continue what you want to say before you interrupt it. Still ask you to go ahead. Oh, so. Oh, so we know this is a simple situation, okay? But it could get much more complicated. Okay. That's all I know about it for the moment, for this moment. Yeah. Yeah. So now when you include the trip, makes the equation more general, supposedly you can make the Do you think that with the drift you could make the number of critical points as large as you want? So I think if you perturb, if I intercept the previous question more, if you perturb, say, A of X plus something G of X T G of XT. I don't know whether one probably can create more local maximums. Maybe. I don't know yet, Peter. So roughly speaking, so whether this is possible, this here, you know, many times it's possible. I don't know, Peter, at this time. It is even, we don't even know the answer for two patch models. You can consider the same question for two batches. Okay. We don't even know that. Whether you can have many local maximums or not. Sorry, I can maybe I missed three questions, but yeah. No, no, that was the question. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Peter. Yeah.
