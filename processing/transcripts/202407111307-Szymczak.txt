Okay. Oh no, maybe let me begin by thanking you for being here and I think it's a great place and great opportunity to meet and mix between people of very different backgrounds and very different subjects that they are studying. So I think cafes are an example of this, but I will hope that at the end you will like. Yes, so I will. Yes, so so I will I will be doing a sort of a sort of a general intro fats and then I will go into the work that we have done together with together with my alien colleagues on the growth of very large maize caves which are fed by tepal mortars. Okay, so that slide you have That slide you have actually seen on Tony's presentation, because he was also quoting Lyle on basically how to grow a cave. That's probably the first mention of the fact that to have a cave, you need the solution. To have the solution, you basically need some aggressive solution, which you can get, for example, by mixing water and CO2. And then you And then you get cargonic acid, H2CO3, which dissolves calcite, which is the main ingredient of limestone, and the cave opens. So for now, you can ask, okay, but what's there for us? What's there for the looking maniacs community? There are loops, right? So first of all, case are relatively simple system. You have flaws. Simple system, you have flow and you have transport of concentration of the calcium ions that, as I will be mentioning in a moment, this is controlling the solution. So, two fields. And this can lead to a variety of patterns. So, I'm here showing you three patterns that I will be mentioning about. So, branchwalk pattern, which is basically a tree, mazes. Mazes and anastomosic pattern, and the last one is like a sponge-like pattern. All he gives us as a system of fractures. And during this workshop, we had many examples of remodeling of the initial system of well, conduits or tubes and so on. Now, all the vascular models are basically based on that. Already was also talking about the race, so you Also, talking about that, right? So, you basically take a system of small cubes, yes, and then you see how it is evolving. And it can evolve into very different patterns, as I was saying. Okay, again, Tony has quoted, I think, all the important equations which are controlling it. I succeeded in reducing them to three equations. Reducing them to three equations basically. So one is the the fact that it is dissolving. So the distance between the walls in a fracture is increasing in proportion to the dissolution current. And the simplest but pretty good model for the dissolution current is basically that it is a constant, which is called the reaction rate, times the under saturation of calcium ions. It's exactly what you do when you are trying to dissolve something in a Of something in a glass, say. You are adding salt, adding salt, adding salt, but at a certain point you are reaching the saturation concentration, you cannot add any more, right? And the solution at this point will basically stop. Okay, so you need to know the C, this concentration of calcium ions. So you also need the transfer equation. It basically means the flow rate dc dx is equal to this reactive current, yes? Reactive current, yes, because this is producing your calcium atoms. So these three equations are important. And let us go like this. Okay. Now there are basically two large classes of caves which have very complicated names, hypogen. Complicated names, hypogen versus epigen, and basically epigen means something on the surface, and hypogen means something from the depth. So epigen caves are the caves that probably every part of you have seen. These are fed by surface water, CO2, enriched by soil and atmosphere, and so on. So basically, these are fed by. So on. So basically, these are fed by sinking streams, yes, and then these sinking streams are dissolving the fractures and creating those components. On the other hand, hydrogen case, they have maybe something to do with the figure that Oliver was showing with those flow and something like this. So, you know, you have recharge going deep into the earth, where there are different processes, maybe magmatic processes, it's basically partic uh Is basically hot as well, and then it goes up again. And then these waters are also carving caves. It's much harder to discover them. You basically, if you want to discover them, it needs to be purely by accident. You cannot really follow the water, you know. But sometimes in a quarry, you know, you're quarrying the wall and there is an opening, you know, you just by accident touch on the border of this hype. Of this hypogen gas. So I will, the main subject will be hypogen, but I will very briefly also mention epigen. So epigen, this means that, okay, it's fed by the surface water, which is aggressive, so it opens up the fracture, as you see here on these photographs. Now, there is a slight problem, already Tony mentioned that, that if you calculate how much of a fracture will be opened and how quickly. Will be opened and how quickly that concentration will get saturated with calcium ions. Then you are getting that penetration length again mentioned by Tony, which is the flow rate over the reaction rate, more or less. And this is for natural crack structures, is of the order not more than ten centimeters. And that was noted by White and Columbia in nineteen sixty two with the conclusion that cave cannot exist. That caves cannot exist. Because everything basically saturates, so we have no caves. Now, but caves do exist. So here I am after, you know, after experiencing the existence of caves. Here is Ronic, who is a co-author of this work, and here is Boas Langfunk, who is the author of all of the nice photos that I will show you here. This is Radost, also. This is Radost, also shown by Matiek, and this is Bishop who cannot be with us today because of the problems. We are just emerging from Herosha Vaya Mai. Okay, and again, Tony mentioned what is the solution to this paradox. You know, the solution is unstable. So in the experiment, even if you begin with a fracture, you end up with a jump. You end up with something circular, which is focusing. Circular, which is focusing all of the flow. So the flow, instead of going uniformly along the fracture, this entire flow goes in this small tube, which means that the flow rates are huge in such a tube. Huge flow rates mean very large penetration length. So you can really open up the cave if you don't want to dissolve them via fracture, but just a code. So that's at least our, you know, our hint that we published with only 50. Okay, so now. Okay, so now staying still within the epigen caves, the surface caves, most of these surface caves look like this. This is so-called branchwalk cave. It has many inputs. So all of these beginnings are the places where different streams are going inside. And usually it has one output, okay? And you know, just for it. And, you know, just for the tea time, I think Stashak will be explaining why it is like this. But it's not unlike the jellyfish, you know, if we are about finding connections between different crazy things, right? Where you see many inlet channels and then just one outlet channel. In fact, you know, I was reading again Palmer's paper about case, and he is commenting on that. There is a cascading effect in which the linkage of each tributary to a pre-existing Of each tributary to a pre-existing passage causes a sudden drop in hydraulic gradient within the tributary and the rearrangement of the surrounding potential field. So there is, you know, these linkages are really changing the pressure field and then you get more linkages, which means the reconnections trigger further reconnections. And the first one is to the end of the system. So in that way, you have this sort of cascade. Okay, now, but if I would But if I would, I mean, I hate the branches, right? Because I am on a looping network meeting, so I need loops. So, how to create loops? Remember that you began with a structured network, so you already have slow conduits. So, really, there are connections between these ones, but they are just not open. They are in their baby state, those fractures. So, you basically want to invade all of the Basically, we want to invade all of the fractions. This is one of the biggest caves in Europe, Hollosch cave in Switzerland. And you see that it is a mace cave, so it has many loops, many convections. And basically, the splendologists agree that this is because it was carved by floods. This is in the alpine environment from time to time, you have all of that snow melting, and it has huge floods. Again, the penetration meant these floods. The penetration length is flow rate over the reaction rate, which means that huge flow rate can enter all of the channels and open all of them. In fact, in huge Slovenian caves, there was a famous experiment where they put little pieces of limestone in different places to monitor how fast it is dissolving. And the answer was that it was not dissolving at all. Which means that basically the clay formation paradox is well. Formation paradox is working. If you have a huge clay to most of the channels, normally no under-saturation, no under-saturated solution can reach. You need flats to really dissolve it, which is interesting, because this means that extreme events are important. It's not a new concept, yes. The first one was pastor Alexandre Katkot, who basically thought that, of course, all of the caves were made during the were made during the biblical flood. Because then you are getting a lot of water, which basically enters underground and carves the caves. For him, the proof was that he could find the shells of sea snails inside the caves in England. And there was no sea in that neighborhood, right? So this is like taking this flat concept to the next. Okay, so we covered more or less. More or less ambiguous are formed. Now, what about those caves that have no linkage to the surface? First of all, so we cannot get the water plus CO2. We need to have some other sources of aggressiveness. One of the most popular concepts here is so-called mixing corrosion. You have two saturated solutions with different content of. With different content of CO2, with different CO2, and you mix them, you are getting under-saturated solutions. So, if you have one source of water from this direction, another from that direction, and it mixes, it suddenly becomes aggressively can dissolve something even very deep inside. Another concept is condensation corrosion. So, this is something, how much time do I have? I was just so. Okay. I mean, tell me at some point because you know, not nine. You'll know five minutes before. Five minutes. So, okay. So, the other concept is condensation. Corrosion, this basically means imagine that I have hot water here, you know, then the vapor will condensate on the walls and then it will become aggressive. It can mix with CO2 of the cave. Again, it can create. Of the case. Again, it can create an emptiness not connected to the surface. And the third one that I will be talking about in a moment is the cooling of thermal waters. Now, there are incredible examples of huge hypogen caves. The ones that I'm showing you here are giant gypsum caves in Ukraine. This is Pozerna cave, or later cave. And this is optimistic cave because you need to be. Optimistic cave because you need to be really optimistic to get up. As you see, there is this huge, huge maze. It has 264 kilometers of passages, so if you get lost, you really are lost. So these ones are apparently dissolved by something which is called Transverse Hypogenic Model by Alexander Glimchuk, recently deceased. So, this model is like this: that you basically have insoluble layer, again another insoluble layer, and then the soluble one, and the water rises. It may be, for example, treadmill water that rises from the depth. The distance there is pretty small, you know, can be one meter or two meters. So, water on that ray will not lose too much aggressiveness. And if it will rise uniformly, And if it will rise uniformly over a large region, you will basically just open up all of the fractures and you will have your urine mass. And this is a very popular concept nowadays, this transverse hypogeny model. Now I will tell you a bit about our caves. So here is one example, and we are making this case with Tainat, Aharonov, and Raguirodek. So these are the caves in So these are the caves in Israel. What is remarkable about them is that they are they are below the aqui-clute, basically imperfable layer, and then there are faults, like vertical fractures, leading towards them from the depth. So, okay, again a nice photo by Boas of one of these caves. So basically, what is going on? Water, hot water, as we think, gives. Hot water, as we think, descends in a fault, in a feeder, like a candry, and then it heats this impermeable layer, and then it begins to flow radially out. There is a large surface of contact then between water and this layer, so it cools down. As it cools down, as it cools down, it becomes aggressive. This is this one mechanism. This one mechanism that I didn't explain yet. Basically, you have experienced that for sure because if you like tea or coffee or whatever, and if you need to boil water, then from time to time you need to clean your kettle. You need to clean your kettle. Why? Because as the temperature goes up, calcium solubility goes down. So you are actually having the stains. And here it's the opposite, you know, the temperature goes down. You know, the temperature goes down because the hot water is cooling, so the water becomes aggressive and can dissolve constantly. And that's a pretty large effect. So basically, because I think my time is slightly up, this is the concept. Water is going there, then it is distributed radially, diverted sideways, and then cooling leads to a large increase in calcite solubility. And this is not only good to create a cave, but it's particularly good to create a mass cave because you know I am cooling down a bit, so I become aggressive, but then I dissolve, I dissolve, I am becoming saturated with calcium ions, but then as I cool again, I can become aggressive again. So there is this possibility of really becoming aggressive over a very large distance, over the distance that the water is. Over the distance that the water is cool. So we implemented it numerically. I will not bore you with all of the details. Basically, I think you understood the setup and you believe that we are able to code it in. I will just show you the results. So this is like going radially from the figure sideways along the radius. The temperature is dropping. Now, here is the under-saturation of water. The under saturation of water. So there is. So first it's zero, then it climbs up, and then it goes down again, which creates a cave which has a shape like this, like the UFO, with a hole here, right? Because actually there is very small dissolution at the beginning, very small at the end, and the biggest one some distance from the figure. And this is interestingly consistent with the field observations, that you don't have large holes in those caves near the feeder. You need to go a bit away from the feeder to see the biggest resolution. This is what you need. And okay, and this, I guess the last slide, we have also done the simulation, the network model simulations of the solution in such conditions, and we are again getting. we are again getting very nice very nice nice nice calves okay so the summary is in three points if you want a cave you need to provide under saturated solution you might do it in very in many different ways now but you of course want a base cave so then you need to give me undersaturated solution you know everything everywhere all at once you know so that the entire network will Entire uh network will uh dissolve. And one way of avoiding this is by virtual booking. Thank you very much. There's plenty of time for motion systems. Do geysers form in similar ways? What about geysers? Are they similar to this at all? No idea. I have nothing about the geysers. Cases, but in the cases, so yeah, yeah, because I think like other time, it's it's both about the temperature but also about the CO2. So, you know, when the water is degassing on the surface, it's also degazing that markets, not only cool. With these radial caves, it seems like it's the similar instability to a It's the similar instability to a helish whistle's fingering, which would lead to just wormholes in all directions. So, what is the key about the dissolution to be not repelling one another typically? So, it's a very good question. So, it is a little bit different from the warm force, because in the case of the warm force, In case of the workhouse, no, they this is under saturated, under saturated, and this is saturated solution, okay? So the locals compete for the flow of the under-saturated solution. You can think of isodization. I am wanting ACID here, and everybody wants to have this ACI because then they can grow. But the only service is here at the inlet, whereas Windows. That. Whereas in those cooling caves, you have sources all around because all of that is cooling. And cooling means that you, even if you have saturated solution, by cooling it, you make it again unsaturated, you make it again aggressive. So you have another way of providing aggressiveness in the entire system. So you don't really depend that much on the flow from the input. And that's why it doesn't have the standard. And that's why it doesn't have this tendency of making just a few components. So it's a sort of self-sustained process. This kind of rather cooling that leads to another saturation. It is self-sustained in time and not that much in space cause cause. Uh because the ah so some of the Okay, anyway, that's the correct one. So the temperature the temperature goes down as as you as you see, yes, when the temperature, you know, they if it will cool to the temperature of the rock. Will cool to the temperature of the rock completely, and that takes place over, say, 25 or 50 meters. That actually depends on the flow rate. But if it will cool, if the temperature of this overlying rock and the temperature of water become the same, it is no longer aggressive. So there is just a limited space where this can take place. Kind of like a question. Uh so this uh condensing water on the wall of the cape cannot like also arguate and use more close and so increase if you want the solution rate so can you have a self-reinforcement special classing of uh when that's important? Yeah, so uh as far as I know the the main uh result of this is uh if you If you visit a cave, it makes sense to go to look up. And very often you have very nice cupolas, very irregular cupolas, even like hemispherical and so on. And some of them are from the condensation corrosion. But I don't think, you know, so that is a bit of trickling down, yes, but I don't think, I mean, it is not like a huge stream. It is a very thin film of whatever, like 100 microns or something. What kind of time? What kind of time scales do these caves form of? Because it's like a prodigious amount of rock being dissolved. Yeah, but basically what is known is that these caves are much less dependent on hydrology in that sense that a normal cave, you know, really changes the hydrology around it. So very often like the third first level is dissolved and then water goes to the second level and this level is no longer dissolved and so Is no longer dissolved and so on. Whereas here, this water is basically raising for thousands of years. But we have shown that with that mechanism, you can get a pretty large casing in, say, 50,000 years. So I was wondering about the you can have multi-levels of M3D. We should have talked about well enough, but then 3D now. Is it possible for more 3D structures in this checklist? Uh so I uh I mean uh I don't I don't really know. Uh i I think here the id the idea was that there is this there is this feeder, you know, going up and then it hits a really impermeable impermeable. Yeah, you should show me a bad photo. I mean it might look as a very bad photo, but it's not this impermeable capron, you see, and these are those And these are those caves which were discovered because they were basically quarries with rubs, and those are the openings of the caves. So this really takes place very close to the simple component. I had a question raised about early on in your show, that multiple features connecting stuff like that. What makes them actually So this is clearly, you know, those are clearly the properties of the road below. So I am not a geologist, but when you talk to geologists about this formation, this limestone formation, there are technical sources, you know, like individual faults, but not as dense and as many as in green in s as in uh green geographies. In the green joker class.
