So I'll start with a disclaimer about this t-shirt and what happened was that my luggage was lost on the way here. So all my t-shirts now have some sort of I Love Bank type of later to it because I bought them downtown here at the tourist store. But that's good because now I have lots of souvenirs and this is a wonderful place so it could be worse. But does this work? It does. Okay, I'll talk about what I have to talk, but alright. Or I have to talk, but I already gave half of my talk on the icebreaker on the first day. So I just want to add a little bit that Mahinora is planning the hike for later today. And I did go on a little hike on the first day before we heard about bears and bear sprays and all of these things. So I was naive and went walking around a little bit. And I was looking at the pictures yesterday, and I did see a bear. Two of them, actually. And I walked around. And I walk around this path here. And if you look closely enough, there are two bears down here with a new. And I saw them, but they didn't see me actually because of the canoe. So that was fortunate for me. But yeah, you can walk around and there's this thing here that looks a little bit like the polymers that we are working on all the time, these purple polymers that make things on Newtonian. And beautiful things along the way. So, like these little houses here with birds, we live. Birds, we live here, so that's nice. And before we talk about the Non-Newtonian parts, I want to make a little art detour and to explain a little bit of what we do at Corelab, because I see that this is a little bit of a date between two communities here. There's a good part of the people that know quite a lot more about Monettonian fluids, and then there's the people like me that don't know much about Monettonian fluids, and I'm more on the porous media side. So, what we do is to try to understand basically how liquids and gas. To understand basically how liquids and gases and fluids in general move through porous materials. So, this is an experiment here. It's a modified handy shell cell with a porous medium in the middle. It's a bunch of glass beads and then there is the blue stuff. There is some water. So, this could be a model for an aquifer, for instance. And then we do experiments on this thing. So, here we are 3D printing a porous media. You see it's an ordered structure. And then, if we inject air, you have this type of a very beautiful pattern. It looks a bit like a snowflake. It's completely ordered. Like a snowflake, it's completely ordered, so it reflects the order of the underlying pore structure. If you have disorder instead, then you have here the hind jumps that you asked about before. So you see that the air is displaced in the liquid from the pores mean, you have this very intense burst activity, and you have this type of pattern that you call the viscous fingering, also a ramified pattern, very interesting as well. So those are transient dynamics, and we are also quite interested these days on a steady state. Quite interesting these days on the steady-state dynamics. So, this is a system, it's a 3D printed monolayer of a poster of cylinders, and then we are co-injecting two different fluids, a water and a silicon oil. You see alternating here. And then you have like this intermittent dynamics. There's a lot of this bubble snap-off type of things that you showed in your presentation. So, we see that happening naturally inside the porous medium as well. And we study that depending on And we studied that depending on the relative fraction of the type of fluids that we have here, the speeds and so on, what kind of steady state would you get? Let me try to characterize that and see how that fits within the theory, the statistical description for true-phase flow that Alex has presented. So that's kind of like one of the goals. And you see, over the time, there's a lot of beautiful images that we stumbled upon, like not only me, but people working in the group. I'm going to show just a couple here. So these are some computer simulations. Couple here. So, these are some computer simulations of flow paths in a porous medium. This is a drying experiment, somewhat similar to what Ilaria has shown. It's kind of like a mud type of thing, like a slurry, like a deformable porous meat, as we call it. And then as it dries, it forms these leggings. This one is an experiment of fracture in plaster, same type of thing that you use on your arm if you break your arm. So all of these things are quite interesting to look at, even if you don't care about the physics behind. Even if you don't care about the physics behind. And what we did is that we collected a lot of this image and we had an art exhibition. It was next to the city hall in Oslo in 2021. And then we also had an online one, which you can also see on the website. And it's really cool. This is how it goes. It's a little bit like a museum. So you have all the pictures of the experiments and the simulations there, and you can walk around with a bench there if you want to sit and so on. And I like to show this not only because it's nice to see. Not only because it's nice to see, but also because this is, I think, a very good tool to expose your results. We all stumble upon very beautiful things as we see in your studies. And it's actually a lot easier to make than it looks. So this is just something that the whole community, I think, could make use of. And then as a result of that, 2022, I think, we got approached by this person, Mirella Vladucci, and she is a curator. Curator and she has a gallery in Timichoare in Romania that specializes in science and art. So I think she just googled science and art and somehow stumbled upon Alex and then Alex contacted me. And so this is her gallery and the art center. And then we started this project where now it's really like an art project because we got involved with artists. So it was four artists and four scientists, both from Norway and Romanians, for porous matter, and it was a physical exhibition. And it was a physical exhibition with artworks that were based somewhat on the type of science that we do at Core Lab. So we didn't tell the artists what they should do, we just invited them over, they hanged around the lab a little bit, and then came up with something. And that was really cool, that was very interesting. So here there are some of the words, and then there's another room with other words. This is a robot that captures CO2. There is a sensor there that you blow on it, and then it measures your CO2, and then it captures. And then it measures your CO2 and then it captures like this. Come out. It's art, okay? So there is a room for it. And this is a fantastic artist that we met there, Florian McCander. So she made this thing here, which I really, really like, and I think it fits quite well within the context of flows of porous media and all the kind of flows. You see, like, this is a tube, it's a liquid and a gas, and that she makes flow through this leaf here. And the thing gets this very interesting dynamics. You can control the pressure inside of it, and then you have like different. Control the pressure inside of it, and then you have like different modes that it operates in. Really, really interesting. This is one from me, actually. This is an experiment that I made to be like Axie, to play it's a spiral. And we had lots of people playing with it, lots of kids came up. And one thing that I learned is that if you put like a syringe with dice close to kids, you know, like they don't know that if you press one, you should not press the other at the same time because it's a closed circuit, so the liquid goes clean from one out from the other. The liquid goes clean from one and out from the other. The kids just get both of them very fast, like this, and then it's like blue liquid all over the colour. So that was part of the fun. And this is also, there's the website about that as well, it's called porousmatter.art. And there is a little bit of a description there, and some of the artwork is there as well. In Romanian. So it's an interesting opportunity to learn Romanian. But yeah. Okay, so end off of the art business. Back to the non-Utonian business. And this is the project. And this is the project that I want to talk about here. We want to link anomalous diffusion and rheology for a droplet spreading in a corner. And this is kind of like a rheometer for power law liquids. So this is a work that it's my first kind of like serious project into non-Newtonian things. I never really worked much after that. So I'm very much of a beginner in this field. And I work together with Kuk Polloy and Aric Flakoy. I'm Eric Flekway, and I've been much helped by this person here, Vanessa Kerr. She is a person that knows about rheometry. So she's the one that really guides me the way in the lab, in the rheometry lab, in the lab of Andreas Carson at the University of Alberta. So the context here is that Eric, so he's a theoretician at Core Lab, and said that I think him and Alex have been working on this type of problem before, and they found a way to solve the Found a way to solve the motion of liquids in this wedge, in this geometry. So, this is a wedge, which is something like this. We're seeing from this side here, but it's just like a V-shape. And it had some interesting consequences. And the consequence is that the dynamics is fights to the bryology of the liquid there. So, we wanted to explore that. And then he told me, it's very simple. It's just like we put the drop there and then you see how it goes. And I said, okay, this is the simplest experiment that you could ever think of. That you could ever think of, you know, expect to be done by the end of the day. And it was not, it was quite complicated, like for many reasons. A good part of it being the fact that I am not a specialist on this thing, so I stumbled upon lots of problems that I guess like everyone that is taking the first steps into doing this type of experiment stumbles upon. But we got something that works now, I think. And that's what I want to show. So the core ideas here is that we have the young Laplace equation, right? So if you have like an interface between the Like an interface between the two liquids, then there is a pressure difference across that. So that's what we have there. There are two curvatures involved here: there's one that is like this one here, and then there's the other one that if you look on this direction here, is that one. This is the one that's important because it's much smaller. So the pressure difference, the height here, if you measure this height here, it's proportional to this radius. So the pressure that drives the flow is just that, this surface tension divided by the height, so it's proportional to that. So it's proportional to that, which is a probability, proportional to the radius. And then, if the height is proportional to the square root of the area, that is the area seen on this direction here, then the pressure gradient can be written like that. So that means that if you have a gradient in height, or correspondingly in area, you have a pressure gradient that drives the flow. So capillary forces drive the flow. Okay? But then what do we have? We have viscous forces. And viscous forces, they oppose the flow. And you can show that for power law, liquids, That for power law liquids, that are liquids that have this type of a stress-shear-rate relationship, the equivalent to a Darcy law would take this format here, that the flow rate is proportional to the linear scale height to this exponent, 3 plus 1 over n, where n is the real-wH exponent. It's 1 if it's a Newtonian fluid, less than 1 if it's shear thinning, and more than 1 if it's shear thickening. Georgia. And then you can just compare, I'm not going to derive this, but if you can just compare that with the case of n equals 1, that is a Newtonian case, so that becomes h to the 4, and that is the Poisson flow, right? So that this makes sense. Okay, so here, capillary forces ramp with flow, viscous forces oppose the flow. And then if we consider a volume conservation, that's if the area grows in time, that's because there is a divergence in the flux, then we can plug these things together and define this equation here. And you find this equation here. It's an anomalous diffusion equation. And it's quite non-linear. You see, there's this term here, a to this fractional exponent. And then the surprising thing is that they have somehow figured out a way to actually solve this equation. So you have like this, all the constants goes into this diffusion coefficient here. And then if you make that type of change of variables there, I don't know if the pointer here works. Oops. Pointer is up here. Okay. So if you consider this type of change of variables, Consider this type of change of variables that the area is a function p of u divided by f of t, where u is this reduced variable x divided by the f of t, you can solve the whole thing. And the solution, the important thing here is that this f of t has this power law scaling in time here with an exponent tau, and this tau is linked to the rheology. And if we measure the position of the tip of the drop, so this is just two times the position of the tip, that position is a That position is a power law in time with that exponent tau that is lead to the rheology. So that's the whole thing here. And then this is a tool, right? Because if this is correct, we can exploit that to measure tau and then to measure the rheology without any sort of force or torque measurement. So that's what we did. And then notice that if n is 1, if we fluid is Newtonian, and if we plug n equals 1 here, 2 times 1 divided by 5, 2 divided by 5. 5, 2 divided by 5, so that's 0.4. The exponent tau is 0.4. So this is an experiment with silicon oil. There's one thing that's quite convenient here: that you see that it looks red, but the fluid is actually not red. It's transparent. There is no dye involved here, but there is a little bit of an optics trick that there is a red band behind. And then, if you position your camera at the right location, the liquid itself acts as a lens. And then we see the liquid red. So that was nice. Red. So that was nice. And here is the measurement: that the position of the tip as a function of time. So the green curve is what we have for this experiment here. It's a 6.1 centis exposing. And you see that it does follow very reasonably a power law. The exponent here is 0.43, so it's just 0.03 more than the prediction. So two fluids of a very different viscosity, but also Newtonian, this is fifty centiscopes, three hundred and fifty centiscopes, they all follow the same power law. They all follow the same power law. So that was very good. We can track the profile. So, this is just an evolution of the profile of the drop for different times. And this is the velocity of the tip. You see, it starts very fast, and then it slows down in the dynamics there. And then what did we do? We just made a bunch of fluids, a bunch of different power law fluids using Zentengun, different concentrations. And we measured the rheology of those in a proper rheometer, so in the Anton Power. Proper rheometer, so in the uncomparable rheometer. And then we see all of these boots are power law up to a given shear rate where it plateaus through a Newtonian network. So this is something that people know from the literature. And then in this regime here, it is power law. And then we get the exponents in there, the rheology there. And then that's when things started to go really wrong. Because when I moved from silicon oil to things based on water, I had only problems. I had only problems. So, and all of these problems were connected to asymmetry of the dynamics and contact line painting and a bunch of things. So, this is a very bad experiment. I very much like to show my bad experiments in presentations, see like this one here. Completely asymmetric. This thing here is even like a punk. That's absolutely not what you would expect. And what happens is that this is very sensitive. Any type of little dust, any type of chemical heterogeneity, anything can disturb it. Disturb it. So that's the same thing here, just showing the asymmetry. So we had to find a way to fix this, to do this differently. So I see that this is about this size. And that's when this person came into play. So I had to move the whole thing to another lab because we didn't have the tools in our lab to work this, to solve this problem. So we went to the maths department. In Oslo, there's a lot of experimental fluid mechanics happening in the maths department. They have like a real. Department. They have like rheometers, wave tanks, wind tunnels, everything. So the construction changed. Now we are coating these two glass slides. So these are microscope slides. We coat it with a polymer. It's a PDMS polymer doped with some other chemical that makes it much more hydrophilic. And we also plasma treat the thing, and that is to reduce the contact angle. I'm going to explain a little bit how we do that. Little bit how we do that. But then, one important thing: notice that because we are coating this with a polymer, when we fold it like this, you get a tiny little curvature at the bottom here. So, this deviates from the perfect analytical case. That is a V, perfect V. So, that is a tiny little annoyance that we had to deal with after. I mean, it's much less than this. It's like on the order of half a millimeter, the radius of curvature, but it is there. So, what we do is so PDM. So, what we do is so PDMS with that pig named chemical there, D-vatyl, silo-oxane, would be ethlane oxide. So, this is something that makes PDMS more hydrophilic. And then you put in the vacuum chamber to de gas it, get rid of the bubbles. And then we do the spin coating, which is inside this machine here. So, this just holds the place like this and rotates at 4,000 rotations per minute. And then you drop the PDMS there, it spreads, creates more or less a faint, homogeneous layer. And then we do plasma. And then we do plasma treatment. Plasma treatment is a very fun thing. If you haven't seen it, it looks a little bit sci-fi. So, this is a machine, you put the glass thing inside. And if you film with your phone, there is some sort of resonance with the camera. So you see like it's round, brown, round. If you look at it with your eyes, you don't see that. But this is activating the surface and making it a lot more hydrophilic. Very important for this experiment to work because it's capillary-driven. We need things to be hydrophilic, right? And it does work. And it does work if I just drop a little some droplets there, you see that it spreads quite nicely. That's how the apparatus looks like. So the wedge sits here. These are 3D printed blocks just to give the correct angle. I have a syringe needle there that I use to put the drop on. This whole thing is inside a what's called a laminar flow chamber, and this whole environment is just to avoid dust. Environment is just to avoid dust. I'm not so sure if it was really, really essential, but it worked. So the experiment now is done a lot more carefully. Here I have a pendant drop on the tip of the needle, and then I carefully move this down until it touched the side of the wedge there, of the polymer, and then it spreads. And now it spreads nicely. So now finally this works. This is experiment number 123. I think I went to some two. I think I went through some 200 experiments with this. It was a pain, but it works now. And here is a little bit of the evolution. Same thing that you did. We just tracked that to get the exponents there. If we zoom in, that's a little bit hard to get the very, very tip of it because the color there is not so intense. But it worked. So this is the Newtonian case. This is the fluid that we have here now. This is the fluid that we have here now, which is something one gram per liter. And you see, it is still overlawed with a lower exponent. So the prediction, if we plug in, if I get from the rheology, this black one, yeah, one gram per liter, if I get the value of the parallel exponent from the rheology there, here, it would predict 0.32 and we measure 0.30. So we are off by about 10% of the predictions. And then what do we do? We repeat. And then, what do we do? We repeat this for very many different liquids, and then what we see is that in this plot of x versus time, a Newtonian is here, and then the more shear thinning it gets, the more it depends that way. And if we plot the experimentally measured exponent versus the theoretically measured one, we see that they fall a little bit along. This would be like the perfect one-to-one line. They fall a little bit like 10% about under this line. Bit like 10% about under this line. The more shear feeling you get, the more you reduce this exponent. So that's what you expect. Okay? So, last thing. As I said, we have this curvature there at the bottom, right? Which is something that's not on the analytics. But then you can deal with that numerically. So Eric has worked out how to solve these equations numerically, putting some sort of threshold that if the film Like some sort of threshold, that if the film thickness is compared to this redness of curvature, then the flow is zero, Q is zero. So, if you post these things, then you can correct the predictions including this curvature. So, here are profiles that you start, this is X and Y, so you start with a Gaussian shape, and you see in time how it relaxes to the analytic solution. The analytic solution is the red one. This is a comparison between the This is a comparison between the simulations in black and the experimental curve, experimental measurements in red. So that works really, really well. Here is the position of x as a function of t, so the same type of thing that I've been measuring for different fluids. So you see the n equals 1, that's the Newtonian one here. And then if you get more and more shift thinning, this exponent reduces. They really are all laws. And here is a prediction of the exponent if you vary that rate. If you vary that red is there, if you vary that curvature. So if there were no curvature, it would be here, 0.18 for these conditions. And the more you increase that curvature, the more this radius gets larger like that, the more this exponent decreases. So it's not strange that the measurements that we are having are a bit less than the predictions from the non-literal theory. It is because of this curvature there. And then if we plug in the results of the simulations, so that's the Of the simulations, so that's the black one here, it really falls a lot closer to the experiments here, the simulations including that curvature. Okay, so I think this is what I had to say. Our conclusions is that the spreading behavior of a parallel liquid in a corner is governed by an anomalous diffusion equation, which is fully integrable, and the solution is tied to the rheology of the liquid. The liquid. And then you can exploit this property to construct a device to measure the rheological exponent for a parallel fluid without any sort of force or torque measurement. So the overall idea is that you would measure this, the spreading x as a function of time, get the Power Law exponent, then this is very easy to invert. You just plug that Power Law exponent there and get the three orange exponent n. Explorer. So that's what I had to say. Thank you very much. Thank you, Marshall, for the presentation. You have time for
