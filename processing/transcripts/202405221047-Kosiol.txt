It is so awesome to be here. This afternoon is free, so if you'd like to incite a toxic Albertan like the boss with Mark Tanaka, this is your invitation. This is actually Bacterial Extinction, and it's my project with Mark. So I'm going to talk to you today about bacterial extinction. And yeah, and I felt like this project kind of catches. Kind of encapsulated, at least in one important way, some of the philosophy that we tried to do yesterday of self-definition, in that it was completely motivated by a question, like curiosity. Mark and I were just curious about this question about the biology, and we've been exploring it. Also, Mark and I mostly I think both think about evolution and Pop Gen and things on that side of the universe, but this is almost completely an ecology question. Almost completely an ecology question. So, this may appeal to the theoretical ecologists in the room. And I'm going to try throughout the talk to make connections as Noah asked us to with other things that we've heard about at this meeting. So, this was inspired by this paper by Stiliana Sluca and his colleagues. Michael Dogli is the senior author on that paper. It came out in Nature, Ecology, and Evolution in 2018. The title was Bacteria. The title was Bacterial Diversification Through Geological Time. And the take-home message, at least for me, was that bacterial species, where species are defined by being above some threshold of sequence similarity, have gone extinct very often through geological time. Their extinction rate is almost the same, almost as high as their diversification rate. So the extant diversity that we see, although it's astronomical, it's Astronomical, it's only a tiny snapshot of the diversity that has existed on the planet. And also, these authors looked for signals of the mass extinction events that affected plants and animals, and they don't see it in this study. This is a phylogenetic study, which is maybe the only connection that I have with the rest of this session, I think, but it was inspired by this phylogenetic study. And so then Mark and I said, like, how do bacteria Like, how do bacteria, like, what are the mechanisms? How are these bacterial populations going extinct? Because the population sizes are sort of billions. Post-associated bacterial populations, okay, I can see how they go extinct. But the vast majority of bacteria in the oceans and soils, in these large population sizes, we know they adapt rapidly. They have a lot of genetic diversity, albeit not the genetic diversity that their census population size. That their census population size might indicate, but still, they carry a lot of genetic diversity. They're adaptable, they're dispersible. So, what are the mechanisms that could drive bacterial populations extinct over and over and over again over geological time? And I will write down the usual suspects because I'm going to refer back to this later. So, of course, there's a really rich literature in Of course, there's a really rich literature in extinction mechanisms, and that literature has been. I'm going to paraphrase a phrase I heard from Carl long ago, which is that literature was developed by and for charismatic megafauna. And so they've so there's demographic fluctuations you're building. Your billion bacteria through normal demographic fluctuations are not going to go extinct. There's also environmental fluctuations. It's another sort of classic extinction mechanism. It could happen. It's hard to imagine that this billion bacteria is swimming around in the ocean, the ocean gets like a little bit colder, a little bit hotter, and somehow that drives the whole population extinct. Seems unlikely. Seems unlikely. Ah, there's Mueller's ratchet, mutational meltdown. Again, we all know that really affects smallish populations. It's not going to be an issue, we think. There's more gradual environmental change, like environmental deterioration, what I'll call the climate change mechanism. In the soils, yeah, maybe, but they're pretty dispersible in the oceans if the ocean gets a little bit. In the oceans, if the ocean gets a little bit warmer and you have this, I envision this cloud of bacteria that just like moves a little bit further north or something. So I'm not saying that any of these couldn't happen. I just think they really explain extinction better for charismatic megafauna than they do for these large asexual species. And there's also catastrophic change. Sorry, that's illegible. And that signal wasn't seen. Wasn't seen. It was looked for explicitly in these data. It wasn't seen. So then we thought, these are all kind of single species mechanisms, how a species can go extinct by itself. And that drew us to thinking about species interactions. And then Joanna, of course, in a very characteristic Joanna way, said, well, of course, that's in Van Baelen, 1973. No one's going to laugh at that. Has that never happened to you? And it is. So there's the whole red queen thing that most extinctions, extinctions happen at a relatively constant rate, and it must be biotic factors. So if we look at species interactions or interactions, there's the immune system for host-associated, but again, most bacteria aren't. Most bacteria aren't. And then there's competitive exclusion, competition, that Daniel talked to us about. And that's actually where Mark and I are going next with this project. But for today, I'm going to talk to you about predation. Because my personal pet theory is that what could be responsible for bacterial extinction is the even more abundant. Is the even more abundant, even more highly evolvable bacteriophages? And so, thinking about this, Mark and I wasted a little bit of time thinking about predator-prey dynamics. These are pictures that we also saw. That was Jeremy, right? Jeremy put these classic data up. Predator-prey dynamics look like this, and on the phase plan. This and on the phase plane, they look like this. And under what situations could you get these circles getting so big and extreme that the nadirs take you down to extinction? And there is some literature about that. And we played around with that for a while. And then we realized there's something much simpler to talk about here. And this is actually kind of embarrassing since I sit in the math department, and the math I'm going to show you right now is like probably the Right now, it's like probably the least math we've seen in this talk or in this conference. So, if we just write down the simplest thing we can do for the bacterial populations sitting at their carrying capacity, I'm going to draw these guys over here. And say we have a bacterial population, like a teeny tiny one, a thousand bacteria. And then the story I want to talk about is host range expansion. So, a new phage comes in. And we know actually the view of phage host range is expanding quite a bit recently. So, we used to think they're very specific. They still are relatively specific to their host, but host range is way more dynamic than we thought before. So, they evolve it a lot. They change, they go back and forth. So, if you think of a new Of a new page coming in, and we'll do again the simplest possible thing. We can do mass action kinetics here. Mass action, the phage has some burst size, and the phage loses infectivity at some rate, doesn't last forever. Really simple predator-prey system. When the new phage comes in, we get these. Predator-prey oscillations, no problem. And what we figured out, though, I mean, figured out, we just tried this, and it seemed like maybe you guys already know this, probably you do. If you start at 10 to the 6th bacteria, there's a lot more resource for the phage. When they come in, The time course that you get is like that for the bacteria. And if you start at 10 to the 9th bacteria and a phage evolves the ability to infect this population, we get something like this. And of course, this is an ODE model. There's one bacterium. Yeah, so these really small population size. And if we think of, it's an OD model, so maybe we think of this as the expected number of bacterium ethanadir. So if the expected number is one, okay, maybe the population survives and maybe it doesn't. And if it's 10 to the minus 3, maybe it survives. And if we have like picobacteria, they no longer exist, right? Exist, right? And so not only is the behavior lower if you start with a larger population size, so I would say the bacterial population is more likely to go extinct. Also, it drops faster. So it goes extinct more quickly. And this is really in contrast to all the other extinction mechanisms I'll show you later that we know of. So with this really simple model, larger populations, More likely to go extinct and go extinct faster. Okay, I'm done now. So then we explored some other stuff. The nice thing about this is it's really general. So it So it doesn't depend much. We can do a different form. We put in handling times, for instance. I thought for sure that this effect would depend on the fact that we're letting the phage infect like infinite numbers, but it doesn't. We can put in the handling time, do the hauling type one, hauling type two, whatever. The form of these ODVs do not predict this effect. It's a much more general effect, but there's so many resources, and the phage, unlike And that phage, unlike other extinction mechanisms, self-propagate. The more successful they are, the more successful they are. And that feedback is what drives this pattern. So the pattern is really robust to the model details. And then Mark did a really nice individual simulation where we have the phages. They meet a bacterium. After some time, they produce a burst of size R. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And this still all holds. So it doesn't even. Still all holds, so it doesn't even depend on the ODE formulation. Is it verbosta spice? I have so next, first I want to take a question from Mark or Pruneetha Maria, and then I will return to Joelle's question. Do you have a question? Is it robust too? I think you're just like my class. So I talked about genetic diversity of these large populations. Populations. So, is it robust to evolutionary rescue? Was the question that I thought I might get. And this question that we asked: so phage develop, or bacteria have developed resistance to phage, and they've got some time to do so. Maybe not much time here, but there's a lot of standing group genet variation here. So, is this robust if we allow the bacteria to evolve? And here, this connects really well to the work. This connects really well to the work that we're going to hear, I think, from Pani about evolutionary rescue and Maria, too, right? Yeah, Tom, too, Tom. Yeah. And drawing over there. So, and here is the one. I wanted to kind of do a slide talk as well because this one figure I'm really proud of. I'm proud on Mark's behalf because it's really all his fantastic one. If we do the probability of survival of the bacteria. Of the bacterial population as a function of its carrying capacity. And we allow for some mutation rate to a rescue locus so the bacteria can escape the phage. Again, as the population sizes get big, they have very little time to do so by de novo mutation, but they carry more genetic diversity, and the smaller populations have more time to escape. Anyway, the bottom line is that for a small Is that for a small mutation rate, where this is one, the probability of survival looks like this, and for a bigger mutation rate it looks like this. And although it's quite a complicated process with a standing genetic variation and divocal mutation and all of this whole ODE system packed into it, in the end, we have an analytical, like quasi-numerical is the lines, and then we have simulations. Close the lines, and then we have simulations, and it's so beautiful. This is the figure that I looks just like that. We're so proud. You'll see it eventually when the paper comes out and we'll all read this paper. So we know that there's still non-negligible probability for bacteria not to survive even at large population sizes. And of course, we don't need all, in fact, we don't want all bacterial populations to go extinct. Populations to go extinct. We expect this should be a rare event, but something that happens. I was thinking, because now we have a mutation with one of these guys involved, but bacteria also, you know, they swap DNA, they cuss a hundred sex. And bacteriophage resistance is something that they will sort of promiscuously. So when we're modeling something with this, an N is a particular bacterial species. Did you go to the? Did you ever think about doing multiple species within letting them pass that resistance test? Well, I think that's kind of like this case is you have a mutation and there's like a mutation, but this case could be up to exactly. So yeah, mathematically it's equivalent. You get it from somewhere, but you can get it much more quickly. It pre-exists. Yeah, Dan. Why is it non-monotonic in K? Like, why do small populations escape? Small populations escape. Escape. Small populations escape. Oh, but it doesn't last. You can say this. Exactly. Okay, so then I think there was a question from Joanne. Oh, actually, no, I wanted to sum up one other piece first. And then we'll get to space. I wanted to go back to that list and just emphasize what I think is the. What I think is the coolest piece of this, if we look at the persistence time, how long persistence, I don't know, E time of a population versus how big it is. There are classic pictures, like in the Sulei, it's a conservation biology textbook, it's Sulay 87. Sulei 87, this figure appears. For instance, for demographic stochasticity, larger populations live exponentially longer, so this becomes a non-threat to populations of a certain size. For environmental stochasticity, also exponential. Exponential and for catastrophic changes, Ewens does some work in this volume. In fact, there's a chapter by Ewens that shows arguments for why we would expect logarithmic dependence on population size. And then Russell Landy went back and corrected some of this and said, found that these were a And said, found that these were a little model-dependent, and you could actually get a range of behaviors, but all increasing either exponentially or logarithmically or linearly with population size. And also meltdown. It really only affects smaller populations, but work by Claudia Banks Group Inc. has shown logarithmic survival times for Mueller's Ratchet. But they're all increasing, right, with population size. And the cool thing about this predator thing is it's completely different behavior. Where your persistent sign goes down for larger populations, if a phage happens to evolve the ability to infect you, you're less likely to survive if you are a larger population. And then if we add rescue, then we get a minimum. So this line. So, this line is predation, and here's predation plus rescue. Okay, so space, last few minutes, and here, oh, and I wanted to also, while I'm shouting out connections, I think I missed the connection to Carolyn's talk because I thought the fact that this our final answer. Our final answer to the biological question was not, it was robust to the biological, or to the details of the mathematics, was really an example of the kind of modeling. You were talking about like good modeling and not so good modeling. And I think that's one thing we should be looking for. Okay, space. So, and this goes back to all of the talks at the first session of the conference. If we imagine, Mark and I are now thinking about this, if you imagine we have a bunch of connected D, Imagine we have a bunch of connected demes. So, in particular, among those first talks, this isn't like Alana can do this in her sleep. I think we have these connected dems. This is exactly the fixation probability on the network that we're going to talk about. Connected deems of bacteria. And we imagine this one gets infected, or the phage arrives here, evolves here. As this one goes extinct, Goes extinct as this bacterial population goes extinct. The phage have some time course. They decay away with their natural decay rate. And somehow the area under that curve times some kind of probability of dispersal will give us a number. Will give us a number of invaders that land here. And we know from, I've erased it, from the evolutionary rescue picture, we have the survival probability. So we can figure out, we know for one invader that lands here, what's the probability that the bacteria survive. So it's pretty trivial to figure out that at least one, blah blah blah. So we can figure out the probability that this dean gets infected and goes extinct. And it goes extinct. That's like, think of that as like a transmission probability in your network epidemiology. So, this connects to all the beautiful working network epidemiology. And also to generating functions that we just saw nicely introduced by Chloe. Because the way to solve this, it's so beautiful. Like, it's old work in network epidemiology, but it's so beautiful. I'm going to tell you a tiny bit about it. If we have the probability. The probability generating function for all of the nodes. So, how many deems is each deem connected to in this network? To find out the probability that the bacterial population goes extinct, it's one minus the probability that the phage stutters out and dies. And the stuttering out and dying probability we can get in the usual way. We can get in the usual way from branching processes. And the trick here, that cool trick, is that, well, one, we have to assume there's no loops, so that's a big assumption. We will relax that in simulations and supplementary material. But we also, the trick here is to start with an infected edge, a transmitting edge, that's carrying the phage over to the new Dean, and then go to this Deem and figure out how many transmitting How many transmitting edges there are, maybe this one's not transmitting, from that deem, and then go to the next deem that got transmitted and figure out how many transmitting edges there are from that. So it's a branching process from transmitting edge to transmitting edge. And then here I can return to Mike's work and Carl's comment about our classroom sizes. In that the distribution of the number of edges for each node is different if we start. For each node is different if we start by picking a random edge. We go to more high-degree nodes more frequently, right? So you do this kind of, I use this notation because that looks like a node and this looks like an edge. So we actually want the extinction probability of this process, but we have to do a little like room different way to do it. It's trivial. It's all trivial, but we can do it. We can do it analytically. And we can do it, we can do it analytically, and it's really actually very pretty. So, that is what about space. And I think perhaps do the bacteria recall that go extinct here, but they're still connected over. Oh, yes, we will have to look at that. Yeah, we'll have to look at that. In this, we'll relax that in the supplementary material. No, we only did this on Friday. We're so proud of ourselves. But yeah, I'll have to think about that. But if it's colonized by competitors, then you can. Yeah, maybe. And maybe, certainly I would expect that the phage disperse much more quickly than the bacteria disperse, so we could make that argument. But we definitely should see what affect that has. Yeah, that's a great point. The other thing that came to mind is The other thing that came to mind is that I don't know the frequency of LIDAC versus lysogenic, and so there's the switch between them. So it's clear that that is dependent on the bacteria being available. If they then switch between, at least in the lab, they do. So that's kind of like one of the hazards when you try to use phase therapy. Right. That the bacteria sensitive switch. Yeah, that's another wrinkle that we That's another wrinkle that we should definitely page that actually switches. So, yeah, the page decides to switch. Yeah. I worry a little about the assumption about the high population density. What if some of your teams had a low population density? Yeah, but therefore the size that this is. Yeah, so as of Friday, as of Friday, we've only done it with the same population density on every day. Population density on every deep. So we haven't heard that. This is great. I've never given a talk about something so fresh. So it's all good. Yeah. Yeah, it's fantastic. And like where the chime just rang, and we might not get to the punchline. So like what happens in this, for the work you have done since Friday, do you still get the result that you get this extinction being more likely in larger initial populations? Even in this spatial kind of model? So we do get the, yeah. I don't know if I can answer that yet, because we didn't do it quite on Friday. My guess is that we're still going to get this kind of shape. So the extinction is not more likely, but there's some large-ish populations for which extinction is still not unlikely. But if you get the population size huge enough, the evolutionary rescue process will always rescue you. But here you have two knobs, right? Yes. You have density and the Right, due to the density and the number of people. Yeah, and we have the dispersal probability. Like when you say like large population, does that mean a widespread organization? Yeah, yeah, right. I think really quick thought. I don't know how this will work, but we might think about this in when you have really good data on the extinction rates in soil. Soil is much more likely to have this sort of like this decaying leaf, this? That'd be like this decaying leaf, this decaying leaf. It would be interesting to see if there's a significant difference rates based on the sort of more connected versus the less connected. Yeah, that's possible. The ODE result feels a bit like the overshooting kind of phenomenon in the intervening logical models. I'm wondering if you took the final size formulas with those, whether you could see that same model to I don't know how you guys analyzed it, but you should be able to see it in those final size formulas. See it at those final sites because it's an oscillating system, so the bacteria in the colours. Yeah, I'm just thinking of how these draw fits. The first draw. Maybe there's some sort of approximation. We have an approximation, but I don't. Yeah, well, we should look. Oh, here. Did you write down all these awesome ideas? Okay. Thank you very much.
