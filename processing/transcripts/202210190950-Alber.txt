Okay, well, first of all, I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me. It's been a very exciting meeting. And I just want to mention that this is, I'm going to talk about results obtained by a collaborative group, which involves experimental lab of Benu Reddy from Uniostate Revisite, plant biologists. I'll get back. Plant biologist. I'll get back to this slide later, but I just want to mention that this is a collaboration been going on for five years. All right, so I'm going to talk about potential mechanisms of maintenance of shoot epical metistems of plants. And you're looking at 3D reconstructed image of microscopy, this reconstructed. Reconstructed in 3D image, we're going to focus on a specific section, middle section, which is indicated in figure A. And then you see the section itself. And then we kind of rotated it and used different colors to represent different parts of the SEM. So some consists of a certain number of stem cells, which divide and grow. And grow in a specific way. So, we're attempting to look at kind of signaling and genetic controls of the maintenance of such divisions and growth as well as orientation of cells. So, I'm going to talk about results from two out of three recent papers we published. So, I'll talk about results from PLS computational biology and nature communications. Nature communications. So I'm going to talk about two models. One model is so-called sub-cell element model, which takes into account mechanical properties of walls and internal components of cells. It's nothing else but coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulation. And it takes a long time to run. And we've implemented our codes on GPUs, running them on a supercomputer in La Jolla. Still takes a long time to run. So we applied this model and we first calibrated it for SEM and then we applied it for testing some hypothesized mechanisms of control of division and positioning of planes of. Positioning of planes, of division planes in specific cells based on concentrations of vuschul and cytokinine. And we were focusing on layer three in this diagram. And for that, we did a lot of image analysis using machine learning algorithms in order to get to high-quality images at the level of basal and epical L3 layers. Typical L3 layers. And so we started with a very detailed kind of analysis of experimental images at different stages over certain periods of times of evolution of sounds. And we kind of looked at the structure. So structure consists of layers and zones. And we're trying to figure out mechanisms maintaining kind of layers and zones. And that's what I'm going to talk about. Yeah, that's what I'm going to talk about. You see and B and C on the bottom kind of distribution of the signal. All right, so I don't know, probably most people in the audience know what the function of USA is, or at least what people think it is. So we're kind of assuming that it controls division rates. And also we're looking at the impact of hormonal. We're looking at the impact of hormone cytokinine CK, and we actually also looked at the extended signaling model. And I'm going to talk about it later, and we kind of realized that there is a very close connection between functions of these two signaling components. Okay, so this is a diagram of how we do things going back and forth between experiments and simulations. So I'll talk about the model itself in a second. But basically, we look at sub-cellular representations, cellular level representations, and tissue level. Tissue level is kind of characterized by certain metrics. First of all, curvature of the surface. First of all, the curvature of the surface. We're looking at this section. It's a 2D representation. Of course, we looked at sections at different angles, and there is specific kind of, there is definitely similarity between these sections. So it doesn't depend on the angle at which you cut it, at least when you look at the metrics. And we looked at three layers: L1, L2, L3, L. Layers L1, L2, L3, and the central zone. Okay, so mechanisms which we tested, I related, as I said, to Washel and CK action. And we kind of assumed in the first one, and that's what people were talking about in the literature. And we're talking about mechanisms controlling division rates, polarization, and positioning of walls. Of walls in the new walls in dividing cells. So, first one, first hypothesis is based on errorzole. The second one, and we're talking about L3. So, I want just to come back and emphasize that we're looking at the third degree. That's the novelty of the whole study. And two, we're also talking about kind of mechanisms. Kind of mechanism which involves tensile stress and cell walls of individual cells. And then there is a third mechanism which controls expansion and division. And it combines signaling and actually the isotropic expansion and cell division plane orientation and kind of controlled by signaling. So I just want to mention that in the end we concluded that Mentioned, and in the end, we concluded that mechanisms in L1, L2, and L3 are very different from each other. So, this is a diagram representing sub-cell element model. So, cell walls are represented by types of nodes connected by linear springs and rotational springs. And spring constants have been calibrated using specific data. Using specific data on testing mechanical properties, and then we have cells inside which represent other components of the cell. And cells adhere to each other, and we take this into account through Morse potentials. And for each node, we have a differential equation, and we model 50, 60 cells. So we're solving a very large number of land-shaping. A very large number of land-cheving type equations. Each equation has a stochastic component and we run them on a very large cluster of GPUs. So this is how model was calibrated. So basically, people use, and I think some talks already kind of talked about very established ways of testing properties of. Of testing mechanical properties of cell walls and cell components. And then also we used experimental data to feed a specific curve which we used for steady-state distributions of OSHA and CK within cells and actually nucleus. And then we made an assumption basically that cell Assumption basically that cell growth rates are based on Wusshall in our model, and with increase of Wishel, they slow down, growth division slow down, and vice versa. I'm going to run simulation. So this on the left, it's a simulation kind of driven by certain distribution functions. But as cells divide and grow and change orientation sometimes, distribution. Orientation sometimes distribution of visual changes. We start with certain steady. Then the second simulation here: division, positioning of cell walls are determined by tensile stress of the specific cell. So, simulations start. So, we model a small piece in the middle. And with free boundary, we also have results when we have a load on the boundary. And I'll talk about this briefly in a second. But basically, we start with like rounded cells and they adhere to each other and they go to a specific equilibrium positioning state. And then this is how we get initial distribution of stresses. So we don't tweak anything, we just have cells, each one of them. Cells, each one of them, the mechanical properties of each cell has been calibrated using experimental data. Then we let them kind of adhere produce a piece of tissue. And then we start running simulations involving growth, division, and orientation. So we're able to show that only the third mechanism works for L3, which means that we can. Which means that mechanical state is important. And the mechanics we used to, for comparison with experiment, it's kind of average size of cells in specific layer, average orientation, and a kind of type of division, positioning of the wall. So these are conclusions which I mentioned already. So we've been testing. Mentioned already. So we've been testing growth driven by Wuschel and CK, which involves cancel stresses. Okay, so recently we looked at extension of a 2D model into the pseudo. So we started taking into consideration cells in the SEM which don't actually grow along the parallel to the And parallel to the plane section plane. So they can be particular at an angle. Because we've got distribution and average positioning of such cells. That's one extension. And the second, we applied load, representing load from the pressure from the rest of the stem at specific parts of stem. Parts of some. And we were able to show that so the out of cell growth is actually crucial for offsetting cell crowding. In some, with the load present, actually. We run predictive simulations with different levels of load and found certain ranges for which we. Found certain ranges for which we logically relevant structure. I'm running out of time. Just very briefly, I want to mention that we have a separate model which is 3D. It doesn't take into account mechanical properties of individual cells. But then we have a very detailed dynamic signaling model for each cell. Signaling model for each cell. And we also have nuclei in each cell distinguished levels inside of a cell, inside of the nucleus. And that's the signaling network. Basically, in addition to CK, we also have clovatus components of it. And this is simulation. And this is a simulation showing this distribution over a short time. And we were able to show that there is a crosstalk between Clovata 3 signaling. Basically, it's inhibiting transcription of WOSH very profoundly. That's the result in this paper. The last thing I want to mention is. And last thing I want to mention is that we used our model for a different project. We also study formation of a wing of Drosophila. I just want to show that the model can be calibrated for very kind of profound changes in shapes of tissue. This is a simulation of a developing wing under certain mechanical perturbations. There's a layer of ECM on the bottom and in the The bottom, and in the certain time, we kind of removed ECM and we predicted the shape, the bending of the wing. And also, I want to mention that we kind of reduced dynamics of actomyosin in the like low part of individual cells. You see individual nuclei in each cell. Their position is very important for the shape of the wing. And actually, this was confirmed. And actually, this was confirmed, confirmed in the experiment. In this project, we're focusing on studying dynamics of octamycin and interaction with. So once again, I want to mention my collaborators. So Michael developed the model initially, and then Christian developed extensions and accounting for loading and pseudo-3D nature model. Yeah, and of course Vinyl Redim was the head of the lab. Head of the lab and produced most hypotheses we were testing with our Chen. A colleague of mine, she developed all signaling models. By the way, currently we're coupling the pseudo-3D model with a dynamic model for signaling, the one I showed. So that would be like kind of conclusion of what we're hoping to achieve. And also there are students and postdocs from Dr. Reddy's lab. Thank you. Dr. Regis, well, thank you. All right, thank you, Mark. Uh, we have time for one question. Maybe two. Daniel Cosgrove. Hi, Mark. Thanks for that presentation. I have a technical question. Did I understand correctly that you measured the stress-strain properties of the cell walls in the L3 layer? L3 layer? I think we guessed it. We guessed it. We checked the whole range. I think we got one experimental value, but we tested the whole range. Yeah, I'm wondering technically how you did that. So the cells are varied. So how did you actually, or your collaborator, actually measure those stress strains? How did you apply a stress or Apply a stress or a strain on those cells. So I think initial simulations assume that all cells are the same. Like L1, L2, L3, they all have the same mechanical properties. So probably we will use the same mechanical properties for all three years for L1. But we would love to have a discussion how to kind of incorporate other. Other measurements, let's put it this way. Yeah. So, as a follow-up comment to that question, I'll point out some work by a group in France that did some indentation with beads of differing diameters several years ago. And they were using that to posit that the interior layers of the meristem can be softer than. Meristem can be softer than the L1 layer in some cases under certain modifications of the cell wall. So, anyway, I'll post that paper in Slack for the discussion. Thank you. I'll also add that that was a proposal, a hypothesis, but it's not an accepted fact. Not fully validated. Agreed. No. Any other questions? All right. Well, let's thank Mark. All right, well, let's thank Market.
