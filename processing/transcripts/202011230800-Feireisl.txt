Thank you very much, Agnieshka. Just tell me if you don't hear me, or if you have some problems in seeing my slides, I'm facing the problem that I have to speak to my laptop but watch the screen on the right-hand side. It seems that we can both hear you and see the slides, and we can see you also. Okay, so thanks a lot to Agnieszka and Miroslav for this invitation. I'm always happy to be in Banf. And so this is a joint work about. So this is a joint work about ergodic hypothesis for open food system with Dominique Breit from Edinburgh, Francesco Fannery from Lyon and Martin Ahof Manova. And I will, in the meantime, I will also mention some other people who somehow contributed to this. So let me start with two pictures. We have already seen Kolmogorov in the talk by Miroslav, and I also dare to present Klausius. So, there to present Clausius here. And so, my talk is about what's called open fluid systems, which means that the system will be interacting with the outer world. Otherwise, you know, so for me, like turbulence is the long-time behavior of the system. So, the system starts moving, then does something that after some time it stabilizes to some kind of stationary state, but not really stationary in the sense that it will not be moving in time, but to some regime that. Time, but to some regime that can be described, say, in terms of random processes. And this regime will be called like a turbulent regime. Because if you have like a no-slip bound of a so, okay, we have seen that fluid systems are usually accompanied by boundary conditions. And we have seen also that the most popular ones are no-slip boundary conditions. Well, this boundary, well, if you have viscous fluid, of course. Well, if you have viscous fluid, of course, which means that, well, there is basically no interaction of the fluid through the boundary with the outer world. And in that case, we have the pessimistic scenario proposed by Clausius, and actually it can be verified for quite a few systems of real equations, in particular for the complete Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, that actually closed system will always keep its energy because there is no way to get rid of energy, and the entropy will tend to a maximum. Tend to a maximum. And so, in the long-term scenario, what you expect to see, and what you will see, and what you can also prove to occur is that, well, the system solutions will converge to an equilibrium state when time goes to infinity and nothing exciting happens. Well, in turbulence, on the other hand, you see only like time averages of trajectories. They do not converge. However, they can for large enough times to converge to some ensemble average and the motion. leverage and the motion can be characterized by means of some probability measure. This measure is then called invariant measure, whatever. And the corresponding solution is called stationary solution. And so I will present what sometimes maybe some people will not agree with me, what we call weak version of ergodic hypothesis. So let me start with the abstract setting later on. Of course, I will apply it to compressible Navier-Stokes. Applied to compressible Navier Stokes, and I will try carefully avoid any exponents in my estimates. So we have a dynamical system. Of course, we know that actually in the context of Navier-Stokes, it's difficult to imagine that we have a dynamical system since the equations, at least in the three-dimensional setting, are not known to be well-posed in the sense that we still don't know if the solutions are unique. However, we will somehow solve this issue. However, we will somehow solve this issue later. So, what is ergodic hypothesis, in my humble understanding? Well, you take the time average of a measure, you are interested in the statistical behavior of the system. So you take a kind of Dirac measure, which is sitting on your trajectory. Then you integrate, you assume that you have a global in-time solution, and then you take the time averages and divide by the length of the time interval. And these measures will show you some. And these measures will show you some kind of statistic. They will converge, well, if you lucky, to some measure that characterizes the long-time behavior of the system, and this measure is sometimes called invariant measure. In our case, we will be closer to stationary solutions, because actually, in my case, the measures will not be sitting like at points, but at whole trajectories. And well, how do you understand this convergence? Well, you take, well, you should start, of course, with continuous and bounded functions. Continuous and bounded functions. And so these averages should converge, but continuous and bounded now, it's not a superposition function, but it's a function which is sitting on the space X. And you expect these averages to converge to something which is an average with respect to some limit measure. Because if this limit exists, it will define a linear function on the set of continuous functions that can be represented by the measure. That can be represented by the measure that will represent the long-time behavior of the problem. And the method, how you obtain this measure, is the well-known Kirovo-Bogolivov method, which means that if you're lucky, and we will be lucky later on, instead of taking the whole limit here, you can at least take some sequence Tn's, which goes to infinity such that these averages will generate the measure. Okay, so that's the abstract setting. Of course, you can see that. Can see that well, I will apply to the barotropic Navier-Stokes system. So, this is my favorite system, and I will do it in two different contexts. So, that's barotropic Navier-Stokes. The pressure now depends only on the density rho, so there is no temperature in the system. There is a driving force, which is like gravitational force, so it's a gradient of a scalar function. And there is another driving force, which in the future will be a stochastic term. For the time being, you can imagine it is zero. Time being, you can imagine it is zero, right? So, we have a Navier-Stokes system, and for this system, we define the energy, which is given by this formula. And somehow, I prefer to express the energy in terms of m, which is momentum, instead of u, because the energy happens to be a convex function if you write it down in terms of m and rho. Okay, so that's barotropic Navier-Stokes. I will consider open systems, so I have to consider boundaries. So, I have to consider boundary conditions that will not isolate the system from outside. So, I will take a general in and outflow boundary conditions for the velocity u. So, I will prescribe it on the boundary d omega. So, there are two parts of the boundary. One is gamma in, where the flow goes in, and one is gamma out, where the flow goes out. Actually, it's not completely correct because I define by gamma out also the part of the boundary. By gamma out, also the part of the boundary where UB is tangential to the boundary, which means that there is no flow at all, which would correspond to which would correspond to isolating system. And it turns out that the system is at least formally well posed if you prescribe the density or if you want the pressure because we are barotropic on the inflow part of the boundary. And that's because the equation of continuity is just a transport equation. So on the inflow part of the boundary, on gamma in, you are, you are. In, you are allowed to prescribe the density. And this is the corresponding energy balance, which is a little bit more complicated than you could see if you consider only no sleep conditions, because if you have no sleep conditions, this means UB is equal to zero, and all terms that depend on UB will disappear, and you will get the usual energy dissipation equality. Now you see that the energy is not really being dissipated because there is a lot of terms. Being dissipated because there is a lot of terms that act as a source in the energy. Actually, the exact form is energy equality, but since we will work with weak solutions, we have to admit that there is an inequality that might be produced by some singularities. So, this is the first choice. So, that's the choice of boundary conditions. And you can opt for another choice, which many people in many books you find that this is kind of equivalent. System in the sense that this forcing term will reproduce basically the effect of inhomogeneous boundary conditions. I must say that's not exactly what is really observed. However, with respect to ergodic hypothesis, at least we will see that the results are rather similar. So now I take very simple boundary conditions like periodic or no sleep, if you wish, but I take a more complicated forcing. I take a cylindrical win. I take a cylindrical Wiener process and I take this forcing term, which makes the problem a stochastic PDE, at least with respect to momentum. And I assume some kind of growth conditions on these functions, which are called diffusion coefficients, right? So in that case, I consider stochastic compressible Navier-Stokes, maybe with simple boundary conditions, either zero or periodic, and we will see what happens in this case. Well, what are the main problems? What are the main problems? The main problems, of course, are that in most cases, we do not know if the solutions are uniquely determined by the initial data. I mean, that's the old problem of Navier-Stokes in general, but of course, you do not expect to get somehow better results than you would get for the incompressible Navier-Stokes. And for compressible Navier-Stokes, even in two space dimensions, the situation is still not solved. So, the trigger deal with the long time. How to deal with the long-time behavior was proposed a long time ago by George Sell. And the idea is very simple because instead of working like with initial data and with a semi-group or some mapping, some dynamical system, you take entire trajectories as being dynamical systems. So instead of taking one initial data, you take just the whole trajectory, you define the trajectory space, which at the end of the day will turn out to be like Of the day will turn out to be like a space of continuous functions on the whole on the whole line R, which means we will be dealing with what is called entire trajectories. And for this, you can define actually omega limit set of each trajectory, which is just the set which is obtained as time shifts of a given trajectory. So instead of working in the phase space, we work on the space-draw trajectories directly, which Directly, which in particular make the mapping of time shift it's trivially continuous in this space. Well, of course, if we work with a semi-group, we even don't know if it's well defined. And so the two things we should somehow handle or attack in this problem are what is called dissipativity, which means if you want to speak about the limit of these averages, you need at least the function that is being integrated to be bounded. Integrated to be bounded. So, this is somehow connected to the ultimate boundedness of trajectories. And secondly, you would like to say that your limit measure is sitting on solutions of the same problem, and that's a question of compactness. Again, you have to solve it in appropriate spaces. So, since I don't have too much time, I have to go fast. So, the dissipativity problem is sometimes also called dissipativity in the sense of Levinson. In the context of the deterministic Navier-Stokes or deterministic problem, Stokes or deterministic problem, I have to show that my energy, the total energy of the problem, is actually being bounded by some constant when time goes to infinity. This constant actually turns out to be independent of the choice of initial data. And in that case, people working in dynamical systems usually speak about bounded absorbing sets. So, actually, the solution in the energy norm, if you define a suitable energy norm, will be finally. Energy norm will be finally ultimately bounded by some constant which is sort of independent of the initial state. And this is indeed something that we can prove for the case of inhomogeneous boundary conditions. An analog in the stochastic version is that expectation of the same thing, but you need certain momenta, meaning you have not only to take expectation, but also some momenta of this, must be bounded. It turns out that you have to go up to four. And in order to do that, And in order to do that, in both cases, unfortunately, the most popular pressure law, which is isentropic pressure to the power gamma, unfortunately does not guarantee ultimate boundedness of trajectories, at least we cannot prove it. So for that case, in both cases, we consider what is called hard pressure equation of state, which means, roughly speaking, that the pressure is still a monotone function of the density, but explodes at some given positive value, which is physically quite reasonable. Which is physically quite reasonable because you will never squeeze the gas into zero volume, however, of course, from the mathematical point of view, it will be better to get rid of this condition. But so far, it can be partially relaxed in the deterministic case, but not completely, but not at all in the stochastic case. At least we do not know how to do it in the stochastic case. Well, so in the sorry, so I should not go away. So, in both cases here, we are able, if you consider Here we are able if we consider the pressure of this form, we are in both cases able to prove these two properties. So we have kind of boundedness. The second property means that the sequence of your time shift is actually represented, it's tight in the sense of measure sitting on trajectories. So you can expect to pass to the limit in the stochastic sense. However, what you would like to see is also that the limit is a solution of the same problem, and this is the problem of asymptotic compactness. Compactness. So the problem can be formulated in the following way. You take something what I would call generating sequence, that's a sequence of shifts. Now you forget the time integrals I was speaking about at the beginning of my talk. You just take a sequence of shifts of the solution of the problem and you let tau n going to plus infinity. And you would like to see that actually rho n converges to some limit rho and mn converges to some limit n. Converges to some limit m. Well, this is quite easy to show in this space because you have enough energy estimates. However, what you would like to see is also that the limit is a solution of the same problem. And since they are time shift, it's a solution of the same problem defined on the whole real line, meaning for any time which belongs to R. In the stochastic case, you have to use what's called Skorochot representations. And so first you have to pass, so you get the usual, you get the bound. So you get the usual, you get the bounce that I have shown on the previous slide. And then this proves that actually your sequence is tight in the space of trajectories. And then there is a beautiful Skorohot representation theorem, which tells you that actually you can pass to equivalent representation, which is the same distribution, but the advantage is that it converges almost surely in the stochastic sense, again to some limit. Again, to some limit. Now, the point is that the limit should be a solution of the Navier-Stokes system. I'm not very precise. The solution is actually, in both cases, is already a kind of process, and we would like the process to solve the Navier-Stokes like almost surely or the Navier-Stokes with the Stofasic integral. And the principal problem, so that's the problem of asymptotic compactness. And the principal problem, of course, is compactness of the density in the compressible set. In the compressible setting, because you have no information what you would call initial data. Let me remind you how this is done in the compressible case. There is a trick which is due to Lyons, which actually enabled him to build up an existence theory for compressible Navier-Stokes, which is the following. You have the sequence of densities. You consider this function, which is a strictly convex function. X function. And of course, you do not have any bound on the density gradient. So any a priori bound, which means that a priori the density can kind of oscillate. However, you can control the oscillations because if you take this row log rho and you evaluate its value for the level of say shift and you pass through the limit, you obtain something which is a weak limit of these shifts. And now you subtract the same function, apply. The same function applied to the limit of the shifts of ρ. And we know since this is strictly convex, and so this is a non-negative quantity if you integrate. And then you use what is called re-normalized equation, which is actually the version of the equation of continuity, where you multiply it by a non-linear function. In particular, for rho-lock rho, you get this equation here, which can be justified also in the weak setting. And integrating this equation, you get this nice differential equality for this. Equality for this D, which represents a kind of defect. Actually, your goal is to show that this D is actually zero. And if D is zero, then the convergence is strong because you have a strictly convex function that actually converges to the corresponding limit. If you look at this equation, there is no reason to believe that D should be kind of zero, because there is a term which looks like the weak limit of rho divergence of u minus rho divergence of u without bar. Of view without bar. There is no reason a priori to believe that there is some sign of this term. However, there is a beautiful Leon's identity, which is actually the core of the whole existence theory, which tells you that in the case of compressible Navier-Stokes, this quantity is actually equal to that, which is the weak limit of the pressure multiplied by rho minus the weak limit of the pressure multiplied by the weak limit of rho. And since the pressure is monotone or non-increasing, this happens to be a non-negative quantity actually. To be a non-negative quantity, actually, and so this quantity here is non-negative. And so, if you can make sure that d is zero at some time, that it will be zero forever, and you will get convergence on this time interval. And this is perfect for the initial value problem, because in the initial value problem, you control the value of d at zero, of course, because that's the quantity evaluated for the initial data. And for the initial data, of course, in the construction process, you assume that they converge strongly. That they converge strongly. However, here we are in the situation where we have a trajectory which is defined on the whole real line and we have no initial data. So this cannot be used. So that's the main trick somehow of this result is that you can do something different. You actually obtain for the defect D such an differential inequality and now the defect D is a non-negative function. You can show this bound. A non-negative function, you can show it's bounded from above by some constant uniformly for any time, and you can show how the dissipation in the equation is really related to d. I mean, you have to work on it a little bit, and you will find out that there is some function which behaves basically like a power. So in particular, it is positive when d is positive and strictly positive. It has this property here. And so, since you have a bounded solution of this inequality, which is defined on the whole line, on the whole. Which is defined on the whole line necessarily, D must be zero, and you again get strong convergence, right? So, this can be adapted also to the stochastic setting. So, in both cases, we get asymptotic compactness. So, we can show the validity, at least, of the ergodic hypothesis in the skyrillo-bogolu-bov setting, meaning there is a sub-sequence which converges. Well, let me finish by showing you some references. So, the bounded absorption. So, the bounded absorbing set for the problem. Let me point out that we have non-homogeneous boundary conditions. So, that's a problem that hasn't been studied before. So, this is a recent work with Jan Tresy and Antony Novotny. In the Sohasti case, we prove it. I regret to say that the preprint is still not available, but should be available in a week or two. Asymptotic compact, as we proved with Francesco and Martina, and in the And Martina, and in the Stohasti case, again, we were able to prove it. However, preprint is not available. And I also take the liberty to make some advertisement to our book about stochastically false compressible fluids because there is existence theory for compressible navir stoke driven by stochastic setting. So, by that, I will finish my talk and thank you for your attention. Thank you, Elva, very much. Thank you, I love that much.
