So, I would like to report on this joint work with Alicia Garbaniati, Cecilia Saliado, Antoniela Terebovic, and Rosa Winter. So you can find this paper on archive as well if you would like to see. So the slides are also on my webpage if you would like to go and download them as well. So this talk is going to This talk is going to be divided into three parts, and as you have already seen, K3 surfaces are very important in the two previous talks. And some point that hasn't been addressed yet is that actually K3 surface form the only class of surface that might admit more than one elliptic fibration with section, which is not of product type. So, this is a key feature that we would like to highlight during this talk. And so when I talk about elliptic fibration, I refer to a surjective morphism from the surface to a smooth curve defined over a q k. And we will assume that almost all the fibers are smooth, a genus 1 curve for this one, and at least one singular fiber. And we would like to have at least one section, though we would denote the zero section. Otherwise, it would be a genus 1 fibration without section. So just to set the notations. So set denotations. So, because we are in a Giophantine problem conference, it is interesting to look at rational points, right? So, if we denoted by E the general fiber of this vibration, then it's going to be an elliptic curve defined over this function field, Kc. And it is an interesting result that actually the Mordeville group of this fibration is actually the set of rational points of this elliptic curve and it consists. And it consists on sections of this elliptic curvation from S to Z. So we would like to study more in detail this arithmetic behind. And as you may notice in the title, we are considering double cover of extremal rational elliptic surface. So I would like to recall the definitions of that. So a rational elliptic surface is a smooth rational surface endowed with an elliptic fibration to be one. That with analytic fibration to be one. And we will say that it is extremal when the rank of this model of the group called fibration is zero. That means that it's a finite group and that the surface has maximal Picard number. So why do we care about those elliptic rational surface? Well actually there is this nice result from Miranda and Pearson that asserts that there exists only 16 fiber configuration. Only 16 fiber configurations of this extreme and Russian elliptic surface. And those 16 are given by this codera classification of singular fibers, and we have 16 of them here. So I have classified them in different colors here, as you might see. Either we just consider one reduced fiber, or we have multiple reduced fiber, but they are all different here, or we have eventually multiple reduced fiber. Reduced fiber. So we will come back to this table later on. So I would like to fix the field to be a number field, and we consider this absolute Gala group of it. So let's assume that this extremal Russian elliptic surface is defined over this number 2k. So this is going to be our setting. Then the elliptic fibration and the zero section are also. And the zero section are also defined over this number field k. Those are our hypotheses. Now consider this double cover here from P1 to P1, and we assume that it's going to be defined over K, and it's going to be branch over two points, P1 and P2. So if we assume that the branch fibers here are smooth, reduced fibers and Gala conjugate under this action of this Gala group. Under this action of this Gala group, then we will have the following. We will have that X is indeed a K2 surface and the induced fibration EX and the zero section of X are also defined over K. So this is the setting that we are going to be working with when we consider a K3 surface coming from a double cover, branching two points. And the key ingredient here is that the cover involves ingredient here is that the cover involution of this so this this double cover d is going to induce a cover involution here up and it can be extended to an evolution on this k2 surface x that is going to be denoted by tau so this is important to remind for the upcoming of this talk okay so having an extremal rational elliptic surface defined over a number of field we take double cover of it as we bit as we constructed before and we obtained a k3 surface defined over k and we would like to determine two fields. We would like to determine the fields of definition of the distinct elliptic fibration on X because as I mentioned before we have different fibrations on a K2 surface. And we would like as well to determine an upper bound for the degree of the field extension over which the more developed group admits a set of generators. So those two fields So, those two fields can be defined properly. So, let x and eta as before. So, we denoted by k eta the field of definition of eta, that is the smallest field extension of k over which over which the class of a fiber of eta is defined, and eta is going to admit a section. And this Mordeuvel field is going to be denoted by k eta mordevel is the smallest field extent. Is the smallest field extension over k eta over which this model of the group admits a set of generators. Okay, so we would like to determine both of them and give an upper bound of the degree of this extension. So what we were able to prove was the following. So given a genus 1 vibration on such a K3 surface, we proved that this vibration admits a section over a Admit a section over a field that is going to depend on the action of the covering volution on these fibers. So, because I describe the action, I would like to be more precise about it. So, we will like to do the following steps. So, the first one is going to be to classify all the possible elliptic fibrillation on X. This is the first step. And that has been done by several authors. By several authors, and among them Niyemeyer, Nishiyama, Garvinetta, and Selegal in 2018. Then, once we have all the possible elliptic fibration, we would like to do for each of fibration eta to determine its field of definition and to give an upper bound, as we probably discussed. And in order to do so, this is an interesting thing: that we need to determine the type of this fibration eta with respect to the covering evolution. And we will obtain then the And we will obtain then the field of definition of this figuration. And in order to determine the degree of this field, we need to determine the model-by group. So let's be more precise about the type and the action. So let's consider a fibration, eta, on the scattered surface X. Then we were going to say that it is of step 1 with respect to discovery evolution if tau preserves all the fibers of eta. So we will say. So we will say that it's of type 2 with respect to tau if tau does not preserve all the fibers, but it's going to map a fiber of eta to another one. In this case, tau is induced by an involution of the basis of this fibration, and it's going to fix exactly two fibers. And the involution induced by tau, that is in the neuroscientific group of X, preserves the class of the fiber of eta. And we will say that it is a And we will say that it's of type 3 with respect to tau if tau actually maps a fiber of eta to a fiber of another elliptic fibration. So then we completely lost the track on the fibers. And in this case, Tau star does not preserve the class of the generic fiber of the fibration net. So those are the three types and we'll come back to the definition later on. So as I mentioned before, we were able to As I mentioned before, we were able to prove this result, and an intermediate result is this following lemma that asserts the following. So, if we consider an extremal rational elliptic surface defined over this number of field k, and we assume that all reducible fibers of the elliptic fibration are distinct, then the neuron-severi group is going to admit a set of generators defined over an extension of k of degree at most to Of k of degree at most two. So it is important to assume that those reducible fibers are distant, and I will be more precise about that. So actually we are just considering for this lemma those configuration and we are excluding five out of 16 configurations in the previous table. So why we are excluding them is because Why we're excluding them is because if indeed the extremal Russian elliptic surface has repeated reducible fibers, then this neuron-sevary group is going to be defined in general over a larger degree extension. For instance, if we consider this one, the neuron-sevari group is going to be defined over a degree four extension. So it's to simplify the computation in the future. So this field extension that we consider, we will denote it by Kr, that is the smallest field extension over K, over which the neurons of a group emit a set of generators. Now I would like to take into account the action of this covering evolution tag, right? So in order to do so, I need to introduce other field extensions that are going to be defined as follows. So take endpoints on P1. points on P1 over which the reducible fibers of this rational elliptic surface are located. So because we know that this cover evolution is branch over remote fibers, then we have two different points above each Ti, right? So some important feature is that then if we denoted sigma i, the restriction of tau, of this covering evolution to this pair of fibers. Discovery involution to this pair of fibers of Ex, of Ti, then we are going to have a field homomorphism. So that's important. And once we have that, we can consider K tau to be the Gala field extension of K such that the Gala group is generated by those M homomorphisms. And we denoted by K Er tau, the composite of the previous fields. Okay, so having those, having all the So having all the fields already, we can say the following. So we prove indeed that genus 1 fibration unix admits a section over a field, which depends on the action of this cover evolution. And this is the main result. So as before, consider an extreme rational elliptic surface defined over a number of field, such that its reducible fibers are all of different types. Different types, colorida types. Then, and we consider the induced KG surface obtained as a double cover, branch on two smooth fibers conjugated under Galois, and we consider this covering volution tau and eta genus 1 fibration on X. So, having that, we can assert the following, that this fibration eta is going to be of type 1 with respect to tau. Be of type one with respect to tau. If it is that the case, then the eta is going to be defined over this field that we previously defined, kr, and it's going to admit a section over a further quadratic extension that is going to be denoted by kr, tau, as before. And if eta is of type 2 with respect to tau, then we know that it is going to be defined and admit a section over k. So now we would like to sketch a proof of this result. So, what about the type 2 case? So, assume that we consider a genus 1 fibration of type 2 with respect to tau, then let me just recall you the definition. We know that tau does not preserve all the fibers of eta, but it's going to map a fiber of eta to another one. So then we know that because we assume that the Because we assume that the branch locus is smooth, there is only one vibration of type 2 actually with respect to type, which is the induced vibration coming from the extremal rational elliptic surface, so Ex and moreover, we assume that Ex and Ox are defined over k. That means that we have already a section that is defined over k. Hence, if we assume that eta is Excel, If we assume that L d C x is defined and at midterse of defined over k. So that is the only elliptic fibration that we have here that is of type 2, which prove what we want that. If we have a type 2 fibration with respect to del, then it's going to be defined an amid a section over k. So what about the type 1, which is a little bit more complicated? So now assume that it's of type 1, we know that tau is going to preserve all the fibers of edge. To preserve all the fibers of it. Hence, each fiber is going to be the pullback of a conic in the extremal rational surface R. And because of the previous lemma, we know that the neural severic group is generated by curves defined over this field extension, this quadratic field extension. Hence, the class of this iconic has a divisor C0 whose components are the zero, whose components are defined again over this field. Because we know that et is of type 1, the fibers of et are fixed by tau, right? And the pullback of c0 is going to be defined as well over kr. Hence, and moreover, we know that its class moves in x giving the fibration eta, and eta is going to be defined over kr. So having a fibration of type 1 with respect to peel, we know that With respect to L, we know that it's going to be defined over this field extension kr. Now, what about the section? So, we know that let's consider a section S of type 1, then we know that S is a rational carbon X, and if we consider this Causion map from X to X over the covering volution tau, which is rational to the extreme of rational elliptic surface R, we take the image of the We take the image of this Gaussian map for S, and we know that Ps is either a minus one curve or a minus two curve in R, right? So by the previous lemma, we know that all the negative curves in R are defined over this field Kr. Hence, this section is going to be defined over a forward extension that is KR tau. So we prove indeed that the section is defined over a four-der extension. So let's show the result again, and I would like to illustrate now this theorem in a particular case. So let's come back to our nice table of the Pearson and Miranda and we like to discuss further this example. So the case where we have a fiber configuration of type E9 and 3EI. So we have this elliptic fibration that is going to be defined over k and the zero section as well, and the more developed group of this Russian extremo-Russian elliptic surface is going to be z over 3z. So we have torsion points of order 3. So E9 is actually a cycle, so nine rational curves meeting in a cycle, and we have here And we have here the torsion sections. And we can consider as well the dual group of this configuration, where each curve is a vertex and each intersection is an edge. So we have this dual graph here and the connection with the torsion sections below. So what we want to take into account is a double cover of this extrema rational elliptic surface. Rational elliptic surface. So let's do the double cover through to line. So that means that we need to do a symmetry with respect to the absence. And now we would like to determine different types, right? So we would like to determine first the type one. So let's consider, for instance, this elliptic fibrillation. This elliptic fibration of type 1. So it's going to have a reducible fiber E16. That means that we have a cycle here. So let me just draw it here before. So Victoria. Oh, there we go. It was taking a while to show up. It's taking a while to show off. Yes, actually, if I don't take out the pen, it doesn't show us. Okay, so we have a dual graph that is this A50 as here, so we have a cycle. And so we know that the model very group of this fibration is actually Z over 2Z plus Z. And what we can see in this picture is that we have the different sections here. Sections here. So we can show, computing the height of those sections, we can show that there is just one section of order two and the rest are of infinite order. And then we know that k eta is kr and that because we have this action of this covering evolution tau, those sections are defined over a further quadratic extension. Okay, so that means that the degree of this field extension K eta more the V over K is of degree atmosphere. So what about a type II now? So we are going to consider, as we already said before, there is just one type II, the one induced by the previous Russian elliptic surface. Previous rational elliptic surface. So that is that we have two copies of fiber of enine. And we have three torsion points, three torsion, three torsion sections here. So what we know is that k eta is k. eta is k and that k eta more develop is a further quadratic extension and that is because we know that by definition Ox9 is going to be defined over k but it might be that t1 and t2 are exchanged so that's the reason why the model group is further so we have a field extension of degree at most two and what about a type tree now A type 3 now. Okay, so we have this more complicated reducible fiber. So we have a E8 star and EI4, right? So we have dual graph either D12 or A3. So let me just row the D12. D12, and we have here the A3. So we have sections here. So this is two sections, so we are not going to consider those. And this modified group of distribution is again z over two z plus z. So we can show as well using the height pairing that. The height pairing that one of the sections is a two-torn section and the other are of infinite order. And so, because of this configuration, we know that K eta is Ker tau 9, so it's up to degree 4 extension, and as well as the Mohr-Devel group. So, we know that the degree of the field extension where the Mohr-Devel group admits the set of generators is at most. Group admit the set of generator is at most of degree four. So those are the three possible cases that can appear. And I would like to conclude this talk here. Thank you very much for the attention.
