Is the N membranes problem? You're welcome. Thank you very much for the invitation. So in this talk, I would like to say something about a free boundary problem connected to the obstacle problem, which is the n-membranes problem. And this is in fact a vector-valued version of the obstacle problem. Of the obstacle problem. So I'll start my talk with a brief introduction about the obstacle problem, which would be the scalar case, the easy case, and then we're going to go to the multiple membrane problem. So the obstacle problem, the physical situation, we have it here on the right. We think we have a wire in the picture represented. In the picture, represented with red, and then an elastic membrane attached to the wire, which is represented by a green membrane in the pictures. And the membrane in the presence of gravity stretches down and there is a rigid obstacle, a table underneath. At some point, the obstacle is above the table, and on some region, the obstacle sits on the table. Some region, the obstacle sits on the table. And mathematically, this is modeled by saying that the membrane is given by the graph of a function x u of x. u simply represents the height. And in the set where u is strictly positive, where we are not constrained by the table, we say the Laplace of U has to be one. Has to be one while when we sit on the table, u is identically zero. And mathematically, there is an energy associating to the membrane, which is the Dirichlet energy that we have here. So we have the Dirichlet energy, and plus U, this is coming from the force, the coefficient in front of U is the force acting on the membrane. Acting on the membrane. And the natural scaling of the obstacle problem is quadratic, that leaves the equation invariant. And there are two questions. One is about the regularity of the solution U. This question is not too complicated. It turns out that U is as smooth as the picture shows. I mean, it has discontinuous second derivatives, but otherwise, along when we switch from the regime, you bigger. When we switch from the regime u bigger than zero to you being identically zero, but otherwise, u is very nice. And the second question concerns the free boundary, which is the shape of the coincidence set, the boundary of the coincidence set. Okay, so as I said, the optimal regularity is not too complicated. U is C11 about the free bound. About the free bound irregularity is done through a blow-up analysis. There is a monotonicity formula, specific to the problem, which is the Weiss monotonicity formula, which is the same as the energy rescaled so that it remains invariant under quadratic rescalings, and this is corrected to some boundary term, L to boundary term of U on the boundary of BI. U on the boundary of Br. So it turns out the device energy is monotone, and then this allows one to do a blow-up analysis and end up with the blow-up profiles that we denote by U-bar. So U-bar are global solutions which are homogeneous of degree two, for which zero is a free boundary point. And then And then one has to look first at 1D, what are the 1D cones? The 1D cones, there are just two of them. One is the half quadratic, which would be one half x1 plus squared, which means that here on the right the membrane lifts, on the left, u sits on the table. And there is a second one, which is the full quadratic. The full quadratic so the membrane touches the table only at the origin. This would be the full quadratic. And these two examples generalize to higher dimensions. The first one, you just add n minus one variables to the picture, and you end up with a solution which coincides on a half plane and is quadratic. Half plane and is quadratic on the other one. While the solution on the right, you can do the same, you can just add extra variables, but you realize because the solution just coincides only barely at a single point. In fact, you can also add quadratics in the remaining variables that are not necessarily constant but are just non-negative. So, the second type of solution in higher dimension, its corresponding picture looks like a full quadratic polynomial, which is non-negative. And it can vanish at the origin, or it can vanish on a line, or on a two-dimensional space, and so on. So, the vanishing in the second case is the vanishing order might depend. Might be different from one to another. It's a full family of solutions. And it turns out that these are the only possible profiles in higher dimensions. So this is one of the few problems in which one is able to characterize the blob profiles in all possible dimensions. Okay. Okay, when we end up with the profile one, we say that the point, the origin where we started to do the blow-up analysis, is a regular point. If you end up with the second type of profile, we say that the point is a singular point. Why a singular point? So the second situation on the right is slightly more delicate because we touch only on a small set, the table. If we lift up, The table, if we lift up a little bit the data, we have no free boundary point. If we push it down, we have a full coincidence set. So the second situation, the singular points, are unstable under small perturbations, while the regular points are stable. If we are in the first setting and we play a bit with the boundary data, maybe the free boundary can move a little bit to the left or to the right. Can move a little bit to the left or to the right, but it looks more going to look more or less the same. Okay, so the regularity for the singular points, this was done by Caffarelli in the 70s. He showed that near a regular point, the free boundary is smooth. And the singular set took more work, but is pretty much well under. Well, understood by now, and the singular set it turns out to be you have uniqueness of blow-ups, meaning that when you blow up, you end up with a unique polynomial in the end, and you can get a rate of convergence, which in reality could say that all the singular points are included in a C1 sub-manifold with some very weak modulus of continuity. It's a logarithmic. Continuity is logarithmic to some power. And here, this would be represented on the right. At the singular points, the free boundary is cusp-like, because when we zoom in, the coincidence set has to get thinner and thinner, has to sort of disappear. And then you can have this sort of pictures that the singular set still aligns nice on a curve, on a C1. On a curve, on a C1 curve. But of course, you can have some dots in between, I mean, some missing pieces in between. It's only included in the C1 submand. Okay, so this is the situation with the obstacle problem. Now, what I'm interested in is a problem that looks similar, but is a vector-valued. And this is the And this is the end membrane problem. So I'll start with the situation of two membranes. And the physical situation is now instead of having a rigid table underneath, we have two membranes represented here with blue and red. The blue membrane sits on top and is pushed down by some force F1, and the second membrane is pushed up. Second membrane is pushed up by another force, and they have some, they cannot penetrate each other, and they have some coincidence region. So, it turns out the problem is going to be whenever U1 separates from U2, each one is going to solve the corresponding equation. Laplace of U1 is going to be F1, Laplace of U2 is going to be F2 in the set where U1 separates. Where U1 separates from U2. How about in the middle region? Well, when you look at the Euler-Lagrange equation, you cannot perturb U1 and U2 arbitrarily, but you can perturb arbitrarily by the same function. The inequality, this inequality would still be preserved. So I can still perturb u1 by u1 plus epsilon phi. u1 plus epsilon phi in u2 plus epsilon phi with the same phi and preserve the constraint u1 gran equal to u2 and it turns out that always laplace of u1 plus u2 is always f1 plus f2 because of this fact so this means that in fact in in the common region the average what this says is that always the average of u1 and u2 is Of U1 and U2 is the same as the average of F1 and F2. So this means that in the common region, the force acting on the two membranes is the average of F1 and F2. So in the next picture, I represent a bit better the equation satisfied by U1. So U1 on some region is F1 on some whenever I separate. Separate. When the blue membrane separates strictly from the red membrane, the Laplace of Fiona is F1. When it coincides with it, is the average of F1 and F2. But this means essentially that you can always solve for the average of U1 and U2. When you look at this second membrane problem, it's always Laplace of the average. Is always the average of the F's, which means that the average is known ahead of time. So in reality, the two membrane problem can be thought as being, in fact, you are back to the obstacle problem in which the obstacle is the average that you can solve for. For and it's hard, it's a hard constraint, and you just want to see when the blue line sits on the green line. So, the two-membrane problem is equivalent. Let me write here, two-membrane is equivalent to the standard obstacle problem, obstacle problem. However, when you go to more than two membranes, the situation is different. Is different. So the end membranes problem was introduced by Chippot and Vergara Caffarell in 85 in the context of variational inequalities. You have n membranes, one sitting on top of the other and so on. So here is a constraint: U1 has to be bigger than or equal to U2 has to be bigger than or equal to UN. They are fixed on the boundary. And you try to minimize the energy. Try to minimize the energy. It's a convex energy. The minimization process is easy. In the end, you want to see what you end up. And now there are n minus one free boundaries. The n minus one free boundaries are, you want to see the first free boundary is where the top membrane contacts the second one. I mean the boundary of that set. The second free boundary is where the second contacts the third and so on. On so, in reality, this is a coupled system of n minus one obstacle problem. When you change the data of the top membrane, it might push in some region the second one, which might push the third one, and so on. So they are all coupled. And here, and whenever two membranes or several coincide, in an open region where they coincide, the right-hand side is the average of the membranes involved. Of the membranes involved. So here on the right, I have an example in which there are three membranes and the free boundary gamma sub 1, which would be the boundary between U1 and U2, where the blue line separates from the green line, would consist of the points X1 and X3. And the second boundary where the green line Where the green line separates from the red line consists of the points x2 and x4. So this would be a 1D picture in the three-membrane case. There is also a game theoretical interpretation of the n-membrane problem that I'm going to try to explain briefly. So the game is the So the game is the following: there are n players, P1, P2, P7, and there are also N tickets, 1, 2, N. And each time a player has a ticket. And there is a token that we can try to think there is here on the bottom, some sort of token that moves randomly, can jump epsilon to the right or left. So this token, somebody flips. Yeah, so this token, somebody flips a coin and the token can move on the bottom. But at each movement, the coin is going to, the token is going to move left or right randomly. So each turn, the player can change their tickets. So the player who has the ticket with number one, he can choose any ticket he wishes. He can keep Any ticket he wishes. He can keep ticket one for the next term, or he can choose, he can switch with the player fourth if he wishes. Then comes the player with the ticket two. He has the second option from the remaining n-1 ticket. He can pick the ticket he wants and so on. So that's the way of reshuffling the tickets. It's very important who has ticket one has the first. Who has ticket one has the first option, the one with ticket two has the second option on the choice, and so on. The player with ticket N has no choice at the end, he's just left with one ticket and he's gonna have to take it. However, there is a catch because if you have the ticket with number one, for that term, you need to pay an amount F1. And if you have the ticket with number two, you need to pay the amount F2. And if you have to sew on the ticket, And if you have so on the ticket, then you need to pay the amount FM. These are the forces. And you keep on playing this game till the token exits. And when it exits, you get the ticket number, the player with ticket one gets paid 5.1. This is the boundary data for the player with ticket 2 gets paid 5.2 and so on. And then the solution to And then the solution to the end membrane problem represents the expected value at a given time of the holder of the ticket K, what is the expected payoff? The expected payoff is given by the function u sub k. And the solution to the obstacle, to the end membrane problem, which represents also the strategies. So in a strategy in which u1 separates from u2, In which U1 separates from U2, the ticket, the holder of the ticket one wants to hold onto it. It's more convenient. But then, in a region where U1 coincides, I mean, starts coinciding with U2, it's good for the player one to exchange with the player two, and then for the player two to exchange with the player one. So, sort of each time they are flipping the tickets one with respect to the other, because, like this, the cost is lower for is the end. For is the average of F1 and F2 in the long run. So, this is the game theoretical interpretation of the obstacle problem. Now, what I would like to say, I would like to say something about the free boundary regularity in this problem. So, first of all, about the optimal regularity. Again, the optimal regularity is not too difficult. One can show that. One can show that solutions are C11, so they're really nice. When you switch from one region to another, you do it in a way that the second regions are bounded. Also, yeah, one can try to do a blow-up analysis, just like in the case of the regular obstacle problem, there is a Weiss monotonicity formula, and you can always reduce to the case when the average of the function is zero. The average of the function is zero. You can mod out one variable from the fact that you know that the Laplace of the sum of the UIs is always the sum of the Fi's. So in some sense, the M membrane problem in reality really has only n minus one variable. The average is always known. Okay. Okay, so again, one can try to do a blow-up analysis and say that when I do the quadratic blow-ups, they converge to a global cone. And on this global cone, one, okay, so when you're interested in the free boundary regularity, if you pick a point just belonging to a single free boundary, it's not so interesting because locally you're back to the scalar problem. Scalar problem. What is interesting is to look at the points where the free boundaries cross each other, where several free boundaries intersect. And at such a point, you cannot go back to the scalar problem. It's sort of the membranes involved, they affect each other. So it's not, I mean, always we assume that we take a point where all the three boundaries intersect. If not, Free boundaries intersect. If not, you can reduce it to one with a fewer membranes. So we always pay attention to a point where all free boundaries intersect and try to say something about what happens to the free boundary. I mean, how do the free boundaries look and or the functions look near such a point? Okay, sorry. So again, we go to the case of 1D. First of all, one tries to understand the problem in 1D. One tries to understand the problem in 1D, and when you are in 1D, the cones simply are made of have quadratics starting from the origin. In this picture on the top, we can try to think we have four membranes, a blue, a green, a red, and a purple membrane. And here, for example, they all go through the origin, but the blue and the green membrane, they agree on this branch here. Here, the green and the red, they agree on this branch here, while the purple agrees with the red only at the origin. So, if you say how many 1D cones are there in one day, it depends on the coincidence sets. Like if I look at the U1, the coincidence consecutive coincidence sets, if I look where U1 is equal to U2, or U2 equal to U3, or U1 minus U. U2 equal to U3, or UN minus 1 equal to UN. There are three options. Either they agree on the left, on the right, or just at the origin. So there are, in fact, three to the power n minus one cones in 1D. And the one with the least energy among all of them, among all these cones, is the cone in which all of them coincide on one side, let's say on the negative axis. Let's say on the negative axis and are separated on the right axis. So, this cone in which we have four membranes, but they all agree on the negative axis, and on the right one, they are separated, has least energy among all cones. Okay. For example, now there are three to the n minus one cones, but I did not take into account similar. Account symmetries. If one, for example, looks at just at three membranes, in reality, there are four possible profiles represented here. And they are represented in increasing order of energy. The first profile is the one, as I said, in which all three membranes coincide on the left and are separate on the right. The second profile here is the one in which the middle membrane. The middle membrane coincides with the top membrane on the left and with the bottom membrane on the right. So the green line sort of that the green membrane transitions between the top and the bottom at the origin. There is a third profile in which the top and the bottom interact on the left and sorry, the top and the middle. Sorry, the top and the middle one agree on the left side, while the bottom one just barely touches it at the origin. So this one is again a bit more singular, the third profile, simply because it seems that the bottom membrane profile on the top, if I try to perturb U1, U2, and U3, I'm not going to get a single free boundary point, but Going to get the single free boundary points, but the picture is going to look more or less the same. Yeah, I'm while here, if I pull the red membrane down, I would simply separate, decouple the problem. So in the profile three and four, these are more singular, in which the free boundary can disappear under small perturbations. This wouldn't happen in one in profile one and two. In profile one and two. Now, one, yes, now one can go from one to higher dimensions. You just extend things constantly in the remaining variables. However, when you just have a single point of contact, just like in the case of the obstacle problem, you have the option of adding some extra polynomials. So you have different profiles, like for example, in this profile four, it might This profile for it might look that is not one-dimensional, but modulo adding a harmonic function comes. I mean, you can try to think that you started this profile in 1D, you extend it to 2D, and then from that profile from 2D, you can start changing it continuously till it looks like this. So, there is a way of So, there is a way of extending 1D counts to higher variables. Also, what is interesting is that in 2D, at least these are the only possible profiles. So, this says, if you look at the free boundaries, what you expect one expects that because sort of the free boundaries come from 1D, it means that when the two free boundaries It means that when the two free boundaries intersect, actually, they have to intersect tangentially. So, here, in this situation, at this intersection point, let's say at the origin, this is a situation which when I blow up, I end up with the profile one. And in the situation two here, when I blow up, I end up with profile two. Three and four, as I said, they are a little bit more singular. They are a little bit more singular, so the three boundaries do not have to be tangential to each other in profiles three and four. But when but the coincidence set have to have very little coincidence sets. So, sort of three and four would correspond to the case in which the free boundary look more like cusp-like. Okay, so finally, let me just so I So finally, let me just so I mentioned some situations about possible blob profiles. So what are our results? So for the three membranes, the three membranes, there are just two free boundaries. And here there is just gamma one and gamma two. So we pretty much say that what we see here on the on the left, these are the possible intersections. There are no surprises. And it means that whenever... And it means that whenever we intersect at the point of type 1, which would be of least energy, in fact, the full free boundaries, gamma 1 and gamma 2, are of class C1 log near the intersection and they intersect tangential. And this is sharp. It cannot be better, the log cannot be improved. And also for the three membranes, you say that if we are Three membranes say that if we have if we end up with a blow-up profile like type two or type four, they we have uniqueness of blow-ups with some rate of convergence and we say that they belong, they are included into some C1 curves, C1 submanifolds. So, this is for the three membranes and any dimension. We also have more recent results this year. This year, about arbitrary number of membranes, but in two dimensions. And we say that all, I mean, in 2D, it turns out that one can classify all possible cones just by being generated from 1D, as I mentioned before. And we have more or less the same results if we have the If we have the best intersection with least energy, we call it regular intersection, that all the free boundaries are C1 log curves near the intersection point. So they always have to intersect tangentially. And then we have all other possible cones in 2D, I don't know, degenerate or non-degenerate, they are included in C1 log curves. So I think in 2D we have We have all a complete picture of what can happen with this intersection of rebounders. Now I'm almost close to the end of the talk, but let me just say some philosophical things about the uniqueness of blow-ups. So this is a talk about how does one prove How does one prove the uniqueness of blow-ups? The situation is, of course, more complicated because we deal with the vector-valued problem, and there are the complexity of the problem grows exponentially with n. So, uniqueness of blow-ups, whenever there is a monotonicity formula, like we have in our case, so that the quadratic blow-ups can be viewed that they Be viewed that they evolve as you follow R, as you go R to zero, they evolve according to a gradient flow given by the energy functional W, by the monotonicity formula. And so, this is like a general fact that happens all. Like a general fact that happens also in the minimal surface or other problems, and this gives you that the energy has to decrease. But if you want to find a more quantified version to get uniqueness, one needs to prove better decay instead of the energy decreasing. One wants to say that it decreases at a certain rate. And the rate has to be a power. A power of W itself. If you manage to prove this, this is known as log-epiperimetric inequality, and this would give uniqueness of the blow-ups. When W has analytic structure, this is related to Loyashevich inequality, and Leon Simon proved this for the case of the minimal surface. And there are some other works in the same spirit. However, in obstacle problems, while W Problems, while W has analytic structure, the constraint is polyhedral. And this analysis does not seem to apply to try to reduce it to a finite dimensional analysis. I mean, to the Loyashevich inequality. For the classical obstacle problem, Colombos, Palau, and Velichkov, they actually managed to prove by hand the logo pitch. To prove by hand the logarithmic inequality using Fourier decomposition, so by hand. Now, in our case, so we have some sort of general strategy, well, on how to prove uniqueness in obstacle-type problems. So, this is the general strategy for the The general strategy for the end membrane problem. And the interesting feature, I mean, from where does it come? This C1 log. At the beginning, it sounds intriguing that you say, well, if I take the least energy, I should expect better than C1 log. In reality, what really happens is that the C1 log comes from a mismatching dimension. So if you want to look In dimension. So, if one looks at the space of possible cones, and let's think of the example in which you take cones that agree on the left, and here on the right, they branch out. If I look at this, the space of cones in 2D, this is simply given by rotation. So it would be a one-dimensional space of cones of this particular cone in 2D would be one-dimensional. However, when you look at the linearized equation, However, when you look at the linearized equation, it seems that each membrane can act on its own, at least initially. So it turns out that when you look at the linearized equation, if you want to look at the tangent space, the tangent space is in fact n dimensional or n minus one dimensional, right? So the dimension of the sort of the linearized operator is much bigger than the dimension of the tangent cones, which means that if you try to approximate the solution always using cones, Solution always using cones, something is wrong. I mean, you cannot use a one-dimensional curve to approximate something n minus one-dimensional. So our strategy is essentially to use the space of tangent, I mean the tangent space to see to approximate things, but for each element. But for each element on the tangent space, you need to find sort of a best approximation. And this is like not clear exactly what I mean, but you try to find the best possible polynomial that looks like an element on the tangent space. So just to give an example, if you look at the three-membrane problem, Look at the three-membrane problem, and you have two sheets and three membranes coming out. Think about that the top membrane, I'm trying to rotate its boundary data a little bit to the right, and the bottom one to the left. The middle one, I don't need to specify the boundary data because the sun is always zero. So, sort of, the middle membrane is not really an unknown in the problem. And then the question is: what really happens? And then the question is: what really happens to the solution? Do the free boundaries, because I did the free boundaries in the end, they need to remain tangent. So you think this is an element of the tangent space where it makes sense on the tangent space, but it's not clear how well the solution is approximated by cones. So, sort of this, what What we do, we create some sort of approximate solutions, which you can try to think they would give some sort of system of coordinates in which we do the analysis. And this approximate solutions, this is the last slide. So, this approximate solutions, they are as good as polynomial up to a certain scale. So, up to a certain scale, the problem. The approximate solution has an error. So, if you give me a polynomial p, I'm trying to minimize the error, and I can do it up only up to a point tau of p. So, as long as I approximate u, epsilon approximate u with such one of these things, and epsilon is much, much bigger than this error. P-bar is as good as a cone. Good as a cone, yeah. But when epsilon becomes at the level of tau of p, that's when interesting things happen, and there is supposed to be some sort of correction. And you can see this through some sort of drop, a definite drop in the energy. So in some sense, we prove some sort of discrete. I don't have time to go into details, but the strategy would be to prove some sort of discrete logety perimetric inequality by. Log epiperimetric inequality by using these approximate solutions as reference points. Like what you would usually do in Schauder theory, saying that use quadratic polynomials to keep on approximating the quadratic part of U and then updated, updated. Here, instead of quadratic polynomials, you use some approximate solutions and they are good up to a certain error when you reach that error. Error, when you reach that error, something else has to happen that would give some drop in the energy that would be very good for the convergence, for the, let's say, saying that the energy decays a certain amount and proof of convergence. Okay, so I'll stop here. Thank you for your attention. Thank you very much for your beautiful talk. Beautiful talk. Are there questions or comments? Any questions? Ovidio, do you think that it is possible to make some, I mean, in the scalar, I mean, as in the usual free boundary obstacle problems, a classification. obstacle problems classifications of uh of uh of um i mean of uh free boundary pro points according to that for instance you you did and also figalisera did and so forth i mean with all this strata that you can you can identify according to the blow up to the behavior of the blow up i mean it seems to be much more difficult in this case yeah yeah so sort of in 2d that's exactly what we did so in 2d it's What we did. So, in 2D, it's all because one can classify actually cones in 2D. Cones in 2D, because they are cones. In fact, it's a 1D problem, and in the end, it's manageable. However, it seems difficult to be able to classify all cones in more than 2D. So, because this is a scalar function. Scalar function because this is sorry, because this is a vector-valued problem. We don't know. We thought about how to classify just, I mean, it would be nice to say that there are just the profiles coming from 1D, but this is not clear. So, so, so basically, the way you have to do it, you have to say like this: if I end up with this type of I end up with this type of blow-up profile. Yeah, if it's like profile, I don't know, type one, type two, if I know what them, then maybe I can say that for certain profiles, the all those points, they stratify, the free boundary stratifies, that has that behavior. But classifying all of them, I don't know, it seems difficult, or at least we are not able to do it. Okay, thank you very much for your reply. Any other comments, questions? If not, let me
