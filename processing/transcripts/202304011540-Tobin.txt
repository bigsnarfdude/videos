Without further ado, let's hear Bella's talk about applications of dynamical belly maps in arithmetic dynamics. Thank you, Eric. I just want to say thanks to the organizers for inviting me to speak here today. It's lovely in van, but I'm very lucky to be here. And thank you all for attending my talk. So I'm going to be talking about kind of what's like Schmorgesborg of work and applications of dynamical belly. And applications of dynamical belly maths and arithmetic dynamics. A good portion of this work is joint with Jackie Anderson and Michelle Maynes. So we've seen a lot of different number theory talks. None of them have been on arithmetic dynamics. So just to catch everyone up to speed, in arithmetic dynamics, we're interested in studying the iteration of rational maps over fields of number theoretical interest. So we're going to let K be a number field for now. number field for now and we're going to consider some rational map defined over k and we're going to use the notation f to the n just to denote the composition of f of itself n times and we're interested in either maybe classifying points based on their behavior under iteration of f or maybe classifying maps based on the behavior of like special points. So maybe like a critical point might be interesting for us to look at. For us to look at. So we say a point is periodic if eventually the iterates kind of get back to the point we started to record. So f to the n of alpha is alpha. You can also think of it as like a fixed point for some iterate of f. We say it's pre-periodic if sort of eventually the iterates loop back on a place where it's been before, right? It doesn't need to necessarily be the point that you start with. And in both of these cases, And in both of these cases, if we look at this set right here, which we call the orbit, so this is just the set of all of the points that are in it of alpha under F. If this is finite, and we're in the periodic or preperiodic case, if this is infinite, then we say we have a wandering point. So, if we're going to be talking about classifying maps, we're trying to understand maps, we want to make sure that we're doing it to a Maps, we want to make sure that we're doing it up to equivalence. So, in dynamics, two maps are equivalent or dynamically equivalent if they're conjugate via some element of PGL2. So, when you take some conjugate by some element of PGL2 and you started with a pre-periodic point, then that is going to correspond to a pre-periodic point for the conjugate map. So, this is like a natural dynamical equivalence, and it will have. Equivalents and it will have the same period, right? So if you started with a fixed point, you'll, when you conjugate, that's going to correspond to a fixed point. So understanding the dynamics of a map really just comes down to understanding the dynamics of the equivalence class. So for example, if we are looking at a quadratic polynomial or I realize there's a type of here now. Okay, so we're looking at a quadratic polynomial. So some degree T map. It's going to have one finite critical point. You can move Finite critical point, you can move that to zero. And then you'll get something of the form z squared plus z. In general, if you have a single finite critical point, you can conjugate to z to the d plus c for some constant c. So we're sometimes interested in special points, like I said, like maybe a critical point. So, if we are talking about a map that is post-critically finite, then we're thinking about maps where all Then we're thinking about maps where all of the critical points have a finite forward orbit. So they're all periodic or preperiodic. So, for example, we can take this cubic map here. It has critical points 0 and 1, which are labeled with these pink dots. And you see that 0 maps to 1 half, maps back to 0, so that's periodic. 1 maps to negative 1 half, which is fixed. So this is a post-critically finite map. So in arithmetic dynamics, we kind of take a lot of inspiration from two other fields. One is complex dynamics, and the other is arithmetic geometry. So in complex dynamics, you've probably seen this lovely picture at some point, the Mandelbrot zat. And this is really describing the complex dynamics of maps of the form z squared plus z. So these are all of C. So these are all of the maps where zero is the critical point. One critical point, we have a degree two path. And this is living in the complex plane, and this is really describing all of these parameters C, where the critical point zero has a bounded forward orbit. So not necessarily a finite forward orbit, but bounded. This is contained in the disk of radius 2. So 0 is right there, negative 2 is out there, and this is like a quarter. So, this is sort of one area we can draw our inspiration from. And in complex dynamics, we do obviously care about the iteration of the critical point, which is why this is really describing the dynamics of the critical point. And we could ask, well, okay, where are the post-critically finite parameters? Where are the values C, where the critical points have a finite forward orbit? And a lot of them are in the boundary. So if we look at points where one where the critical point has a strictly pre-periodic orbit, that's actually going to be dense in the boundary of the Midland Rock set. And just as a note as to why we might care about the orbit of critical points, they sort of largely determine the dynamics of the entire map. So if you have a critical point with a finite forward orbit, that tells us a lot about the sort of dynamics on the The sort of dynamics on the entire space. So, another area we draw our motivation from is arithmetic geometry. And we have a lot of analogs between arithmetic dynamics and arithmetic geometry. So, in arithmetic geometry, you might be interested in rational points or integral points on varieties. And in dynamics, we are interested in rational integral points in orbits. So, if you're thinking about like a periodic point, that might. Like a periodic point that might remind you of a torsion point, right? And it should, right? That is the same behavior. The analog of torsion points on abelian varieties are pre-periodic points of rational mass. And abelian varieties of complex multiplication are analogs of post-critically finite rational maps. I feel like I know your question. I'm not quite sure. I guess not explicitly. Yeah. Yeah. And this is kind of a loose analog, right? So there's no direct dictionary. It's not like you hand me an obvious writer with complex multiplication and I necessarily have like a post-critically finite rational map that has the exact same properties or something. So trying to understand these analogs and how far we can push this is a major motivation, but it's kind of known that if you have But it's kind of known that if you have sort of concepts or problems or conjectures in arithmetic geometry, you can often rewrite those and reformulate those questions in terms of dynamical systems. So for example, if you think about the uniform boundedness conjecture for torsion points on abelian varieties, that's a special case of a uniform boundedness conjecture for pre-periodic points for rational mass. So I'm very much interested in these post-critically finite rational maps and most of what I'm going to be discussing today is kind of exploiting this analog here or maybe convincing you that this isn't quite a great analog. One of those two. So we're going to be using belly maps to do this. So what is a belly map? A belly map is a finite cover in a smooth projective curve. Projective curve, and we want it to have we've branched at exactly three points. We can take those points to be 0, 1, and infinity, because why not? Those are usually our three favorite points. Since we want to do dynamics, we want to make sure that we can iterate. In order to make sure we can iterate, we want to make sure that we're starting where we end, right? So we can just take the map again and again and again. So we need to make sure that we're starting on P1. V1. And we also want to make sure that when we're iterating, we still have a value map, right? For it to truly be a dynamical value map. So we're going to require that 0, 1, and infinity map into the set 0, 1, and infinity. We're going to go a little bit further with how much we're specifying the conditions of these maps. We want it to be single-cycle in this case, we want a single ramification. In this case, we want a single ramification point above each 0, 1, and infinity. And we can always normalize so that 0, 1, and infinity are fixed. And this isn't like normalized, these aren't conjugates, they're dynamically conjugate, but these are conjugates sort of in the setting of value maps, right? Not in the setting of dynamics. We can always take these maps to have these fixed critical points. To have these fixed critical points 0, 1 individually. So, from the work of Jackie Anderson and Irene Bau and Edger, Bergen, Kerr Mecker, and Michelle Mayness, we have a normalized belly map with this combinatorial type here. And this is really just describing the ramification of this case. It's not too complicated, it's just a little bit of combinatorial data that's telling us about the ramification 0, 1, infinity. The ramification 0, 1, infinity. And there's an explicit description of the belly maps that have this combinatorial data. And it looks a little scary, not too bad. These actually will always have integer coefficients. They always have content one. They're actually fairly nice and good to play with, I would say. And these are all polynomials. There is another form for rational maps, right? You change this combinatorial type. It was combinatorial type, and this would no longer be d. Then you will get a rational map, and there is an analogous theorem for rational maps, but we're not going to need to use that. So, we want to see how we can use these dynamical belly polynomials in arithmetic dynamics, and there's three things that we're going to be touching on today. So, the first is that these are critically fixed polynomials. All of the critical points are fixed points, right? Critical points are fixed points, right? Just by the way that we constructed these maps. So we can use this family to answer questions about heights of conservative polynomials, which is just another word for critically fixed. We can use these as sort of a building block for a family of what we're going to call bicritical polynomials, and we can use these to kind of classify some post-critically finite maps. And lastly, we can use these to actually learn. We can use these to actually learn some reduction properties of post-critically finite polynomials. And I would say this last one is kind of the most surprising and interesting, so stick around for the end for the punchline. So let's start with this first application. So a while ago, Silverman posed this question about critically fixed polynomials. In particular, he asked this question about monic polynomials where zero Polynomials where zero is fixed, and that is also conservative, so also critically fixed. And he really wants to know how does the height of these polynomials grow? If we look at this family, how does the height grow? And we can actually answer the second question in the negative. So, this one we can use these dynamical belly polynomials and say that this is not true. So, our dynamical belly maps are conservative, right? They're critically fixed, but they don't follow all of these conditions here, right? It's not monic. So we need to make sure that we are conjugating to actually make it monic. So we can do so by just conjugating by this element of PGL2. PGL2. So we're just taking the D minus first root of the leading coefficient. And we get that if we look at the height of these, we fix one of these values, okay, and we look at the height of these dynamical value maps as we let the degree go to infinity. Then we notice that it doesn't necessarily just grow like 1 over d log D. It actually, compared to 1 over D log D, we get... Compared to 1 over d log D, we get a limit of K. And now K can be as big as D minus 2, right? Because it's a ramification index. So our K can be fairly large. We can let K be arbitrarily large if we want. So this is not a finite limit necessarily. We can let K be arbitrarily large here. So how can we do this? We can use Mahler measure. So the Mahler measure of a So the Mahler measure of a polynomial is just given in terms of the leading coefficient and the absolute value of the roots of the polynomial that are larger than 1. And if we have integral coefficients and content 1, then we can write the height of the polynomial in terms of log of the Mahler measure. Okay, using Mahler measure is very nice and kind of allows us to do this fairly quickly. us to do this fairly quickly. We can just look at the height of our belly polynomials and then we can just bound the difference between the belly polynomial and the conjugated belly polynomial that would kind of allow us to answer Silverman's question. And this is only going to depend on k and d and then we can use that to kind of show that this is actually the difference is going to go to zero and we'll get the statement. So it's not necessarily totally Necessarily, totally surprising that this question is not correct and that belly polynomials would help us answer this question. This question was kind of formulated in a time when we didn't have a lot of examples of conservative polynomials. We had a few examples, we had a few nice families, but we didn't have a family like we do for the dynamical belly maps. In fact, just the construction of the dynamical belly polynomials answered another question of Silverman in the... Another question of Silverman in the negative by showing that there are conjugacy classes of dynamical belly polynomials of degree D, and the number of conjugacy classes is bounded independent of D. So just knowing that we kind of now have so many conservative polynomials is sort of why we can now get a little bit more information and answer this question. Okay, so the next application here. Application here. We can use this as a building block and find bi-critical polynomials and use that to find post-critically finite polynomials. So going back to our picture of the Mandelbrot set, right, that's looking at things that the form z squared plus c. Okay, and these, the Mandelbrot set is really describing all of the post-critically bounded parameters, right? So parameter C where the critical point had. Of parameters C where the critical point have a bounded forward orbit. And if it's post-critically finite, obviously it's going to also have a bounded forward orbit. So all of the parameters that gave us a PCF map have to be in the Mandelbrot set. The Mandelbrot set is contained with disk of radius 2. That tells us that the height of C has to be at most log 2. So using Northcott's theorem, So using Northcott's theorem, we know that for any fixed integer b, there are at most finitely many parameters c or that it would admit maps of the form c squared plus c that are defined over a number field of degree b. So this is specifically now for these polynomials of this form c squared plus c. But what about in the case? But what about in a case where we have a degree d map? What if we have more than just one critical point? What happens? Or what happens for a general polynomial? So in 2011, Patrick Ingram studied post-critically finite maps over number fields. And his idea was saying, okay, there should be finitely many of these. How can we show that there are actually only finitely many post-critically finite polynomials over a number field of bounded degree? Over a number field of bounded degree. And he used something called the critical height, which I'm not going to get into too much here. And his main theorem is actually about critical heights. This is really kind of like a corollary or a reframing of his main theorem. But this is really just telling us that there are only finitely many conjugacy classes of PCF polynomials of a given degree with coefficients over a number field of some facted degree of B. And moreover, they should be like effectively computable. We should be able to find these. So we can try to actually go through and say, okay, how many PCF rational maps are there? Maybe I just start with polynomials. How many PCF polynomials are there? Let's just say over the rational numbers. Starting with z squared plus z, and this is like a well-known classical result. If we look at things with the form z squared plus c. look at things with the form z squared plus c and we require c to be a rational number then c has to be zero negative one or negative two all right and a fun little jump-off point if you're tired of paying attention you can just show this yourself right it's really not too bad to just just kind of process of elimination get down to those three points what about z to the d plus c right it's kind of the the next step and here c has to be a zero or Has to be zero or negative one as long as our degree is greater than negative three. Okay, all right, what about many things? I have two critical points. So in Patrick Ingrow's paper on post-critically finite polynomials, he looked at polynomials in this monic-centered form, right? So z cubed plus a, z plus b. And he classified all of the PCF cubic polynomials in this form over the Cubic polynomials in this form over the rational numbers. A few years later, Lucas, Menas, and Yap classified all of the PCF rational maps of degree two to find over the rational numbers. And this is what that last one kind of looks like. We have this explicit classification of all quadratic rational maps defined over rational numbers at our PCF. So, a few things to kind of note about this. So a few things to kind of note about this. So first, this is kind of an analog of looking at like elliptic curves of complex multiplication. I think there's like 11 of those, maybe 12? One of those numbers, right? It's a small number. We see 12 of these. And the way that they went about this is very algorithmically. So they first started by kind of understanding reduction properties of post-critically finite maps. They've used some of the like what we know in dynamics about reduction to actually get sort of a testing space. And then they just ran through some code and tested all the parameters in their space and said, okay, does this fit out a PCF map? And then they got this nice list. And then from this list, they were able to conclude some things about how many rational periodic points can show up in post-critically finite maps that are. Maps that are quadratic and defined over Q. Okay, so that's sort of the order that they went in. I just want to make note of that because we're going to move on to another result, but the order of events is kind of a little bit different there. So we know things about cubics, we know things about maps with one critical point, so what about two critical points? points. We're going to say a polynomial is bi-critical if it has two, exactly two finite critical points, and we want them to be distinct. So our belly polynomials have two critical points that are finite, right? They have zero and one. So let's take our two critical points and let's move them to zero and one, right? Okay, if we do that, then we'll get something of the form A times. Of the form A times the belly polynomial plus C. Now, if we started with rational critical points, then we're going to end over whatever field we started in, right? This is going to preserve the field of definition. If we start with an irrational critical point, we don't quite preserve the field of definition. That's a little bit complicated. We can get to a quadratic extension for C. But if we start with rational critical points, But if we start with rational critical points, then we'll end in our field of definition. So, this is a good form to look at, right, since it preserves the field of definition. So, now we can ask the question, right, how many bicritical polynomials of degree greater than or equal to 3 are defined over Q and R P C F? So, I had mentioned before that Ingram in his paper had looked at cubic polynomials of a certain form over Q. That form actually does not preserve the field that definition. Actually, does not preserve the field of definition, so it was missing a good number of PCF cubic maps. So he found some PCF cubics, but not all of them. So borrowing some notation from his paper, we can write our polynomials sort of in this standard form, a to the d times z to the d plus so on and so on. And this And this 2D sub V is really either just going to be 1 if we're talking about a non-Archimedean place or 2D if we're talking about an Archimedean place. And we're going to define this constant C in terms of just whatever place we're working over and the max of these ratios of the coefficients of the poly. So we can use this and say, all right, if we have This and say, all right, if we have some polynomial of degree D and we have an iterate of a point that is larger than this bound here in any place, then that has to be a wandering point. So this is really like an escape radius. It goes beyond this, then it's escaped, and we have a wandering point. So if we want to say, okay, if we want to find post-critically finite maps, we can look at the iterates of the Finite now, so we can look at the iterates of the critical points and say that in every place it has to be bounded by this constant here. Okay? All right, so using that and our nice form for bipritical polynomials, we can complete the cubic case by following this strategy here. So we find normal forms that respect the field of definition. So in a lot of cases, that's A times some Belly polynomial. That's A times some Belley polynomial plus C, right? Our nice belly form. We know that it has to be post-critically bounded in every absolute value. So we can use the bound on the previous slide and kind of use this to find bounds and the coefficients for the maps. Kind of like play this inequality off itself a few times. And then that's going to give us a search space. So we can use those bounds to create some sort of finite search space, and we can do this very algorithmically and then just have Sage kind of run through that list and tell us if our maps are PCF or not. So what do we get? If we're specifically looking at this belly form over the rational numbers and we're looking at the cubic case, then we get that the parameters A and C have to be contained in this list. And C have to be contained in this list here. And going through this strategy, actually, is you don't, your search base is really fun. Like, to get the cubics, it was like the original search base is like 126 pairs. So even if I didn't have a computer, I could, if I wanted to, do that by hand. That's not terrible. But we get these, I think this is 11 of them here, right? 11 different pairs that would admit a post-critically finite quality. admit a post-critically finite polynomial over the rational numbers. And you could extend this to a number field and you know look at different cases here. But for now we're just kind of trying to see how many there are and what they might look like. But we have that field of definition problem, right? We want to make sure that we are preserving the field of definition. And I said that if we have an irrational critical point, this might not preserve the field of definition. Alright, so usually it preserves the field of definition, but this we have actually completed the qubit case and we get that there are exactly 15 qubit post-critically finite polynomials defined over the rational numbers. We have our two unicriticals here that we already knew about. Numbers 3 through 13 are the ones we get using our belly form. And numbers 14 and 15 are a little bit different, right? They're written in a different way. Are a little bit different, right? They're written in a different form. Like this one has that squared term, these we write with a linear term. And that's just because we kind of found them in a different form. We did still use that belly form, but we had to also use another form. And in fact, when we kind of went through the algorithm, the search space for these was like closer to like 40,000 or something. So no one wants to do that by hand. All right, but we have this entire list of post-critically finite cubic polynomials defined over the Finite cubic polynomials defined over the rational numbers now. So we might want to get this first of all just to know sort of how many there are. We know that there's finitely many, but how many is finite? And 15 is pretty finite. That's like a pretty small number. So it's nice to know that there's exactly 15 of them. And it's also nice to have these as examples. Cooking up a post-critically finite polynomial that isn't just like unicritical isn't necessarily trivial. So it's nice to have... Isn't necessarily trivial, so it's nice to have these examples now that we can play with and try to explore some properties. All right, so there's gonna be a quiz later. The answer is this. I'm like a little serious. Okay, but I'm giving you the answer ahead of time because it's a weekend, so why not? All right, so keep that in your pocket. What about higher degree polynomials? These are cubics, but we really kind of want to understand how many post-critically finite polynomials there are, maybe. Polynomials there are maybe of degree D. And let's just think about the bicritical case for now. So if we have a bicritical polynomial, it has a critical point of ramification index 2, specifically of 2, and we have degree at least 11, then we can always conjugate it to the form A times B D, and here our K value is 1. And that's, again, corresponding to these ramification indices. Indices plus C. So we're in this nice belly form here. And if our polynomial is PCF, then these parameters have to be in this list here. They're exactly this list. So there's a few things that are kind of interesting about this. So first of all, this is fixed for all degrees higher than 11. So that means that we're not getting more post-critically finite polynomials sort of with a critical. Sort of with a critical point of grammar index 2 after a certain point. So that's a little bit interesting. I think kind of new ones stop showing up. And the method to get these is actually a little bit sort of backwards than what was originally done to get the quadratic rational PCF maps. So here, I actually started this by finding the number in actually classifying the pre-periodic Classifying the pre-periodic rational points for post-critically finite maps and then using what I knew about pre-periodic rational points to say, okay, well, I can kind of exploit that and know that the critical points have to go to one of those in order for this to be post-critically finite. So it's kind of a reverse algorithm than what the authors did for the quadratic case. All right, so this is specifically when we have replication index. Is specifically when we have ramification index 2, and you might be thinking, well, what about higher ramification indices? This was a pain to get and was a little bit brute force and wasn't fun. So I ran some code and said, okay, what do I think is going to be happening if we increase the ramification index? And it seems to be that in every case, we'll hit some point, right? So in this case, it was 11. We'll hit some point. Case it was 11. We'll hit some degree where sort of new post-critically finite maps stop showing up. So essentially, like this set seems to exist for all values of k. So the set of parameters or rational parameters where a polynomial of form a times b plus c is post-critically finite seems to kind of be not only a list of fixed size but completely describable just based on the polynomial. But completely describable just based on K and the degree D. I haven't quite figured out how to show that yet, so this is something that's been on my mind of trying to develop some new tools and trying to figure out how can we really extend this result to a much more general setting. All right, the third one. We want to be thinking about dynamo, how these dynamic Cobelli polynomials are post-critically finite and Critically finite, and we can then use these to look at reduction properties of post-critically finite polynomials. So why do we want to think about this? We know, as I described before, that these are thought of as dynamical analogs of CM abelian varieties. So CM abelian varieties are defined over number fields. And we always know that there is And we always know that there is some extension of that number field so that when you base change to that extension, we have everywhere good reduction. So now you say, okay, for what do we know about post-critically finite maps? We know that they're algebraic. So we know they're defined over some number field outside of one family of post-currently finite maps. So this kind of begs the question: do they have good reduction? So, what does this mean? Now, we're going to let K for the remainder of the talk be an algebraically closed field. That's going to be complete with respect to some valuation V. We're going to let little K be the residue field and P the maximal ideal. We can always write a rational map in some normalized form, so it has integer coefficients, no common factors between the numerator and the denominator, and we want one coefficient to have the absolute value of one. One coefficient to have absolute value of one. So you can always write it in that form. And then we can just reduce the coefficients mod p. And that's the reduced rational map. So if when we reduce our rational map, if the degree stays the same, we say it has a good reduction. So you reduce it and you got a map that was very similar, right? Dynamically, probably very similar if it has the same degree. Otherwise, we say it has. Otherwise, we say it has bad reduction. So this behaves really well with iteration. These tildes are a little hard to see, but if you reduce the nth iterate, that's the same thing as taking the nth iterate of the reduced map. So reduction commutes with iteration. This also tells us that if we have a periodic point, say of like some fixed period. Of, like, some fixed period for F, that's going to correspond to a periodic point for the reduced map, and the period of that point has to divide the original period that we have. Yeah? Why do we assume the field is algebraic composed? Where J might not need that? It's a big question. That's a big question. I don't think we do need, like, yeah. I guess we need the electric signals. But I guess we can characterize signatures. No. All right, so what do we know about polynomials with good reduction? The FAT2 set is just all points where the family of iterates is epicontinuous. And the Julia set is a complement of the Fatu set, right? So the Fatu set is like. Into the Fatus set, right? So the Fatu set is like well understood. Points near to each other stay near to each other. And the Julia set is like thought of as like a locus of chaos. The dynamics are interesting on the Julia set. But we know that if we have good reduction, the Julia set is empty. So this means that bad reduction is kind of dynamically interesting. Because bad reduction is when we have that like a fun Julia set to try to understand. To try to understand, some interesting dynamics could be happening in that case. So, we also know that we have good reduction if and only if any iterate of our rational map has good reduction. And these are, this first thing is kind of just like as a fun motivating fact for good reduction, and this theorem of Benedetto tends to be useful sometimes. So, we wanted to. So, we wanted to describe these up to conjugation, right? And it's not clear that if you have a map that has maybe good reduction, that you can't conjugate it so that it has bad reduction or vice versa. So, we say that a map has potential good reduction at some prime, if you can conjugate it and get good reduction, right? So, if you start with bad reduction, but it has a conjugate that has good reduction. So, we say it has potential good reduction. If it doesn't have potential good reduction, so all conjugates have bad reduction. So, all conjugates have bad reduction. Say it has persistent bad reduction. So, how do we know if it has persistent bad reduction or potential good reduction? So, we can use a theorem of Benedetto, right? And I think of this as almost like a little mini Tates algorithm. So it kind of gives us like a nice model to look at. So, if we have a polynomial and we can always conjugate it so that it fixes zero and is monic, right? Zero and is monic, right? And that's kind of the best case scenario. We look at that conjugate that fixes zero and is monic, and it has good reduction, then we know that we have potential good reduction. But if it has bad reduction, then we have persistent bad reduction. So conjugating to that form and understanding the reduction properties of polynomials of that form is really telling us if that entire conjugacy class has persistent bad reduction or potential good reduction. And we're going to want to exploit this theorem later on. So, what do we know about post-critically finite polynomials? If we have a unicritical polynomial and it's post-critically finite, then we're really just, if we take some things, say, of the form like z to the d plus c, and we let that be our polynomial, and we want it to be post-critically finite, then that means that. Critically finite, then that means that C is really a root of something of the form of polynomial indicat with integer coefficients. So we're going to have an algebraic integer. So we're going to have good reduction every year. So everything, all the unicritical PCF polynomials have good reduction. So now our question kind of has to change. Our question kind of has to change a little bit and say, all right, so when do we have good reduction and when do we have bad reduction? So, for a given degree, for which primes does there exist a post-critically finite polynomial with persistent bad reduction at that prime? Can we maybe find pairs of degrees in primes where we can always find a post-critically finite polynomial of degree D with potential good reduction at that prime? And then, can we find non-unicritus? Then can we find non-unicritical post-critically finite polynomials that have good reduction everywhere? And we also maybe want to say that they're not like a composition of unicriticals. So we know due to theorems of Jackie Anderson and Adam Epstein that if we have a degree D P C F polynomial and a prime that it is greater than the degree, then we're going to have potential deradction of A. Then we're going to have potential dereduction at P. We also know if our degree is a prime power and we have a piece, then we're going to have potential due reduction at that prime power. So what about other primes? What about primes that are less than the degree and where the degree isn't just a prime power? So now having a bunch of examples of post-critically finite maps might come in handy because we can just look at these and say, well, what are the reduction properties of these maps? What are the reduction properties of these maps? All right, this has good reduction, this has good reduction, and most of these, the rest of them, have bad reduction. What prime would they have bad reduction at? As the first part of the quiz? What it would be? Two. I see some twos. Right, we know our prime numbers. Okay, right, so these have bad reduction at two, except for one of them. Which one do you think? Which one do you think has potential good reduction? 11. Okay, great. See? Hopefully, there would be a quiz. All right, so 11 is a little bit special, right? This has potential good reduction at two, right? And it's not unicritical. So now it's like, okay, those can exist, right? We can have cubic PCF polynomials that aren't just unicritical, where we have potential giving reduction at two. Potential gint reduction at two. So, when does this happen? Why is this happening? Why is this not special? All right, so keep kind of reformulating our question and trying to get down to something that sort of makes sense as a question based on the data that we have. So, now we want to fix some integer D and say, for which primes does there exist a KCF polynomial of persistent bad reduction of A? Right, so for degree three, we know there. Right, so for degree three, we know there exists a PCF polynomial with persistent bad reduction of two. We saw many of them, but we also know there exists some that have potential good reduction of two. So we can use this lemma of Benedetto that I said before and look at our dynamical valley maps. And we know that there's always going to be some prime such that these dynamical value maps have persistent value reduction at the prime. And it's actually Reduction of the prime. And it's actually going to be any prime that divides the leading coefficient. Like you just kind of can't get rid of them. They just always kind of either hang out in that leading coefficient or they can move to a denominator somewhere and will always get that reduction at those primes. This actually extends to any critically fixed polynomial with content one. All right, so can we build belly maps with a with persistent battery reduction at some given prime? So there's a lot of sort of conditions here, and we can go through all of the conditions and what this is saying, and then I'll try to sort of paraphrase. So we're going to pick some prime p, and we're going to write any degree d as p to some power times l. We want l to be bigger than p. Needed not to write l. We're going to We're going to write L just using the division algorithm in terms of P with some remainder R and then we're going to find like choose a particular K value and this K value is going to give us a belly map of degree D that has persisted by reduction of that fraction. So all this is really saying is if we have some degree D and some prime that fits these conditions. That fits these conditions here, right? So, we really, it's this elevator, the OP that's really important here. Then we have a belly map that has persistent battery reduction on the prime. So this is like almost like halfway answering that question. If you give me a pair of a degree and a prime, I can maybe build you a belly map that has persistent bat reduction at that prime. But what if I can't find a belly map that has persistent bat reduction at that prime? How do you know another map doesn't exist that has persistent bat reduction? Doesn't exist that has persistent reproduction there. And this is one area where these belly maps are sort of suspiciously interesting. If I can't hand you back a belly map with persistent battery reduction at that prime, then one does not exist. So these are sort of, in some sense, like as bad as they get in terms of like PCF polynomials. So if we have some degree D greater. If we have some degree d greater than or equal to 2 in some prime p, then there exists a PCF polynomial of degree d with persistent biodirection at that prime, if and only if the conditions that were in this proposition here hold. So if and only if there exists a dynamical belly polynomial persistent fat reduction F E. So these are really sort of like PCF maps that get are as bad as they get. And this is, I find it to be a little suspicious because all we really did To be a little suspicious because all we really did here is just add one more critical point. Right, we understand unicritical maps, they have good reduction everywhere. We just have one more critical point, and we get like the worst case scenario in terms of reduction. All right, so we can go over the proof idea a little bit. And this is really just some of the common techniques that we might use in arithmetic dynamics. That we might use in arithmetic dynamics. And while it proves that the theorem is true, I think it's not super enlightening because to me it doesn't explain why this is happening. Some proofs really explain sort of why this is happening, dynamically giving us a reason. And I feel like this isn't really dynamically giving us a reason as much as just sort of kind of playing with the coefficients and using what we understand about the value. About like the valuations of the coefficients and such. But it's dynamically unsatisfying. So let's assume that we have L less than P and we have persistent bad reduction at P. So we're sort of assuming the opposite here. We're going to get a contradiction. We're going to look at the Newton polygons, the ones that give the fixed points, so f and z minus z, and the ones that give the critical points. And the ones that give the critical point, so the derivative. So we're going to look at those two Newton polygons and kind of play those Newton polygons off of each other a little bit. So looking at these Newton polygons, they're going to exist some positive r, and that r is actually just going to be the rightmost, the slope or the rightmost segment of the Newton polygon of f and z minus z. So this looking at those fixed points. So we take that slope, and we're going to see that See that there exists some i such that we have i fixed points of absolute value less than p to the r, and at most i minus one critical points of absolute value less than p to the r. And the fact that we have fewer critical points here of that absolute value is what's really going to be important. So, in order to remain post-critically bounded, each critical point has to lie in the disks centered at fixed fixed. Disks centered at fixed points of radius API. Now, if we look at the disk around zero, we see that there's going to be at most i minus one critical points and exactly i fixed points. And this is like with multiplicity, right? So just counting the critical points and fixed points that are left and using the study on pigeons in their holes. The study on pigeons and their poles, we know that there's another disk that contains at least as many critical points as fixed points. Okay, so now we're just going to translate, move whatever disk has at least as many critical points as fixed points to be centered at zero. And now this map has fewer critical points with absolute value p to the r than fixed points, but this same argument should still hold. This will still hold, and so we get a contradiction. Hold, and so we get a contradiction. So again, dynamically a little unsatisfying, but it is sort of using a lot of the tools that we use in arithmetic dynamics. It likes to exploit new polygons and kind of understanding escape radiuses of special points. It's very unhappy. Any tips on how to make it move? I didn't get it off anything. It's frozen. It's frozen. Ah, perfect. Technology. Technology is going to be an example. I did that on purpose, don't worry. So the Zoom session shows it. Yeah. Protected doesn't. Alright, so a quick example here. Let's look at the degree 18 case. So we know we want to understand that any prime greater than 18 is going to give us potential good reduction for all PCF degree 18 maps. We're calling them the other. So we only have to think about prime. So we only have to think about primes less than 18. And then these columns here are really giving us that nice form that we had, like p to the n times l, where possibly l is greater than p. And if l is greater than p, then we would have a valley polynomial that has persistent battery action at p, which are all listed in this rightmost column. But at 2, we don't get a valley polynomial, which means that there are no PCF polynomials of degree 18. PCF polynomials of degree 18 that have persistent bad reduction F2, right? They all have potential for reduction F2. So just sort of illustrating that this is giving us sort of all we need to know about persistent bad reduction. So what can we say about good reduction now? So I gave this talk a while ago and Adam Epstein asked the question. He said, okay, you know, now we know about persistent bad reduction. What about potential good reduction everywhere? About potential good reduction everywhere, right? When can you make there be potential good reduction? So let's take a degree D and some prime P, and let's try to build some polynomial that has potential good reduction at P. So we're going to model it off of that polynomial number 11 that was on your quiz. So here we're choosing f of 0 to be d over d minus. f of 0 to be d over d minus 1, which happened in that nice sort of special polynomial where we have that good reduction at 2. That's a fixed point. And f of 1 is a plus d over d minus 1. And we are going to sort of force a critical orbit relation here. So we're actually going to force this to be a fixed point. All right, forcing that to be a fixed point, we can get some nice sort of polynomial that A needs to satisfy. And then we can again use Newton polygons to kind of Newton polygons to kind of try to understand the values of a and our solutions that polynomial to that are like a root of that polynomial and using that we'll say that there is definitely an a where f will have potential good reduction at p right just by looking at the new polygons so we can find good reduction at a particular prime but this isn't really answering the question can we find good reduction everywhere so So, kind of still an open question that we're working on, but suppose that we have some sort of some positive integer d. Can we find a PCF polynomial that's not a composition of unicritical polynomials, not Chevy Chev, not Lattez, that has potential good reduction at all primes? So, we want it to sort of not be special in any of these ways. We could also say, okay, how bad can the reduction be? The reduction be right, so you can use like the resultants to try to say, to try to figure out sort of how bad reduction can be in some sense. And so it might be interesting to say, okay, you know, is there some sort of bounded component of how bad reduction can be for a post-critically finite polynomial? And we've seen a few different applications of these dynamical belly maps, but we've also seen that they're sort of suspiciously strong, especially in this reduction case, right? We're just looking at Case, right? We're just looking at this next case where we have these two critical points. This really helped us understand some dynamical properties. So, how far can we push that? How can we use the family of dynamical belly maps or the family of bi-critical polynomials to try to get a better understanding of dynamical phenomena? So, thank you so much for your time.
