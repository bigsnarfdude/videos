Gracias. Aber, um, all gracias per invitarme. So, if you don't direct with mathematics, because I use mathematics, in general, no mathematics. Matemáticas your bueno. This I puma y seems my licensed mathematics in the Unami, especially a matemáticas puras, a mastery of applications and doctorado applicadas. And work in this centro, that is Fred Hoch, who has caused cancer, but in a great division of infectious influence. And that is what I medicate, all that infirmities with. All the informed works, the mejorsement, the visual one, but work with many infirmities, in particular, work with influenza, and the messes in my life exclusively with COVID. And how is the description of what? And how I do mathematics, more mathematics, and here. And here, well, epidemiological models or population, and some of the mathematics that use them also model for models, and have some other themes. And finally, in what more concentrated, and what more gustan related is optimization of intervention in public and in that passage of NIVID, and that. Sando lo in libida, and that what is there of the charlatan, voyage because model COVID model voyage of the optimization of COVID. And if there are time, well, here with the first, and two projects this, and if there are time, it's going to misendo projecto, but we know and the other thing that. And the other things that I have in Spanish, as I entered a disculpa, because I will super poacha there and traditional. As I was talking about the first thing that is in COVID, and a quantification of the interventions of social distancing to retraced the COVID plan, because it works with COVID. Les quiero recordar como puel chronología de COVID. I vivo ensued in the Washington, the first caso of COVID in estados unidospo identified here in the state of Washington, the 20 degrees of 15. The first caso load in parallel que pas in México, in Mexico first official identificado masomen mastarde, segura menta via casos desiantes. The 2019 fever, as a member of the stadium of Washington, a proclamation of emergency, and the three Joachim who worked in a mobile vast impression to work. When you have no idea of social distancing, I think it was the first great investigation, but it is very great. Investigation, but it is very great. And for the first time, we have worked on it because the Hoch tenos patients with cancer, entrepreneurs have many patients and a commitment, and no query that COVID and cabara with all the world. So that is what I'm doing. In this post, so 35 years, but the functionaries of public. Los functionarios de publican este termino de planar la curba planner. Y lo que querían decirgo como échentamir figuritas así, espango que Mexico tobira una luna figura destillo in the periodic figure, not that what curb seventh curve seems like plana because the same number of infections is more than the vista desale public. That the functional public. But Publica decided. But my social media, what the gentle decides. Because we have this solo como influenza. We have given this queen influenza. Solo affected here for the population. And there figurines así, but no via quantification of this plan to the curb. So I think one of the things that is in the And what people can do, for the three par el 16, model that originally very, I will put on Facebook, and I want to say already, is that their ya attendeo impacto directo en el número en muertes de COVID. The COVID. So, vaccine in the very sense, avoid the label, and one possibility of our cases, in the case of Mexico, 3 parentheses that they similarly. So, this model was one of the equations of differential equations, nothing, but what are four new. loquimos per comparison four distancing social distancing. And that well that passes and reduces the contacts of the adults mayors, of the most important or reducing contacts of nineties, or the rest of the adults or the total world. And what can quantify the proportion of cases hospitalization and very clear cases that we have during the first siendas of the epidemic? And so extamiendo here. And so they, in here, is the proportion of cases, in Spanish, here came from the contacts, not here for hospitalization and history. So what is obvious in this graphic in the various verdicts, which is the people, is that if reducing the contacts of the adults in more than 60 podiums. Adults in more than 60 podiamos evidence. And that reduced the contacts of all the groups, some adults may not be pornography, reducing their contacts only, 15%, we have reduced 20% of the marties. But the other concept that this project is reality is of planning the curve. That plan to curb, not as well. And that distanced social detail, respect where we are in the private sector. The unique queasamos will retrace the curb, and that in this graphic of the issue, here in the norms of cases for dia, and here is what the first cases. Report the first time. And what is here in relation to depending on what social distancing is not absolutely correct? We are very happy. And that is not because the time to the hospital of preparing infrastructure, but that passes in the social temporary society in my case in this case the points. In this case, the pointitos there maricán los when the social enlisted Washington y semanas despues queer local governador different supreme order in here we are in service. In change, y el distanciamento socielen pebas mastar respecto la epidemia, to sipo demos observar está planamiento de la curba, que lobe here, love a poco con rojo. And the other thing that is.  Well, that was the first one that COVID-19 was in Marcel de 20 and for more of the money pushed in vaccine. Because what I live in the 2000s to record this toddler is not in clinical pace. Not in the clinic in past, not in the clinic of vaccine. But I have worked a lot with influenza and a project for color that we are terminating. So we have when they are vaccinated, if we are attending the vaccine, and the measure of control pandemic. But also that the vaccine and inevitable. Comma civa inevitable. So we have some strategy that was based in the science, which is not algo to prioritize vaccines. And the question as more obvious are here that received a vaccine first. And that depends on the efficacy of the vaccine, the number of doses and doses, or the people who are infected. So we can So we can use a model with a structure of data structure, and the juntamos with algorithms of optimization to determine the optimos of some options of COVID in a great variety of scenarios. So the first pregnant basic queue was here with first. This is a collaboration with Julie Iton in the University of Washington, Tiffany London. University of Washington, Tiffany Long, and Elizabeth Brown, Lasos, and Fred Hodge. And that's a article that is quiet with this. So, to empend no sabía in the military, en reliad no sabíamos manyas cosas. Para empezar nos habíamos y vamos attende una va cona. Lasente nos àunte. The people, but it is a great suite, have a vaccine of COVID, but the tendency is rapid as the same. For example, for probability, probability, probability, vaccine, for the last 20 years, and we have no vaccine that functions. They don't have a guarantee that we are vaccinated. Much efficacy, not the number of doses that will be disposable. We are not this. We don't have this. And many parameters of the natural history of the progression of COVID-19, and very incircular in the way of 2020, all very new pandemic. And for city region, ambivalent pandemic is very different than what I think is very different from the DF. Different because different social media respondents of different forms. So, it was many incognitas and inserted, I decided that I wanted to do the number minimum of suppositions, that the most conservative possible conservation, because to parameter very important, and want to explore. And exploring a puestos, so in terms of efficacy of the vaccine, as the other parameters of the models, which I could have an impact in what I decided. And what I finally said, what I wanted to offer a vase scientific de la priorization of some priorities that was applicable to many times, and that depending on one or efficiency. Because Josephía came. Most vaccines that are provided and I want to say that in Bangladesh could be my vaccine, have an effect of tanto, and I have tasks responsible that is the optimal option. And that was very general, can be seen with it. So we are modeling differentials, there are models of groups of data, so I decided groups, but not the SCEs. But all the diseases, two people all in this case of susceptible susceptibility, and expuestos, and this quiet decir que están infectados, pero toda vía nos un infectiosos y después can do zopas. La gente puede puede de. La gente puede de sarrogar un infection asymptomátic, so quié decir que no tiene en ingoma, and not entering que tuberon una infection dears COVID, but also transmitting the masses. That is very important from the point of view of the dynamic transmission and recuperation, and they enter what the spaces, or can be in this face of pre-symptomatic phase, which is important because this. Because in this faces where more contagious content and more like a normal agreement, the ratio and recovery, or can be the hospital, and the hospital is one general or intensive and in these two recovery. That is also two. And the vacuna is that. La vaccuna, what is that repeat? This all this diagram that has here, but the stas in the transitions occur chambian segu in the vacuum. So, here are the equations that do not voy a porn, but the voyage for example, this question of people who are susceptible and. And here that the efficacy of the vaccine alter the probability with the vaccine. And well, and for fines of optimization, all important options terminate in these three questions of public alguna specific or sensitivity. Specificad or sensitivity of the state? No. No. My model tomorrow is diagnostic. It's much more general. And there are other models in the group that works that work much with diagnostic, or with the diagnostic people, but this model is not 2000 and 100%. Tampa los necessitas for what these are equations. And the son, like the digits on groups of data, and the tienen group. Tomé una population of 6 million evidence: that is the population of the state of Washington in where vivo and the demographía dead unidosmicentas important of infections. Of the infections not in symptoms, but transmit igual que las infections that have symptoms. How is that of the presymptomatic originally infections? And in the moment, we have absolutely pero not the most remote idea of when people have infected. So, this is what tomorrow 20%, but in the population. Pupano los abía y also como yo sabía que sora nos que kienza cuentora tamien tami 10 con 10 cuenta percento para que sendo idea recina hora in the stado de Washington tenemos 2% of the population that infected previously with COVID, despite four. But no, I have no changes much for what they are. Okay, and when for the vaccination, you have to manage groups of vaccination groups noticing not the optimization, but also the vista sales public, because it has public available 50 or not in the groups of public groups, not great. So, we have to launch in. Dividimos to the population in 50 groups of vaccination groups, the ninos of eros and novels, the adults who have quarantine, the 50s and 50s and 40s, the majores. And consider vaccinas with efficacy between the vaccine actuation reduce the probability of infected probability, that are not allowed and the articulate. And the article there summaries, but for fines of this plateau, we will concentrate in that and variamos the vaccine to cover between the cognition. Ok, so describe that as the part of how the model describe the dynamic transmission of COVID. Now, what do you say, how optimization? So, for the optimization consideramos four functions objective functions that represent different manners in media, what the pandemic in the society and the four things consider symptomatic infections and this is a proxy for the transmission. The pico de hospitalizations that are not intensive, and if they are intensive encounters, and this is a proxy for the system. Cara in the systemas desalude, and the nomero demuer sobiamentes. And these two agar reporters are like a good memida of which hospital systems decir in the maximum of hospitalization, I vajo de uncerto unbral, so I can guarantee that all the pandemic is available and not in the hospital. Osí, no, and for this. And for these two, with the resultados with objectives, of the Washington state, have dispersed hospitals with COVID and for intensive cuids, only the name of the intensive en el estados. Okay, so the plant of the problem according to tengo 5 groups of vaccination groups need a variable vector. Necessitate a variable vehicle, where they enter represent the number of people vaccinated in the group of vaccination and growth minimizing the objective function, about all the possible values of these vectors. So, what I wanted to do is contradict the mean of my function, of my function objective function. And my objective is a function that, for example, if what I interior is. For example, if what interests the total functions of infections symptomatic, then my function objectives, in the summer of the ICC group, of all that infected with infections in one moment. But clearly that two restrictions important, the first queen summary of the views have a vehicle. Where is the total of disponable vaccines? What is that vaccine to more people from the number of vaccines that have been done? And the second restrictions that came from this behavior that country, where countries, the population in the group of vaccination and group, all these local decides not to vaccinate more people that live in this population. So, this is chantes. So, there are really very publications in optimization in the context of public. There are some work theories, and you do here. And there are some workshops to some informed, and much of this all this influenza and these para colours. And there is a great variety of algorithms of optimization for. Algorithmos optimization, but in general, not very good for objectives of the type of cash, and this all is the objective function. Because I can explicitly describe the function, that is. So, no great cosa, not great. So, replant the problem is a little different. So, this mathematical mathematics are. So, this mathematical map is the same, but we have a great computation. The quantity of people in cases of vaccination to vaccinate, and now they want to change for a variable and where the fraction of the total fraction of vaccines that are the group today. So, our restrictions that are the first one that we can vaccinate with more vaccines of what we have. Vaccine with more vaccine of the ten years, because the sum of the EFCs have been one, and the second one that we can see more people that are in cada population, in cada group, sebuel veto, that y por vet and p esto a que mathematically lo que es gigiantes, fue muy bueno, porque, ahora estoy vivien. Now, I live in a garage that we have the unitary implementation, and I would say many pero. The simplicity of the unitary complexes is the confuent vectors, which are the sum of the FFA one, and we have three dimensions, no? This is a little bit. If I visit a lugaro enlugar, If I visit a lugaro in the 5 groups of vacuums, you will have 3 groups of evacuations that are in the retreat. And what if we can optimize two passes? In the first place, we are going in this complex and simplified unit. And so it is more vacuum that we have in 3 increments. So, for example, here is the same. In incrementals of 0.25, this dividend vaccine that has a top por decided this point that the first group 5% of my vaccine, the second group, and the 30 group 5% of my vaccine. And if you can numerate all the points of this major point, I don't have three groups, have 5, and the puedo dijar la mall, because. Because we have to go to the example of retreat, but there are a point in this matter of here, as examples that have here. And what I want to decide is that the voyage of 5% of the vaccine first group, the group of service decision groups, the vaccine, the group of 25% of the vaccine, and 2% of the Building 500, 50% of the 50. Yentonces, voyage una busqueida in this maya. And there are 25 points in this mall when 5. The calculation, the 2 points, and that. And evaluate one. But valuable functions objective in 1 points a computer, we have a computer cluster, the pueden nace pastada, yes, locimos. So evaluamos natra functions in cadaver one of these points and selections the mejores en points, and my country was 25, and then selectionamos others to the arches, living in this complex implicit unitaria. Unitaria. And my collaborator, and Julie, a peculiar function algorithm for this. And so you are good, but many points in this mall that do not satisfy this restriction that when one multiplicate point for the name of vaccines that have one tier more vaccine that the That the population of that group of vaccination groups, and that is. So, when they do these points, what we can reparate, these points to force this restriction, and reparation. So, that was the first pass. And selectionamos 25, which are the mejors between them, and the other 25 points that select, and there are a point that we agree. Well, a point of solutions in the book because we pass two of these algorithms of optimization, or heuristic algorithms, or in the Heuristic or Mid to determine what the optimal solution. And in general, the great problems in the algorithm here, is that in the local minimum, you have to see in many lads, because we want to make it, and selection points to them that we are covering all the space. But if we agree, one point more and that the solution program. And the solution for rata quiere decir que divided the vaccine between all the groups of proportionalities utama. So if I sufficient vaccine to vaccinate the mitigation of the population, what the rat population is the rata, is that we have a group of dad 50 or 50% of cada groups of dad. So now two masks. And a point more than this solution properties, like initial points for the algorithm of the remote algorithm, and so I correlate as two veces. And that has two solutions optimized. So you declare the optimal solution, the mejor of these solutions. Ejordo estas solutions. I don't know the mathematica that this solution optima. But this idea is what they are the same. This algorithm is very rapid. Well, this is not the algorithm, what is a use of all the space of variables, and the solution is optimized in non-margene, 5% of the vaccine. And the algorithm that is very important is that the majority of the Important is that the majority calculos of calculations and note of the responsible. And that is very important because I want to say that what is other people who want to be able to use more than this in GitHub, and not Latin encounter calcular. And there are many probabilities that are trapdos in minimum localities, because we are exploring all the space. Phew. Okay, now the resultados. So everyone who. So let's go inseñar one results here and want to start slide, don't secure Spanish, a tiene dema cases. Cada quadrito que vemos eso mir una differente efficacia debajunas. Accorden se que yo en mayo del 20 nos a day que. Maybe of the 2000s notía que à efficiencies in the vaccine. Empendo por die especiento aquí y ségiendo 1% aca. Now englón in these graphics represent 2 vaccuna tengo disponible in total. So for example, this says that vaccine sufficient for the mita de la population. So, for example, this cuadritor rojo que marquí aquí, what this Marque here, what this a perdo does not important columna represent one of my groups of vaccination, but 20 25, etc. And the colors me indicate that people of this group have my cued rosa here. What these me dice, okay, if I lose that minimize, and ten vaccines that have been percentage, and Percento. And it sufficient vaccine to cover solo 10% of my population, which is the optimo. Well, the optimo is covered by all the major people of 17, and with whatever debaucha, that is like the group of dad that's different. So this is very complicated, but a reality like a pass for trace only the first ring. To trace all the first renglon esto stadium toddling history. And what is for vaccine que no que nos nuyenas que nos effectivas, lo optimo siempres lo mismos en pieces por el grupo de los adultos majores que son los adultos de major risgo para para amuerotes in COVID, and vas vaccundando as y groupos of dad, vas bajande, vajjand and vajando, conformity more vaccinas in the groups of the group. In the groups of ads, cobblers first the majors of what, etc. If you have vacuums that are very effective, that have efficacious for this phenomenon of a phenomenon, that we have here 50%, and here in 40 years, and here in 2000, etc. And what this is buen, if you have vaccine, Because what is optimism, and it is the vaccine to the ninth, and adults join us. And that is because the groups are in the world. So, what this is if we have a vaccine very efficient, have many vaccine paradigms, the mechanics can be when they vaccines attack the groups of transmission groups, in the torrent group. And when they protect indirectly to the group of torrent groups, how epidemias when we are solutions optimized and contramos. Optimas who contramos. So, here old Quadrito represented a different idea, you said, and they are the epidemia, and what graphic in the symptomatic is. Well, and the first one that we have with this was what we have. What the nominated rebañas, because it was a question that we had in the past, to record many rebaños, the fraction of the population and one that infected to understand the virus. And to see what we see a vaccine perfect, a vaccine perfect. So here, oops, no digest. Cada linear representa vaccundara un presentaj district. Vaccine distinct from the population. So, Negroes are not vaccinated, this rojo esto is like Mexican rose, which is vaccinated. So, what these are, to vaccinate, but more, no, to the transmission, your union of robots, the concept of the population and population. Ottra cosa que vimos es que vaccunas que son sign. We vaccinate that are 50% effective, can reduce significant reducing epidemia and some people can contain the epidemia. Okay, and that is important to use the optimal distribution versus usar establishment programs, a vector decir buena because the world forms, and we have a priorization. So we have here the So we have here the proportion of prevenidas, and here the number of total of the population that we vacuum, and what we see is that usar la distribution maxima debacunas usar la distribution optima debacunas can vitar está 32 mass muertes que usar es distribution de ver bengantos y va cones es comojiran. Bengal, if you like, and that we are here, and it is very important to the distribution optimization very quickly. So, the difference between the radio and the radar is very great in the principle. When you have vaccines, but when you have many vaccines, that is irrelevant. And we can log with. So this is a contour plot, however, a contour plot will have. So that is here the efficacy of the vaccine, and here the total vaccine disponible devo, and what this meant is the. The presentage of infections symptomatic que prevenimos, the presentage of muertes that prevenos, and what we can see that if you have a vaccine that has read the population to contain the epidemia. And if, for example, have a vacuum effective, with one 30%. Vaccine 35% of the population government 5% of the muertes is that to have an impact very great. Okay, how distribution optima constant functions objective functions to the four functions objective functions differentes. So it is here to assume that my vaccine objective are the same that we have. It is more here that optimized. Here is the distribution optimum for inferned symptomatism for infection symptomatic infections here for hospitality not in cubidad intensive aqueous hospitality for what we say is that when you try to optimize or minimize the infections symptomatic infections, the strategies optimize one of the groups of transmission, and the covenants siempre. Y los governes if you don't cunt vaccine the optimos attack this group that is the group more important in the transmission. If you functions objective functions that are more the optimization of the other groups. So what observants are this phenomenon of a phenomenon also in when. Tengo en cuando toy optimizando el pico hospitalario en puedados intensivos. Ok. So we can say respect hospitalizations. So esoteric are contour plots that we say in Spanish with the efficacy of the vaccine and when we have and in negro what this lineage are. As metas, that the Washington dondeamos que star para non dir hospitalio systeme lo que vende de la linea negra para ca du assul quiere decir que non dimos al hospitalar system, what you see here for decir queos hospital systemos la capacity of the hospital system. And what can be here is that the vaccine. On the vaccine that is 5% effective or more effective, can maintain the system of dentro of the limits, what we are vaccinated very population to satisfy the limits. Ok, so I think in conclusion: the pandemic can control when a vaccine. Ser control with a vaccine that has efficacy of the menu 5%, vacuums with strategia optima strategy to the great majority of the population. The pandemic is contained with no vacuum percentage. No, about the pandemic, no secret container has a manera, but antescubid variants. When the videra masse. When the visitor is facing the results, that can be contained in the pandemic, if we are with very efficient, very effective efficiency. Most of the time you can inhibit 35% of the population, simplify when 5% more effective, and there are no. So, with some especially If the vaccine is very effective, like covert strategic optimization vaccine first, the risk groups, but also many optimism vaccines, the transmission group. Voice. So this works in general as very immediately, that is a very experienced very new experience, because also with the principle. But more importantly, these results that are the us organizations of the paradigm, the lineament of how vaccines in general, not for the universities, obviously, but the inclusion. And with that, I think that there is a time for one. How quiet questions are this part as you flaring no calculation as if the son misfuentes queer dinner for this work and came much. Muchas gracias, Laura, is for a plateau interest. Well, you have to say, here we can see a question with the chat. Ano, pardon, a Victoria, I will pass the microphone to much. Mucha diracies por esta plateaumentes impressionante, mucha deracies ta imprus traja. But so for example, what vaccine is standard? Because the case of the main. But we have a via this, but for delta, we're queuing this average. There is a important thing is that many slide, well, not important. Muchas of this experience: much of all the clinical enslaves that miden this efficacious of the crypto blando. What miden esoteric? It is the efficacia contra infermed symptomatic. Symptomatica. And ten slides that disgraced the push aquí que explica comos ligan es two. Enta caso para delta dependa aquí en leas, dependen el estudio que leas, but la vaccuna para infection, que esta de la que estoy ablanda qui están algún lugar entrequariente y 7%. And unlugar como alemana por decir algo que tien está que esenta percento. Sirgo que ten es que 7% of the population vaccunada, este es vijar en está linea sulita, digamos que toda ví esperas ver una curba aquí y esperadías verona curba importantes y esa yamos que 50 percent effective. So, we have this here, oh my como esta suita de ah, semo chamjora yíno, o como la verde. O como la verde. It's not with the epidemia, we are in a luggage like dad the vaccine, and relid retiring because it assumes that a receipt and what is assuming that the transmission is 3, we have 6. Pensamos que six. So the doble de los. So if I say this magrácica concés en lugar de 3, lo que verías es un fico much grande, incluso con 7%. Aha lo importante, lo importante des que unque estas vaccunas allas tienen una disminionción nu importante respect a cuanto te protection para infectar. Siguente nona effica. Efficacia very impressionante respect hospitalization and all infections and infections and inclusion, you can have a great normal group, not one day, but this is not a morning. And that is fundamental. That is fundamental, understand the difference. Perfect. This pandemic doesn't control, can be argued that experiences the perspective. Yes, what y munida del rebaña cona con una si seras los calculos, con una con algo tan infectioso como delta. With infections like inflation, the people who have not seen the population. So, the nerve of content is not what can be done the nominal, with the infectious aspect and combat that are perfect. Or that. What you pass digamos, what do you create much of COVID and what you pass, not like influenza cadaño y cadaño tendras que poner estuva con COVID as you have influenza gracias este other presenta por aquí Rodrigo la la very interestant manyas gracias eso Rodrigo Trevino de la University of Milan. José Rodido Trevino de la University of Maryland. Query has preguntas on the model sientendo bien el model suppones que rankas with vaccunas at 10pm que rank la pandemia, no? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. The model rank with vaccines and society, but ranking that 20% of the population infected, and assuming that. And then it's not that million fictions in that moment. Okay, okay. Otra pregunta. Hola, yosca Andre Rodriguez. Mi pregunta es esti como mides la. This as the effectivity and if this change with respect to people that we visto, no, this is also a variable that can be affecting. Me, the efficiency of the cones is a podcast of art, the platinum of how Decomo se aceso y de y de como chambi con el timepo os en el model algo fijo que fuebo osa este model yo lo coripor por solo unaño y la razón espor que pensaba que nos ayo sabía que kinza que pasaro unaño espuest there nos sabíamos cuanto vadura lun unidad. So era como una buena, eron buen su puesto poner. Ern good with a choice to stand with a macier who correlates. But the efficacy of the vaccines or there is no para masquendo, the efficacy of the vaccines emidenos clinical and that for the clinical enslaved basically for this para COVID-19. COVID, since we are 2 people that the injector with NADA and 2 people queues inject with injecting, the signal 6 meses, and the 6 meses comparable infections symptomatic infections have the group that injected a guy consaling in the group of placebo, and when infections had been infected in the group that And 20 people porqueas por groups and have a response rapid necessity what I could do. But this is one of the clinical energies and how to darplace that is very complex and very interesting. And very interesting. Muchas gracias, minimbrestar lambaldes de la unan. The question that has the probability that the virus much is the same for all the groups of dad and caso. And if the case is all deployed to the correspondent function, supermoso este la probability que los group así coming rasgos, the probability that the multiple probable majority in the majority because the majority have responded in monological. So, the muta, how product of a position here in the frente dividamos, yen sensido decho, omicron, a delaster no idea of omicron, a delaster is that omicron salio de un patient in a A patient in a method where the pudding changed and changed and changed the poro porcelain, and for that pudding the number of brutal mutations that we consist in one more. All that we do, like English, and that. And that includes how to make a model for including. Everything is models that model how videos of people prodive the population. Well, if there are no idea difficult. Okay. Gracias. Gracias, more preguntas. Hasí unitica and felicito for a porado generality. I want to say variables. In the problem for a political problem, but as scientific note of my models, you have to. My models are really very important that also like a por verify. And this is convinced that what I'm saying, but part of what you are saying the results with  Apex summer una gamma of parameters, no. So, I think that it conserva, or a vece este results and that concentrates the optimas to this parameter, or with other sets of parameters the solutions, or to see the number of. You paraver the number of muertes, for example, your tengo como una mela y un rango, no 1 parametro. So, this toy is segura. This is segura de que cuando digo que 0timos optimo. Use a y vecho justo hace two three días menre una articulo que hace una revision de todos, dos que mos echos cosas así que os pel first articulo que salios que hablaba de optimizar. Welleno quebla de. Optimizar. Well, the cablabas prioritized with an article that is public that resume all the articles in that article, and all more coincidence in the sense that mejor yere minimizes more parameters protected more first. And I create what the experience is demonstrated, because the solas or the. Lasolas or solas después de la aba conación en todo dos país aver en todo dos paíces se termino applicando esto. Well, in all countries, that one se termino applicando no, we are retiring. All the countries that are present with adults first, the adults great. In India, decided to reverence, in India, dijero, because many agente opinions that will transform. Because, but what this articulate and many other demonstrators are tenas vaccines and vaccine very rapidly, and not especially, but not the principle of digital principles, all the adults may not vaccinate. And one of these totally absolutely, and also that. That was with it and a great porque notes, or not the vaccine to serve. So, this terminated distribution of the vaccine effect. But I think that if you graphic of the first holiday, the effect of effect, and that segment. When I marry the second, or the effect of the vacuum impression, or I think you are tuber that will be all well, you can change it, but not that I can say 30% of different things. I think my role is more grand, but I don't want to change, but the moment is that inguna manera. That is what inguinal manera and I think in case 9% of the via affected when people are. But that's not one another. This one commentario deer, but   And how time is that caso pued very exhaustive because we have optimizations or vacuums, ideas possible variants of vacuum efficiency and ideas possible, possible. Coverturas, all and there are four functions objective function, all 45, or 45 problems in one and cluster and when we go, but I think 45 cosmos. 2 35 cos enough. If you see one, supo que lo puedos resolve non averas que ya nomo más cuero du cuento tempo meto, but la maya y ver evaluar es 1 la maya, toma algúa cómo or imedia odos alo major pero después cada, pero despues y después de. But it depends on when solutions want to be tus condicions initial conditions. No, that initials I else 25, more 25, 8 repetitive problems, to decide the question, to reiterate the points that I think the question is, I am. I see much to secure. When Rodigo came optimism, verdad is optimal. Because I don't want to circle us, it is very important to have much more in what is that I repeat this process, including 45 years, I repeat processes, 50 veces to 5 optimos, and there decided that the optimo. There decided that the optimo test in this text in the computer, you repeat a veces in the remote puede deserva 10 targets. Problems that I can't do. Did we see the six computadors and cada one of these runs like a dia, my parents? But don't que no pascaras precise. Perdon que no paser más precisa zemal vido. Gracias, gracias, este gracias por todas las preguntas y gracias una vez más al laura por por utarla vamos a talibuna esmas los gracias.
