So today I'm going to talk about high co-dimension phenomena in gauge theory. So by which I mean first of all we are going beyond dimension four and by higher co-dimension I mean we are looking at behavior of gauge theory in co-dimension greater than four. So four in my mind is the critical number as many As many of you know, for is the magic number engage theorem. So, let's begin with some basic motivations, but I won't actually dwell upon these motivations. So, as most of you would be very familiar, there's this famous theory of Donaldson about ASD instantons. And analytically speaking, this theory relies on these three facts about. Three facts about the ASD equation. The first is modular gauge transforms, the equation is elliptic, so has all the nice kind of regularities you have once you put it into the appropriate gauge, like the Coulomb gauge, for example. The second fact, which is analytically the most difficult and most non-trivial, is that if you give me some kind of a priori bound about L2 energy, Priority bound about L2 energy, then a sequence of ASD instantals, a compact modular bubbling phenomenon at some isolated points. So this means, as many of you would know very well, that the energy density of an ASD instanton could well concentrate near a finite number of points. The number is bounded if you give me an upper energy bound. And away from these points, And away from these points, and then after doing some kind of appropriate gate transforms, you would have smooth convergence of the ASD instant home. So we say it's compact modulo-bubbling phenomenon. So the third fact is if you perturb the ASD equation, then for lots of kind of moduli theoretic intersection theoretic constructions you do on moduli spaces, you want to Modulized basis, you want to achieve certain transversality, and you can do that for ASD equations. So, these are the three analytic underpinnings of the Donaldson theory in four dimensions. So, a big theme in high-dimensional gauge theory is to ultimately define enumerative invariance using high-dimensional generalizations of ASD instantons. So, what are examples of high-dimensional generalizations? So, what are examples of high-dimensional instantons? So, maybe I will list three most popular ones. There are more examples actually, but maybe the top one would be the Hermitian-Yang-Young connections. So, this is known in algebraic geometric equivalent language as stable vector bundles. So, the reason these two are equivalent, at least on compact GALA manifolds, Compact keto manifolds is something called Hitching-Kobayashi correspondence. So, this allows us to study Hermitian-Yamills by kind of studying the equivalent problem about stable bundles. And that means the numerative theory can be boiled down to some purely altruometric considerations. And it has a famous name called Thomas and Thomas theory. Thomas and Thomas theory. So once you are outside of the algebraic world, then you actually have to face the full scale of analytic difficulties. So there are two cousins of Hermitian Yamiels, which are also quite popular. So one is called G2 instantons, the other is called Sphinx 7 instantons. So these are associated to special harmony manifolds. Manifolds. So I probably should apologize to Sergei, who probably object to the name. But when I say G2 or spin 7, I always mean the holonomic group of the underlying manifold is G2 or spin 7. Instead of saying the structure group, it's so the relevant equation would look like this. So here, phi is the z23 form. So Ïˆ is the spin 7, 4. Is the spin 74 form. So if you're not so familiar with this, the way you should view all these kinds of examples is that you have the curvature of some connection and you are imposing the condition that the curvature satisfies a first-order linear condition. So you should think of this as a first-order reduction of the Yamiel equation in the sense that these equations, the Hermitian Yami, That these equations, the Hermitian Yamiels, G2 instanton, and spin 7 instantons, they all imply the Yamiels equation. So G2 and Sweene 7 instantons have conjectural applications to defining new enumerative invariants, rather like the DT invariants. But unlike the Haneshi Nyamiel's cousin, they don't have a direct algebra geometric translation and therefore And therefore, so far these things have remained conjectural largely. I guess the only definite progress we have seen so far is Thomas Boposki's gluing construction of many of examples of G2N spin 7 is 10 tons. So, Vopowski and others have a quite grand program pushing in the direction of ultimately defining enumerated. Of ultimately defining enumerative invariance. So, without going into the details of this program, let me just mention that it seems very crucial in this program to study certain sub-manifolds called associative and or Cayley sub-manifolds, which are kind of calibrated sub-manifolds in these special harmony manifolds. And the reason you are sort of full And the reason you are sort of forced to include the study of these sub-manifolds, even if you're purely interested in gauge theory, is because, well, these sub-manifolds appear in co-dimension four. And just like ASD instant tons in four dimensions can concentrate in a number of finite number of points, so these G2 instantons or spin-7 instant tons may concentrate along associative or K-lais and manifolds. Klaus and manifolds. And these intones, if you try to vary the underlying G2 structure or spin 7 structure, then these instant tongues can be born or they can die near the assertives or KL manifolds. So you have to be able to understand what happens when this happens if you want to ultimately come up with enumerative invariance. So the central analytic difficulty, they engage Difficulty in gauge theory, at least in high dimensions, is compactness. So, even in four dimensions, this is quite far from being trivial. In high dimension, this is largely unresolved. So, what is actually known about Yamiel's compactness problem in high dimensions? Let me give you a survey. So, some part of it we have already seen in Mark's talk. So, we know there's something called price. Know there's something called price monotonicity formula, as Mark explained. So, what I'm writing here is just the sort of standard unit ball version of this. So, on manifolds, you have some kind of correcting factors, but this is the basic version. If you are on flat space, you take the curvature, take the L2 integral, but then you multiply by radius to the appropriate power. Appropriate power, you find after some computation that this is actually an increasing function of the radius. So the way you should understand this: when n is equal to 4, this is just the L2 energy. But when n is greater than 4, this is not quite exactly the same thing as the L2 energy. And it's the thing which is more appropriate to look at than the L2 energy. So the second result is epsilon regularity. Result is epsilon regularity. So, if your energy, namely L2 energy, is small, which automatically implies this quantity is small because of monotonicity. So, if you have that, you can bootstrap to higher regularity estimates. So, everything will be automatically smooth and bounded. So, the third big resulting about what is known is About what is known is something called co-dimensional full convergence. So, if you give me an a priori energy bound, so we consider a sequence with uniformly bounded out to energy. So, in particular, the re-normalized energy is also bounded at all scales. Then, after possibly deleting a n minus four, so this means co-dimension four rectifiable. 4 rectifiable subset with bounded Hausdorff dimension, Hausdorff measure. Then, away from this codimension full subset, modular gate transforms, you can extract a sub-sequence which converges locally smoothly to some limiting smooth DAMILS connection on the complement of this coordination 4 subset. So, outside of coordination 4, you have convergence. Ford, you have convergence. So, for people who are not analysts, I should give you some intuition about what coordination 4 kind of rectifiable subset might look like. So, for example, if you're in R4, then coordination 4 just means a number of points. So, if you're in R5, this, so for instance, a one-dimensional sub-manifold in In a five-dimensional ambient space, would define you a rectifiable subset. But a rectifiable subset may not actually look very much like a manifold. So the main problem is something like a Swiss cheese. I don't know how much you like Swiss cheese, but for the purpose of doing an analysis, this is actually bad news. So, for instance, if you have, let's say, R inside Say R inside R5, but you delete a control subset from R, then the resulting thing you get is still rectifiable, but it has plenty of holes in it. So just like a very infinite Swiss cheese, this might not actually be what you wanted. But so far, this possibility is not ruled out. So, in some space, So, in some special holomy settings like G2 instantong or spin 7 instantons, then we know in addition that this sigma is calibrated. So, with some kind of this well, this means this satisfies some kind of special linear algebraic constraints on its tangent spaces. So, we also know that there's a removable singularity result for stationary Yamiel's connection. For stationary Yamiel's connections, if you know the energy is small enough. So, this is rather like the removable singularity theorem for ASD instantons, but instead of dimension 4, you go to the higher dimension. The statement is roughly similar. So, a consequence of removable singularity is that if the smooth limit Is that if the smooth limit, so I mentioned to you that you can take smooth limit away from co-dimension four. So if the smooth limit on the complement of this co-dimension four subset extends to a stationary connection over the unit ball. So a priori, this thing is defined only away from this co-dimension for subsets. So this stationarity property is. Property is not automatic, or at least not obvious, then you would know that this smooth limit away from the codimension 4 subset actually extends globally across the complement, well, across the complement of a subset of M minus 4 measure zero. So instead of having a codimension for some manifold, For some manifold, you expect maybe you removed most of the singularities, and maybe you hope that the co-dimension of the singularity actually could go up a little bit. So you hope that maybe the only essential singularities might not be co-dimension full, but rather higher. So there are some related conjectures which I will mention very soon, but this is not exactly known that. Known that the co-dimension will actually be high. So the only thing known is just the co-dimension for measure is zero. So there's something called the energy identity, which just like in the ASD instanton case, you know that the curvature density, so they define. So if you have a connection, you can take the curvature and this would define you a mesh. This would define you a measure. And a sequence of measures can you can always extract some kind of weak limit. So in the sense of weak convergence of measures, you can always write something like this, where this A infinity is the smooth limit on the complement of this coordination for subset. And this is something called the defect measure, which measures how much. Measures how much energy is lost to this co-dimension four subset. So this thing would be supported on this co-dimensional four subset, rather like the sort of delta masses you see in the empty cell deal connection setting. So we actually know a little bit more about what exactly happens with the defect measure, the sort of energy loss to codimension four. So we know that this takes So we know that this takes integer values up to some maybe one over eight pi squared, kind of usual normalizing factors. And the amount of energy lost to these third-dimensional subsets can actually be explained in terms of co-dimension four bundling phenomena transverse to sigma, this co-dimension for subset. So this is rather similar to what happens. This is rather similar to what happens in the AST case, where you know that the energy lost to those isolated points where bubbling happens, all the energy can be accounted for by the bubbles which arise as bubbling limits. And you also know that the amount of energy lost would be, I would take integer values, essentially. So this is a high-dimensional analog of that. So let me try to mention this. Me try to mention the standard conjectures in this area. So, or really some questions. So, one is how large are the essential singular sets? So, the essential singular set means, well, so we extracted this limit away from co-dimension four. So, as I mentioned, the co-dimension four subset, not all of it, is Not all of it is really singular, so you can after removing the singularities, you expect the true singularities to have possibly higher co-dimension. So this is, so just think about the usual ASD case. So there the essential singular set would be empty. So what happens is that after taking account of bubbling, you have isolated. You have isolated singular points, but these isolated singular points of the smooth limit can actually be removed thanks to the removal singularity theorem. And that means the essential singularity for ASD instantons would just be the empty set. But for high codimension, this is largely unknown. So the codimension 5 conjecture, which is one of the major conjectures in this area, Conjectures in this area say that if you're just working with young mills, more technically stationary young mills, then the essential singularity had better have Hausdorff co-dimension five. The co-dimension six conjecture. That part is that it can be better than five is known because you can take on the fourth sphere, non-homogeneous. Sphere and non-homogeneous anti-software connection, for example, and that doesn't extend through the origin. So you can't do better than five in general. That part is. I was just about to say, in fact, okay, sorry, sorry. Anyway, so as Gonsalo mentioned, you can't possibly do better than co-dimension five. So this is what he said is just why people thought it might be co-dimension five. So there's also something called co-dimension six conjecture. So if you restrict yourself not just by imposing Yam-L's, but by imposing something stronger, those first-order equations, like G2 instantons or spin 7 instantons, then you conjecture that the essential singularity would be codimension 6. So I should mention that codimension 6 singularity can definitely occur. Can definitely occur. So, a typical situation, for instance, would be you have, well, the typical situation would just be a Hermitian Yamios connection with isolated, well, let's say on C3, but with isolated singularity. So a typical thing you can do is to find a connection-yamiel's connection on CP2 and then try to pull back to C3 minus the origin. C3 minus the origin and the origin on C3 would give you an isolated singularity. So that would be a codimension six example. So a more technical question is, do we know that the smooth limit is stationary? So that is actually not known as well. So in special honomy cases, you also hope that the Swiss cheese picture might not The Swiss cheese picture might not actually occur. So, does the bubbling locus have any boundary? So, we know this is a rectifiable subset, but it might have a Swiss cheese type of boundary. So, the boundary might be very uncontrolled. We hope that doesn't happen, but we don't have a proof of that. So, this is one of the outstanding conjectures. And ultimately, even if you could do all of these. Ultimately, even if you could do all of these, you still face the big bus problem. So, can you ultimately make your a priori estimates match up with the very strong assumptions needed in a gluing construction? So, in the ESD case, we roughly can match up. So, the analysis, well, a priori, you have all the sort of estimates you need to justify the bubbling only at isolated point. Only at isolated point picture. And what happens around the isolated picture you can demonstrate to be fully described by gluing construction. So in high dimensions, we are millions of miles away from having some result of that kind. So we have some gluing construction. These gluing constructions assume conditions which are extremely far from being justified by a priori analysis. A priori analysis. So, today's main takeaway message: this is the thing I suppose you to remember: is that the compactness problem is genuinely hard. And the reason this thing is hard is, or at least one of the reasons I should give to you, which I hope to remember, is that high codimensional singularities can be hidden inside. Can be hidden inside codimension four bubbling region in a way uncontrollable by energy. So, so far in gauge theory, in the sort of analytic aspects, the only quantity which has found very effective use is the energy. So, what I'm going to tell you is that if you just have control on energy and nothing else, you can't actually hope to control the topology in a meaningful way. In a meaningful way. And this phenomenon actually already occurs on local examples of Hermitian Year Mills connections. So the sort of examples I'm going to describe to you would concern only Hermitian Year Mills, even though my true intention is that similar phenomena ought to occur also for G2 instant tons or spin 7 instantons. And in those contexts, this would actually pose genuinely difficult obstructions to having a good analytic theory. So there are two main theorems. So one is the construction of a new Hermitian-you know-measure connection over C3, the other case being the unit ball, which I'm going to come back to later. So the theorem. So theorem one says there is a Hamish-Nyamios connection over C3 whose underlying singular bundle, so this is going to be a singular connection, is the pullback of the tangent bundle or code angular bundle of CP2. They don't actually make much difference such that the tangent count at zero is conformally equivalent to the pullback. To the pullback of the Livita connection. So here, conformal equivalence just means you do something with the U1 part of the connection. So this doesn't really make much difference from the geometric perspective. So the important thing is that this is essentially the pullback of the V V G beta near the zero. But the tangent con at infinity. Kong at infinity is the flat connection away from a copy of C inside C3 with a defect measure supported along C. So translated into maybe more intuitive language. So this means that there is a Hamish Nomi supposed for over C3 lying on this singular bundle with a singular pointer at the origin. So near infinity, what happens is that What happens is that most of the curvature density is concentrated near a very small solid angle along a copy of C inside C3. So this would be a co-dimensional subset. So if you try to look at the neighborhood of infinity, then in generic directions, the curvature decays quite fast. And in the limit, you just get some kind of flat connection. Limit, you just get some kind of flat connection. But if you stay close to the copy of C, then in fact, that's the region where most of your curvature is concentrated. So this is roughly the description about what happens near infinity. So what happens near the origin, you should think is just a pullback of the DVG beta connection on CP2. So I should say that on this singular bundle, there is There is one obvious connection which is Hermitian Yamios, and that is just given by the public of the DVG Vita connection. So, in particular, the existence of this Hamish Niyamius connection already gives you something which could be surprising to some of you, namely that if you just give me an underlying algebra geometric Geometric vector bundle, that actually doesn't determine the Hermitian Yamios connection. Well, the reason is just in this example, you have at least two different Hermitian Namiels connections, one being just the conical connection obtained by pullback of the Luvichivita, and the other being this non-trivial connection. So the Hitching-Kobayashi correspondence actually does not quite. Actually, it does not quite hold in non-compact manifold settings. The bundle does not tell you what Hamish-Yamiel's connection is. Can I ask a question, Jang? Yeah. So could this be because if you try to projectivize these on by adding a P2 at infinity, each of these Young-Mills connections would extend in different bundles. Extend in different bundles? That could be an explanation. So, well, I mean, so from the viewpoint I'm taking, this happens because the curvature could be concentrated near a very small solid aircraft. I think that that's roughly equivalent to what you are saying. So if you are looking at the infinity in a more refined way, so by trying to make some compactification and looking at more refined directions, you should be able to. Directions, you should be able to detect the difference. Yes. Okay, thank you. So a less superficial way of understanding this theorem is that this gives you a local model for the generic situation of codimension six singularities to be embedded inside a codimension four kind of public phenomenon. So, the way, so, how is it related to the statement of the theorem? How is it related to the statement of the theorem? So, the co-dimensional bubbling phenomenon being precisely what happens at the infinity of this. So, everything is concentrated, the curvature is concentrated near a copy of C inside C3. This is precisely the defining feature of quadration 4 bubbling. And at the origin, you have a tiny unit ball where the connection looks genuinely codimension six. Genuinely co-dimension six, the singularity looks genuinely co-dimension six, so that could actually be embedded in a co-dimension four bubbly region. So theorem number two says that there exists a sequence of Homeschini-Miels connections on the unit 4 of C3. So I mean singular connections with uniformly bounded L2 energy. But the number of isolated But the number of isolated co-dimension six singular points, so all the singular points in this context are co-dimension six and they are isolated. So if you look at an interior ball, a smaller ball, and you try to count the number of coordination six points, for each of these connections, you get a finite number. But that finite number can go up to infinity as your sequence goes to infinity. Sequence goes to infinity. So the slogan is that if you just impose uniformly bounded L2 energy, you can't actually control the number of singular points, and therefore you certainly can't control the topological complexity of the connection. So the remark is that what happens here, those singular points in theorem number two would be locally modeled on the previous theorem. So the previous theorem. Theorem. So the previous theorem being a certain connection on C3. So the serum number two being a more local construction on the unit ball. But if you look at each of those singularities, what happens is pretty much the same as what happens in the first theorem. So what happens in the second theorem, roughly speaking, is that you have a copy of C inside C3. So you restrict attention to the unit ball and this copy of C c c c c c c c c c c And this copy of C is where most of the curvature is concentrated. So roughly speaking, you have a codimension for bubbling phenomena. But behind the sort of event horizon of the co-dimension for bubbling, there are plenty of co-dimension six singularities hidden there. And the number of co-dimension six singular points is uncontrolled. So, as I repeat and emphasize, this theorem is that if you just give me an energy control, there's no way to control the topological complexity. So a rather baffling remark is that on projective manifolds, if you look at commission Yang-Mills, that should be equivalent to looking at stable bundles. And the above And the above phenomena actually cannot occur because stable bundles actually arise in bounded families, and the topological complexity is in fact bounded. But this fact is altogether geometric in nature and quite mysterious from the analytic perspective. So, one way to illustrate what is mysterious is that, well, in algebraic geometry, you know that once you find Geometry, you know that once you bound the rank, the first chain class and the second chain class, then you already have some kind of boundedness, which tells you that the Hilbert polynomial can only take a finite number of possibilities. So in particular, the high-churn numbers would be bounded. But from the analytic perspective, how on earth is an L2 energy going to be able to control, for example, C3? The third chain class. Well, the third chain class a priori depends on a cubic expression of curvature with which an L2 curvature expression has no reason to control. So from this perspective, even for Hermeshin Yamiels, there seems to be quite substantial things to understand from the analytic perspective. So this is certainly not clear to me. So I emphasize that the previous So I emphasize that the previous counter example, this example on the unit ball of C3 is strictly local in nature. It cannot occur on compact manifold. So maybe if you want to define enumerative invariance, the above theorem does not actually arise. And so the kind of phenomena illustrated in the above theorem does not actually arise. But the reason seems very mysterious. So let me try to. So, let me try to go a little bit more into the actual proof of the theorem. So, in broad brush terms. So, the main idea is something called singular freer sections. So, let me first tell you what freer section is roughly about. So, freighter section is really about the descriptions of code. The descriptions of co-dimensional four-public phenomena. But singular Fourier section means that you can allow for certain singularities for Fourier sections, and that is correlated with the appearance of high coordination singularities. So, what is a photo section? So, in what context does it arise? So, the context is you want to study coordination for bubble phenomenas of instant. Of instantons, which I mean, high-dimensional instantons, along some calibrated sub-manifold. So, a typical situation being you have emission Yamios connections along some complex four-dimensional two sub-manifolds. So, when you try to study this, the picture roughly is that the connections on the normal fibers of to this calibrate. Of to this collaborative sub-manifold, approximate ASD and has some kind of framing data. So, how should you understand this? So, I have some codimension for locals. So, let's for simplicity say that these are some manifolds where I expect bubbling phenomenon to occur. So, how does bubbling occur? Well, I have a co-dimension for some manifold, so I can look at Manifold, so I can look at the normal directions. So I should look at normal bundle. So on each fiber of the normal bundle, I should see a kind of ASD instanton as a bubble. I might have iterated bubbles, but let's just say in the simplest case, we just see ASD instantons on each normal fiber. So for instance, For instance, a typical situation is that you have a copy of C inside C3 where the bubbling occurs, and you just have a family of almost AST instantons on C2 times Z. So these are the normal fibers of the normal bundle. So normal to C inside C3. So these are parametrized by where you are on this copy of C. On this copy of C. So the thing to notice is that although you have a family of ASD connections, these ASD connections might vary from fiber to fiber. So they don't have to be the same ASD connection for all Z. It doesn't have to be a product situation globally. But instead, this picture gives you a map from C into the moduli space of framed A. Into the moduli space of framed AST connections. So the way this map works is that for each thread, you have an AST connection on the normal fiber, and that defines your point of this moduli space. So in total, you have a map from C, which is the bubbling locus, into the moduli space of framed ASD connections. So framed ASD. So, frame the ASD connection is nothing very scary. So, for instance, if you are rank 2 and charge 1, then this moduli space, the relevant moduli space is C2 over Z2, which is actually what I'm going to focus on. So this is more than a map in a sense that it satisfies, in addition, first of all, the derived type equation coming from really remembering something about. Something about the fact that you started with an East Lantong equation, high dimensions. So if you analyze the original Hermitian-Yamel's condition, you discover that this math can't be very arbitrary, but instead it had better be a solution of a first-order equation. And in the Hermitian-Yamios context, in this very simple Context in this very simple scenario, this just means you get a map from C to this moduli space C2 over Z2, and this map is just holomorphic. So in general, you might have a slightly more complicated setup. You might not just have a map from the bubbling locus to the modularized phase, but what takes the place But what takes the place of this map is rather a map taking value in a C2 over Z2 bundle over the bubbling locus. So it's really a section of a bundle of moduli spaces. And the solutions are called Fuetter sections. So in usual setups, you hope that Setups, you hope that the floater sections had better have very good regularity. But when the floater sections take singular values, so for instance, zero inside C2 of Z2 is a typical singular value, you expect that maybe the co-dimension for a bubbling is not the whole story and you might actually see higher co-dimension singularity. And this is precisely how it arises in our context. In our context. So, for the model situation of Hermitian Yamils on C3, which is the context of theorem number one, the relevant footer section is a map Z mapping to Z to the one-half zero inside the moduli space. You might be slightly surprised that this one half a case instead of Z, but I should first I should first kind of assure you that this is a well-defined map and it's a holomorphic map because the moduli space is C2 of Z2 rather than C2. This expression is genuinely well defined. And the reason you are interested in Z to the one-half rather than something like Z, which is perhaps your first guess, is that you can easily believe that Z to the one-half is in some sense more generic than Z. So this is really the most. So, this is really the most generic possibility after doing some coordinate transformations. So, really, the starting point of the project is really about trying to understand what the generic singularities of the Fouter section correspond to when you translate everything back to connections. So, in the context of theorem number two, the relevant Freuda section. The relevant freighter section is instead of this map, you consider this map. So you have the sine function from C. Well, so this is a map from C to C2 over Z2, and it's given by this expression. So this N could be arbitrarily large as your sequence moves on. So you can see that when You can see that when Z takes kind of integer multiples of something like pi over n, then this expression is zero. And zero inside c2 over z2 corresponds to a singularity, as I explained. So when n is very large, the number of singularities become very large. So, the key point is that you can increase n indefinitely at essentially no cost to the energy. So, if you just give me a uniform bound on the energy, you have no way to control the oscillation of the Fueta map. And that is the reason why the number of singularities and consequently the topological complexity of your connection. Complexity of your connection is uncontrolled by energy alone. Excuse me, may I ask a question? Yeah. How much regularity do you have to know about your singular set itself before you can deduce that you have these Freuder sections? So, do you, in your case, you know, your singular set is sitting in C. I mean, if you just, if you just know your, you're just if you just know you're you're blowing up do you if you if you just know you are blowing up uh at the moment nobody knows any way to extract a full transaction from this so this is rather from a constructive perspective thank you in fact what you mentioned is part of uh the previous list of conjectures i mentioned so this is roughly what i mean by how do you make the gluing By how do you make the gluing a priori hypothesis match up with the a priori estimates? The most crucial part is, in fact, how do you extract a quote a section? And in fact, I should make a convert, well, almost like an opposite remark. In fact, the phenomena I just illustrated actually tells you why it's very hard to extract a photon map. So the reason is you see, sine to the one, if sine to the one-half, nz could actually. To the one-half nz could actually arise as a freighter map, what would be the consequence? So, as you well, as probably everybody knows, sine nz is a typical sequence where the weak limit cannot be strong. So this means a sequence of wetter maps have no a priori compactness properties, which is one indication why it's very hard. One indication why it's very hard to extract a priori a photomap in the first place. So, the thing that happens around the singularities in theorem number two has the same nature as theorem number one. And in fact, you can use theorem number two as being obtained from gluing construction, if you like. So, I reiterate that if you increase n, the oscillation of the Fourier map becomes very high, but Becomes very high, but the energy stays uniformly bounded. So, let me proceed to more details of the construction. So, first of all, let me remind you something rather standard, which is how you get the ADHRAM construction for the one instant of ASD connections via something quite well known called Monad construction. So, what does the monad construction say? So, what you want to get in the end in this particular context is just the chart 2, chart 1 instant on R4. So, let me remind you how you do that, at least one perspective, is to start with a complex like this, a three-time complex. So, this is a complex if If the appropriate condition is satisfied for the parameters. So this complex lives over the Euclidean space C2 with coordinate x and y. So the a's and b's would be parameters. And if this is satisfied, then this defines a complex. And the ADA track equation is this equation plus this equation. This equation plus this equation. So if both are satisfied, then on the cohomology, so I should say the first thing, the first term injects into the second term and the second map is surjective. So if you look at a cohomology bundle, that usually gives you a vector bundle unless A and B's are all vanishing. So this would be a round. So, this would be a round two-vector bundle living on C2. And the cohomology bundle has a natural emission structure inherited by the sub-bundle and quotient bundle constructions. And that gives rise naturally to a Hermitian-Yamiels connection. So, if you're working on C2, that's the same thing as an ASD connection. So, this is just standard. So, this is just standard material about what happens on C2. Well, let's look at what happens on C3. So, I do something rather similar. So, I take a complex of this shape. So, x, y, and z would be coordinates on the underlying c3. So the underlining here just means I take a constant vector bundle. So now I look at the cohomology of the middle term. That gives me again a rank two vector bundle. Well, actually, there is a singular point at the origin. Away from that, I get a rank two vector bundle. So it's not very hard to check. It's not very hard to check just doing some very elementary linear algebra that the underlying bundle you get on C3 with coordinate x and y and z. So if you use some kind of Euler sequence on P2, you can convince yourself that the bundle you get in fact agrees with the vector bundle over C3 minus the origin. So it agrees with the pullback of the cotangent bundle of P2 via. Tangent bundle of P2 via the standard hop projection map. So this would be the kind of algebra geometric description of the bundle. But now you want to also put a metric on that. So this is not quite Hermitian Yamiels yet, but let me nevertheless put a background Hermitian metric on the bundle. So the way I can put a Hermitian Yamiels bundle on the call. Put a Hermitian Yamiel spond on the cohomology is by putting a Hermitian metric on C4. So the way I do it, I make a somewhat non-standard choice for the Hermitian structure. So this is the construction. The way I arrived at this construction, roughly speaking, is by trial and error. Is by trial and error. So there's nothing very canonical about the construction. So, what this roughly means is that ultimately what I want to get is something which models the co-dimensional bubbling phenomena modeled by the Fouter section z to the one-half zero. So the bubbling nocus is roughly where x and y would be much smaller. Where x and y would be much smaller compared to z. So, really, this expression is not very different from the perspective of what I'm trying to get at from something like z modulus to the minus one. And then, after some doing some kind of elementary linear algebra kind of thing, you can convince yourself that this is in fact the sort of the Is in fact the sort of the relevant permission structure you want to put in order to match up with the filter description. So, sparing you the details, I should just say that this construction is essentially by translating the freighter section description into the language of monad constructions and then applying some regularization procedures. So, without bothering you with So without bothering you with the details of computations, let me just tell you the sort of main features of this answers. So if you are near infinity, then far away from the z-axis, the curvature decays faster than quadratically. In fact, it's cubic. But if you're transverse to the z-axis and staying close to z-axis, then you get a family of ADA Trambian standards. means 10 tops. And the reason you get ADHRAM is because this construction is closely related to this. So you can somewhat reduce to the standard ADHRM construction after doing the appropriate coordinate changes roughly. Well, so far this is an answer. It's not exactly a Hermitian-Yamiels connection. So how do you get a Hermitian-Yamiels connection? MLS connection? Well, the strategy is that you do two steps. One is instead of doing things on C3, you do things on very large boards. And you can solve Dirichlet problems with the above answers as the boundary condition. So Donaldson has an early paper which tells you how to solve boundary value problems in the context of In the context of planet animals. So, the original Donaldson's work doesn't involve singular points. So, here, of course, we have a singularity at the origin. But we also have quite standard tools to deal with what happens near the singularities. So, for instance, there will be works by Bondo and Sue. So, in fact, the version I used is Version I used is a paper of Vopuski and his collaborators. Anyway, so what you can do is you can use your answers and solve Dirichlet problems. And then the second step is that you extract limits as your domain goes to infinity. So you take larger and larger balls and trying to exhaust C3. You solve a sequence of divisionary problems and you try to say that the solutions converge. Solutions converge. So then you try to argue that the limit you get is the impact of Hermitian-Young-Mills connection. And because you obtained your solution sort of by solving the division problem with the answers as the boundary data, the solution you get in the end is very closely related to the answers you. Closely related to the answers you started with. So the relation is that near spatial infinity, these things are roughly the same. But on a compact region, these can deviate quite significantly. So let me also say a few words about theorem number two. So the above is the construction of theorem number two. Construction of zero number one, which gives you a commissioner mius on C3 with the appropriate behavior at infinity. And at the origin, you really appeal to some previous result of Shemel-Chen and others. And that tells you exactly what happens near the origin. So let me say a few things about theorem number two, which is the unit ball with With an unbounded number of singularities, but kind of uniformly controlled outer energy. So, the idea here is that you construct some singular connections corresponding to the fighter section given by this expression. So, z is a coordinate on c. This is a well-defined function on c2 over z2. So the picture is that you are looking at unit Boe in C3. The connection is more or less flat if you are slightly away from a copy of C inside C3. So all the sort of interesting things happen along C. And what happens along C is that transverse to C, you have a family of AST collections. So, these ASD connections vary as Z varies according to this Fuetter section description. And when you see a zero of the Fuetter section, that tells you that you get some kind of singularity. And you can probably realize that up to some coordinate changes. Up to some coordinate changes, this expression. Well, if you look very closely around z, then up to some kind of non-essential factors, this is roughly speaking z to the one-half. So this is precisely what happens in the previous theorem context. And what that means is that what happens around the origin, you can precisely glue in. Glue in what you obtained from theorem number one. And that describes what happens in a very small neighborhood of each of these coevention six singularities. So if you want to write everything in terms of a monad, this would be the sort of monad you want to write down. And near each of those zeros, you do some kind of local surgeries where you try to Where you try to glue in the construction coming from the first error. So you use a more complicated Hermesian structure on C4, which I will not even attempt to write down in this talk. And then you do this kind of gluing construction in principle to get a Get a non-trivial Hermitian Yamiel's connection with the appropriate properties. So, from the analytic perspective, the key is really that if you have some kind of epsilon parameter which controls how concentrated these connections are around C. So, the point is that if you choose the sort of The sort of characteristic curvature scale small enough, in fact, exponentially small compared to n, then the effect of having a very large n in the beginning will actually be neutralized. And that doesn't actually destroy any kind of estimates. So, the rest of the construction is roughly speaking a mean style perturbation, even though I technically Even though I technically use the divisional problem as a shortcut. So the output is that for each n, you choose an extremely small epsilon, which so the meaning of epsilon is roughly that the curvature is concentrated near C inside C3 inside the union ball with roughly length scale epsilon. Scale epsilon. So outside the epsilon neighborhood of C, nothing happens. Everything is roughly a trivial connection, a trivial flat connection. And all the sort of interesting behavior happens along C inside C3. Everything is inside the unit ball. But the Freita section can oscillate to higher and higher frequencies. And that causes the number of high co-dimensional. The number of high codimension singularities to increase indefinitely. But the total L2 energy does not depend on the number of singularities or how hard the oscillation is. It only depends on the number of instantons bubbling off in the transverse direction, which is always one instanton. So the energy, roughly speaking, is the energy of the one instanton times the area of times the area of the unit disk inside C. And that has nothing to do with n. So as n goes to infinity, the number of singularities goes to infinity, but the L2 energy stays uniformly bounded. And that's how you show theorem number two. Okay, so that's roughly the end. Thanks for listening. Thank you. Thank you. Questions, Tiang? Yang, did you think about constructing a family of smooth instantons that converge to your example with one singularity? So, a model for this thing arising. So, I suspect that, okay, so I think for the particular choice I made, maybe that's impossible. So, I'm not 100% sure, but I think that maybe that doesn't quite happen because I think maybe there are some issues with C3. What issues? So, if you are a smooth rank 2 vector bundle, then the third chain class ought to value. Then the third chain class ought to vanish. Oh, yeah. So I think in my context, probably it doesn't. So that can't quite happen. But okay, so but in fact, the principle of the construction is much more general than the particular example I mentioned. So instead of taking z to the one-half, which corresponds to this kind of singularities, so here I took a function like So here I took a function like sine nz to the one half. So this has the same local nature as that to the one half. So I could well have taken something like sine z. So this would correspond to a much less generic kind of singularity. But I would think that that situation can be smoothed out. Okay, thanks. Okay, thanks. Other questions? Well, if not, then let's thank Yang again.
