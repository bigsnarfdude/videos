I'd like to talk about some recent interaction between the theory of vertex algebra and physics. It's just a review talk, so I apologize for people who already had my talk. So the title is in Bretto Schinger's and the Vertex Algebra. So let me start with Start with recording the definition of symplectic singularity due to Beauvir. So a symplectic singularity is a normal variety which has a closed sympletic two-form on its smooth part. And then this two-form pullback of two-form for any Two form for any resolution of singularity extend to the holomorphic two form on on on the on X child. So it's not required that the this extension is sympathetic, but it's just assumed to be holomorphic. And so it's have to use two so it says any but it's it's enough to check for one. But it's enough to check for one resolution. And what follows from the definition is that this X is a simple singularity, then it's a Poisson variety. And the Poisson bracket is defined on the regular part, and by the nomadic extended to the whole x. And typical, I mean, for so this simple symbol appear in representation theory quite often. The most familiar, sorry, of course, most holomorphic symbolic varieties are symbolic singularity because it's already non-singular. And the most uh familiar example A familiar example is the Nirpotent Kong of complex D algebra, semi-simple D algebra. And it's a singular variety, and the regular part is a principal nilipotent orbit. And the simplicity two form here is just a kilo of constant sorry of simple. Of cost and sorry, simple form. And then you can consider the Springer resolution, and the pullback is just the canonical simple form on the cotangent G over P. And more generally, normalization of a near-potential closure is known to be simply. It isn't on to be a symplectic singularity. And there's an easy way to construct new sympathetic singularity from known ones. So you go as follows. You start with a sympathetic singularity. For example, you can start with With non-smooth sympathetic variety, and then you find some finite subgroup in the automorphism which preserves the symbolic two-form on the regular part. And then O before by the action of G is automatically becomes simply singularity. So, for example, you can do the following. You choose your favorite complex reflection group, for example, some wire group, which is generated by some reflections on some vector space, which I denote by gamma. And then cotangent to this vector space. Cotangent to this vector space is naturally a sympathetic manifold. And then you can consider a diagonal action on this sympathetic variety, and this preserves the natural sympathetic two-form. So we get this sympathetic variety, which is obifa of this space by the action. Space by the action of this complex reflection group. So, in this way, you can attach this simplex singularity M gamba to any complex reflection. And of course, affinization of Nakazima quiva varieties provide a very large family of simplicity singularities. Singularities. And simply singularity appear in physics as well. Please interrupt me anytime. The Higgs and the Curl branch of 3D Enigof. Branch of 3D Enical 4K theories are supposed to be synthetic singularities. And so Higgs branch is rather easy to define, and the Coulomb branch was difficult to define, but now there's a definition by Bravilman, thinking about Nakajima. And for the defined cases, it's shown to be a simple singularities. And then there's a very interesting theory. There's a very interesting 3D mirror symmetry or sympathetic duality. So, Coulomb Hicks branch and Coulomb branch in general are totally different simplex singularities, but because it comes from one theory they are sus they are related and the They are related and the what there's certain duality between Hicks and Coulomb branch and it described in mathematical term the simplest duality by so the statement is that the Hicks branch of one theory is the same as Coulomb branch of the mirror theory and also quantile category O category O of natural quantization of fixed branch and category O of quantization of Coulomb branch in cost dual to each other. That's a statement of symbolic duality. Oh, sorry. And also, so this is 3D setting, but there's Setting, but there's also 4D theory, and in 4D theory, there's also a notion of Higgs branch and Coulomb branch. And Higgs branch of 4D theory is again supposed to be simply singularities. And in fact, Higgs branch of 4D theory is the same. So you can go from 4D theory to 3D theory by To 3D theory by doing so-called S1 compactification, and it's known that the Higgs branch remains the same. And if you once identify Higgs branch of OD theory with Higgs branch of 3D theory, you can further identify it with Coulomb branch of the Miras theory by using 3D Mirasymmetry. Okay. And why these things are related with vertex algebra? So vertex algebra defined by Boches as an algebraic framework to define a two-dimensional chiro conformal field service. So there's no So there is no satisfactory mathematical definition of quantum field theory that has dimension higher than two. But for two dimension theory, there is a rigorous definition, and a vertex alizaba does this job. But I was talking about the three Three-dimensional theory and four-dimensional theory. So, why vertex algebra have to do with such a theory? And well, connection can be so for to find such a connection, this theory of Haish and B is quite important, which says the following. Ah, so I'm not so I'm the only one who talks about vertex algebra here, but I will not. Here, but I will not give a definition of a text charger because if you I don't think if you you enjoy the definition if you don't know, and if you know, you already know, so let's skip the definition. But I try to explain vertex algebra in examples. So, anyway, so vertex algebra, it was shown by Hai Shangi that every vertex algebra is canonically filtered. So, this is quite some. So this is quite surprising because it's not true that every algebra is canonically filtered. But for vertex algebra, it's always filtered. And its associated grade is naturally a so-called Poisson vertex algebra. So it's a Poisson, it's a vertex algebra version of Poisson algebra. So it's in particular a differential algebra, which means that it's a commutative algebra with a differential algebra. With a differential. And in this differential algebra, there's a sub-ring, which is called zit algebra, which generates the whole space of the differential algebra. And I forgot to write. And this, which has a plus one algebra structure. It's written here. So this means that this statement means that the spectrum of the whole associated gradient is a closed subscheme of the arc space of this spectrum of this algebra. And so this sovereignty So, this sub-ring is a finite organic ring and has a Poisson algebra structure. So, in this way, you can associate to any vertex algebra a Poisson scheme, which we call associate scheme. And usually, we are only interested in it as a topological space. So, we usually interest only the reduced scheme of the person associated. A Poisson associate scheme, which is called associated variety. So, this is a Poisson variety. And that X algebra is called the chiral quantization of a Poisson variety, if the associated variety is isomorphic to this one. And if it's really a quantization of the arc space, Arc space, it's called a strict chiral quantization. In general, this spectrum is a sub-scheme of this arc space, but it often happens that it's isomorphic to the arc set itself. And in this case, it's a so-called chiral quantization, strict chiral quantization. And the connection And the connection between vertex algebra and 3D theory is stated by the following conjecture by Costello, Kurutek, and Gaiot, which says for any n equal 4 gauge theory, there exists a character quantization of a fixed branch such that the equoulant branch is recovered from this. Is recovered from this vertex algebra by considering a spectrum of the X algebra of this vertex algebra. And by 3D mirror the you can restate this state in by using the Coulomb branch as well. And uh this this vertex algebra And this vertex algebra is called, it's defined earlier by Dayut, it's called boundary vertex operator algebra, and I expect it to have a very interesting representation theory, which is closely related with quantum geometric Lambran's program. And this conjecture, in particular, implies Particularly implies that each Nakajima quiver variety should admit a chiropractization because you can attach to any quiver a quiver gaze theory. Because it appears as a boundary condition of a 3D KD theory. Any other questions? Any other questions? Okay, so this is a connection with 3D gauge theory. And there is also a connection with 4D theory. So this is due to the following discovery of this beam lemos regained appear. BIM, Lemos, Reynolds, Pyrrhus, and Rusty, and Veris. And so the statement is the following. So they constructed a map or a functor from the category of four-dimensional n equals two superconformal phyllo service to the category of vertex algebra, which you identify with the category of 2D chilar conformal phylo series. Former field service. So, this was originally designed to do the following. So, this is an important invariant of the 4D theory, which is called Azure Index, which is just a Q series. And this Q series can be recovered from the Evatex algebra as it. As its character. So, what exactly I didn't define, I didn't give you a definition, but it's in particular a graded vector space. So, to this graded vector space, you can associate acuses by counting the dimension of each homogeneous component. And this is called a character. And the statement is that this Shiva index is exactly. This shoe index is exactly this character. And so this is quite nice because here Hilbert space is... There's no large algebra which makes Hilbert space here an irreducible representation of it. So Hilbert space here is defined as infinite sum of. As an infinite sum of finite-dimensional representation of the Park Conformer algebra. But here, Hilbert space is a vertex algebra itself and it's a reduced representation of a vertex algebra. So you can use the representation of theory of vertex algebra to obtain this important invariant. In any case. And so there are some several properties of this map functor. So there's a notion of central charge in physics which takes positive value for unitary theory. And so there are two central charges, central charge for four-dimensional theory and central charge for two-dimensional theory, which appears as. For two dimensions of the each appearance as the image of this map. And these two numbers are related by this formula. And because of this minus sign here, this means you start with unitary theory, which is always the case for physical theory, you end up with a non-unitary theory. So the vertex algebra that comes from 4D in this way is rather exotic in the sense. Is rather exotic in the sense it's not, it's never in Italian. And in particular, it means this map is not subjective because there are many interesting in Italy about extrapolitanism. And on the other hand, so if you look at this map, it goes from 4D theory to two-dimensional theory. Images only. So you might think it loses a lot of information, but in fact, people believe that this is a finite mode, which means the fiber is a finite set. So not every VATX server comes from 4D server. So this means the image is. The image is almost completely invariant of the FODI theory. So this is very, this is remarkable if you think about there's no mathematical definition of a FODI theory. And the vertex algebra is a rigorously defined mathematical object, and this says it contains almost all information of the 4D fabric. And so if it contains almost all information, it should be possible that you can recover many properties of 4D theory. And in particular, this says you can recover Hicks branch as the associated variety of the vertex algebra. And in fact, they say, they conjecture that this vertex operator algebra itself is a strict chiral quantization of associated scheme of the vertex algebra. So it's a quantization of the arc space of the associate scheme, which is the Higgs branch of the 4D theory. And I should remark, you can also consider the map of sending for this theory to Higgs brand, which is simple singularity. And this is not a finite map because there are infinitely many for this theory which goes just point. So So, in this sense, Vertexer is a beta invariant, so it can be regarded as a refinement of the Higgs branch, because it recovers Higgs branch. And there's a subtlety in this statement because the associate scheme is actually not reduced in general. And while Hicks branch is Branch is as if I understand as unbelievable, it's always reduced. Yes? I cannot hear, sorry. If you're ever not reduced by our file? So for a concept, So our cut says that this match is not finite, but if you remember not just the big scratch, but the not reduce the expansion. Yeah, it's supposed to be fine. This is what this statement says. If you consider but you can ha have to go through vertex algebra to define this fat fat structure. FAT structure. Because so far, there's no other way to define this FAT scheme. But if you can define this, this is a finite one. Yes. And this contains, this one has the same information as about X-rays, let's say. Any more questions? So I talked about the commented about 3D mirror symmetry and you can also ask whether there's a similar symmetry for 4D theory, but for 4D theory, Higgs branch and Coulomb branch are not symmetric. So in 3D theory, both Higgs and Coulomb branch. Both Hicks and Coulomb branch are simpler single. In fact, it's hyperkiller cones. But for this Hicks branch and Coulomb branch are different objects. And Higgs branch is a hyperkiller cone, but Coulomb branch is a special kero geometry with a cyber within geometry. So for example, class for class S theory, which already appeared yesterday, it's known that It's known that the Coulomb branch is, the S1 compactified Coulomb branch, is a moduli space of a parabolic six bundle on this punctured Lima surface. So it looks like Coulomb branch have a richer structure than the Higgs branch in the case of 4D FOD. And so you cannot really expect. And so you cannot really expect there's certain duality between Higgs branch and Coulomb branch in 4D theory. But vertex algebra is a refinement of Higgs branch, which have more information than the Higgs branch. And I think it expects that there should be certain duality between Coulomb branch and Coulomb. And corresponding vertex, which is a refinement of Higgs branch, which may be called for the mirror symmetry. And such a symmetry was discovered in this recent interesting paper of Ben Shan and Dan Xiel Wenbiyang, where so here it's a heating system, irregular heating system. Irregular heating system on P1 and the vertex algebra are double algebra. Okay, so but we don't know how it's not there should be more refinement of such uh duality, but so at the moment nobody knows how to state. Nobody knows how to state even the conjecture of this Sephardi miracentary, but many things, many interesting are going on. So just just combined. Okay, thank you so much. Any more comments or questions? Please correct me if I say something wrong. Yeah, so vertex surgery coming from 4D theory have many interesting properties. And FODI And for the expectation from the mirror assembly I just mentioned, you can this vertex server should be as interesting as Higgs pandos. So it'd be very nice if you can characterize what XR is coming from for disability. Started coming from 4D theory. But this is, of course, a very difficult problem because it's almost the same as defining 4D theory mathematically. But you can say, I don't know how to answer this question, but I'm able to give some partial answer to this question. This equation due to this theorem collading, which says if variety is a sympletic singularity, it means it has finitely many sympletic leaves. So in general, for Poisson variety, you can consider solidification by analytic similar manifolds. You can make sense of simpletic leaves, but leaves maybe in But leaves may be infinite in general, but if it's simply singularity, it has finitely many singularities. So this is certain finiteness condition. And so this means associated variety of a vertex algebra should have this finiteness condition if it comes from 4D theory. So it makes sense to give the following. Makes sense to give the following definition. So vertex algebra called quasi-division if the associated variety has finite remaining simpler leaves. And so we can ask what kind of property this vertex algebra, this kind of vertex algebra has. And one can say that there exists That there exists only finitely many synthetic ordinary representations if this satisfies this condition. Here, ordinary representation is a representation whose character makes sense, which means it's a graded representation. Grading is bounded from above and it's a homogeneous component of finite dimension. So there might be infinite. So, there might be infinitely many simple representations, but if you are only interested in those representations whose character makes sense, there are only finite remains. And for such representation, this character always converges to a holomorphic function on the upper half plane, and it satisfies differential equation. Differential equation called a Mojra linear differential equation. So Mojra linear differential equation is a differential equation that the Mojra form satisfies. So in particular, the solution space of the modular linear differential equation is invariant under the nax natural action of a modular group. So this states a certain modularity property of the a character. Of the character of the vertex regime. And if you recall, you remember that the fact that the Schwarz index before this theory is exactly the character of vertex algebra, the previous theorem states some some modularity property of the Schwarz index of the Foudy theory, which is important in in in physics as well. in in physics as well. So for example, you the effective central charge of the character makes sense because of the previous theorem. So effective central charge is a certain growth of the acu series. And effective central, from effective central charge you can recover the A central charge of 4D server, so another invariant of 4D server. And this doesn't follow from the previous theorem, but the character of a quasi-district algebra, in particular it comes from 4D theory, it's often quasi-modular if it's not modular. So which means that if it's quasimodular for for the whole modular group, this this character belongs to the ring generated by second resistance. Generated by second resistance series and four and six. So if it's modular, it's contained in the ring generated by E4 and E6. And quasi-modular means you just have to add second. Yes? Then it's proven by Yung Chanzu that the all the only so you don't need this any representation is ordinary, first of all. So there are only finitely many simple modules and all modules are ordinary. And this space spanned by character are exactly the same as the solution space of the The solution space of the linear differential equation. But here we don't, we just state it as some space of the moduli and differential equation. Because it might contain the logarithmic solution. This MLDE might have an logarithmic solution. Could be. Low rational. I started nine thirty, right? And yeah, so actually, vertex algebra coming from Faudi's theory are often super vertex algebra. And it was the Frebius theorem was generalized by Haoli in the case of a super vertex algebra, where a character is replaced by a super character, which is the same, which equals to the Shiva index, supposedly equals to the Shiva index. Supposed to equal the shivana of the 4D cell. So let me explain some example of a quasi-displain some quasi-example of quasi-dis vertex algebra. So let G be a complex simple algebra, and then you can consider corresponding affine-cut simulating algebra. affine catsumuli algebra and then there's a vertex algebra called universal affine sorry this is universal affine vertex algebra associated with z which is just as a representation it's just a induced representation induced from one dimensional representation this parabolic subalgebra but but it's it's known that it has But it's known that it has a structure of vertex algebra. And so you can talk about representation of vertex algebra. And in this case, representation is just the same as smooth j hatamoz over every k. So you can regard this vertex algebra a version of a Viering algebra for Of a ripping algebra for Katsumudi algebra because representation theory are the same. But we are more interested in the simple quotient of this universal affine vertex algebra, which inherits vertex algebra from this one. And the category of module of this simple one. Simple one form a full subcategory of the category of Mosul of the universal, which is the same as Sumos Jihata Mozurgi. And this totally depends on the level, which is the value of this central element, and this category becomes quite interesting depending on the level. And for this universal one working, so I quickly went, so maybe you don't remember, but this is a Jude sit value which defines the associated variety. And in this case, this is as a vector space, it's just a quotient space of a V by this subspace. And so this means And uh so this means uh that the there's a surjection because you forget anything contained here, there's a surjection from symmetric algebra of G to he in this question which sends this kind of monomial to this kind of vector. And uh this map is in fact a Poisson algebra. Is in fact a Poisson algebra homomorphism where this is equipped with uh Kirof user Kirof constant or Poisson structure, which comes from Poisson bracket of G. So this is a cost of this function on this star by certain idea which is the kernel of this map and that's why associated variety is the location of the kernel of this map. So when when So, when this is an induced one by PBW theorem, this is in fact isomorphism, so there is no kernel. So, in this case, associated variety is just a G star. But in general, for Causion, it defines some G invariant coordinates of variety of G star, which is exactly the same, similar to the case of. To the case of associative variety of primitive ideal of UG. And the difference with the associated variety of primitive ideas is that for in that case, associated variety of primitive ideas are always contained in the reported con. But for our case, Our case, when level is generic, then induced one is always already irreducible. So the associative variety is a whole space, just which is not quasi-duce, because here simplicity leaves are quadjoint orbits and there are infinite remaining quadjoint orbits here. And another extreme is when this associated variant is just a point. The variety is just a point. And this happens if and only if this is the integrable representation which we had, which is the case if and only if k is a non-negative integer. So this zero associated variety condition characterized integrability conditions. And of course, this case Of course, this case is quadrupeds because a point is trivial simply to leave. But this one never comes from 4G theory because it's unitary. So unitary will never come from 4G theory. So unfortunately, this one does not come from 4G theory. So if you want to find examples. Find examples that come from 4D3, you have to study more general representation of cats-media algebra. And it's easy to see that this is quasi-leave if and only if this associated variety is contained with an irrepotent cone of Z. So this direction is Z if it's contained, it's uh there's only finite remaining an ill potential coefficient of its. 14 quasiant orbits. Now, so when this happens, so there's a natural candidate for that. So there's a representation called Katsuma Kimoto admissible representation for Katsumudi algebra. So of course, integral representation, nicest representation, which have the property that it's completely reducible and character modular. And character modular in volume. But here, such a property, so this representation also has this property. So this category is completely reducible, and they are characterized by modular invariant, but not the integral representations. And in fact, this vacuum representation is known to be atomic if and only if the level, the shifted level. The shifted level is a positive rational number, where this A check is a Duracux number. So I omit the detail of the. And one can show that for this admissible representation, associated variety is in fact a closure of some nibbotant orbit, which is contained in a nirport. Which is contained in an input end con. And in fact, you can describe this variety explicitly. So, yeah, so maybe I will not explain the detail. So, this admissible, the conclusion in the admissible vacuum vertex algebra provides example of a quasi-lease vertex algebra. And you And you can ask whether they come from 4G theory. And it's known that they do come from 4G theory if it's a boundary admissible. So I did not explain, but this numerator has condition that it has to be equal or greater than H equal H. Well, it's a direct number, the Cookson number. And it's called the boundary. And the mystery if it's numerator is as small as Is as small as Smur. And so it's known, it was shown by these people, and so they come from certain agrased agras theories. And so I did not really explain the this variety, so but if you look at here Here, it looks like if you are familiar with module representation theory, it looks like restricted nirpotent cone. And in fact, there's such a relation with a restricted nirpotent cone. In fact, so there's a quantum group called small quantum group, which is a Q analog of reflected every time. Reflected everything algebra, and this associated variety is isomorphic to the spectra of the cohomology ring of the small quantum group. If it satisfies some conditions, and this suggests that in connection of this admission representation with the small quantum group. And in fact, there's such a more direct connection between representation, admissive representations, and small quantum groups. But you have to consider, as I said, because as I said, category of admission representation is semi-simple, but the category of more But the category of Mozilla Basomore content group is not so simple at all. But to compare, you have to consider wider representation of this vertex charge. And the statement is that it's proposed in the joint work with Thomas and Casia. Well, the category of weight representation, which is not necessarily the highest weight model, is broken equivalent to the category. Brokova is equivalent to the category of unruled smotomic group at the root of this unity, at least when G is 02. And there are quasi-affirmed vertexes outside admissive representation which do come from 4D theory. Such example was this we found. Was this fun my joint work with Amuro and the recent work with Serba Ftoni and Aliba Witzka. But it's wide open to classify in general quasi-less affinity algebra for the moment. So it's a very interesting problem. Any question? Yes. Is there anything the is there any use to select the screen without leaving the how to describe non-reduced ah that's uh you have a conjecture to describe it there. It's very difficult to describe it. No, only yes, two cases now, basically. Yeah. So for Kazanu's correspondence, this number so K plus H commas in the K plus 8 comes in the denominator. So it's a different kind of correspondence, but maybe there's some cos derivative or something like that. I don't any other questions? So there's another, so because classes theory appeared yesterday, let me explain this case. So there's a family of 4D theory called theory of classes. S stands for six. So this is a 4D theory obtained by considering 6 dimension theory on R4 times a function. are four times a punctured Riemann surface. And if you fix Riemann surface, the remaining dimension is four and you get some four-dimension theory. And the resulting theory, of course, depends on this Riemann surface you choose and also with complex semi-simple group which is a Flavor symmetry group. So there's a four So these are for the theory parameterized by pair of functional Riemann surface and group. And so in this case Coulomb branch was the moduli space of a parabolic Higgs bundles. And for Higgs branches, it's known that it's called Moatachika varieties, which is a new family. Which is a new family of simplicity varieties. So, this was defined by Moore and Tuchikov up to a conjecture, mathematical conjecture, and this conjecture was proven by Ginsburg-Kasdan and Brave-Ram Finker-Nakojimu. So, we have a mathematical definition for Higgs branch for the classes theory. And one of the statements of Muatachikova is that the Is that it's enough to describe this variety for a genus zero or Riemann surface. So I just explain the case for genus zero surfaces. So let MGR denote the P1 with Higgs branch for P1 with R punctures. Then this is a sympathetic variety with With Hamiltonian action of R copy of G, where R is a number of functions. And there are some initial conditions. For two points, there should be two commuting actions of G. And of course, cotangent to G has two commuting actions G, the right and left action G. And this gives this more attachable variety for two points. Variety for two points. For one point, it's a product of G times so-called constant slowdown size, which is an example of a twisted cotangent of an important group. And then this important condition is this associativity condition. So this more attached cover variety should be compatible. Covert should be compatible with operation of RIMAS office, such as this one. And so the state of the conjecture of Muatachka was the existence of family of sympletic varieties satisfy this kind of condition, and this was proved by the Condition, and this was published by these people. And so, this let me explain the simplest case is, of course, SR2 case. So, this case, if you look at this formula, because Moatus covered two points and one point already given, and because of And because of this, if you put R to be 3, this gives S plus 1. So it's enough to define MT3 to get all motorscale varieties. And for SL2, this is just a pencil product of three copies of C2. So each one admits SL2 action. So there's three copies. So there's three commuting S reactions, which is obviously Hamiltonian. But if you consider MUT4, what you get is minimal in the report or closure in D4. So why D4? If you write dinking down, you find three commuting actions. So this should have four commuting actions, basically two. action of VSL2. If you write Dinkin diagram, you find three commuting actions of V2, but you find another one if you write extended affine extended Dinking diagram. So the non-triviality of Moatachical variety is that somehow you end up with default, although you are considering it's a two case, and the variety in general is a singular variety. And the associativity implies that this minimal innovative orbit closer into four can be obtained from this simple Smooth sympathetic variety by considering, ah, so I forgot to say this is a sympathetic reduction, simple reduction by this formula. So this is, for me, this is non-trivial isomorphism, but this is very known for physicists, and it's known as. And it's known as ADH construction for minimal hypothesis corrosion. So the associativity in general states a very non-trivial isomorphism between symbolic varieties. And for SL3 case, so MET3 is always already non-trivial and it's minimal and it's protein orbic closure in E6 and why E6 And why E6? Because you find three commuting actions of a set of two, three, if you write extended Dinkin diagram. But you cannot continue like this forever because you go outside of a Dinkin diagram. So more Otachka variety in general completely new farm, new simplicity. New family, new sympetic varieties. I mean, there's a conjectural description of singularity of more touchical variety by physicists and if you look at this HEFE diagram, you realize immediately that they are a completely new family of symplic varieties. And uh so you can ask whether there's a similar construction for There's a similar construction for a vertex algebra. And in fact, it was conjectured by BMAO that there should be similar construction of vertex algebra. And in fact, one can show that there exists a unique family of a vertex algebra satisfying required properties which I don't explain, but similar to the one for mortal varieties. So there's initial properties. There's initial conditions and also some associativity conditions like this. So it should be compatible with this operation of Riemann surface. And because of this uniqueness property, this must be the vertex cellular coming from classic surface. And you can also show that the associated variety is isomorphic to more attached varieties, which implies. Which implies, which proves the beam rastery conjecture for process theories. Okay, so and so I go to the next example. There's a conjecture, this remarkable conjecture by Bonetti Meneger. Conjecture of a bonetti meaning Guerian rust tree, which says the following: For any complex reflection group, there should be a vertex superalgebra, which satisfies the following. So, first for associated variety is simple singularity associated with this complex reflection group. Sorry, this is this is not how the This is not hal gamma. So this is a so this is a simple variety explained at the beginning, singlet explained at the beginning attached to a complex reflection group. And so this implies that this one is quasi-use. And also there are some properties. I skip this because I don't have time, but the central charge is this. But the central charge is is described by fundamental inv uh invariants of this complex reflectional group and so on. And so when gamma is a wild group, this vertex is the right of one, which corresponds to the fourth dimension n equals fourth by ambulance with gauge group G. Group G. And in this case, Higgs branching on to be simply singularity associated with the wild group. So the previous conjecture is compatible with B-morress conjecture. And this conjecture is still open, but you can do something for the simplest case when gamma is a symmetric group. So in this case, So, in this case, simpler singularity is essentially a symmetric power of C2, which is known, which is where known to that the singularity is a result of a Hilbert scheme of n points of C2. And what we can do is that because this is non-singular variety, it's easier to so we want we want to. So, we want to somehow attach a vertex algebra naturally to the simple singularity, but we can work up there and construct a shift of vertex algebra whose global section gives the vertex algebra with required property. So this this follows the conjecture for the case of uh asymmetrical group. Of asymmetrical group. And maybe I skip these. And so super character satisfies the modulin differential equation. And in this case, we can compute explicitly which has this nice form. This nice form, and one can show that this is a quasi-modular form of mixed weight. In fact, and in fact, it's not only just a quasi-modular form, but it just gives an example of generalized Q multiple zeta varies introduced by Mahon. This is a vacuum character. Yes. Yes. So this that supercharacter where the SIWA index is quite interesting Q series. And so our result gives a fast and non-trivial example of chiral quantization of Narcima Coiva varieties. And we expect that our method works for general Nakajima Cuiva varieties. And in fact, such a statement was claimed by the paper of Commerce. Claimed by the paper of commerce in America, although they did not give any proof of the statement. But let me explain one thing. This vertic quantization chiral quantization of geometry varieties are actually rather related to 3D theory than a 4D theory because. I wrote one thing and finished. So you can associate from 4D3 to using this map of beam, a vertex operator algebra. But you can go from 3D to 4D to 3D by doing S1 compact friction and do a boundary. And do a boundary, consider boundary VOA. But this is not a commutative diagram in general, as far as I understand. And for our case, luckily, this diagram commuted, but in general, this diagram doesn't commute. And Nakajima queer bonnet was associated with this quiver gauge theory for 3D setting, so it gives a boundary. Setting. So it gives a boundary, vertex of the retaliator in general. Okay, maybe I should stop here. Thank you so much.
