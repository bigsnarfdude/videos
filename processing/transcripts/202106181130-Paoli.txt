Okay, so thank you very much for the opportunity to talk at this very nice conference. So this talk is about higher categories, but in low dimension n equals two. So I recall that the very classical notion of weak to category is due to benaboo and is called bicategories. But over the years, people developed higher notions of what we call weak end categories that were Categories that were motivated by modeling examples arising in a variety of fields, such as homotopy theory, mathematical physics, logic, and computer science, and all these different combinatorial machineries, in particular when n equals 2, give you different models of weak two categories. And these have been shown to be suitably equivalent to bicategories. One of the advantages of working with these models is that whether in Models is that whether in bicategories you have to specify the coherence laws by explicit axioms that are given by commuting diagrams. So, if you have concrete examples, you have to actually check these coherence axioms by sort of direct computations, which in some cases can be quite lengthy. In this modeling approach, these coherence data are taken care of by your combinatorics. So, this is one of the reasons why they are nice. Nice. And I'm going to concentrate on certain classes of models in this talk. One class of models is called siegel-type models, and they are based on simplicial objects, so functors from the opposite of the simplicial category delta into cat, satisfying additional properties. So the oldest of this model is Tamsomani to categories. This was one of the earliest models of higher categories. The earliest models of higher categories that was introduced by Tam Somani, a student of Carlos Simpson. But much later, there has been a development around these single-type models, starting with the work of the Red Prunk and myself for n equals to, or what we call weakly globular double categories, which is a full subcategory of double categories. And we showed that this is suitably equivalent to the Tamsamani model. And in order to do this, we had to. And in order to do this, we had to use the third category called weekly globular time summary categories as a common context between these two. I will concentrate in this talk on this weekly globular double categories, which is based on a new way to weaken the notion of higher categories, because as you see, double categories is a very rigid structure, but you can encode the idea of weakness with this idea of weak growth. idea of weak globularity. And I will explain some background around this in a moment. The other model that I want to bring in today is due to Joachim Koch and it's called FAIR two categories. It's a model in which you can have strict associativity laws but weak unit laws. So the idea is to find a way to weaken only the unit laws. Weaken only the unit laws, but keep everything else strict. And it's a model that is in spirit very close to the Siegel-type model, but instead of using the category delta, it uses a modification of the delta, which is what Jaork calls the fat delta, that is used to precisely encode the idea of weak units. So, what is the question that motivates what I'm going to present today is how To present today is how can we directly compare FAIR two categories and weekly globular double categories? And what I mean here is that we know from the literature that both these categories are suitably equivalent to by categories. So you might say, well, then there is nothing to do. But the point is that we want to compare fair to categories and weekly globular double categories directly without going through by category because if Because in doing so, we want to set up a technology that has a chance of being generalizable to higher dimensions. This structure exists for general end. So, Joachim Kark has a model of fair n categories. And in my book, I worked out the model of weak globular n for categories, proved that it's suitably equivalent to the Tamsanari N categories. So, what I'm aiming at in the long run. So, what I'm aiming at in the long term is to have a generalization of this comparison for any n, which would give a proof of the Simpson-Wick Units conjecture. Today is much easier because it's n equals 2, and yet it contains a lot of new ideas that I believe have a very good chance of being generalizable. And they also shed light on weekly globular double categories themselves because we're going to see how this notion. See how this notion of weak units is encoded into weakly globular double cartographies. So, we were encouraged to somehow cover background in these talks. So, I'm going to do this. Apologies for those of you who know this technology already, but I'm trying to be as inclusive as possible. So, let's start with the idea of signal map, which is associated to any simplicial object in a category. Simplicial object in a category C with pullback, so a functor from delta up to C. If you consider this commuting diagram and you take the pullback of the bottom part of the diagram, this iterated pullback here, the limit of this bottom part of this diagram, then there is a unique map from xk to this limit called siegel map for every k bigger than or equal to 2. So every simplicial object in C comes with siegel maps. Why are Segal maps. Why are these important from the point of view of these models? Because they can be used to characterize nerves of internal categories in C. Remember, there is a nerve functor from internal categories in C to simplicial object in C that works formally as the nerve of a small category. You take these iterated pullbacks and then you compose to find the phase operators, you insert. You insert identities for the degeneracies. And the point is that a simplential object in C is the nerve of an internal category in C if and only if all the single maps are isomorphism. So for instance, if C is the category of sets, this allows you to think of a small category as a simplicial set with extra properties, namely the Siegel condition. This is a simple but important. This is a simple but important observation that started these ideas of Siegel-type models. So now I can give you the definition of weakly globular double categories. So it's a simplish shell object in cat, so a functor from delta up to cat, such that, first of all, all the signal maps are isomorphic. So what does this first condition say? By the previous slide, it says this is an internal category in cut. Internal category in cut. An internal category in cut is what we call a double category, which we can think of as a structure with objects, vertical arrows, horizontal arrows and squares, and all these things compose horizontally and vertically in a way which completely is associative and unital. So it's a very rigid structure, which a priori you may think has nothing to do with weak structure. But that's precisely what we do when we start to. Do when we start talking about the weak globularity condition. So, we require this X0, which is a category in general, to be a special type of category, an equivalence relation. Or if you prefer, a group point with no non-trivial loops. And this comes equipped with a functor from X0 to the discrete category on the set of connected components of X0. And this is an equivalence of categories. Of categories. So, why do we call this weak globularity? Because if you are used to strict to category, you will remember that if x0 was here a discrete category, in other words, all your vertical morphemes are identities, then this would be precisely a strict to category. So, weak globularity means that, and this condition, sorry, of discreteness of X0 to describe strict to category is usually called globularity condition. Is usually called globularity condition. So we weaken the globularity condition by asking that is x0 is instead homotopically discrete, if you like, because it is a category equivalent to a discrete category. So before going further, let me say, how should you think about this? You should think about this set underlying x0d as the set of objects in your structure, right? So what we have New structure, right? So, what we have done is that we have fattened up the set of objects. And finally, there is this inducing map condition that says this map for every k bigger than or equal to 2, which is induced by this map gamma from x0 to x0d. This is a map of categories. We ask this to be an equivalence of categories. So, what does this do? This is the structure that regulates the good behavior. That regulates the good behavior of the composition. This coherence data are all contained in here. But the good thing is that you don't have to check anything. Everything is encoded by these combinatorics. And we showed, so going back to the previous slide, where was it? Oops. I'm not finding myself anymore. Not finding myself anymore. Okay, going back to the previous slide, we showed with prong that these weekly global double categories are equivalent to the Tamsamani2 categories, which I haven't designed yet. But in particular, we showed an explicit equivalence with bicategories. So we had a way to go back and forth between by categories and weekly globular double categories. Okay, so this structure This structure of X0 being an equivalence relation is the first thing that attracted my attention to the Koch model, because in the Koch model, which I will define formally in a moment, we see exactly that the weak units form an equivalence relation. So I've always thought this can't be a coincidence, and in fact, it's not. And the main point of today is to explain that exit. Today is to explain that X0 is really a space of weak units. So, what is the Koch model? Again, I need some background. It's based on the idea of colored categories, so a category with a distinguished class of arrows containing all objects, colored preserving functor. Then you can have the notion of colored graph and free colored category on a colored graph. And in particular, you can do all this for ordinals. Okay, so you can have a notion of colour. Okay, so you can have a notion of colored ordinal, which will be denoted like this with dots, like the usual ordinals, but the colored arrows are denoted by links. You also have a way to go from colored ordinals to ordinary ordinals, so from T to delta by contracting these links. And so that's the first idea. The second idea for the FET delta needs the idea of semi-category. So here So, here, again, thinking of the siege condition, remember that a semi-simplicial object is like a simplicial object, but without the degeneracies. So, formally, it is a functor from delta mono up into set. If you ask that this functor satisfies the Siegel condition, you obtain exactly a semi-category. And you also have a corresponding colored notion, so you have a colored semi-category. So, now we wrap. So now we wrap things together to give what Joachim Kok calls the category of the FAT delta. This is the category of all finite non-empty colored semi-ordinals. And you can identify this with T mono. So what is now a FAIR 2 category? As I mentioned at the beginning, the spirit is similar to the Siegel-type models, but instead of using the simplicial delta, you use the FAIR. Simplicial delta, you use the fat delta, so you say you have a color-preserving functor from the fat delta up into cat, which preserve discrete objects and pullbacks over discrete objects. And there are three distinguished structure that you get out of this. So the object corresponding to this dot is what we call the object of objects. The object corresponding to the ordinal one is the object of is the object of arrows and the object corresponding to this link is the object of weak units or weak identity arrows. And Koch shows that there is a very nice criterion to check that a structure is a fair to category. Namely, you only have to give a diagram like this between the objects, the arrows, and the weak units. Then you have to Units, then you have to have a semi-category structure on U and A in such a way that this is a semi-fanto. So, in for space reasons, I did not include here the compositions, but they should be there because this is a semi-structure. And the final condition is that these maps and these maps, so you have five maps in total, are equivalences of categories. So, what this is saying is precise. Is saying is precisely the preservation of colors, and you can show that these three conditions are enough precisely to give you a fair to category. So, this is a fairly concrete criteria by which you can see whether a structure you have at hand is a fair to category. And we're going to use this as I will explain. Okay, so now this is essentially the end of the background. I talked about weekly globular double categories as part of the three. categories as part of the three single type model about the cock model. Now how can we make these two things talk to each other? To do this, I need to come back for a moment to the siege type model and say a little bit more about this third model that I said is a common context that contains both the Tamsomani model and the weekly globular double categories. How do you define this model? It's very simple. You'd say simplistology cat and Object in cat, and then you say you want x0 to be an equivalence relation, you want the induced signal map condition, but you don't require anything else. So you see that it's exactly like for cat2 weakly globular, except you don't ask the siege maps to be isomorphism. So you easily see that this is a full embedding into here. If X0 happened to be discrete, then you would be describing a Tamsomani 2 graphic. Having a Tamsamani two graphic. Okay, so this is truly a generalization of these two models. Why do I want to speak about this? Because now I want to tell you about another piece of the story, which is how you produce a pseudofunctor from delta up into cap, starting from this model here. So a pseudofactor, it's a well-known notion in category theory. If you are topologically inclined, you can think of a pseudofactor from Delta. Think of a pseudofuncto from delta up into cat as a simplicial object, but in which the simplicial identities do not hold on the nose but only up to isomorphism in a coherent way. Whatever you preferred way to think about this, you will have a diagram like this, which if H is a generic pseudofunctor, this diagram would only pseudo-commute. But if you are in a situation where X0 happens to be discrete, then zero happens to be discrete that then this necessarily commutes in this case you can talk about a single map from hk to the pullback of the to the limit of the bottom part of this diagram so we say that a pseudo functor from delta up into calt is siegealic definition if this h0 is discrete therefore we can talk about siege map and we require all the siege maps to be isomorphism Maps to be isomorphous. So, given this notion, one can show that there is a functor from this tattoo weakly globular to siganic pseudofunctus from delta up into cut, whose entries are as follows. So you have X0D, X1, and then this iterated pullbacks. The two-dimensional structure of this pseudo-functor is built from the induced signal map and their pseudo-inverses. Inverses. And there is a standard way to show that this is a pseudofunctor, which is based on the categorical technique of transport of structure along in a junction. And that's why we called this functor TR for transport of structure. And the magic that happens here is that if you strictify this pseudofunctor, remember there is a general strictification theorem of pseudofunctor into strict functors. If you strictify a segalic pseudofunctor, you get Pseudofuncto, you get a weekly globular double category. So, weekly globular double category emerge as strictification of a certain class of pseudofunctors. And I'm going to need this later on. So the first thing that allows us to build the connection between a weekly globular double category and the Koch model is the observation that if you restrict this You restrict these transfer of structures functor to cat2-whykly globula. Remember, cat2-whyklobola sits inside here. If you restrict it here, you find a special type of segalic pseudofuncto, which is what I call strong sigalic pseudofuncto. These are pseudofunctors such that when you restrict to delta mono, you actually obtain a honest functor. Okay, so the theorem. Okay, so the theorem, well, proposition is that this transport of structure, when you restrict it to weakly globular double category, produces a strong segalic pseudofunctor. And the proof goes about what is a here, a functor from delta model up into cat is what we call a semi-simplicial object. So it's just a matter of showing that this thing here satisfies the semi-simplicial idea. The same is simplicial identities, okay, which are these things over here. And this is an easy calculation if you look at the two-dimensional structure of this segalic pseudo-funct that you build out of here. So I am emphasizing that this is a fairly straightforward observation, which in some sense had been in front of my nose for a number of years, but I was concerned with these things in higher dimensions, so I forgot about n equals 2. About n equals 2. And when I realized this, then I realized that this gives the entry point into building the functor from cat to weekly globular to fair 2. How? Well, because if you have a cat to weekly globular X, then the corresponding FAIR2 categories as for objects of objects X0D, objects of arrows X1, and X0 is precisely the objects of weak units. How do you show that this is a How do you show that this is a fair to category? Well, you use that criterion that I was telling you before. Namely, you have a diagram like this. Well, this is straightforward. And then you have to show that you have a semi-category structure on X1 and X0. This comes precisely from our observation. We know that when we restrict our structure to delta mono, we obtain a semi-category. So we obtain an associated. Category, so we obtain an associative composition. But that's precisely what we need here. And the last condition was that these maps are equivalencies of categories, or this is a consequence of the definition of weakly globular double categories of this induced single map condition. So these are the three ingredients in the proof of this functor, in the construction of this functor F2 from This functor F2 from weekly globular double categories to the Koch model. This functor presents two equivalences. Now, I haven't told you what two equivalences are. It's a general notion that corresponds to the idea of bi-equivalence or bi-categories, and it can be easily defined in these settings. So, this is one way of the comparison. Now, we have to go the way back from fair to categories to cat to weekly globular. CAT2 weekly globular. This is more technical, so there's no chance in a 20-minute talk to illustrate this, but let me just give you a few insights into the construction. So first of all, you produce a pseudo-fanto from fair to categories with these entries. These entries are things that you would probably guess easily, but the proof that this is a pseudo-fanter is involved and it relies on some properties of the category. Properties of the category of FAT delta, which, as far as I could see, are not in the literature. I had to sort of dig quite deeply into some technicalities here to make this work. But once you have this, then we can hit this with the strictification functor. So we have a ready piece of technology, because as I said before, when you strictify a segalic pseudofunctor, you find a weakly globular double category. So this is the functor the other way around. It's the composition of this. Way around. It's the composition of this functor that produces a pseudofuncto from their top into cut with the strictification. And the final result is that, so you have now a pair of functors between weekly globular double categories and fair to categories that induce an equivalence of categories after localization with respect to the two equivalences. Okay, so this is like a homotopical type of equivalence between these two structures. Equivalence between these two structures. Probably this result could be strengthened and put into some kind of two-dimensional equivalence, like we did in the paper with Pronk, but this is what I have reached so far. Now, there is a piece of the story that you don't see in the statement, and again, I have no chance to tell you in details, but it's the fact that to prove this, to prove this equivalence of categories after localization, you actually need a new player. Actually, need a new player. So, these two categories, CAT2 Weekly Global and FAIR2, are not enough. You need a bigger context, which is a weekly globular version of FAIR2 categories, which I call FAIR2 Weekly Globala. And I have not found another way to do it. I have to enlarge the context first in order to find the zigzag which are necessary to prove these equivalence of categories. And I find this quite common. Quite common in these situations that to prove an equivalence of categories after localization, you have to first enlarge the context and then come back to your context. And it could be that this bigger context maybe is the right way to phrase all these equivalences there. So coming to a short summary, there are several models of weak to categories, in particular the Siegel-type model and the Joachim-Koch. And the Joachim-Koch model. Here I was interested in proving a direct comparison between weakly globular double categories and fair to categories. This comparison sheds new light on this weak globularity condition. It's the one that precisely encodes the idea of weak units. But my real interest is that I believe that the technique of the proofs, which obviously I have not been able to illustrate in greater universal units, I have not been able to illustrate in great detail in 20 minutes, but these techniques are general enough to be generalizable in higher dimension, not in a trivial way, but this direct comparison really has nothing to do with the comparison with by categories, which in dimension two could be potentially a problem because you know that in dimension two everything can be strictified. But we don't use any of that here. So I have a I'm very confident that this can be generalized. Very confident that this can be generalized to higher dimension and eventually lead to the proof of the Simpson-Weak Units conjecture. So, finally, there is a preprint about this case, n equals 2, and I posted recently a version 2 where I corrected some earlier typos. And I would be delighted if you want to give me your feedback or discuss things further. You can always find me at this email address. And that's all. Thank you very much for your. And that's all. Thank you very much for your attention. Thanks very much. Let's thank the speaker.
