Okay, thanks very much for the invitation to the organizers and thanks very much to you for watching this. So today I'm going to talk about this brand new project that we started about five months ago. So first I want to fully acknowledge that First, I want to fully acknowledge that this work was done mostly by a postdoc, Ismail Hernandez, but also by Valeria Mateo, who is a PhD student. So as some of you may know, asinet factor Vamani is an opportunistic pathogen and actually is a very important one. It causes a lot of outbreaks in many hospitals all over the world and it mainly affects patients. Patients in intensive care units, critically patients. And there are a lot of different infections that this species can cause, but the most relevant ones are the ventriloquial associated pneumonia and blood-stream infections. And one of the most particular characteristic of this species is that a lot of the isolates are resistant to a lot of antibiotic drug plastics. Antibiotic drug classes. So, what you have here is a table of a bunch of isolates that we recently analyzed. And what you can see here, so you have the MICs, and here you can see that most of them are resistant to many antibiotic-resistant genes. And these were very particularly relevant because they were resistant to carbapenems. So, actually, it was in 2007. Actually, it was in 2017 that the World Health Organization published a list of the most relevant antibiotic-resistant bacteria for which newly antibiotic-resistant drugs are highly coveted. And acid bacterial Vermani was right at the top of this list. And this is just because it shows a lot of carbapenem resistance due to the many carbapenems. Many carb appendices that it has. Now, I want to talk a little bit about the genome sequences available for this species. Compared to other species, like for instance, Staphylococcus or some other very well-stated pathogens, there are not that many genomes for these species. As early as this week, there were less than 5,000 genomes, and most of them have been sequenced in the last Have been sequencing the last decade and belong to just a couple of international clones. So, but there is a very strong bias in the terms of the studied clones. So, most of the clones, most of the lineages that have been studied came from the international clone two and some of them came from international clone one. One, but recently we started to study a lot of lineages from this particular international atlone here. And actually, we have been dating the emergence of some lineages here. For instance, this particular lineage that is the sequence type 758 is well distributed in America Latina and we dated the merchant of this lineage to We dated the emergence of this lineage to around 2008. So, but I want to talk about a little bit about the genetic forces that impact this species. And compared to other species, this species is very dynamic. It has a lot of non-maloid recombination and mollusc recombination. And a few years ago, actually, we showed that when you consider very closely related isolates, just monsoon. Related isolates just months apart, we show that actually the differences due to gene content were far higher than those two mutations. And this has several implications as it seems that the MLST genotyping doesn't work properly. So the aim of this project is that just because the bias in terms of the that only a few sequence stacks have That are only a few sequences that have been studied, and just a couple of countries. We want to analyze the resistance at a global level. And actually, one of the other issues is that different cities have used different strategies to identify antibiotic-resistant genes. So, what we did in early March was to download all the available genomes from the RAF set. From the RAF set, but we only considered highly quality genomes. And then we discarded all those strings that did not pass an average nucleotide identity threshold of 90% versus the type string. In the end, we were able to get almost 1,500 genomes and we Genomes, and we annotated those in terms of antibiotic resistant genes using the resistant gene identifier tool from CAR, that actually this is a very well-created database. So our data set covers more than three decades, as you can see here. Although, as I told you, most of the isolates come from the last decade. Last decade. And in terms of lineage diversity, actually, we were able to sample a lot of lineages. As you can see here, we have almost 150 sequence types and 42 countries were included for this study. So, one of the first things is just to count the number of anti-vagetic resistance proteins. And what you can see here in this heistogram, you can see that. You can see that most of the isolates have over 20 antibiotic resistant genes per genome. And on average, each genome has about 30 antibiotic-resistant genes. But then we wanted to classify these into gene families, and we found that there are almost 200 gene families. So then So then we want to analyze the frequency distribution of these gene families all over the species. And the first relevant thing is that there seems to be no core antibiotic resistant genes, nor even these guys here that are the flux form genes that are considered intrinsic resistance. On the contrary, it seems that most of the gene families are present in just less Less than 15% of the strains. And most of these gene families have clear signals for homologous recombination. Then one of the things that we wanted to do is to analyze this into the population structure of these species and as many other species there is in an MLC for this species. Well, there are actually two MLC schemes. Actually, two MLC schemes. And so, what I'm showing you here is the antibiotic resistance variation within the different sequence types and between them. And as you can see here, there is a massive amount of variation, not only between them, but within them. And this clearly tells us that there has been a lot of recent or recent gene transfer and gene loss. Horizontal gene transfer and gene losses within these sequence types. But then one of the things that we want to analyze is whether this species has original gene transfer with other species. So what we did was to look for identical allele sequence, allele sequences in other known asynthal factor sequences in the NCBI. And here I'm talking about identical allele. And here I'm talking about identical, 100% identity, and the whole gene cover. And we have very interesting results. As you can see here, we found quite a few cases. And actually, one of the most interesting things is that the most relevant species involved in this are very well known pathogens. And actually, some of them are also very well known in terms of Very well known in terms of being associated with infections in ICUs, intensive care units. And so this one here actually has been reported in polymicrobial infections with Asinetto Vaturbamani over the last 10 years. But this led us to this idea to what extent we are really sampling the whole resistance. Resystem. So, what you have here is just a regular accumulation curve. So, here you have the number of genomes, and you have the accumulation of antibiotic-resistant gene families as a function of the number of genome. And as you can see here, this curve hasn't paid off. So, there is still some diversity of antibiotic-resistant gene families that we haven't sampled yet. Haven't sampled yet. So, we're thinking about including more genomes. The fragment wants to see if we can get some guys here and also to do an extrapolation to know about the potential number of antibiotic-resistant gene families that we are missing. And this might be one of the most interesting things in terms of the biology of this project. And what we want And what we wanted to focus on here is to actually analyze the non-human isolates. And this is because this species is a prototypical nosocomial pathogens. So what you have here in this heat map is all the plant and animal isolates that we found. And here you have the different antibiotic-resistant genes. And what you can see here is that actually we find Actually, we find quite a few. The other very important thing is that these are located on very different lineages on the three. And importantly, we found very important resistant against very important drug classes like cephaloscroines or aminoglycosides. We recently published this in Lancet Micro. And so I'm just hearing the last part of the presentation. So one of the things that we are doing right now is to actually establish which are the mobile genetic elements that are actually spreading these antibiotic procystin genes. And as in many other gram-negative bacteria, plasmids and pathogenicity islands are the usual suspects. Usual suspects, but we recently showed with another data set that actually transduction could be a very important source of antibiotic resistant genes. The other thing that we are doing is that at a much finer scale, we have got isolates from one big tertiary hospital in Guadalajara, which is the second biggest city in Mexico. Biggest city in Mexico, and we have covered more than a decade. And we are doing some actually phylographic analysis. And here, for instance, you can see that the different sequence types have been introduced at different times, some of them around 2007 and 2008, but one of them later on in 2013. Another thing that we are doing is to actually use the G content Gene content analysis to tell apart the different sympatric populations within this hospital. And so, well, I just want to wrap it up. And so maybe the conclusions or the most general ones are that horizontal gene transfer is spreading antibiotic-resistant genes not only within the species within the species. Genes not only within the species but with other species, and in this regard, asinato factory of money is typical in the sense that it seems that clonal expansion is not a big player for spreading antibiotic-resistant genes. Secondly, it seems that environmental isolates have a sizable amount of antibiotic-resistant genes. And actually, in that brief report in the Lancet microbe. Anset microbe, we suggested that actually these species should be considered under the lens of the one-health approach. And finally, these species might have an open resistant. And in this regard, it seems that at least for many of the antibiotic-resistant genes, maybe the affected population size is not limited by this species, but actually is able to incorporate. To incorporate a lot of gene families from some other bacterial pathogens. And finally, I just want to acknowledge some funding. I have funding from the Mexican National Council of Science and Technology, John Investigators, and I also have a couple of projects sponsored by UNEM. And well, I just want to thank some collaborators. Thanks, some collaborators, Rafael Franco and Patricia Volkov. These are medical doctors that gave us the strains from the different hospitals in Mexico. And then, well, a friend and a colleague of mine, Timothy Red, and Ben Evans from University of East Anglia. And so, thanks very much for your attention. And I'm happy to take any questions that you may have. Thank you. Thank you, Jago. Thank you. Thank you, Ago. Do anyone have any questions? You can either just speak up or put in the on the chat. So there's no question on the chat yet. I have a question. You are having so many ARGs. The number seems increasing with the number of the lineage. Linear edge. So, how do you decide these other ERGs? Okay, yeah. Well, actually, we set up a very strict threshold using actually CAR. And so the genes that we identified as antibiotic-resistant genes are identical to already described antibiotic-resistant genes that actually have also meek. Also, MIC established for quite a few of them. And the other hits are very closely related sequences. Less than, well, yeah, less than 90% of, no, actually, they are more than 90% identical to already studied antibiotic-resistant genes in CAR. So was that based on Jiva's study or experimental results? Yeah, well, that's a good point. Actually, CART is one of the, I would say, most sound databases in terms of gene resistance, just because a lot of the genes that are there are manually created and they have a lot of phenotypic information plus the gene sequences. Gene sequences. So, what let's say it's based on the gene content, not from the GMAS study, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, this is totally gene tempting. Yeah, exactly. This is totally gene content. Okay, thank you. I have a question now from Jesse. Or do I have another question already?
