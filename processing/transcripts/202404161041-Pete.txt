I guess the organizers didn't know that I will be talking about a big failure of my life. I hope you will enjoy it. So this is a question that 15 years ago I started thinking about. And okay, so there will be a result that I will tell you, but it's not the result that I wanted to prove. Uh so it's just uh uh a partial result about it. Uh so uh the question is the f following. So let's take the four angular phi and two neighbor bootstrap calculation. Okay, so that's very simple. So okay, I will have a notation which I'm not sure you will love. Sure, you will lost. So the initial configuration will be omega for the vertex X, and that will be either black or white, where black is occupied and white is empty. And there is the final, the bootstrapped Configuration, which I will denote by sigma, and the colour, the bootstrap colour of the vertex will be black or white, black, E, and W. Okay? I don't have a better solution. It should have one. Okay. Uh okay, and uh so of course uh you can you know there is the usual question, what is the density of uh little blackness in order to uh occupy the entire tree with probability one. Okay, I'll draw this just so that you can So that you can imagine that a vertex, where should I write that? So let's say q is x, and the color of x is, so it remains white if and only if it's contained in, in the initial configuration, if it's contained in something that stops, you know, that's an obstacle against bootstrap. Obstacle against boost trappings. And what is that? That's a three-regular little white tree. So X is in a three-regular white sub-tree. Right? Because if it's indeed in a three-regular white subtree, then the outer boundary of that sub-tree is one at every vertex, so it doesn't get occupied from the outside by the two-rule. By the two rule. And if you are not contained in a three-regular white sub-tree, then there are some vertices that have degree O, degree two, and then they will be eaten up, and eventually you will get black. Right? So that's very easy. So really the question is: what is the density of whiteness when it's like a calculation question? Instead of you want x to be in a wide infinite cluster, you want it to be in a white free regular subject. So it's like a higher order pipeline or something. And okay, how do you calculate the typical density? Let me do it. Maybe you have seen this, but uh I don't know if This, but I don't know if it has. So let's say BP. So the probability of blackness near BP. Probability key. So let's say BP, okay, maybe I should call it B, capital B P is the probability that... Ah, sorry, I forgot. Okay, it's easier. Okay, before I do the calculation, let me. Calculation, let me say that the model is basically equivalent to, you know, we just ignore this part of the tree and we are doing occupation only from below. So it's like oriented to neighbor percolation on the three array tree. Basically, you know, anything interesting you can ask, it will be the same in the two models. Like, you know, the critical delta. Like you know the critical density, for instance. So equivalently oriented to rule on 3L3. So, but you know, calculations are slightly more symmetric on the 3L3. I will do recursions. Okay, so let's go BP is the So let's call Bp is the probability that root is black when you when little blackness has density p. Now you can write an equation. Okay, so what is the probability that it gets occupied? Well, either it is black, little black at the beginning, or it's not. But in that case, you need at least three, out of the three kits, you need at least three. Out of the three kits, you need at least two kits to be capital B. Because then it gets so either all three kits are bootstrap lagged or two of the three kits are boosted flag. Okay, so this is the equation. And how does it look? Uh and uh how does it look like? So I'm going to to draw the equation for p plus 1 minus p. So p is a constant and I'm going so the the equation for b goes to for x, I don't know what I do is uh actually p and b. uh okay b I'd say b goes to p plus one minus p okay sorry so this this thing uh as a function of b okay and the question is you know what are the solutions you know where are the places where it intersects the diagonal and when p is less than one over nine then uh this so this is a cubic curve This is a cubic curve, and it looks like yes, the other way looks like this when p equals one ninth looks like this and when b is uh When b is bigger than 1 over 9, then it looks like this. Okay, and really the true b is the smallest root you can easily see. So here the probability of capital blackness is something smaller than one, a bit small. Here at one ninth, At 1 9th, it is still smaller than 1, and for p bigger than 1 9, it is 1. Okay, so the interesting thing about this is that, as opposed to normal calculation, like Watson trees, at criticality you don't have yet the infinite cluster, at criticality you don't get capital Black, meaning Capital black, meaning that at criticality you already have a positive probability to be contained in a binary white subtree. So this phase transition is a discontinuous phase transition as opposed to the usual calculation phase transitions. However, as I learned from Marek, in physics you don't call this a first-order phase transition. It's a hybrid phase transition, meaning that although it is discontinuous at the critical point, correlations still decay polynomially, not exponentially as you would get in a random cluster model with high Q. You get the discontinuous phase transition. At the critical point, you see either the supercritical or the subcritical thing, and you also have the exponential DTF correlations. This is not like this. What do I mean by? What do I mean by polynomial decay of correlations? So, for instance, if you so at the critical point, if you get black, okay, why, so if your color, the color of the root is skeptical black, why is it black? Why? Because by definition, there is a finite certificate, finitely many vertices, that little black vertices that may Little black vertices that make black. So the question is: how far do you have to go to see this finite set at criticality? And it doesn't have an exponential tail. So the probability that you have to go to distance n to see that you get black is probability you have to go larger than n is one over root, sorry, one over n. Okay, it will be clear, right? It's one over n, not sure. Let's see. So that has a polynomial there. Which means that this is an interesting phase transition. So at the critical point, you still can ask for interesting critical behavior. And what is the critical, the interesting critical behavior that I'm after, so that's dynamical bootstrap. Meaning that Meaning that, so I will talk about the critical case. For this initial configuration omega for each vertex, let's put a Poisson, a Poisson block. So in continuous time, each vertex is switching between little black and little white so that you keep the stationary distribution to be density. Distribution to be density one over nine for the for little blackness. So dynamical distract calculation, you have this omega x t in continuous time. And then at every time, you look at sigma. This is right for every x in the tree. Every x in the tree, in the binary tree. And here, similarly, you know, you define, I mean, from this, you get the, by bootstrapping, you get the bootstrapped configuration. And then, so this is stationary dynamics. So, at any given time, the probability that Uh that there is, right? I mean, so the probability that the root remains white is positive. The probability that somewhere in the tree you have a white binary tree, therefore you don't have complete occupation of the three tree. With probability one, you don't get complete occupation. So at any given So at any given t, so any fixed t the probability at p equals 1 over 9 that not all of t is black is 1. But this is a continuous time dynamics. This is a continuous time dynamics. This is a nice example where it actually matters that probability one doesn't mean for sure. You cannot add the probability zero event that the probability zero event that the whole tree is black. You cannot add that continuum many times. So the question is, are there exceptions? Add that exceptional sorry, Gabriel, I'm not completely sure that I understand the process. Yes. So each vertex in the initial configuration is switching between black and white. So each has a rate one Poisson process of switch times. So when the clock is ringing, then it's with probability 1 over, you want to keep the stationary distribution. So when the clock rings, then with probability 1 over 9, you become black, whatever you were. And with probability 1 over 8 over 9, you become white. A little white, whatever you were. So you just resample your comp your colours, your initial colour. Otherwise, you run the bootstrap. And every moment, in every moment, you run. The bootstrapping. So you can write that every moment you take this function, this measurable function of these bits, to get your bootstrapped configuration. And the time of the dynamics has nothing to do with the time of the bootstrap calculation, right? Right, so you just start into the correct. The bootstrap is always uh intent instantaneous. So at every moment you immediately apply the measurable mass, which is the final mass solution. Which is the final mass function and not cumulatively, you forget about not cumulatively. It's not like you're adding more infections as you go along. Right. You just start again. Yes. So it's really a stationary dynamics. So at an exceptional Van Baum times when When all the Tueri white, you know, initial white subtrees are destroyed. Is the question clear? The model clear? Okay. I don't know. So this is the question then. Uh I don't know. So this is the question that uh I asked uh fifteen years ago first and uh uh you know when I learned from Marek that it's called a hybrid phase transition because in so you know if you want exceptional times so for instance in a in critical planar perpetration the probability so at criticality you don't have an infinite cluster but the probability that you are But the probability that the cluster of the origin is large, has some polynomial decay, it's not completely unlikely that it's huge. And you do the same dynamics for exponential blocks, and you are asking, are there exceptional times in these dynamics when actually you get infinite clusters in critical calculation? And the answer there is yes, you get. But this is a quite a different question, actually, because there you want to produce one. You want to produce one infinite pass curve, and here you sort of want to destroy all these infinite obstacles. So it's a very different kind of exceptional time. Also taking inspiration from population. Do you know if there is a Misscipiat Oz O Leg? All lack configuration at reality. For example, in population, you can condition the cluster to reach. That's a trivial question, but a good one. You know, you have with positive. No, no, I want to see Mike Helen, but I want to know how it happened on conditional dependency. Okay, if I know, right, right, right. This is okay, okay, this is an even better question than I think. Okay, sorry, yes, you are right, I don't know. You have a black vertex just disconnects a graph right, and then what So you want the things below this black vertex to be uh to not perpolate and in the bubbly to be just uh just independently. Okay, so you're saying that maybe it's easy to it's easy to construct this this incipient uh measure. But it may happen, you know, how do you okay, anyway, we can discuss that later. So I'm just a bit surprised by the fact that you've worded it so different. I mean, you just mean, are there times when it's all black, right? It's all black, right? Yes, which means that all white subtrees are destroyed. Yeah, but on the line above you said not all black. Yes, isn't that equivalent? Yeah, yeah. As different as the wording could be. Interesting. And there was one more question. So how how is it different when you look at proportion when you say there is an independent uh cluster and you want it uh It's a cluster and you want to destroy all circuits around the origin. Okay, you will see in a second maybe. Okay, so I'm after this question. Uh now observe the following. Uh so I didn't really tell you that at the switch times when a clock rings the color is black or white. It doesn't really matter. So let's define it to be white. So for this is really for convenience. So, for this is really for convenience, doesn't really matter. For okay, this I cannot try this work. Did I succeed? And that succeeded. For convenience, so at switch points omega x equals, so always, you know, it doesn't matter if you switch from white to black. It doesn't matter if you switch from white to black or from black to white, make it white. And then, the set of times when you are black, so if you are black, I mean if you are capital black, then it comes, you are black from finitely many little black vertices. So the times when a vertex is little black is always Vertex is little black, is open. It says union of open intervals. Because I mean, at the switch times, you have white, so you know, you are black for a while, and you are black for a while. It's a union of open intervals. When you are capital black, it's an intersection of finitely many open intervals. So it is still a union of open intervals. So, okay, so then the set. So then the set of tens where the sigma x t is black is open. Just a union of open intervals. Okay, and then there are two possibilities. One is that uh Is that the set of times when a given vertex is black, okay, so it's open, and sometimes it's white, but maybe it immediately becomes open. So maybe this open set is dense everywhere on the real line. I like it. Okay, maybe let's give it a name. Give it the name Bx, the times when it's black. Bx is almost surely dense everywhere. So even if you start conditioning on this probability, okay, I didn't write it, but uh at the let me do the remark. Okay, that let me just remark that b one over nine is uh one over four so the white one over nine is three over four and so the probability of white is the root is white is three quarters if you condition on this positive probability event you can ask and start running the dynamics do you immediately get black I mean are there I mean, are there infinitesimal closed times when you are black? So this would mean almost surely. This would mean that Bx is almost surely that you learn. Or not. So the probability that sigma x zero is the probability of the probability of the probability of the probability 0 epsilon is for a positive amount of time, it remains white with positive probability. This is what it means, right? If it's not almost sure, if it's not dense everywhere, then there are intervals that are left out with positive probability, not almost surely dense everywhere, with positive probability, there are intervals left out. The right intervals left out. So, this is, you know, there's a small interval that is left out from blackness with positive probability. Okay, so these are complementary factors. Yeah. Okay. And why am I talking about this? Because this decides about the existence of exceptional times. In case one okay, who knows the best at a gracier? One. Two. High school? Yeah, but you had to learn. You all learned, you had to, but we have forgotten for a long time. So it says that a countable intersection of open dense sets is non-empty. It has some name, bearish, category one or two, I don't remember. So the set of times when x, the vertex x is capital black, if it's an open dense set, then you have countably many vertices in the back. Countably many vertices in the binary, in the 3L3. So the intersection of these open delta sets is still non-empty. Therefore, there's a time when every single vertex in the ternary tree is capital black. So there are exceptional times. Okay, in case two, no exceptional thanks. Why? Because here is your third vertex tree. So you have this epsilon. You go really deep in the tree where you have the number of vertices is much larger than epsilon. is much larger than one over epsilon. I know two to the k is much level L, two to the l is much bigger than one over epsilon. So you have all these all these vertices. Okay, so let's uh okay, maybe one of the silent group address or something. One over epsilon squared or something. So cut the unit interval, time interval into pieces of epsilon and look at the probability. Look at the first epsilon length interval. You have all these lots of things. Each remains white during that time interval with probability epsilon. You have a lot of them. So of course at least one of them remains white for time zero to epsilon. And high with huge probability. With huge probability. And between time 2 epsilon and 2 epsilon, another one may remain white all along that time. And so on. So with huge probability, at least one of them will remain white during one of these intervals. So in time 0, 1, the probability that someone remains is very close to 1. You can make this very close to 1. To one. So you don't, you know. So the probability that in 0, 1 there are no exceptional times is 1. So it's using some availedness of the model to due independence across the. Yeah, I mean, of course, I mean, here, you know, whether, you know, you are coming from below. So whether this remains white or this remains white, these are independent ones. Right, but on the other hand, it's obvious for a different reason that if you are remaining. For a different reason, that you know, if you have remaining white stuff, okay, you can do it. Okay, so we have to decide about this. And And what we can prove, or I can carry the result, is this. So it's not almost sure denseness everywhere, but a much weaker, but still non-trivial statement. So probability. So probability that uh uh how do I include it si So sigma x zero epsilon changes infinitely often in a so in time at silent you have infinitely many changes of the of your uh Changes of your bootstrapped colour. We would want that this happens with probability one. Actually, there's a simple 0, 1 law that tells you that you don't need. Okay, so if this probability was bounded away from 0, regardless of epsilon, it doesn't have to be probability 1. It doesn't have to be probably one, just bounded away from zero, then it implies that it's probability one. So that is fine. But we don't know that it's uniformly bounded away from zero. It's just constant times in the cell. Okay. So there is some chaotic behavior in the colour of the root. So it's not like it's white. So it's not like it's white for a while, then it's black, then it's white, then it's black, then it's white, then it's black, the blue striped color, but really, with even if you start with alpha, okay, this was wrong. If you start with probability 1 over 4, you are starting at time 0, you are black. And this stays there for a while because you are black from finitely many vertices, and in time at zero, Vertices, and in time epsilon, they don't change their colours, so you remain black. The point is that even if you started with white, you will become black with some probability. So, you condition on a sigma x0 to be white. False with raw? It was. No, no, no, it wasn't. No, no, no, because if you start from black, you don't change your colours often, you remain black. That's my precise probability than white. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, with the probability with equals one, with my dream results it will be false. In my dreams it is false. In my dreams, it's okay. Okay, so this is the result. If you again, why is it not correct if it's black? Okay, it is correct. But it's trivial. It's correct, but it's trivial. But you didn't modify it. It's strict to the fact that it's equivalent. It's equivalent. No, I'm saying that if I condition on blackness here ah, then it just false. Okay, but without the blackness, it's trivial or false. Okay, so is the result uh clear? Uh now, before I say no, it's okay. We can discuss it. We can discuss it. But just to be clear, it was correct before, right? Yeah, it was correct. It was correct. It wasn't trivial, it wasn't false. It was equivalent to this thing. Okay. So if you don't get excited by this result, then I tell you a similar thing, a similar question. Things, a similar question, which is completely open. And this type of result I think would be more, would look exciting to everyone, even without this weird explanation with that category theorem that I told you. So, suppose you started with flat, then you can also ask what is the length of the time for which you do state flat, right? Yes, that's a random variable, and then you can ask, like, what? Variable, and then we can ask what is the behavior of that. That depends on how big the neighborhood we have to explore to detect that what it's taking. And probably also depends on this at the same time because let's call it another motivation. So, actually, the first time when people looked at So actually the first time when people looked at uh this question of uh finding a binary subtree in a percolation configuration on a ternary tree or something like this was not for booster percolation but was for fractal percolation. Mandel growth fractal percolation. So you just take the random canton set so take the unit square, cut it into three by three squares and with probability p uh with probability P keep, you know, independently keep some pieces uh and the others are uh okay, maybe these are guarded and these are kept, okay. And then the ones that are kept, uh you repeat. Okay, and you get some, and you have, and you repeat this. I'm sure this was the first time, because I mean, this has been like rediscovered dozens of times by people all over the place. It's very hard to find the first. Yes, right. Right, so this or something. Yeah, there's a pigs and decking papers on this. Okay, so maybe. This okay, so maybe that was actually independent of. I don't know. The application to fractal population was in chase chase to at 88. So the question is: of course, if you take P, okay, there's an obvious, there's a trivial phase transition, whether the limit set is empty or not. This is just a branching process. This is just a branching process thing. The non-trivial phase transition is, let's say, do you have a left-right crossing in the limit set with positive probability. Okay, so let's call it PC, the infimum of B values, where there is a left-right crossing. Is positive. That's P C and is it clear that it's non-trivial? So can you have is it clear that P C is less than 1? So if P is close enough to 1, do you have a letterite plus 1? And the proof that they did was that, well, if you, in this 983, and every single 9 every tree on every step. If you have an eightery sub-tree that is kept, then you can easily see that if there's an infinite atery tree, then you can actually find, go around any hole and you can actually get through. So the critical density for finding an 833 and the 933 is an 1 minus that is an upper bound we see. So that's the So that's the relationship. And it seems like this relationship goes, you know, it's just a bound, but it goes more deeply. The two models are really similar. Another way of seeing that they are similar, okay, maybe I also define P D is the infinum of p values by the probability that the limit set is not just like Set is not dust-like becomes positive. So, dust-like means totally disconnected. Every connected component is a single point. So, of course, if you have a left-lite crossing, then it's not a dust-like. Maybe it could be not dust-like, but not having the left-lite crossing. They proved that P D equals P C. And they also proved that And they also proved that at PC equals P C and two is that at P C the probability of a left-right crossing is already positive. So this is, again, a discontinuous phase transition. And the reason is simple for the discontinuity. If this probability of an LF transpressing was. If the probability of a left-trained crossing was too small, then on a much smaller scale, you see the exactly the same model, and you could do a Payer's argument on that small scale to get that the probability of electronic crossing is actually exponentially small. So, you know, when you have a left-right crossing, it needs to be at least something. And it's right continuous, obviously. So it needs to be a discontinuous transition. Okay, and then you can put dynamical fractal perpetration. So on each level, you decide independently. You know, you are updating your decisions independently. And can ask that at the critical point, are there exceptional times when instead of being not dust-like, it really falls apart into complete dust. So that's the analog of the question that I asked. So, question one: Are there exceptional times of being passed? And uh question two, maybe you cannot answer this, but Answer this, but you know, look at the root thing. So you don't want to control that it's dust-like everywhere, you just want to see what the left-right crossing on the macroscope, you know, at the root of your decisions does. So the analog of this thing would be that the probability that left-right crossing changes infinite. Infinitely often in 0, 1 is positive, or maybe 1. And you know, being positive, if we could prove this for this model, then we would prove question 2. So, anyway, and that, I think, is a really cool version of this thing that really says that there is huge code symbol in Whether the event that there exists an infinite crossing goes from true to false infinite often. Or are you saying that the sort of path itself changes infinitely often? The existence of the reference changes things often. Um okay. Now one more remark. Uh okay. Uh when am I finishing? And how much should it depends on how deep I go in the proof okay five minutes? Is that okay? Okay, I'll try in five. Okay, so one thing is that uh That in usual Bernoulli planar population, you ask about noise sensitivity. So the question is: if you run the dynamics a little bit of time, did having a left-right crossing or not having a left-right crossing, did it decorrelate during a little time? That would be noise. The left-right crossing is noise entity. Here, there is no question about. Here, there is no question about that. It's clearly not noise sensitive because whether you have a left, so you already have infinitely many bits here, as opposed to taking an n by n box in a planar preparation. So you have infinitely many bits. Whether you have a left-right crossing or not is a measurable function of all these infinitely many bits. So if you run dynamics for a very little time, the first million levels are not Million levels are not touched by the noise. But the first level is a good approximation to your measurable function. You can approximate by finite ceiling text, any measurable function. Therefore, the probability, you know, the correlation between time zero and time epsilon, whether you have a left-right crossing or not, will be close to one. You are running time for a short time. So definitely noise sensitivity is not the question that you can ask. It's more like this volatility question that you can ask. And that also shows, so, okay, how is noise sensitivity and exceptional times, how are they proved for planar percolation, bad noise percolation? You need Fourier analysis to control the Some correlation decays. So we also need that here. So there are two main steps in the proof. So, when in actually calculating So when you're actually calculating the proposition one is that the correlation between sigma x zero and sigma x epsilon, so just also in a in Buset calculation, This is a measurable function of all the initial colours, so the correlation will be close to one. The question is: how close it is to one? And it is one minus constant times root epsilon. Okay, so this root epsilon is after some work is this same root epsilon. Before I say anything more, so this is proved using history-fourier analysis. And proposition two is that if I define c n epsilon to be the number of given The number of kivoto uh white to black switches uh in time zero left silent within uh level from the root from x. Okay, so what does this mean? Okay, we have the infinite. Okay, we have the infinite tree under x. How does it happen that the colour of x changes from white to black? Well, it's because it was not occupied before and there is a change for the initial color of a vertex somewhere from little white to little black and that suddenly colors the root to be capital black. So that's a pivotal switch for that. So that's a pivotal switch for that vertex when it really that little white to little black changes the color of the root. And the question is from how far are these pivotal switches come from? How many pivotal switches do you have from distance at most n in time epsilon? So this is your random variable. And the statement is that the expectation of the n. The expectation of Cn epsilon is exactly n times epsilon, while the variance of Cn epsilon is up to constant factors, is n squared epsilon to the three halves. I could, it's not really the variance that second moment. But it's the same, but okay, and then Okay, and then you know the Pele-Wigmund inequality dividing by you know you divide the square of the first moment by the square by the second moment, you get the root epsilon probability for the number of pivotal switches being at least n times epsilon, constant times n times epsilon. For every n, the same probability independently of n, therefore, Independently of n. Therefore, as n goes to infinity, you get infinitely many kilotals, which is full-time epsilon with the same uniform promoting the frame. Okay? So this implies this immediately. And okay, and how, so of course, this thing is again, you know, this uses this root of sine and there. And okay, so you give you some idea. Give you some idea. Now, why is this exactly anti-sepsilon? If you are white at the moment, if the root is white, how does the pivotal tree look like? So, who are the pivotal vertices for the root to be white? So, if it's white currently, at time zero, it means that it has. It means that it has a it's in a white binary subtree. So maybe this is this is black, so this will be black, this will be white, and maybe this is capital white. So it needs at least two white children, actually capital white children, but I will draw more the tree. The three. And you know, maybe this is white from all three kids being completely, you know, capital white. And then therefore should okay, maybe I draw more than okay. Let's say it looks like uh Let's say the configuration looks like this. Okay, so if anyone here changes its color, it doesn't matter because you have already two white subtrees here, and so this remains white, and here it doesn't change anything. So there are no devotor bits under this thing. Let's say these are all okay, and if I and but this is of course pivotal, but these are not pivotal. And when you have the two kits, then you have to go further to decide, but you know, every time you see already three capital white kits, you know, this is still, this could be pivotal, but these are not. So the pivotal tree in this, I mean, the set of I mean, the set of inverter bits is really picture is this sub-tree. So if these initially white vertices, they switch to black, then the root becomes black. Anything else which is black, the root doesn't care. Okay, what is the distribution of this white sub-tree? So you can either have two kids. You can either have two kids or zero kids in this tree. And it's a very simple calculation from these one-ninth and three-quarters and these numbers that the probability of having two kids in the pivotal tree is one-half, and the probability of having zero kits is one-half. So this pivotal tree is a critical Gautam-Watson tree. Meaning that its expected size of e on every level is exactly one. level is exactly one. And the probability that it reaches distance n is probably one over n. The probability that its volume, it's n, is at least one over root n. Critical Gautama free stuff. So this already explains this from, you know, there's a Fubini, there's a time integral, but you know, at any given moment, the expected number of pivotals are less. Expected number of pivotals on level 1 is 1, and any level is 1. So the expected number of pivotals up to level n is n, and whether they switch within time epsilon is epsilon. So the expected number of pivotal switches is n times epsilon. Now, if you want to find a second moment, you need pairs of times, pairs of vertices, and for that, you need to understand the correlation. What is the probability that this And what is the probability that this vertex is pivotal at this time and pivotal at a different time? And then you have to do something. And it comes, you know, after some non-trivial arguments, it comes back to this question. You know, for one given vertex, what is the correlation between being capital Y and capital black? And that is this result. And the last sentence is that, so when you do the The Fourier analysis, there is a correspondence, there is a relationship between pivotality and Fourier analysis, which is not perfect, but for first and second moments, it's good. So there is something called, so those, I don't know, maybe three people who knows what the spectral sample is, it For this function, the spectral sample is a critical Garton-Watson tree, just like the Pivotal tree. So it's a different object, but you can understand it in a recursive structure like this. And it's a Gauten-Watson tree, this spectral sample, and it's a critical Gautam-Watson tree. Therefore, you know its size, and from its size, you immediately get this correlation. This evaluation mode. So roughly that's it. If you wish to ask, I know Size questions and most of the suit, so you could take a four-ray of the graph of indices. Yes, so we consider this. This. And you've got two types of noise. You can do rewiring. You can also change the. Okay, we didn't do rewiring. So when you take the colour, you are changing the colours, and you are asking, so let's say you take the density where the probability of complete occupation is one half. And you are asking, we sample the colors a little bit, whether you have the complete occupation or not. Did that change? And no, it's okay, we didn't prove noise stable, we proved not. Proved noise stable, we proved not noise sensitive. And the reason so, then that's the event that I put there's three cores for there exists three regulars. Okay, we didn't go into the structure. We didn't go to the structure there. The truth just says that if you go into Pollock Peter, you see that the You see that the threshold is. They computed the threshold window analytically, sort of, and it's the same threshold window as for majority. So it's just one over root n. So, you know, being you know, the probability of getting occupied, it gets from very small to very close to one in a window of. Close to one in a window of one over repair, around one over nine. And this fact that the wind, so, and this is actually the coarsest possible window that can happen, no, the sharpest possible window that can happen. Sharpest that can happen, and this implies that actually, whether you are fully occupied or not, it actually positively corrects. Or not, it's actually positively correlated with majority. And therefore, so if you know, right? Because if you are, you know, majority has the same window. So if you know that, so, and that implies that you are not. I'm just trying to recall because for the vermilion percolation case, they also fall into this comparison between the expectation squared. Expectation squared over the second moment, but in their case, it's like bigger or equal than a constant, and you have this like square root epsilon extra factor, right? And so, like, but I'm trying to remember, so like, you expect the square root of epsilon, those things see tighter. Yeah. So, this is tight. Yeah. So, so you cannot get the existence of puritan switches from the second moment. You have to do something else, or something more. Something else, or something more, and uh but then going like beyond the second moment you could like potentially reach a similar conclusion to what they reached? You know, I tried only for 15 years. Who am I to tell? So, really, I have no we have no idea what is the truth. So uh okay, so poor Aber Fortrush was my postdoc and we were working on this for My cost, and we were working on this for two or three years. And we all, you know, for a while we thought we can prove the existence of exceptional times, but then we learned something, we wanted to prove the non-existence of exceptional times. Then the existence, non-existence, existence, non-existence, something always changed. And it didn't converge. No, in every three or four months it changed. Yes, it is. But not only for this reason. Yes, if you want to work. This is a beautiful question. If you want to work on it with me. This might be a stupid question, but if you take three-dimensional evaporation at a critical point, do you know there are times when there is a cluster?
