Thank you for inviting me. So this is some joint work with Daniel Alemajad. And this talk is unfortunately a bit far away from the stated topic of the conference, but I hope it will be interesting nevertheless. It is also rather elementary, but I think it okay. I think it okay so let me start so what are um what is minimality what is so if we have a house or topological group which I'm going to write like this with G tau where tau is the topology so we say that it is minimal if it does if the group does not admit any Hauser group topology that is strictly coarser than tau right and a stronger property is And a stronger property is so-called total minimality. So we say that a group is totally minimal if any topological quotient of G is also minimal. Including G, right? And the prototypical example is compact household groups. But this is the closest I'm going to be during my talk to the subject of locally compact. Update of locally compact groups, I open. Alright, so now let me define the kind of topology I will be most interested in. So if you have a group G of permutations of a set that here and only here I'm going to call omega, and some subset of omega A, I will write G A to denote the point. G A to denote the point-wise stabilizer of A in G. And one can check that if you take the collection of all point-wise stabilizers of finite subsets of omega, you get a basis of neighborhoods of the identity of a house of group topology, which I'm going to refer to as the standard topology. This was just a quick reminder that just I will, you know, I will. A relational language or signature is just like a collection of relation symbols and constants. An L structure is an interpretation of the symbols in L, right? So relation symbols are interpreted as predicates and constants as elements. I won't be really using constants today. Using constants in the talk. I mean, they so this is the appearance of constants here is more of a format, right? And okay, so when you have two L structures, an isomorphic embedding of one into the other, this is maybe worth clarifying. It is an injective map that respects interpretation of the simple signal, and this goes both ways. So a relation holds, has to hold for a total if and only holds, if and only if it holds for each image, right? And okay, but isomorphism. And okay, isomorphisms and automorphisms are particular cases defined in the obvious way. And just another piece of notation: so H of M stands for the collection of all finite substructions of M. Really, in the abstract, right, it's more like the isomorphism class. Okay. Fair enough. Okay, so now suppose we have a counter. Countable structure in some signature. Here it doesn't matter that whether it's relational or not. We say that it is ultra-homogeneous. Well, it does matter. Okay, so we say that the structure is ultra-homogeneous if any isomorphism between finite substructures of M extends to some automorphism of the structure. So it's a very symmetric structure. Very symmetric structure, right? And then, so given a relational signature and a countable class of finite L, a finite, okay, a relation, a countable class of finite L structures K is called a Frochet class. It satisfies the following properties. So it is close under taking substructures. Any two structures in the class and The class and jointly embedding to some larger structure in the class. And the class K satisfies the so-called amalgamation property. So if you have a structure A that embeds into and two embeddings of A into other structures in the class B1 and B2, there's a way to embed B1 and B2. There's a way to embed B1 and B2 in a larger structure in the class, C that is compatible with the embedding of A into each of them. Right? So, okay. Okay, and so a very basic theorem by Frechet is that if you have a By Fraser, is that if you have a relational language and a Fraser class of L structures, then there exists a unique countable L structure M, which satisfies these two properties, right? It is ultra-homogeneous, and the H of M, sorry, there's a typo here, is precisely K. And we will refer to M as above as the Pressel limit of K. Right, the way one uses The way one uses the properties of M is typically the following. So you have a, it's also the way you construct it, by the way. So you have two structures in the class, and you have some isomorphic embedding of, let's say, Yota of A into B, and then some isomorphic embedding phi of the smaller one A into M, right? So the properties of M imply that Properties of M imply that this M extends via Yota to some, this phi extends via Yota to some phi tilde from V into M. Right, and okay, some examples would be, for instance, if the class of finite linear orders is a Frace class, and the Frace limit is a dense linear order. So something that's isomorphic to the rationals with. The rationals with a relation that with the order relation. If k is the class of all finite graphs, then you get the so-called random graph. And if k is the, but you could take also, there are some variations of this that are also classy classes. For instance, you could take graphs which should not take some complete graph of a certain Complete graph of a certain size as a subgraph. Okay. So I want to focus though on some specific subclasses of Rose classes, namely the ones that satisfy the free amalgamation property. So what is this? So suppose we have L structures A, B, and C, right? Where C is a common substructure of. Right, where C is a common substructure of A and B. Properly speaking, there are two isomorphic embeddings of C into A and into B. So, what is the free amalgam of A and B over C? Well, this is just a structure which is constructed as follows. You take a copy of A, a copy of B, and then you simply identify the two copies of C inside each of them and then. And then in the new structure, the only relations you have are the ones inherited from either A or B. And a Fraze class that which is closed under this operation is called the is said to satisfy the freedom of dimension property. And at some point I will use the following notation. So I will say that A is free from B over C. Free from V over C and write it like this. If the substructure, so these are three substructures of M so I will say this hold if the substructure spanned by the union of these three sets is isomorphic to the free amalgam of A union C with P union C over C. Okay. Okay. It might be unwise to introduce it so early, but what is done is done. Right. So the question I'm concerned with here is the following. So suppose I have like a countable, well, ultra-homogeneous or even something weaker homogeneous structure. When is the group of automorphisms? Group of automorphism of this structure endowed with the standard topology minimal or when it is totally minimal, right? And there is a more general question one could ask, which is whether it's possible to classify the group topologies of the automorphism groups that are coarses and the standard topology in some way, right? Whether parametrize them in some way. Okay, so here. So here, okay, I'll be short of time. So here are some counterexamples of minimality. So for instance, if we consider the dense linear order, right, if you can define a group topology in the Define a group topology in the following way. So you can, so as a sub-basis of neighborhoods of the identity, you take the collections of sets NX, AB defined as following. So this is a set of all G's that take this point X in the interval, in the open interval AB that move it inside. That move it inside that same interval. Right? And it is easy to see that this is strictly courses and the standard topology because there's no finite amount of such conditions that can there's no finite conjunction of such conditions that can imply that you have to fix some particular point in Q. Right, and well, this is the yeah, it's actually the pull. Yeah, it's actually the pullback of the compact augment topology, the homeomorphism group of R. Another example is, so if you take the Flasse limit of the class of finite bipartite graphs, right, so suppose you have some language with an edge relation and a predicate that holds, well, if you are in one side of the partition. Then the restricted standard topology, the standard topology restricted to one side of the partition is a house of group topology, but it's strictly courses and tau standard. So why is it housed or well, if it wasn't housed or then that would mean that you can fix an entire side of the An entire side of the partition and somehow act on the other side, right? Moving some points on the other side. But this is really not possible because if you have two points on, let's say, x1, you can always find some third point by the universality of the flash limit. You can find some third point on x2, which is connected to one of these points, but not connected to the other. So if you fix To the other. So if you fix that point on x2, there's no way you can take one of these two points on x1 to the other one, right? On the other hand, you can also see that if you there's no way in which you can there's no there's no finite subset of x2, let's say, such that if you fix x2, you have That if you fix x2, you have to fix some point in x1 because there are always going to be two points in x1 that have the same that behave in the same way with respect to this finite subset. So, and by again, by the properties of the plasma limit, by ultra-homogeneity, this will imply that there's an automorphism fixed in this finite set in x2 that takes this point to the other point, right? The other point, right? So, so it is strictly coarser than the full standard topology. And another example would be, for instance, the rational Eurison space, which can also be seen as a frazzle limit. Here you have a relation for each rational. This metric space with rational values and a universal metric space with rational distances. And there's like a relation symbol that holds between two points that I That are at precisely a certain distance q. And in this case, there is like a natural topology associated to the metric that's strictly, that is Hauser, but strictly coarser than the standard topology. And it would be very nice, but unfortunately, there's nothing like this yet to find some general set of conditions under which under which any failure of minimality can could be sort of attributed to some abstract behavior that each of these examples exemplify. I'm not sure if I'm making a lot of sense. Right, okay, so I'm a bit short of time, right? So I probably should hurry. So, I probably should hurry. So, what is some basic way of proving that this kind of group is minimal? So, this is through the so-called Zariski topology. So Zariski topology on a group is a topology whose space is given by sets of solutions to group inequalities. Something of this form, where the alpha i are parameters in the group, right? So it's a collection of x's that satisfy this equation, right? And it is, so one basic theorem in this field is that if you take the full permutation group of a countable infinite set, actually, countable is not needed here, like this is with the standard topology. With the standard topology, this is totally minimal. And the reason is that the Zariski topology on this group is a group topology. Now, which implies that in fact Zaliski topology is the coarsest house of group topology on the group, right? The on the group, right? Because those sets here are always open in any house of group apology. Okay, so probably should not stay too long in this slide, but like one can prove that structures in which there exist automorphisms that are Well, let's say the identity on some sort of interval in the structure. And for these structures, you can show that the disk topology is actually a group topology. So for instance, the automorphism group of a dense linear author, but also similar objects. For instance, you could take a reduction of a dense linear author. Of a dense linear order. So you could forget, so you could remember only, for instance, when you could close Q on a circle by forgetting part of the information of the structure. And this still satisfies the same property. If you remember the clockwise order of points in... Clockwise order of points along the circle, or you could even forget what is clockwise or anticlockwise. There's another read of Q. And there's another similar structure, which is the cyclic tournament. So this is basically taking like a dense set of points in the unit circle with no antipodal points, and then having a Having an oriented edge from A to B if the arc, if the clockwise arc from A to B is a shorter one. And the funny thing is that in this case, while with Q, for instance, there are no topologies closer than the standard topology other than the standard topology itself and the Zoliski topology. In this case, there's another one. And there's another one, which is the one corresponding to the Zariski topology on Q's, the one you define using intervals. The Zariski topology in this other structure has a neighborhood of a basis of neighborhoods of the identity consisting of conditions that tell you that some point has to go to some union of antipodal intervals in Intervals in the circle rather than some small interval, maybe around that same point. Okay, so one thing we prove is that if a structure we have a couple of results of this flavor, but I guess the most important particular case is that if you have a flash class with the free amalgamation property, Amalgamation property such that the action of G on the limit is transitive, so there's no distinction between points, then the Zariski topology is not a group topology. And the reason is that you can show that solution sets of non-trivial group equations over G are meager with respect to the standard topology. As a consequence, you get that for any countable. That for any countable subgroup of G, there exists an infinite countable rank free group such that the group generated by A, and this free group F is actually the free product of A and F. Okay, so what is some actually deep result on this question of minimalities? This is due to Open Yakov and Sankov. And it was originally stated in the context of context of um of um continuous logic so there you have not uh so so predicates are not like um are not zero one valued right so they are not set theoretical predicates but rather uniformly continuous functions to zero one so there are there's a con a continuum of of truth values let's say but i i will restrict to to to the classical case so um so you have So, you have a. There are some terms here I haven't introduced, but I will introduce it immediately afterwards, or at least make an overview. So, suppose G is a automorphism group of a stable omega categorical structure. Then I should say, there's a mistake in this slide, G with the standard topology is totally minimal. So, M is the metric topology, and this is the topology which is totally minimal in the general. Totally minimal in the general context, but in this context, it restricts to the summary problem. Okay, so what does this conditions mean? What is omega categoricity? So this is the theory, so the set of first order sentences satisfied by a structure is omega-categorical if we. Omega categorical if one of the two conditions is satisfied, it's two equivalent conditions. So there's a unique isomorphism types of countable structures satisfying the theory. And the one that interests us the most is that for any k, the diagonal action of g on the k's Cartesian product of the universe of the structure, sorry, another typo here, has finitely many orbits. Has finitely many orbits. So, in particular, our ultra-homogeneous structures are omega-categorical if the language is finite. So, how is this relevant to the proof of this result? So, in these circumstances, you can, there's a so-called relationship. Relke compactification of the group, right? Which doesn't quite have per se much of a structure. It interacts with some other compactifications, some other objects, but in itself, in this context of generality, it doesn't have much of a structure. But when you add this other condition, this model theoretical condition, which is stability, which probably I shouldn't follow. Probably I shouldn't bother to define here, then this confers a topological semi-group structure to this compact space. And then their result follows from some analysis that establishes a correspondence between the topological quotients of the group and identical importance in this space, which, by the way, has a very nice model theoretical interpretation. Theoretical interpretation is the space of possible ways in which two copies of the structure can lie in relation to each other, if that makes any sense. Yeah, so this was our main inspiration for this work. And there are some natural questions. So can something be said in the context of non-stable homogeneous structures? Unstable homogeneous structures or even omega-categorical. And in particular, what about the automorphism group of some very, I say uncomplicated, I should say simple, but this has a technical meaning, so it's a bit some yeah, some some some fairly, I don't know, elementary, but not Elementary but not stable flush elements, as I say, like the random graph, right? It is not stable, but it is simple in the technical sense and in the non-technical sense. And finally, it's omega categoricity really essential, right? Their argument depends heavily on omega categoricity. So can something be said in the general context? And so we have. And so we have a couple of results, but some of them are a bit technical. So I will present the and there are variations on the one I'm going to present. So we have a relational trase class with the free amalgamation property. So then any group topology on the automorphism group of N, which is cost and The automorphism group of N, which is coarse than at the standard topology, is of the form, well, tau standard X. So it's a restricted standard topology. So in particular, if G acts transitively on M, then the only G invariant subsets of M are M and the empty set. So then G with the standard topology is totally minimal. So I will. So I will. I don't know how much time do I have. 10 more minutes? How much? 10 more minutes? All right. Maybe a bit more? 15? Is it? Yes, yes, maybe, maybe till 20 past, but. Okay, because I wanted to try to sketch the proof of this and then maybe. Sorry, this is a bit. I'm a bit rushed and making. And I'm making a bit of a mess. So I'm going to try to briefly sketch the proof of this result, which is actually quite simple and completely elementary. I will just stick to the case where the action is transitive. So let me establish some notation first. I will write this n tau of one to refer to the collection of neighborhoods of the identity. Of neighborhoods of the identity with respect to tau. And the first lemma that we have, again, assuming transitivity, is that either if you have some group topology on G, which is coarser than the standard topology, then either tau is equal to tau standard, or the following happens. This is a bit so for each B in M and for each finite. And for each finite subset A of M, and for each neighborhood of the identity in tau, there exists some group element in W such that P does not belong to GA. Okay. And the reason for this is that you can rewrite the second condition where instead of second condition where instead of asking B not to be in GA, you can you ask that GB is not in A. And then a counterexample for this would be a neighborhood for which any element, a neighborhood of the identity, so that any element there sends B to A, right? But then you can move A fixing B in such a way that you're moving it to some A prime. You're moving it to some a prime such that the intersection of a and a prime is at most p. This is by, let's say, free amalgamation, right? And then this would imply that the intersection of two conjugates of this neighborhood is contained in the stabilizer of P. So and from there you get that by transitivity that this is tau has to be equal to tau standard. Okay, and okay, the essential use of the The essential use of free amalgamation is in the following lemma. So if you have two finite subsets of M, then there's this bounded alternating product of the stabilizers of A and B, which is equal to the stabilizers of the intersection of these two subsets. Okay, so why is this, right? So okay, so I will write I will write A. I will write A isomorphism symbol B given to finite subsets of M if they are isom, you know, sorry, not to finite subsets, two finite tuples, if there is an automorphism sending one tuple to the other, right? Which is equivalent to the two tuples being isomorphic. Isomorphic. But I will write A congruent, sorry, A isomorphic to B over C if this can be done fixed in C. All right, so what are the two properties of free amalgamation that, well, of free independence that I'm going to use? So the first one is this. Suppose you have A0 and B0. A0, B0 and C tuples in M. 0 and C tape was in M and you have some finite tape in M and then you take some other some isomorphic copy of B somewhere else in the structure then you can extend this isomorphic copy of B to some to some pair AB sorry some this isomorphic copy of B0 to some pair AB in such a way that A is independent from B from C over B. C over B. This is the first property. And the other property is the following. So if you have two finite tuples in M and AB, and you call the intersection C and you have two copies of B, which I call B1 and B2. What I want to say. What do you want to say? All right, that are sort of so two conjugates of B over C that happen to be freely independent over C. So B1 is free from B2 over C, then you can complete, you can extend this C to another copy A prime of A. copy A prime of A such that the two pairs A prime B1, A prime B2 and AB are isomorphic. Or if you want, there are isomorphisms of automorphisms of the structure, taking each of them to each of the others, right? Okay, so how do you prove the lemma? So probably I don't have much time to go into the details, but so you time to go into the details but so you you um so you so you have some so the proof lemma reduces to the following so you you suppose you are given some a prime which is some copy of a over the intersection of of a and b right remember a and b are fixed in this lemma they are hidden in this lemma right so you want to find some So, you want to find some chain of alternating copies of A and B that takes you A to A prime. And so each consecutive pair in the chain has to be isomorphic to the original pair AB. If you do it, then you are done, because you can see that in this way, you can use some alternating products of stabilizers of A and B to move A to A prime and then. to to move a to a prime and then okay and then if if so since a prime is the image uh of a by any by by an arbitrary element in g of a intersection b this tells it tells you know this product of this alternating product acts on a the same way as as this element does and then this tells you that the two elements are the difference between these two elements is an element in the stabilizer of a An element in the stabilizer of A. So this generic element in the stabilizer of A intersection B is actually an alternating product of stabilizers of A and B, right? So how do you construct this chain? So the first thing you do is that you move B. So you pivot B, fixing A to some B0 in such a way that B0 is independent from A prime over A. Over A. And basically, the only thing that interests us here is that the intersection of P0 with A prime is exactly contains only the things that it needs to contain, namely the intersection of A and B. Right? Okay, this you can do by the first property of free independence I explained. And the second thing you do is you take a copy of B. You take a copy of B, so you move the pair. You take some B1 that sort of has the same that behaves with respect to A prime the same way B behaves with respect to A. And you can take it again by the first property independent of, so free from B0 over A prime, right? And by the choice of Right, and by the choice of B0, this guarantees that B1 and B0 are free from each other over the common intersection, which is precisely this constant A intersection B. Right? And then you use the second property of free independence to find this A1 that sort of completes the chain and joins B1 to B0. Okay, once you have that, Okay, once you have that, then you know that given any finite collection of finite sets, the stabilizer of the intersection, well, I should say it's equal to some alternating product of those sets, which is bounded. This is always the same product. The boundedness is always the same product, right? And then, and then, how do you finish the proof? So, suppose that you have some non-trivial group topology that is strictly courses on the standard topology. And then, if it is non-trivial, then there's some neighborhood of the identity such that the which is symmetric and such that the fifth power of it is not the whole group. Because the topology is coarser than the standard topology, there is some finite set A such that such. Such that g of a is contained in u zero. Fantastic. So now you pick an even smaller neighborhood of the identity such that which satisfies this condition. So this very large power of it is containing u zero. And you take some, you consider any b you know that there is some b such that the stabilization is some finite b such that the stabilized Some finite p such that the stabilizer of p is containing u1, right? And then the first lemma I explained at the beginning, so gives you some for each element of the A we chose before, it gives you some some G. So for any AI in A, it gives you some GI that moves B in such a way that it away from AI. So the image of GI by P does not contain AI. Gi by P does not contain AI, right? So then, if we consider the intersection of all these translates of P, then this has trivial intersection relay, right? And this allows you to finish the proof because then by the choice of U1, the stabilizer of this C is containing U0. And then this alternating product of GA and GC is continuous. A and G C has to be in the stabilizer of the empty set, which is the whole group, but on the other hand, it is contained in the fifth power of U0. So it is not, which we assume not to be the whole group. So there's a contradiction, right? And okay, this same argument holds in a more, well, more general setting, but probably it's better not to get there. Right, and to finish, probably, how many means... And to finish, probably, how many minutes do we have? Five minutes, two minutes? Two minutes. Two minutes, right? Okay, I hope that was more or less understandable. But we have some probably more interesting result which concerns the Eurison space that was mentioned earlier. Was mentioned earlier. So, when you have a metric space, then you can consider a different topology. So, this is the point-wise convergence topology, right? So, here, a basis of neighborhoods of identity is given by sets of the following form. You have a finite subset of your metric space and some positive epsilon. Positive epsilon. And then this neighborhood of the identity consists of all the genes which do not perturb any of the elements in this finite set by more than epsilon. Okay, what is as mentioned before, Eurison space is like a is very much like a frac limit. It can be constructed by a generalization of Generalization of the Frace Limit construction, and it's basically a separate metric space which is that contains any finite metric space as a subspace and also is homogeneous in the following sense that if you have two finite subsets of it which are two finite that are isomorphic we have to We have to sorry in place more geisometric, then there's an isometry of the whole space that sends one to the other. And then there's a variation on this of this object where you allow only distances that are between zero and one. This is the bounded Eurisian space. Okay, so it's a very beautiful theorem by Uuspensky that the isometric group of the The isometric group of the bounded Eurison spaces with this topology, I mean the point-wise convergence topology, is actually totally minimal. It does not admit any non-trivial group topology that is strictly coordinated out n, right? And then his proof again uses like this, well, the topological group version of omega categoricity, which is the relative compactness. Robert compactness. And so he asked, which is a property that does not hold for the isometric group of the unbounded Eurisian space, right? So he asked whether the same property holds for the unbounded Eurisian space. So we were able to answer this question. And in fact, we proved something slightly more precise. So we have also some generalization of this result to generalization of this result to um uh to Eurison spaces with distances in in with a more uh more general domain of distances like in general distance monoids with certain properties but um okay so what we prove for this for these two for the hurricane space and the boundary phase um is that there are exactly two non-trivial group topologies that are That are strictly coarser than the standard topology. One is the standard topology as defined before. So, one is this pointwise convergence topology I just mentioned, but there's one in between, which is where the basic neighborhoods of the identity are given as follows. So, you have two different points, and then This neighborhood of the identity consists precisely of those elements of the group which somehow respect the distance between x and y. So the distance between the translate of x by g and y is less than the distance of x and y. It's sort of like if x is in a certain If x is in a certain ball around y, then the image of x by g has to stay into that ball. And okay, probably I don't have time to try to argue why it probably is not worth it. Finish now, but thank you very much. Can I make just a remark and then I finish? Just 20 seconds. 20 seconds, if that's okay, or if not, I can. No, no, but I thought you were going to say it, so now please. Yeah, so the remark is that in many of these cases, automatic continuity is known for these groups. So this implies that, in fact, any how to How to say. Any separate group topology on the group has to be coarsest on the standard topology, or in okay, and one of these cases, the metric, the pointwise conversion topology. So for instance, it's a result by Signora and Solecki that if you have that this property holds for frach limit of limits of, I think, relational flash classes with the free amalgamation property. Right, so in that case, So, in that case, a combination of their result and ours tells you that there's like, you know, if the action is transitive, there's a unique separable group. The standard topology is the only separable group topology on the group. And a similar thing, a slightly weaker result is true for the automorphism group of dense linear order. And it is also known that the metric topology is the only separable. metric topology is the only separable sorry that the automatic continuity holds for the pointwise convergence topology in the case of the of the Eurison space and the bounded Eurison space so in that case in this case the combination of in this case Savok's result and our result tells you that well and Uspensky's result tells you that the point-wise convergence topology is the only separable group topology on the group okay and then Okay, and then here I'm done. Okay, so thank you very much. This is really very nice work, I think. Are there questions or comments?
