Thank you for the introduction. And also, I want to thank the organizer to invite me to speak here for this special occasion of Bill Castleman's 80th Birthday Conference. I learn from Castleman mostly by reading his papers and also hearing other people talking about his works. When I was a student, also, I benefited a lot from his famous lecture notes on the His famous lecture notes on the representation of PID groups. So, I wish him good health and happy birthday. So, I was asked to talk about Arthur's conjectures. So, I think I'll start with some history. So, Arsha conjecture is a set of conjectures concerning some fine structure of the automorphic spectrum. And I think they first appear in these two papers. The first one is on asterisk. On asterisk, where I formulate all these conjectures and their local and global ones. And in the second paper from the conference proceeding at the University of Michigan and Barber, he gave the motivation behind those conjectures. And they are mainly from the consideration of the trace formula, more precisely, the stable trace formula. Okay, and you may notice that in these two papers, In these two papers, the word unipotent automorphic representation shows up. So I think the rough idea is to mimic the Jordan decompositions for an element in an algebraic group that you want to kind of decompose an automorphic representation into a semi-simple part and a unipotent part. We'll be precise later. So let me introduce. So let me introduce some notations. K is a number field, A is the Del ring of K, gamma K is the epsilon Gala group, WK is the way group. Now, for simplicity, I'll take G to be a connected quasi-split reductive group. Although in Arthur's previous two papers, he actually treat more general G and even disconnected case. For this talk, we're going to consider automorphic representation to be the irreducible constituents of this. Irreducible constituents of this record representation on this L2 space. In particular, they will be all unitary. And we fix a central character, so Zg is the center of G, then we can decompose the Pissy equivariant version of the L2 space into a discrete part and a continuous part. And by Landland theory of Eisenstein series, one can understand the continuous part from the discrete part. Continuous part from the discrete part of the Levy subgroup for G. And from that perspective, it is essential to understand the discrete spectrum. And as I said, that Arsha's conjectures give a very fine structure for the discrete spectrum. But before introducing these conjectures, I'm just trying to motivate the ideas. To motivate the ideas, so I'll start with the global landlands correspondence, which is trying to parametrize these automatic representations. So on one side, we have the automatic representation of the data group, and on the other side, we have the global L parameters. And these are the homomorphisms from the hypothetical global landlands group, which we denote by LK, to the landlands dual group, Lg. Lg and we also model out the conjugation by the complex field group G hat. So this global Leynas group is conjectured to be the extension of the global wave group by some compact group. But we still don't know what this is. Arthur has some conjectures based on the functorality principle. Okay, but since we don't have the functority in general. We don't have the functority in general, so we still don't know what this group is. But, like the global weight group or Galois group, that you would expect it is equipped with homomorphisms from the local version, the local landlands group, into this global landlands group. And for this local landlands group, we do know that when the place is Arc Median, it is just the wave group, and at the non-Arc median, Way group and at the non-Archimedean place, it is the way group cross SU2. Now, with these maps from the local landlands group to the global landlands group, then we can obtain local landlands parameters from the global ones at all places. And in particular, at those unramified places, we have the static parameters on the automotive representation side. The automatic representation side, and then we want them to match up with the image of Rubenius for the Lenand parameter. And you can think that's how we categorize this correspondence. We also have the local Landland correspondence, which is in a more precise form. It is actually a map from the irreducible admissible representations of G. Of G now at this local field Kb and the map to the local landlands parameters. And since we have assumed that G is quasi-speed, this is going to be subjective. And again, when this representation is unramified, you want the static parameter to match up with the image of the Fourius. One way to think about this local Landland correspondence is that it gives a partition of the set of irreducible representations. Of irreducible representations in terms of this packet parametrized by the land length parameters. Okay, so for each local land length parameter, we'll have a finite subset of irreducible representations, and these are called L packets. Since we have both local and global correspondence, it's natural to ask if there is some local global compatibility. Global compatibility. So, start from a global landline parameter, we get these local landlines parameter, and we have the local L packets from the local landline correspondence. Then we can take the restricted tensor product and form a global L packet. A natural question is: Does this global L packet contain all the automorphic representation corresponding to this global land length parameter? Global land length parameter from the global land length correspondence. The answer is no. And this comes from the famous count example to the generalized Ram Newton conjecture given by Roger Howe and Pieteski Shapiro in the Corvatis proceeding. So, in this paper, they constructed a cospital automorphic representation of SP4, which is super cospital at one place. At one place, and for almost all places, it is the same as a representation induced from an automobic representation of a Levy subgroup. In fact, that Levy subgroup is a Taurus. And in that case, the global parameter will fax the Levy subgroup, and in particular, it will fax the Levy subgroup at all places. But as we know, that for a supercaspital representation, the Lennon parameter doesn't vex to any Levy subgroup. To any levy subgroup, and that's why the classical automobile representation if constructed does not belong to or does not course does not belong to the L packet of this global parameter. And I think it is one of the reasons to kind of fix this that Arsa introduces his A packets. And roughly speaking, these A packets is enlargement. A packets is enlargement of these global L packets to try to capture these representations shows up in these counterexamples. So that's the motivation. Now we're going to formulate these conjectures in two parts. The first part concerning the eight parameters. So when we talk about the global landmarks correspondence, on one side, you can see the other. On one side, we can see the other global parameters. But this conjecture says that not all global parameters will be corresponding to some automorphic representations as we defined in the beginning. So in this L2 space, it will be only those parameters, which is described in terms of A parameters. And these A parameters, just like the Landland parameter, so they are homomorphisms from this hypothetical global Landland group. Hypothetical global landline group, but now we add in SL2C. And the critical condition is that we want the image of LK to be bonded. Okay. So for general global landline parameter, we don't have that condition. And it is because of that we can embed the set of A parameters into the set of L parameters by taking this map. Okay. So probably you have seen this in yesterday's Cunningham's talk, but that's very similar. But that's a so that's very similar. And the absolute value is induced from the absolute value on the weight group. And I think this is already striking, even though we haven't introduced a packet yet, because as we said, that in general, the landline parameter can be unbounded. But this actually tells you how it can be unbounded. It's something very rigid. It's just controlled by this SL2C. And I think the motivation. Okay, and I think the motivation from this SO2C is from considering the cohomology of Shimmer variety, where you have a commuting action by the Kara group and the HECA operator, but now you can also introduce the Left Schedule SO2 action. But I think this conjecture goes beyond those cohomological representations. So, and yeah, so I think it's very, very striking. It's very, very striking. And just like the global landline correspondence, now we can start from an A parameter and get the local A parameter at our places. Then the second part is about A packet. It says that for any local A parameter, one can associate a finite set of unitary reducible admissible representation satisfying the properties. Satisfying the properties that first of all it should contain the corresponding L packets. So, as we said, that these A parameters can be viewed as a subset or they map into a subset of Landland parameters. So, this Kai will correspond into a Landland parameter. And we want this A packet to be an enlargement of the Landland packet. And secondly, when you form the global A packet, just by taking the tensor. Just by taking the tensor product of the local ones, we want this to contain all the automorphic representation corresponding to cosine under the global Lennon correspondence. Okay, so that's the A packet, roughly speaking. I think from these two conjectures, you should think the A packet is really made to kind of capture the automorphic representations. Representations. And later we'll see where this global A packet comes from. And then you should think this local A packet is simply obtained by taking the local component of the global A packet. So for me, the local nature of these A packets are very mysterious because they seem to come to help to classify the automorphic representations, but locally they just But locally, they're just a finite set, slightly larger than the L packet. The L packet kind of classified the representation for the local groups. But what is the role of this local A packet? So in yesterday, Kanninghan's talk, he gave a description of this local A packet in terms of the micro-local geometry for the modularized space of local Leyman parameters. And if that is true, then And if that is true, then I think it's even more hyper how this microgogeometry stuff is related to automorphic representations. Yeah, so I think these are very intriguing questions. And for Arthur's conjectures, actually, even he go further to describe or to distinguish the automorphic representation within this packet. Okay, so here we just say that it contains all the automorphic. We just say that it contains all the automorphic representations, but actually, some of them are not. And to go further, we're going to impose this assumption just to simplify the illustration. Okay. So now we want to look into this A packet to distinguish the automorphic representations. And so look, so we'd like. And so, so we like to parametrize the representation in the A packet. And locally, what we do is we define this finite, define a finite group, which is to take the centralizer of the local A parameter, and we modulo the center of the dual group and take its Gauva invariant. And then we take the component group, the component group. Okay. And can you actually, there's a map from this local A packet to the set. This local A packet to the set of representations of this component group, and when this representation is unramified, we want this to correspond to a trivial representation of the component group. We can also define the global, oh, by the way, so even though the idea is to parametrize the elements in this packet, but this map in general is neither injective nor subjective. And then we can also define the global analog. also define the global analog. So first of all, the global component group will map into, no, will map to the local component group. It's not going to be injective in general since we're taking the component group. And then we can define the map from the global A packet to the representations of this global component group by simply taking the tensor product of the local ones. And this makes sense because for almost all places, the local ones are trivial. The local ones are trivial. And finally, we're going to restrict to the discrete spectrum since, as we said in the beginning, that the continuous part can be categorized in terms by the discrete spectrum for the Lebesgue subgroups. And for the discrete spectrum, they are parametrized by a subset of eight parameters subjecting to this finiteness condition. And now we can formulate a conjecture. This is called. Formulated conjecture. This is called the multiplicity formula conjecture. And from this conjecture, we can see the criteria for distinguishing the automobile representation in the A packet. So we choose a unitary irreducible representation of the ideal group with the central character C, and we ask what's the multiplicity for this representation in the discrete spectrum. And the answer is that it is. That it is given as a sum of multiplicities contributed by these global A parameters. And for each global parameter, you will get zero if the representation is not in the global A packet. And if it's in the A packet, then you further need to look at the multiplicity of certain sign character associated with this casi and inside this epsilon pi that associated that is associated with this pi. Associated with this pipe. So, in particular, if you just fix an A packet and choose a representation in that package, and you want to ask whether this is automorphic or not. And it is this condition that you want to look at. And this sign character seems to be very mysterious, and we'll give the definition in a moment. So, so far, are there any questions? Okay, so now I want to talk about where do the a packet come from? Because they actually could be slightly larger than just considering automorphic revision. Just considering orthomorphic representations. So they come from the invariant trace formula. So the invariant trace formula is an equality of two invariant distributions of very different kinds. And one is called geometric, and it consists of orbital integrals and also weighted orbital integrals. And the other spectral, it consists of the characters and more generally weighted characters. On the spectral side, you can You can distinguish a so-called discrete part of the trace formula. And it is slightly larger than just the discrete spectrum. So it's a sum over the rational Levy subgroup, where this Wm is the relative wow group, and it will act on this AMG, which can be thought as the Lie algebra of the central spitauri module G, modulus center of G. V, modular center of V, and this regularity is to require the determinant to be non-zero. And most importantly, is this trace where we take the induced representation from the discrete spectrum of the Levy subgroup, and we compose with a global intertwining operator. And when m equals to g, we just get the discrete spectrum. But there are also things coming from the continuous spectrum. Then the stabilization is to write this invariant distribution in terms of stable distributions on all the elliptic endoscopic groups of G. And since we want to compare this distribution on various different groups, we need the Lehman-Schaft transfer to let us transfer a function on G to H. Now, on the right-hand side Now, on the right-hand side, you see these stable distributions. And how are they defined? So, in fact, you have the turn h equal to g on the right-hand side. And you can just define that using this equality. So, it is the disquiet part of the trace formula subtracting the sum of stable distributions on the endoscopic group H when H is not equal to G. When edge is not equal to g. And so you can think inductively, you can define this stable distribution on edge. Then the upshot of this stabilization is to show that this difference is actually a stable distribution. And this is by no means obvious because the Land and Schauster transfer is defined in terms of orbital integrals. And here these are spectral. These are spectral. And not surprisingly, that to prove something like this, you need to look at their geometric expansions. So I think that's the right idea. Okay. And once you have shown this, then you have a stable distribution built out of the discrete part of the trace formula. Then you would like to ask, what is this distribution in terms of representation? In terms of representations. And the conjecture is that it gives you the global A packet. So, this is called the stable multiplicity formula. It says that you can decompose this stable distribution. It's parametrized by the global A parameters. And for each A parameter, you can associate a stable distribution. And there's also a constant. Okay, now for this constant multiple, first of all, you have already seen the component group, and it's a finite group. You have also seen this character appearing in the multiplicity formulas. And there's also another constant. So this constant only depends on this group, which is a complex reduction group. Okay, so. Okay, so this S bar casi is just the centralizer of the parameter in the dual group, modulo the center of the dual group. And you take Gabriel invariant. So this is the group that we have seen, and we take the identity component. This constant is to define this constant is a little bit delicate. this constant is a little bit delicate but the point is that it only depends on it only depends on this group not the parameter that to say so and in particular when this casi is in the is discrete which means that it parametrized the discrete spectrum then we have the condition that s cosi bar is finite The S cosi bar is finite, so the identity component is trivial. So, in that case, this constant doesn't show up. And then for the stable distributions, contractory is factorized into a product of the local stable distribution. And the local stable distribution is going to be a linear combination of irreducible characters on this A packet. On this A packet. And by the linear independence of these characters, you can say that this packet is actually determined by this local stable distribution. Okay. And finally, I want to talk about the sign character. To record a definition of the sign character, we first take the global A parameters and then shoot a joint representation of To a joint representation of the Landlands dual group on its Lie algebra, we can have a representation of this triple product from the Lie algebra of the dual group. And we can decompose this into irreducible representations. So this lambda i is the representation of the centralized of G hat, and this mu i is a representa irreducible representation of this L K and mu i is a reduced representation of S O to C. Representation of SO2C. Now, since we're taking the joint representation, it preserves the killing form. So, in particular, this representation is self-due of orthogonal type. Then we consider those irreducible constituents, which are called special, meaning it is self-due by itself. And also, when you look at the root number for mu i, it's minus one. And since we know And since we know, so since this μ i is self-dual, so this root number is either one or minus one. And the condition that this is minus one implies that this is of symplatic type. And finally, this character is defined by taking the product of determinant for this lambda i. So this lambda i is also going to be self-due. So the determinant is either one or minus one. Minus one and and so this character will actually affect through the component group of the centralizer of the parameter. Okay, and in this definition of this character, you see this very curious this sympathetic loot number appearing here. So you may wonder where do we get this condition. So in fact, if you go back and see If you go back and see that this character shows up in the stabilization of the trace formula. And in the trace formula, since we're taking the discrete part, there the global intertwining operator also showed up there. And in fact, this condition on the sympathetic root number comes from the normalizing factors of the global intertwining operator. And finally, I think this is maybe the most technical part: is how we get the map from the local A packet to the set of representation of these local component groups. And that is given by the endoscopic character relations. And to describe that, we take a semi-simple element in the centralizer of the local parameter, and then we take the And then we take the centralizer of this element in the dual group and take the identity component, and that gives a complex connective data group. We can further make it into an L group by considering this short exile sequence. Now, in general, this is not going to be an L group, and we need to take a Z extension. So, but let's just assume that we'll get an L group. And then we'll get two groups, G and H. And also, the parameter for G affects to the. And also the parameter for G affects through a parameter for H. And the character relation is the relation between the characters, it's a relation between distributions on H and G. So on H, we take a stable distribution associated with the A parameters for H. And on G, we take a linear combination of irreducible characters on this packet. And it is these coefficients. And it is these coefficients give the map or determine the map from the packet to the setup representation of the local component. Okay. Okay. So this is the end of the introduction to Arthur's conjectures. Are there any questions? Okay. Okay. I think since these conjectures are proposed, there have been a lot of developments. And since this is a very large set of conjectures, there are local ones and the global ones. So yeah, I'm not able to list all the developments. So maybe this is mostly focused on the global aspect. And also in Arsa's original formulation, he included in the forms. He included in the forms. So, here we also include in the forms. So, for example, for GON, we know this is due to McGunnen-Bospeshi. And also, we also know the case for in the forms to these two people. And also for classical groups, that's due to Arthur. But for the inner form case, we don't have a complete knowledge yet. But there are some related work, like, say, by Taiyi Pi, Wei Chuan, and Jia Liang Zhou. And also for unitary group. And also for unitary groups, it goes back to Rogowski, the case of U3 and also Mark, and also Khalisa Minkette, Shing White in the form. And also this GSP4 by Geetaibi. And also there are some results for MG2 for the non-temporal spectrum by Gen, Guruvich, Jan, and Gen. Again. And finally, for the case of metoplatic group, although it does not fit into the original setup of Arthur's conjecture, these are not the algebraic groups. But again, you can formulate similar conjectures like Arthur's. And this has been proved by again and etrino. And finally, I want to mention that in Arthur's original formulation, he's treating like one form at a time. Form at a time, but Tashu Kalisa gave a kind of enhanced formulation by putting all the forms together. And to be able to have a nice description, you need to add in auxiliary data. So these are called the global rigid inner forms. Okay. And so over years, I've been working on extending arsours. Working on extending Arthur's work for the sympathetic and orthogonal groups and try to extend that to the similitude group. So, maybe in the last few minutes, I'll talk about that. Yeah, so we take G to be the sympathetic or even orthogonal groups, and G tilde is the similitude groups. So, they are defined as the group of linear automorphisms preserving the sympathetic or orthogonal forms up to a scalar. Up to a scalar. And because of that, you have a short exact sequence. And this lambda is called the similitude character. In the simplest case, you can take G to be SP2 or just SL2, and then G tilde is GL2. And this lambda is just a determinant map. And in fact, this project is highly influenced by the work of Landland Lafayette when they try to uh think do the uh to classify the or to categorize the discrete spectrum of SO2 using GO2 and that's also the beginning of the endoscopy theory but here we're going the other direction so we're going to take what we know for the the sympathetic orthogonal groups and we want to kind of upgrade to the similitude groups so on the dual side So, on the dual side, we also have a short exact sequence, and the dual group for this symmetric group is the G-spin group, and it will project onto the dual group for G. And through this projection, we can have a subjection from the global parameters of G tilde to that of G. Now, to be able to prove something about Arsa's condition. Prove something about RSOS conjectures. The first problem you meet is: how can you define this set of global parameters? Because we don't know the global land length group. And in Arsha's work, what he does is he take the standard representation of the orthogonal group to GONC and through this, he can embed the set of In fact, the set of global parameters for G into the set of global parameters for GON. And on the automorphic side, this corresponding to the automorphic, the front-ray lifting from the automorphic representation of G to GON. And that has been established by RSU. Now, there's a little subtlety here because you may already notice that I put this bar for the status. Put this bar for the set of global parameters of G, and that accounts for the conjugation by the four orthogonal groups. Okay. When this G is even orthogonal. But maybe we can, this is just a bit more technicality and you can just forget that for simplicity. Okay. And so that's how Arthur. How Arthur described this global packet, this set of global parameters, which is eventually in terms of automatic representation of GON. Now, if you want to do something similar, then you'd like to take a representation of the G-spin group where this C cross will act as a scalar multiplication. But in those cases, we don't know the font valuing, and that's beyond endoscopy. So instead, what we do. So instead, what we do is we just parametrize the set of global parameters for G tilde by that of G. And also we need to describe the fiber. And the fiber emits a transitive action by the quadratic Del class characters. Then the final conjecture that we're trying to establish is as follows. So for any global parameter discrete, Global parameter discrete for this G, we like to show there exists a global A packet for G tilde, and it's going to be unique up to twist by the quadratic characters. And it decomposes into a product of local wave packets. And furthermore, you have this decomposition for the discrete spectrum. And in this first two steps, And in this first two sums, they really corresponding to the summation for the global A parameters for G tilde. And the last part is exactly the same as you have seen in our first multi-piece formula conjecture. And what we know now is this conjecture holds for the discrete part, for the temporal part. More precisely, it is for those A parameters which are trivial. Parameters which are trivial on SL2. And indeed, I proved this result earlier in the special case when this cassi-tilter, the component group is trivial. But now we can remove that assumption. So as long as cassi is trivial in SO2, we have this decomposition. Now I want to talk about how to go to a non-temper case. How to go to a non-temper case, okay, the general case. And the first step is to construct this local A packet. And I'll just focus on the PiaD case. And so now everything's local. We take a local A parameter for G tilde. It projects to a local parameter for G. Now you take the component group after psi. Of Kasai, and it is known that this is a two-group. And we also have a natural inclusion from the component group of Kasai tilter into the component group for Kaisai, which means that the component group for Kasai Tilta is also a two-group. So it's very simple. Previously, we have seen that there's a map from the packet to the setup representation of the component group. And in this case, one can further show that the image consists of irreducible. The image consists of irreducible representations, and this is due to Magellan, and it's usually referred to as the multiplication one result for this A packet. Now, the idea for constructing the A packet for the symmetry groups is you take all the irreducible representations of G tilde with restriction to G are contained in this A packet. So that's the right idea. And it is going to be a subset of this set. Of this set. And also, we can define a map of, so we want to have a map from the packet to the representation of the component group. And now we can even define a map for this set. And they define as follows. So you can take an irreducible representation here and you restrict to G and you take any irreducible constituent and that will give rise to a character of character of the component group for Si and then you restrict to Si tilted and the fact that this definition is independent of the choice of pi is from the endoscopic character relation for casi which has already been proved by Arthur okay so you have a well-defined map so the final theorem is that Is that there exists a subset of the set we have seen that first of all, if you sum over this set and you restrict to G, that will give you the sum of representation in the packet. And the secondly, you can form a stable distribution as just conjectured by Arthur. And thirdly, you have the endoscopic character relation for G tilt. And again, I've already proved this earlier in the case when Pasai is trivial on SL2. But now we can have the general case. You may wonder whether this set of this A packet is unique or not. So here we just say there exists a subset. And in fact, we can prove something more, which is not just for the Which is not just for the, these are the endoscopic calculations. We can also prove a twisted version. And the twist is coming from the twist by characters on the representation of G tilde. So there's this similitude characters on G tilde. Yeah, so okay. And once you combine also the And once you combine also the twisted end of the scopic character relations, then you can further show that this packet that we mentioned here is going to be unique after twisted by quadratic characters. Okay. Are there any questions for the serum? Okay, maybe in the last. Okay, maybe in the last or four minutes, I'll talk about the ideas behind the theorem. And already you've seen that from the first requirement, you just want to take some representation of G tilde whose restriction belong to the packet 4G. And the way to choose this representation is first you would like to fix the central character. Okay. But fixing the central character does not determine this packet because you can always. In this packet, because you get always twisted by some quadratic characters and they won't train to the central character, which means that you need some strong kind of invariant. So the idea is you take, you consider the infinitesimal character of the representations. And here we define them to be the infinitesimal character for the landlands parameters, which you have already seen in Clifton Tunny Han's talk yesterday. Yesterday, so it's defined in the same way, but to define this infinitesimal character, you would require the local landline correspondence. So to do this, previously we are able to associate a landline parameter for this G tilde with an L packet only unique up to twisted by quadratic characters. So there's an ambiguity. And to be able to define an ambient character, we are going to make a choice of this corresponding. To make a choice of this correspondence, and we impose further conditions that the parabolic induction will preserve the infinitesimal character. And the meaning of this is the following proposition. So you start with the Levy subgroup of G tilde and you pick up infinitesimal character. Then you induce the representation on this Levy subgroup whose infinitesimal character is this one. Then any irreducible constituent of this induced representation of the result of the result The irreducible constituent of this induced representation will have the infinitesimal character given by the infinitesimal character in the Levy subgroup through this embedding. Okay, and this kind of statement is due to Haynes. And in the case of classical groups, this has to be proven by Muslim. But here, we're kind of taking this as a criterion to build up this correspondence. And once we impose the condition. And once we impose the conditions on infinitesimal characters, so we can restrict the set of irreducible representations with respect to the fixed infinitesimal character, and this correspondence is given by a restriction. In the special case, when the fiber over the set of irreducible representation of G are singletons, which means that you have no choice once you know what the restriction is, then you can just define the packet. Then you can just define the packet by imposing this condition on infinitesimal character. And that's the easy case. And also, you can prove all the theorems about stability and the endoscopy character relations. And the essential input is the previous proposition. Unfortunately, in general, this is not going to be always the case. And in general, what we do is to extend the Mergland's construction of this A packet using. Of this a packet using induction and restriction, and we extend that to g tilt. And that construction essentially reduced to the temporal case where we already know how to construct the packet. Yeah, and that's very long and technical, and that occupies the most part of the paper. So I think I run out of time, so I'll stop here. Thank you.
