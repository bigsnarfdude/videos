Even in this non-semi-simple categories, huge categories, we can have some smaller subcategories which are semi-simple. So this can happen. But here, when we speak about logarithmic models, they are super non-semi-simple. So they are really objects which are totally not semi-simple and which are hard to construct. And now I will try to. And now I will try to present some methods and some new development about these topics. So, okay. So, and Simon talks, a lot of definition were presented. So, any case, let me start briefly. We start from with a VOA, vertex operator algebra. We have vertex operator map. operator map and and and this so this omega is a virus or a sort of vector so when we have vertex operator out there and we can look at any weak way module so weak model is so so without any limitation so we take anything it can be with a very very complicated module but we always have action of the virus or algebra so by using   operator algebra every which module is logarithmic when we when we go beyond beyond c to cofinite algebra we have we have modules we which are not logarithmic but somehow we are here we are now interesting in this logarithmic representation and then Presentation. And then one notion which we know from linear algebra somehow, this is called also Jordan decomposition. So we have that M has nil potent rank M if so we take we have this L zero and then this L zero takes semi-simple part of this L zero. So if L zero minus L semi-simple part to the power of M is zero and M minus N L L zero minus this semi-simple part 0 minus this semi-simple part to the power m minus 1 is not 0. So this is the notion of an ill potential rank m. So problem is how to solve, how to construct such modules and how to see which kind of logarithmic modules we can get some. As I mentioned, this is very, very, very, very non-semi-simple representation. Representation. Okay? And logarithmic models are connected with logarithmic conformal field theory and with vertex operator algebra in this logarithmic conformal field theory. So I started to look at these cases maybe 15, 16 years ago. So and we had a lot of discussion. And we had a lot of discussion with Semihatov, who visited Croatia and so on. You need to construct logarithmic models. So essentially, then somehow we detected this logarithmic modules in Vagin Semihatov and others, Kaush Gabardiel, and so on. But the problem was how to construct this logarithmic. Construct this logarithmic representation. So it's a person work with Anton, Abe, Arike, Naga, Tomo, Simon, Sushia, Ganon, Kroitsi, Grido, and others working in this logarithmic conformal field theory frame. And what we will hear at the conference, there is important connection with projective models of four quantum groups. Morris of our quantum group. So I think it appears in AZAT talk, Samuel Lendner, and other talks. It should appear similar objects which appear on the quantum group side. Somehow this Kajan-Lushi correspondence is one good motivation to study such objects in VOS side. So, what is also very non-semi-simple, so we need to advertise a non-semi-simple approach. Not semi-simple approach. So logarithmic modules can be interpreted as twisted, somehow it can be related as twisted module for non-semi-simple vertex operator algebra automorphism. So this is the notion introduced by Yiji Huang maybe 12 years ago, and somehow it's very, very related. And the problem of logarithmic construction of logarithmic logarithmic construction of logarithmic model is somehow difficult, difficult, but the same difficulties are in the construction of certain kind of twisted model for vertex operator algebra. Somehow, if we understand more twisted model for this non-semisimple automorphism, we can have a nice relation, nice realization of logarithmic model. Somehow, this is the good way for research, and that way we can think on these logarithmic modules inside of axiomatic vertex operator algebra theory. And one thing that was surprising, essentially, that this existence of logarithmic modules are usually long-standing conjectures. conjectures. But it is very essentially very difficult to realize in the current literature when such conjecture is proven and how it is. So what happened? What happened? I remember for Triple story, it was, we first proved it to cofinateness. And like Simon says, and his thought for PP prime. So for pp prime triplet also, C2 cofiniteness is known, but it's very hard to construct in all such for such logarithmic models all logarithmic representation and difficult to decide if we will get all. And what are methods? What are our methods? Methods here using, so there are various methods depending on the vertex operator algebra. Operator algebra. One good method is Jules algebra theory. Jules algebra theory. And what happened, for example, for triplet? With Jules algebra, we have complete description of the Jules algebra. Even now, one student described first the Jules algebra for triplet algebra, Nanteceparic recently, but somehow, even with higher... Even with hydrogenous algebra, you cannot detect all logarithmic models. So use just detect them all. Somehow, a more reliable method is this Kajan looks to correspondence, but this is still conjectural approach. So on the quantum group side, we can see much, much clearer logarithmic module, but then we need to work hard on the VOS side to consider. We are a site to construct them. And last approach is maybe not so dramatic, but explicit lattice free-filled realization of logarithmic models. So this is one approach somehow which go beyond this Jules theory or modular invariance theory, but what is good with this we really get theorems. we really get theorems theorems of voice so this is when you when you get when you construct a representation you you have theorem that such such logarithmic representation exists okay let me just let me just so this i will give two slides which are well known well known but that but just to see that this is really really fact now one can prove this very easily so take take this one ev evil vector This one even vector. I will take here commutative even vector, but it can be more general, but let us be commutative, which is primary, primary for the virusaur of weight one. It must be weight one to get screening operator. And then we use this delta operator, studied by Heisheng, by Yirji. And so we use this delta operator, which appears also in lattice construction. Lattice lattice construction, but usually for this non-semi-simple, but here we don't assume that this v0 is semi-simple, so it can be arbitrary. So we have such expression. We have such expression, and we proved with Antun that if we start from any weak V module, any weak V model in Selecta 2009. So, if we have vector satisfying condition before, and if we start with any weak module, and then in this vertex operator, define new module, we insert this delta function, with delta operator before, sorry. Sorry, we insert this delta operator and we get new. And we get new representation, but not it won't be usually a representation for whole VOA. It will be a representation of sub-VOA, which is contained in the kernel of this screening operator. And then in this relatively simple way, we construct a logarithmic model. So if this V0 is not actually semi-simple, we automatically get. we automatically get get logarithmic logarithmic model so this is fact and this is theorem so we really have we really have and question is how to apply this and why it can be difficult to to apply such such result in general and what what what is application so what is what is application application is Application is essentially based on the very simple observation. So, take U be any vertex operator algebra and M be any module and then we can form this semi-direct product of the vertex algebra with module and get VOA. We need to add them. M has integral eigenvalues of L0. And then take screen. And then take screening operator and then take kernel of the screening operator. And that way, I assume that we get our so we are not interesting in this V, in this large. We are interesting in this V bar. And this logarithmic V bar model can be constructed using previous theorem. So just in the case, what do we need? We need V A. What do we need? We need VA, we need screening operators. But what is interesting here in application of such theorem that it's not somehow one needs some kind of free-filled realization in order to get such representation. So one can start from some unique. One can start from some universal object and so, but it's hard to prove the existence of this logarithmic representation starting from this universal. But fortunately, for all important vertex operator algebra, we already have this free field realization, like from the triplet, then we have super triplet, logarithmic extension of minimal models. So then F and V O A. For F and V O A, it's very nice that we can also construct logarithmic models using this algorithm. And now we will present some new application, some new application using this recent work with Thomas and now Kijenra. We find some new free filial realization for which we For which we were able to construct many logarithmic representations. Okay? Okay, and then next. So as I mentioned, F and VOA is one example we need. Now we will switch to this F and setting for F and VOA. And since the topic is semi-simple versus not. Semi-simple versus non-semi-simple categories. Let me just give some state of the art in this case. So we start from simple least super algebra. Take affinization and then consider universal F and V O A of level K. And this is it it has nice high realization, it's highest rate model from F only algebra. Finely algebra and beyond, except for critical level, we have simple quotient, unique simple quotient, but taking a simple quotient. And then we have Virasoro vector obtained by the Sugavara construction formula for this Sugavara central charge. So we have universal VOA and simple VOA. Universal is definitely not. universal is definitely not semi-simple we can easily find representation question is what is happening with the simple with with the simple via in this in this case and uh and uh let me just uh so so what is what is first category what what we are interested is this category of ordinary module for vertex operator algebra which is also Algebra, which is also known as Kazaluski category, because Kajaluski started this work almost 30 years ago. So, and then we have this Kazal-Lushik. We will now define essentially three Kazjal-Lushi category. So, we have Kajal-Lushi category for the representation of universal vertex algebra K up. Algebra K up. And then keyword is here that Lie algebra G or Lie super algebra G X locally finite. This category depends relatively larger. We use notion of this subcategory of category all defined in Maria Gorellic and Victor Katz settings a little bit larger. And then And then we consider category K, category of model for the simple, simple vertex algebra, vertex super algebra, which are in the category KLK. So, and this is very nice for Lie algebra. For Lie algebra, it's very nice. But for Lie super algebra, we need to find something more precise because More precise because in the super algebra case we have non-semi-simple finite dimensional representation, we all know. And we introduce category in super case category KLK category KLKFIN consisting of the module in KLK which are weight module. And in the relatively long project with Katz Mossed and Herpappe in Persia, the proof Papi and Pershe. The pro semi-simplicity semi-simplicity result for such category. And it is very nice category for applying tensor product theory. Recently, Thomas and Ginway published a nice paper about tensor category of model for this scale for T-scale K model. So this is about the case. And just to see. The case and just to see, just to see what is the state of the art, and in this algebra case, we don't have nice example when this scale k is not semi-simple, when k is simple Lie algebra, but we cannot prove that. We cannot prove that. And this is one nice conjecture to try to prove exactly when KLK is semi-simple. We can prove this for so-called collapse. We can prove this for so-called collapsing level. And in the case when Vk minimal f and w algebra is rational. And maybe one can take that this is semi-simple also. So this is in Lie algebra case. But if we copy this in Lie super algebra case, so there are problems to proving this in this category KLK, and then we in supercase, supercase. In supercase, supercase we only prove R-Love-Motorum for this category of weight model in this K-Fin. This category that this is collapsing and when we get minimal F and W algebra is rational, then we can prove semi-simplicity of this smaller category. But what is interesting here, what is interesting here that Here, that in supercase, we can very easily find examples when they are not semi-simple. So, if you want to have some nice category, non-semi-simple look in supercase. For example, SLN1. For SLN1 and K is positive integer, one can show that there is highest rate model which are not irreducible. So, this category is very non-semi-simple. This category is very simple, and still now. This category is very simple, and still now we have this open, open, nice, open problem. How to find for which k will have a semi-simple category, for which k no. And in this supercase, it seems that there are many, many interesting non-semi-simple category. Okay. And then, and then now, so in order to go, as I mentioned for Lie algebra case, it's hardly to expect that we can get any. Expect that we can get anything non-semi-simple for this category of ordinary model, we need to go beyond this category. We need to go beyond category and we need to look at some weak models which are non-semi-simple. But in order to construct this, we apply a new approach using a realization, some kind of Realization, some kind of free field realization, which is in some cases exactly free field realization. In some cases, there's some shifted free field realization with some W algebra. In that case, let me just say briefly, what we want to do, take any new potent element and k and using And K, and using quantum Hamiltonian reduction, we can have universal WF and W algebra studied by Katsukimoto, Frankel, Tomoyuki, and Thomas Nauke and others. So this is very and now very well developed area. So, but essentially, So, but essentially, they are defined using quantum reduction. But in this talk, I'm not interested so much in W algebra. I'm interested in affine algebra. So, W algebra somehow generally should be complicated. But in our story, we will take this W algebra to be somehow a step understanding. Understanding affinely algebra, so somehow we are aware of this importance for us. For us, we will somehow try to use something known, something which is easier for W algebra to construct something like logarithmic representation, logarithmic representation for affine vertex algebra. Okay, and then, but we are not interested in universal, we are interested in seeing. In universal, we are interested in simple W algebra. And by inverse of quantum Hamiltonian reduction, we mean that we should embed this simple affine algebra, LKOG, into tensor product of some affine W algebra, tensor with some free field algebra, some algebra which we need to specify. We need to specify it. And we recently studied this, and also they are studied by David, Kazuya, Thomas, Nauki, and Zach, and for algebras, also Rang and some others, maybe. So this is our approach. Our approach. For us, this free-field algebra, free-field realization will be somehow tensor product of or product of affine w algebra with some free field algebra. And is it easier than consider a final algebra as quotient of universal? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. But it is much more useful for constructing certain type of representation. This is much more useful for constructing This is much more useful for constructing a relaxed module, for correcting for constructed logarithmic models. So, for logarithmic module, this is ideal. You will see how from this kind of realization, we can get logarithmic representation. Okay. And now I want to describe what is this free-filled algebra. And Simon, before dinner, a really nice explain. Nice explain, start in this subject. So, so Simon explained this Heisenberg algebra and lattice type algebra. If I understand this was talked just before my, so if I understand that, but so, so, but, but essentially, this free field algebra will not be pi zero, it will be an extension of Heisenberg vertex lattice. It's a simple current extension of the Heisenberg. Simple current extension of the Heisemerk and take this, and but in our case, we will take this one simple, simple version. So, take lattice of rank two with this colour product and consider this lattice VOA. But inside of this lattice VOA, we consider a smaller sub-algebra, smaller sub-algebra, which will be tended to algebra which will be tender product of Heisenberg of rank two with this group algebra associated to rank one lattice and this is for us this pi zero so this is very interesting object to study study separately but for us they have some some other interpretation but first interpretation of this pi zero is is well known Is well known. This is localization of beta gamma V. This is Friedman Schnecker-Martinez localization of the beta gamma. I remember I was five years ago in Banff, we have an in-person conference and then I think Malikov, Edmulekov gave a talk after dinner about this all possible localization of the beta gamma, beta gamma. The beta gamma, beta gamma system, and this pi zero, but pi zero is not only possible localization, but for us the most useful for the purpose. So we have luck that one localization of this beta-gamma system will have nice realization of this latest type view. Okay. Localization means, and this is what means localization that we have inverse. means localization that we have inverse. So essentially we need to have inverse, inverse in this setting. And what is next? I will first recall my result about SL2, but just like information. So in the case of SL2, so in the case of So in the case of SL2, free field realization which we need is obtained as a tensor. F and Lie algebra is embedded into tensor product of the minimal of the Virasora vertex operator algebra. It doesn't need to be minimal. So it is Virasora. But the most interesting example is in the admissible case, an admissible F and SO2 is embedded in the minimum. Or two is embedded in the minimal model, tensor, this pi zero, which is localized by large. And we have a very nice formula, very nice formula, formula for this serialization. So this simple algebra is embedded in this tensor product. There are plenty of applications. I think David will discuss about relaxed modules and so on. About logarithmic. So in the case that this denominator is greater or equal to This denominator is greater than or equal to 3, we have a logarithmic model of Nilpotent rank 2. So, by using methods which I explained before, so we have plenty of logarithmic representations here. But we are not interested in this talking about SO2. We want to study SO, we need to study higher ing case. So, problem is how to generate. The problem is how to generalize this in higher end case. So what is here, you see here, formulas are very nice, very nice. And we essentially need some kind of formula in order to analyze representation. So one can see here that we have this nice Borel part of this realization. And this Borel part we can. And with this Borel part, we can prove many, many results. And what is the problem? We need to have realization in high-rank case so that some idea for this SO2 realization will still hold. And now I'm going to this main topic. This is a joint work with Thomas Groeting and Aochi Genera, published last week. Published last week, so it's very published at Arachai last Friday. So this is three days old on Arachai, so details are there. So what we prove there? We start from the Brzatsky-Polyakov algebra. So for SO3, we have two W algebra in the game, the Algebra in the game, Zamological algebra, this is principal W algebra, and minimalist is Brashatsky-Polyakov. And take this Brashatsky-Polyakov algebra, and this Brashatsky-Polyakov algebra has simply quotient. And then we also need this pi zero as before, and we need beta gamma, beta gamma, where this algebra. So we have three algebra. So we have three algebra in the game: Brashetsky, Polyako, Beta, Gamma, and Pi zero. And we prove that there exists embedding of universal intensive product of tensor product of Brushatsky-Polyakov, tensor of the beta gamma, tensor pi zero. But what is all maybe more interesting, we prove that simple that simple F and L E algebra of arbitrarily non-interception. Algebra or arbitrary non-positive integral levels can be embedded into tensor product of simple Brashatsky Podakov, tensor with S, tensor with the pi zero. So in our case, for S or three, we invert this part of the quantum Hamiltonian reduction. And for us, free field algebra will be just tensor product of the whale vertex algebra with the pi zero. So this Pi zero. So this tensor products, with tensor, with this we invert quantum Hamiltonian reduction. But I will and and what is and formula like this, I didn't copy all. If we take generators from Brushatsky-Polyako B, G plus minus J L Brushatsky Polyako and then and take generators or And take generators or SO3 as usual, we have this formula. We have this formula A, which are nice, very nice for this Borel part, A1, A2, A3, or principal part. And for Heisenberg, and F part is more complicated, but this F1 and F2 is not so, but F3 is really complicated. And you see in this F3, I didn't copy all, I didn't copy all, but in Old, but in formula here it appears this Brzatsky Polyakovirasora in this formula. So this is formula which we needed for our purposes to proving some consequences. I think one can imagine almost more than 10 interesting consequences. It's even difficult to write them in the introduction. So there are plenty of possibility of what possibility. Imagine what is done for SL2, one can do for SL3 much more. So it is something which somehow our proposal, but this is way how one can look an SL3 case using this realization. And but what is what one needs to prove something. So for this is, let me just discuss here how we manage to prove this semi-simple this simplicity. So we take this universal and then project to this simple Brashatsky polyak of tensor s pi zero, we get some Lk, we get some L K tilde. And question is why we should Is why we have here a realization of the simple, and we have a similar problem for proving irreducibility of relaxed modules and semi-relax and so on. And how we prove, my idea was that we take this Borel part. We take this Borel part generated by A1, A2, A3 from here, which is nice. And we somehow we need to remove this J. We need to remove this Brashatsky-Polyako part just with taking this H-bar. And then this and then take affinization. And we classify singular vectors in this tensor product. They must be of the form ELC. And then if we assume that this tilde algebra is This tilde algebra is not simple, then it must have a singular vector. It must have a singular vector of the form Z times something ELC. But then using other generators, we are able to show that this Z, if V singular vector, this Z was Vivacum vector. And this proves. vector and this proves this proves irreducibility in the case when k is not integer. So we use that such singular vector can exist only of this four can only exist for k positive integer. So when k is not positive integer, we prove simplicity. Simplicity of the algebra. So in that way we prove simplicity. And then we have interpretation for cash. For cash-down Lucy category, KLK, in order to understand KLK. And we proved by similar methods that for each reducible module in the category KLK, it can be represented in the form of high-sweight C-1 cofinite module, tensor with. Tensor with again with S, tensor with pi 0, 1/3. And then, of course, this is not this guy in the bracket is very, it's non-semi-simple. But then if we take maximal integrable part of this representation, we get, we reconstruct exactly this irreducible modulus in the category KLK. So this is our result. And this pi 0, 1 third, this one. And this pi zero one third, this one simple current extension. So this category k l k can be some all modules can be reconstructed in that way. So this is understanding, this is how to how to get under different understanding of this category of ordinary model. And what about relaxed? What about relaxed? This is maybe even more interesting question. Even more interesting question. For a Laxter module, we notice first the tensor product of the beta gamma tensor pi zero is embedded in pi zero square. And then, like in Simon talk, we have weight module. Weight module, which is of this form. So, this is one irreducible pi zero square module. And if we take, if we take zero. take z graded a model from the Bershatsky Polakov algebra with little deformula sore then tensor product tensor product of this R times this special module for this pi zero square will be Z graded SO3 universal SO3 module in the case that we start from from the module from the simple From the module from the simple Bryshatsky Polyaku, we will get a large family of modules from the simple FN algebra, which belongs to the category of relaxed modules. And it is easy to see which very, so in this case, this module sometimes has finite dimensional weight spaces for less. Weight spaces for L3, sometimes it's not. But essentially, it depends about this top component of this Brushatsky polyaco. If this top component is finite-dimensional, we get a module which has all finite dimensional weight spaces. If it is infinite-dimensional, we get infinite-dimensional. Okay, and for example, this is our contribution to Gelvin Settler models. unsettling models so so if we take we can construct for each n positive integer irreducible relaxed module which are realized in this form a bryshatsky polyax of tensor pi minus one minus one lambda one such that top component is gelfan settling module this is some some special Some special kind of weight model over this Gelfand settling algebra, which has all n-dimensional weight spaces. So, all weight spaces of this SYTU model will have same dimension, and it can be arbitrarily dimension. And for special, for condition that every model from the simple, such guy can be modeled, can be modeled from this for the simple. For the simple I finally algebra. But how we get the module with infinite dimensional weight space? For that, we construct something more. For this infinite-dimensional setting, we take some infinite-dimensional relaxed model from the Brushatsky-Poyakov algebra. Brzezatsky-Poyakov algebra. So if we and we construct such modules in joint work with Khazuya and David, and if we tensor this module with again with pi minus one minus one, we will get a module which has all infinite dimensional weight spaces and which has non-Galfan settling modules. And so let me just show that. Let me just show. Let me just show how these models look like. See here that this model essentially looks like the top component of this module will be like we will get Laurent polynomials and three variables. And this L0 will act as certain constant, but we have only two element. element of the of the Cartan algebra so we have these three parameters z1 z2 z1 z z2 and with two with h1 h2 and this module this module is clearly has all infinite dimensional weight spaces so such model is is very nice and very complicated unfortunately we couldn't we couldn't prove irreducibility of such modules but Of such modules, but what we could prove is that such modules can exist even for the simple affine algebra. So even simple SL3, even an admissible, set an admissible level can contain such huge modules. So this is very nice and it's somehow related to work of Slava, Zhao, and Liu. They have some classification of the Have some classification of these galaxy modules and beyond. Okay? And how to get SO3 modules? So, how to get logarithmic modules? So, we discuss this a lot, how to get logarithmic modules. So, what will be an interesting logarithmic model for us? So, this will be model on which Sugara operator doesn't act semi-simple. Doesn't act semi-simple, but Cartan algebra acts semi-simple. So, this is kind of a restriction we have. And it seems that so we have embedded, remember that we have embedding on this Brzezevsky simple algebra intensive product of Brzezecky Polyakov tensor S tensor pi zero. It seems that this pi zero doesn't contribute to such logarithmic modules, so we need to construct. Modules. So we need to construct a logarithmic module from Brashetsky-Polyakov and from this beta gamma. For the beta gamma system, previously mentioned paper by Wood and Allen, they construct some projective model in category F. And when we insert this PS here, we will get we will get we will get some logarithmic module for a fine s of three. And a remaining question is: how to construct a logarithmic model from Brushatsky-Polyakov algebra? And for that, we need to look at a realization of Bryshevsky-Polyakom algebra inside of tensor product of the semological algebra with pi zero. And then And then, and using that, we prove the following results. So, what we can prove for logarithmic models so far? So, there are more results which you can prove, but so far we can prove that universal SL3 has a logarithmic model of rank 3. Maybe more, but we can prove that there is this logarithmic model for rank 3. If case If case admissible, then we can prove again logarithmic modules of L0, Nilpoten rank 3, even from the simple F and V algebra. So even simple F and V algebra at admissible level always, almost always contains this logarithmic modulus of nil potential entry. modulus of Newport and Ram 3 and this is obtained as tensor product of this beta gamma logarithmic tensor with this Brzezatki-Polyakov logarithmic and how just briefly how we how we get this this Brshatsky-Kolyakov logarithmic module this Brzezatsky-Polyakov module we use this realization obtained with Minkazu and David inside of this with this special With this special, we need to assume also that case not half integer, because at half integer level, Brzezatsky-Polikov is irrational. So Bryshatsky-Polikov at half-integer level doesn't have any logarithmic model. So we take the extra cases integer and half-integer and use this realization. And then how we prove, we apply this method. We apply this method, which I explained at the beginning of my talk, and we construct a special high-sweet model from the themological principle, SS-3 algebra, with the spatial high-suite. And so using generic free-field realization, we construct such scaling operator between such kind of. You see here we have some special. we have some special special modules L L bar with this special heist weight and and using this we can prove existence of logarithmic modules for universal for universal Brashatsky poliarch at arbitrary level but but question is is this L Tilden module from the simple simple zomological algebra simple principle SLT simple principle SLT. So we can solve this for admissible, for admissible level beyond admissible it is a really open, interesting question is this L the order module module for this AK and then but if we assume that L is an irreducible module for the simple algebra which can we which we can prove for admission which we can prove for admissible. Then we repeat the method, which explained in our previous work, 12 years old, how we get this logarithmic model. We apply this delta operator and consider extended VOA and get logarithmic model from the Brzezatsky Polyaku. And what we can prove using that That, for example, that in the case that case admissible and this then denominator is greater or equal to four, we can prove that simple Brashecksky-Polyako algebra, this admissible level has logarithmic modules of nilpoten rank two and length two. One can see the structure. So one can see the selector. This is my favorite logarithmic module, offline. One can see the selector of modules. So, and then question is probably it works also for when denominator is three. And we expect that even beyond admissible level, such module can exist too. So, and this is this is this result that we Where we use this screening operator from Brushetsky Polyakov to get these logarithmic models. And now, logarithmic models, see somehow import, include here one logarithmic for beta gamma from Brushatsky-Polyakov and get this modulus. And this is very, very general, very general, almost maximal general. And lastly, Maximum. And last remark, I'm running out of time. So, as I mentioned, there are probably more than 10 applications, current application. Imagine all what is done about SL2 case. And so one can do for SL3 and beyond. Let me just finish with one possible application which can be. Possible application which can be interesting here. So now we can combine two realizations. So recall we proved that the Bryshatsky-Polyakov is tensor product of the zomological tensor with pi zero and an affine is tensor product of Bryshatsky-Polyakov tensor with S tensor with pi zero. And when we put together, we get in We get embedding of F and SL3 in tensor product of zombological tensor with S, tensor with pi zero. As I mentioned, we really have good understanding of casualustic categories. So one possible application is just, for example, take Fagin-Tipunin algebra. What is Fagin-Tipunin algebra? This is this is. algebra this is uh this is extension of the extension of the zomological algebra extension this is some conjectural c2 cofinite algebra extension of the zomological algebra and just instead of zk put here this fragmented pun and we get something which is completely so if we if we which is completely reducible Completely reducible as a representation for the SL3 at level at level minus 3 plus 1 over p. And then we can do a lot of very interesting things using this. We can construct the module, the compose here. So really we can do a lot of things. So taking any such kind of logarithmic algebra for the algebra for the zoomological algebra we can one can one can get such extension extension for the from the uh sorry from this for example what what what we what what is uh classical story just just to just to see uh comments here so so in the case in in the ranguan case in the ranged one case In the Ramdran case, we have this classical C2 cofinite algebra, which is triplet, doublet. And using this algebra and free field realization, we construct this VP algebra. But in the high-rank case, we can start with high-rank logarithmic algebra like Feynman, like high-ranked Ritlet, and using the centrics. And using the centrics, we can construct more overall algebra. With some new realization of this type, we can even get more. So this is a certain kind of trick to getting new results about logarithmic algebra. And I think such kind of algebra also should appear in this correspondence with physics theory. And so. And my last slide is essentially. Sorry, my slide slide. So essentially, last last part of the talk is based on this recent paper and some other references. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Trajan, for the nice talk. Please, everybody, ask questions. Rajan, could I ask a question? Yes, of course, please. Hi, very nice talking. Good morning for you. Yeah, really nice. Oh, yes, it's early. So I wanted to know, you have for the FL3 realization, you'd expect three B2 gammas from the standard free field realization. Um, free field realization, and so we know that we have to uh uh allow for more uh uh we have to convert some of those beta gammas into your pi naught the ways. Why is it that uh do you have any insight into why in this case it's it's enough to to uh to take uh one beta gamma and one pi naught with the Byshatsky-Polyakop instead of having both. Having both converted to pi naught or some more complicated thing. Yeah, yeah, it seems we first thought that we needed to use two pi naught for SL3 now. Then we realized that we can keep one beta gamma and one pi naught. And so, but who knows what will happen in the hierarchy when we go to SL4s? When we go to SO4 or so, this is okay. So always get one. So it seems that it should be one in some realization for these delinear series. Yeah, okay. For beta gamma, for Shatsky Poliako, we didn't, maybe we didn't see. So we didn't, we have just by zero. This is very simple. This is very similar to SL2, but now we will see for high-rank case. Yeah, in the earlier case, we didn't have a choice, I think. Yeah, but what is the this beta gamma is much better for getting logarithmic because we automatically have a logarithmic for pi zero. It has pi zero has some logarithmic which is but on which Cartan algebra does not act semi-simple. So I have it to love. So yeah. So yeah. Can I ask one more question? I don't want to be rude to other people, but with your construction of the relaxed modules with infinite dimensional wave spaces, were you able to confirm that you can get all of the what we might call semi-relaxed modules as subquotions from those? If I understand in your paper, the notion of semi-relax. So maybe we have to use AFNUS since I prepared Can use since I prepare my if I can use for semi-relax so so we have so we have Brushetsky Polyakov tensor with pi is with S times pi zero and and then this is embedded in Brushetsky Polyakotensor pi zero square and then if we start with pi zero square weight module we get I think we get relaxed but we can take we can take we can take some highest weight model tensor with the s tensor with the pi Tensor with the pi minus one line. I think it is semi-related. If I understand, so so I think we just keep we just keep, we haven't studied this semi-relucture, but we just keep keep s and take and take this weight modules of pi zero. And then somehow somehow this is yeah, yeah, I mean it is great it is great job now to compare if one get all can grow. So this is your approach with Kazuya and Simon and Futorni approach where it's a classification. It's a classification of this Gerfan-Settlin model, but this non-Gelfan settling in infinite dimensions are very, very interesting somehow. It seems that even in Lie algebra theory, they found just for SL3. So probably one can expect such kind of huge relaxed model in general. But it's probably very interesting how. It's probably very interesting how to compare with your method localization of, yeah, I agree. It's very non-trivial to compare. Yeah, yeah, very nice to have. We can study case by case, but maybe it's better to get some uniform. Do we have another question? So Drajan, this morning the are you still there, Drajan? Yes, I'm here. Yeah, this morning the quantum groups of SL2, the Anrod one, appeared. And could you just explain to the audience how this quantum group is related to certain VOAs? Okay. Then I need to share again. and then i need to share again i i wanted to see you but so what is the what is the again so so so we have you you know better so but so so we have just just a short explanation which we have so if i understand if i understand this quantum group appeared today was related to singlet yeah exactly To singlet, yeah, exactly. So, this is UQ how you call you, UQ with an H on the top, H H. So, this is the quantum group Francesco was talking about. This is related to singlet, so this is logarithmic. But we shall singlet, so not single, this is singlet. And then it's a triplet algebra, triplet algebra, which is related to
