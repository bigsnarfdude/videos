Organizers, of course, for organizing this really, really nice workshop. And thank you for inviting me and giving me a chance to give a talk here. Okay, so of course, it's a bit hard to talk after all these excellent talks that we had here. I mean, they were so good and so inspiring. So I'm a bit nervous because. So, I'm a bit nervous because of that, but I'll try my best. Okay, so I want to talk about higher Auslander algebras. And so, let me just kind of make a summary of what I'm going to do. So, first, I'm going to talk about, this is just, of course, recalling Auslanger correspondence. Which, of course, was done by Auslander. Auslanger and it was not called the Auslanger correspondence. Then I want to talk about higher Auslanger correspondence. And this was introduced and studied very much by Osamu Iyama. Yama. And then after that, I want to talk about higher Auslanger algebras from coming from hereditary of. Of finite representation type. And this is the work by Amyersen. And then after, so it will be a collection of such algebras. Then after that, again, higher our slender algebras from From higher representation finite, higher representation finite algebras. So there will be kind of new collections of Aussie algebras from these. It's also by SEN. And the last one. The last one is again higher Auslander algebras, but now Nakayama. So here we will describe all higher Auslander algebra, all higher Auslander algebras, all Nakayama higher Auslander algebras. And this is this joint work with Is this joint work with Sen and Shijiazu as DZ, yeah, with three of us? Oh yeah, both Emre and Shijia are my students. Okay, so let me now talk about the first part, which I think everybody knows, but I think I still want to mention. So this is the theorem of Auslander. And it is for R Pina algebras. So it says that there is a correspondence between algebras. Lambda of finite representation and algebras gamma such that global dimension of gamma is less than or equal to 2 is less than or equal to the dominant. Is less than or equal to the dominant dimension. So, this is the old well-known theorem of Ausling, right? That there is a correspondence. And then, of course, we have equivalence, you know, Maurita equivalence. Okay, so I want to recall actually. Oh, yeah, and then these algebras here, of course, are called Auslander algebras. So, this is just the definition slide. Definition slide and of course global dimension, everybody knows. I just want to kind of recall that dominant dimension. So the dominant dimension dimension of gamma is P if you look at the You look at the minimal injective resolution of gamma i t plus one and so on. So it's minimal injective resolution and then t is Where you check that all these injectives are also projective and it plus one is not projective. So that is the dominant dimension, right? Okay. And of course, Aussie algebra is which was the beginning of all of this, right? For Aussie. Of all of this, right? For alpha and the algebras, what it means is that you have, yeah, so this is the definition, right? This is the definition of dominant dimension. And for Aussie algebras being two, that means you have injective I1, I1, and I2. Since global dimension is supposed to be less than or equal to 2, it has to stop. And dominant dimension being bigger than or equal to 2. Dimension being bigger than or equal to two, that means that these two must be projective. So this is kind of original projective. Original, if you start with algebra of finite representation type, this is what you have. And I want to recall what is the correspondence. And then after that, I want to kind of relate it to the correspondence in the higher case by Iyama, right? And then after that, I want to. Then, after that, I want to talk about creating these higher Auslander algebras and checking what happens when we do correspondence like this in a higher case. But I just want to recall here what is really correspondence. So, if we start with the lambda of finite representation type, then we Type. Then we have M1 up to Mn. I will write just in decomposable lambda modules, but it will always mean a complete set of representatives of isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules, right? So because it's a finite representation. So, because it's a finite representation type, that's why there are finitely many of them. And then you take m to be sum of these, mi, i goes one to n, and to that, you associated gamma is defined to be the endomorphism algebra over lambda of m. Lambda of m and then correspondence. I should put it here. Okay, and then this is Auslinger algebra. So that is part of Auslanger algebra. That is part of the Auslinger's theorem. And I want to mention also the correspondence the other way. You start with gamma, which is Auslanger algebra. So global dimension and dominant dimension. Global dimension and dominant dimension appropriate. And then you take Q to be the sum of Q i's. I goes from one to M, where Q i's are representatives of projective injective gamma modules. So you take all projective injective gamma modules and then you take and or then you Take endo, then you define lambda to be the endomorphism algebra over gamma of Q. And then, of course, lambda is a finite representation type. And again, that is part. So, all of this here is just part of the Auslan theorem. Okay. And now I want to talk about the And now I want to talk about the higher. So that's the first part. Now the second part is to talk about higher Auslander writing. I mean, Auslander, it's kind of hard to say just Auslander without Ausland writing. Okay. Okay. Second part. I want to talk about higher Auslander correspondence. And let me just see if I wanted to mention something before that. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. In order to state it, of course, I need to recall definitions, which again are IAMS definitions. So, this is recall. Definitions. Meetings again by Iyama. So, again, art in algebra. Everything is art in algebra. Sometimes there are kind of more restrictions, but Are kind of more restrictions, but I'll just keep art in algebra. Okay, so then we say that a sub, okay, so we say that C inside of mod lambda are arc in algebra lambda. Is cluster filter? Filtering and now it can be subcategory or module. Okay, and I will put here also D to denote the cluster tilting. So the definitions were already several times here during the talk, right? But the condition. But it the condition is there are two parts, right? So that C consists of all X such that X I over lambda of X C is zero for I between one and D minus one. And then it can be also straight. And then it can be also stated the other way. Lambda, C, and X. Okay. And the same here. Okay. And now if the question, if we are talking about cluster tilting subcategory, then you want C to be functorially finite. Finite. Finite. And then, of course, if it happens to be a module, if it has finitely many indecomposables, then for the module, you know, it's already functorally finite. In this talk, I will be actually dealing with all the examples of the examples three, four, and five. Three, four, and five will always have this cluster tilting module. So it will be the cluster tilting. So even if I write cluster thing, it will be cluster tilting module. Okay, so now I want to state the higher correspondence. We are higher correspondence, of course, here I will have higher Auslan algebras, and then we cannot have finite representation. Have finite representation type, but there is certain finiteness which Osamu introduced, right? And finiteness will be given using this now. I hope I will state it precisely, but I'm yeah, I looked at several talks that you gave, and sometimes it's kind of a bit hard to state it. Okay, so let me. Okay. Small remark. So the million to dimension gamma is a t plus one. If you use, you define in this way. Auto t. Yeah, yeah, of course. Thank you. I'm always thinking about is it I'm always thinking about is it called P Aus under algebra or P plus one Auslan algebra? So there's always this plus one minus one and so on. Yeah, so dominant dimension is P plus one, right? Because dominant dimension here is two and I am only here up to one. Thank you. Okay. Yeah. And then this is called, so when we have this dominant, this is called. This is called one Aussie, right? So, so when dominant dimension is t plus one, then this is called t higher Aussie algebra. Okay. Yeah, yeah, there will probably be more mistakes with this. I was trying to do it carefully, but still, I guess I made. Okay, so here's the theorem. And again, it's Yama. And again, it's Yama. Yama, you can correct me. Okay. So again, there is a correspondence. And now I have to have the left part and the right part. And right part is easy. So this is higher. Let me see whether I'll do it right higher. And I will call D Auslanger. Algebra gamma, which means that the global dimension of gamma is less than or equal to d plus one and less than or equal to the dominant dimension of gamma, right? And that will correspond to algebras. Lambda, which have B cluster guilting module. And then again, one has to be careful about relations, what kind of relations to put here and what kind of relations to put here. And what kind of relations to put here. Okay. So again, so we'll have these higher Alisfandria algebras, and they will correspond to algebras which have the cluster tilting. And here is a module. So the finiteness or the lambda is not a finite representation type, but it has this D-cluster tilting module, which is where we have finiteness. Okay? So So in order to describe the correspondence, let me just see. Yeah, so the correspondence, okay, so if it says that M is D cluster filting module, so that gives us possibility to take the endomorphism. To take the endomorphism over lambda of m and then this will turn out to be a d cluster. Oh, no, the Alzheimer algebra and the correspondence going the other way, and this is. Other way, and this is where I will need to talk a bit more. If I start here with gamma, which is the Aussie algebra, and then you choose Q to be the sum of projective injectives, so projective injectives, and then take lambda. Take lambda to be the endomorphism algebra of Q over gamma. And now comes the part where one has to discuss if lambda has finite global dimension, it will have a unique cluster tilting object. And if lambda has infinite global dimension, it will have more, it might have. More, it might have more cluster tilting objects. Okay, so the cases that I will be talking about, all of them will be such that Lambda has finite global dimensions. So that's why I said I'm kind of concentrated more on the case of cluster filter modules. So in the cases three, four, and five that I will be talking, we will construct higher Auslanger algebras, and then from these higher algebra algebra algebra, And then, from these higher Auslanger algebras, look, describe the projective injectives, take the endomorphism of these projective injectives, and then describe cluster tilting objects here. So let me just write this. And in order to do that, there's this really nice proposition which tells you exactly what to do. Okay, again, I am a proposition. So let me just So, let me just proposition. Okay, so if actually, I wanted to first put the definition of okay if so I'm using. So I'm using, I'm going through this. Okay, so if global dimension of lambda is equal to D, then lambda has a unique D clustered filter module. Filting module and a module M and M is the sum of the okay, tau I'll define this so it's tau d of d lambda i i goes from one I goes from one to and it will be finite. Okay, actually, we can write the okay. So if this, so this is what I was saying here, if this lambda has finite global dimension, then the proposition says that in that case, lambda will have a unique decluster tilting module, and that d-cluster tilting module can be described really nicely as the this is. As the this is okay tau d this was already defined tau d is defined to be omega d minus one. So this is higher Auslander write and translate. So it m because of the finite global dimension this orbit tau d orbit of injectives these are the injectives so These are the injectives. So, tau d orbit of the injectives will be finite, and m will be the sum of this, all the all the modules that appear in this tau d orbit. You can't sound the sum past b, you might remember, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, it will be finite. I wanted to say finite, but I wanted to put something, okay, so so. To put something, okay. So, so this is okay. So, the idea, yeah, so I described the correspondence. So, so what we want to do, so the idea of constructing, so we want to construct more of higher cluster tilting objects. That was the idea. Okay, so to get more of cluster tilting objects, we define higher, we construct higher Auslander algebras. Alanta algebras look at the projective injectives in gamma, take the endomorphism of Q over gamma, call this sigma, and then take, so this will be Actually, I didn't define. I should also define here. So, this will be what is called D finite representation type, where D finite representation type means. So, here's the definition. I should have written first the definition. D finite representation type means there. Type means there exists the cluster tilting module and global dimension of lambda is d. Okay, so an algebra is of the finite representation type, and also there are these different definitions. So I'm really. So, I'm really for this talk. I'm using this, but when you look at the papers, there are different definitions. Sometimes, so the finite representation type, sometimes it says there exists the cluster tilting module, and sometimes it says, in addition, it has to have finite global dimension. Okay, so I don't really, I'm just using this. Okay, so let me go back to what we are doing. Okay, so you have high construct higher Alsinger algebras, take projective, injective. Take projective injectives, take the endomorphism of these, you get an algebra, and then to construct a cluster D cluster tilting module, take the tau D orbit of the dual of sigma, which is of the injectors. Okay, so that's the plan. Okay, so now I'm going. That's the plan. Okay, so now I'm going to do this on three families. Okay. So about the proposition. So uniqueness, unique, yes, if cluster, declass that routing module exists, then it is unique. Yes. This is. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. Yeah. Then if the yeah, yeah. The yeah yeah you're right cluster the cluster tilting module exist then it is unique okay one more small comment is a direct sum is from i equal to zero to when yeah of course thank you Yeah, because you start with the injectives, right? I mean, I is zero, you start with the injective, and then you take tau orbit, tau, the orbit of it. Okay, so thank you. Okay, now let me start the okay, so this is the So now I'm going to start with age hereditary of finite representation type. And then VBH, so the VB mod H is just the union of all the shifts of mod H. All the shifts of mod H in Z. Since H is hereditary, all the indecomposables are stock, so it is really only, it can be viewed only as shifts of those. And now, so this is the M-ray sense construction, okay. Now he picks I kept changing letters, so I might end up with the writing changing throughout. Okay, CK. Let me do this. CK. Okay, so CK is the subcategory. So it's a full subcategory of DB model H. Full subcategory consisting of, so I'm just going to write what the objects are. CK is the union of the mod H shifts J, but the J goes from zero to K. Okay, so this the derivative category looks like you have okay mod H. Okay, mod H, and then you have shift, shift, shifts. And the CK means just take K shifts of that. That's the CK. And then you take a module in there. So when I write CK, I will mean a module. So this is a subcategory, and here I will mean a module. And then you define gamma k to be the endomorphism. The endomorphism algebra of CK over in the derived category. And then the theorem is, so this is Andrew's theorem that gamma k is three k plus two. Plus two Auslanger algebra. So it's a higher Auslander algebra, it's 3k plus 2. And now in order, so that's the first part of the theorem that it is this higher Aussie algebra. Now, in order to do what I suggested here, we want to know what are the injectives. So injective I mean, projective, injective, that's what I mean. Injective, projective gamma K modules are of the form HAM. So all the projectives are, of course, HAMCK. So it's HAMCK DB. And then here you can take any. You can take any sum end m i where m i because it's a finite representation type, I'm again using the same notation m1 up to mn. So you take mi and you take the shifts j, but now you only allow, so of course I will go from one to n. From one to n, but j will go from one also. So in the original here, j goes from zero. So to define c k, you go from zero to k. Here, injectives will be j goes between one and k and you And you also have to add comp db CK of the injectives DH. Okay, so the harm, so you look at the images under HAM CK and only, so anything here, any module here, if you take HAM into that, it will be injective. It will be injective and also the injectives here. So it's from shift one and includes injectives in shift zero. So these are the injective projective gamma k modules. And then you define sigma k as the endomorphism of the fuse. Of the cules, but then also sigma k will have nice its endomorphism of exactly these modules, and sigma k will be, okay, so sigma k I want to mention this, so sigma k will be, okay, so now this is 3k plus 2 auspicial algebra, so sigma k will be 3k plus 1 representation. Representation finite and it will have it will have three k plus one r cluster tilting module. And we can describe it. I mean, there is a precise description of all of this, but I want to mention the other two cases also. Okay. Also. Okay. So it's again the same idea. So the next example or next family of examples is again the same idea. Find higher Alzheimer algebras, find projective injectives and take the endomorphism, and then find the cluster tilting objects. And as I said, you know, there's a really nice, precise description of these cluster tilting objects in this case. Objects in this case. And of course, this can be done for any k. And you can see that if k is zero, then you're just back to Alzheimer's algebra. Okay. Okay, so now the next case is, okay, so now I want to start with lambda, which is m finite representation type. So, if it is M finite representation type, that means there exists M, which is M cluster tilting module. Okay, so now you want to look at the You want to look at the M and look at the shifts of M. So this is finite, right? It's a module, so it has finitely many sum n's. Now you take M and if you look at M and you look at this M here, C shifts. So you have cluster tilting module, and this is inside. And this is inside of the derived category of lambda, which is this L finite representation part. Okay, now this is, I believe, it's m plus one angulated category, and that is by guys Okay, uh Keller and Offer okay so now inside of that you look at the subcategory C C K okay which is well actually I'll define immediately module because this is module so I'll define module instead of saying full subcategory and then take representative so we take CK. So we take CK to be the sum. Okay, so first of all, of course, you take all sum n's. Oh, okay, since I already have take m, but then you take shifts of m, but now you don't take just any shifts, you only take multiple of m shifts of m. So there's this cluster filter module, and then you just go m shifts of those. Go M shifts of those, okay, and then J goes from zero to K. Okay, so it's kind of the same idea. You know, you're in a big case and you take appropriate shifts. Okay, so you have this now, this is sitting inside of the derived category, okay? And then you take gamma. Then you take gamma k is defined to be the endomorphism algebra of this CK, where the endomorphism is now again in the derived category. And then the theorem, again, theorem says that the gamma k is higher out than the Higher algebra, higher Aussie with global dimension of gamma k less than or equal. Okay, so it's m plus two. So it has to do with what representation type you started with times k, how many shifts you take. Shifts you take and plus m plus one and then dominant dimension of gamma k. Okay, so this is now higher Alexander algebra. Okay, and then you can describe Q, but I have six minutes. Okay, so Q are projective injectives, and you define sigma k to be the end of. K to be the endomorphism algebra. You have 10 more minutes. Oh, 10 minutes. Oh, okay. Okay. So I'll just slow down a bit. Okay. So anyway, so here is again higher Aussie algebra. This is the global dimension zone. And then sigma k is in the endomorphism algebra of the projectives injective. Objective and then sigma k is this, and that will be m plus two times k plus m plus m. Now again, I'm not sure about my plus or minus one. Okay. Representation type, finite representation type. Presentation time. So, again, there is a precise description in the paper of what these projective injectives are, what is sigma k, and then again, one can construct the cluster tilting object and then use higher our slide. Higher Auslander writing translation of this m plus 2 times k plus m plus I'm not sure about why here a little bit, okay, this to get cluster building object, okay, so again. Okay, so again, the idea is to start with, of course, if you start with something of finite representation type, yeah, you know that you already have cluster-tilting objects. So it's not that, you know, but this is procedure of constructing many more cluster tilting objects. For each K, you can construct a cluster tilting object, which is, so this one has M cluster tilting object, but this procedure constructs more of high. More of higher and higher cluster tilting objects. Okay, and as I said, I'm just a little bit unsure about this plus one where I add plus one and so on. Okay, and then I want to talk about a different construction. Okay, so I do have time, different construction, which deals with Nakayama algebras and describes actually all higher Auslander Nakayama algebra. I do not care about algebra. Okay? And it is, as I said, it's kind of different type of construction. These two constructions where you take something and you take shift, shift, shift, and then you know you use that. But this, this other one, so we'll use lambda is cyclic. Cyclic. I'll state for cyclic. We also have results for linear, but cyclic is kind of almost okay. Cyclic nakayama. It's funny, but it's easier to describe what I'm going to describe for cyclic than for linear. But we do have description for linear, also cyclic nakayama. Okay, so I want first to mention. I want first to mention what is epsilon construction. So again, that was also Emre. I mean, it's almost everything is, you know, Emre. I mean, he got all into this higher Alesner algebra. Okay, so this is construction. Now, what is the construction? Okay, so you take S to be the To be the collection of S simple and S is circle of projective. So you only look at the circles of projectives for the Nakayama algebra. If you think about Alexander right and clever, you look only at these simples and these simples and these simples. And these simples, and you don't look at the obvious singles. So that's what S is. Okay. And then S prime is how S for S in S okay. And then P is the sum of the projective. The projective covers of tau s. And this is over all s in s and then the definition epsilon of lambda is defined to be the endomorphism algebra of P over lambda. And then another theorem is the theorem is that. Epsilon lambda is cyclic Nakayama a global dimension of lambda of the episode lambda is global dimension of lambda minus Of lambda minus two with a small condition that global dimension has to be bigger than or equal to two. And dominant dimension of epsilon lambda is dominant minus two, and again, a minor condition here. So the point is that this epsilon construction reduces. Reduces global dimension and dominant dimension, therefore, reduces the Alzheimer's right. And so, what we want reverse epsilon. Because we want to construct higher Aussie algebras, right? So we want to reverse epsilon, and then we have the two theorems. Clearance. Okay, so well, actually, I'll state them all as one. So, theorem, this is S T Z. So, I'm starting with Lambda 6. So I'm starting with lambda cyclic Nakayama. Actually, I'm going to call it A cyclic Nakayama. Then, okay, so part A, the first step is there exist countably many, many cyclic. Cyclic Nakayama B such that epsilon of B is isomorphic to A. Okay, so there and we have precise description, you know, exactly how you construct. Now, part B is there exist unique cyclic. Cyclic Nakayama B such that epsilon of B is isomorphic to A that we started with and defect of B is equal to the defect Of A. Okay, so this is kind of defect-invariant theorem. So if we don't have conditional defect, you have infinitely many. But if you put this condition, now defect of algebra just means how many injectives, injective non-projectives you have. Okay, so if you preserve that, then you have this. And then part C is, of course, if If A is higher our slender let's say D then the B from this part This part is higher P plus two Auslander. And there's a corollary this gives all Uh yeah ow slender nothing so the point is that you know you can describe ones which are of glow Auslander, two Auslander and three Auslander and then you have using this epsilon inverse construction you get all of them and I And I you said I'm supposed to stop exactly at that time. Okay. Oh, please. Are there any questions? So we can just check that. So, I can just check that. So, by Emory's theorem, part C of the joint theorem should hold whenever epsilon B is A, and not just for the special one with the same defect, right? In part C, B could be any cyclic Nachi armor with epsilon B equals A and not just the one with the same defects, right? By the previous theorem. So, can you comment on what the defect condition is giving you? The number of object objects I uh you need the condition of this in order to um to get the the the no yeah yeah and okay yeah yeah you you're right Yeah, so it's just but is there some reason to be interested in preserving the defects beyond just that makes B unique? Yeah, it's okay. I mean, I think it's yeah, there's something that I cannot. Yeah, there's uh later later is fine. Yeah, maybe I'll think about it. Oh, okay, yeah, okay, Andrew, you can come in. Oh, okay. Okay, thank you. Hi, everyone there. So the effect condition is required. In general, for the part A, we have control of the increment of the global dimension. But if the effects are not equal, we cannot increase the dominant dimension. Dominant dimension becomes one. So that's why for part C, part B is important. If the same, then we don't have. Not same than dominant, we don't have the increment on the dominant dimension. Perhaps there should be an inequality in the statement of your theorem on its own, but well, what about so is this the condition, right? You know, when does dominant dimension the condition on the dominant dimension that reduction is true when dominant dimension of Dominant dimension of original algebra lambda is greater or equal than three. This is the okay. Yep. Okay. Well, I put the box here. I just didn't remember what it was. Okay, dominant dimension means. Three. And global dimension and all other dimensions are two. That's why dominant dimension is special. When we do the part A, if we do not assume the defect invariance and then dominant dimension of And then dominant dimension of the algebra B can be one or two. But when we assume the defect, then it becomes D plus two. Could you clarify the necessary condition in the theorem? Emir, could you clarify the necessary condition in the theorem of equality for global dimension and dominant dimension? So did this equality So, this equality is not automatic. This is a factor you commented, right? Which equality? I don't understand. In the middle of Black Rado, I'm not sure. Yes. Yes, this. Okay, this is true if global dimension of lambda is greater than two. Greater or equal than two. Sorry. Yeah, and put down the magic. It for dominant dimension, it is three dominant dimension of lambda greater or equal than three. Thank you very much. More questions? There's a question in the chat by Renee Marksinsi. Can this be used to enumerate the connected linear Nakayama algebras with n simple? Nakayama algebras with n simple simple modules that are higher Auslander. Do you want to talk about this? Okay, yes, this can be used. And in that case, we did. Okay, Professor Todoro stated the part for psychic Nakayama algebra, but we have a similar approach for linear Nakayama algebras. And in that case, we can start with semi-simple algebras or Simple algebras or some small global dimensional linear Nakayam algebras, and then apply this iterative construction. So for a fixed n, we can get. Yes, when we bound the number of simples, we can get such a formula. For example, let's only consider the rank the global dimension three, dominant dimension two. Dimension three, dominant dimension three, all standard algebras, which are linear. And then their CCG filtered algebra is always direct sum of A-type coavers, oriented A-type, so we can get the formula for fixing the simples, number of simples, and also the global dimension. The description of the actual interest is much easier to describe when you're looking at second pages. And it's a bit more complicated when you look at that in a linear, because then you have to add some extra point and get complicatory a little bit more complicated, right? So, anyway. So I just had it to your point. One more question. So in the last corollary, so this construction gives all higher Auslanda Nakayama algebra. I guess the meaning of this is using epsilon reduction, one can reduce the classification of higher Auslanda Nakayama algebra to the very basic one. Yes? Basic one, yes. And what is the most basic one? What is the result of reduction? Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. Yeah, so what I was saying. Okay, yeah, so what I was saying is that you know you cannot go down to hereditary, so you can go at most down to two. Okay, so always we can reduce this to higher or nakayama or zero of a global dimension two. Two or three, two or three. This does by two, so you have to reduce to two and three, and then from two and three, you can get everything. So then, is it a possible? so then is it possible to understand this most of basic class of higher ausland gamma algebra you mean the ones which are two and three two or three uh is there any cross yeah we do we do have uh we do have description uh okay you you you have a description yeah yeah yeah there is precise description in terms of the the um copy series you know certain copies Know certain Cooper series will give you exactly so there's precisely, that's what Emre did before, you know. So before, you know, before we were doing kind of this more, you know, I mean, Emre had the description of all of those, but I don't know, I don't remember. You don't need the two teams. Thank you very much. Well, then we thank all the speakers of this session and of the whole conference, and we thank also the organizers for this wonderful. The organizers for this wonderful company. Well, I was going to say also to all organizers, right? We have the official organizers or their organizers here. I mean, all of the organizers. And also, I still want to, I said it at the beginning, but I still want to thank people for all the beautiful talks. I really, really enjoyed this. It was very, very nice. Enjoyed this. It was very, very nice and inspirational. And so, okay. So, again, thank you all. And thank you for organizing this.
