So it's the integral over the Adele's over the Adels of G prime modulo, the principal Adels. And so things have been set up so that both sides are homogeneous in a choice of they're independent. If you multiply F and F prime by scalars, nothing changes on either side. All right. Now, the local factors tell you whether the period integral The period integral is zero automatically, and it's zero if the local factors are integrals, normalized integrals of matrix coefficients, and they vanish if there is no local pairing. This is here, if this pairing doesn't vanish, that means that locally at every place, the local pi and the local pi prime. Pi and local pi prime, small lowercase, have to have an invariant pairing under the local group. And so the gun-gross-Prassad conjecture tells you that this is only possible if your global group has been chosen locally and if your local representation has been chosen, lowercase pi, has been chosen in such a way that. Chosen in such a way that they coincide with the inner forms of the unitary group and the members of the L packet, which carry this local pairing. And there's always a unique such pairing. We were talking about cuspital representations, and they are in particular, they are always known to be tempered. So this is only. So this is only sorry, at all the at finite and at the Archimedean place. And at the Archimedean. There's a unique Archimedean place and a unique member of the L packet, which is going to be discrete series L packet, so that this doesn't vanish. And we assume that we have picked this out. In that case, it means that there is a unique local pairing and everything is determined uniquely. Determined uniquely. But my talk is going to be concentrating on the, it's going to be ignoring the finite primes. We'll only be looking at the Archimedean prime. So now I'm changing notation temporarily. Pi tensor pi prime is a representation of the product of unitary groups with a discrete series representation, which admits a unique and invariant pairing. An invariant pairing under the smaller group. All right, so now I'm going to be talking about that. I'm going to be trying to classify the ones that have some relevance to algebraic geometry. All right, now we have unitary groups, so they have signatures, and the signature is on this page. It's R S U R S and U R. And U R minus 1s, and then the maximal compact subgroups accordingly, U R cross U S and U R minus 1 cross U S, K prime is chosen to be inside K. Then the symmetric spaces have equivariant remission structures so that the inclusion is holomorphic. Well, if you have a holomorphic inclusion of locally of symmetric spaces, then you get a holomorphic inclusion. Then you get a holomorphic inclusion of the locally symmetric spaces, and these are Shimura varieties. So, we're not going to talk about the Shimura varieties for the next half hour or so. Now, as is generally the case for Hermitian symmetric spaces, the quotient of G by K, the Lie algebra of G by the Lie algebra of K, breaks up according to the Harris-Chandra decomposition. To the Harris Chandra decomposition into the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic pieces, which are, if you think of K being the stabilizer of a point X in, well, let's say one, there can be more than one fixed point. Let's say there's a fixed point in the symmetric space, then its tangent space, its complexified tangent space, decomposes as a holomorphic and anti-holomorphic. Decomposes is the holomorphic and an anti-holomorphic piece. And that's what the Harsh-Jandra decomposition registers. Now we are going to pick a theta-stable maximal parabolic, which for important reasons is the sum of K and P minus, and likewise for P, capital P minus, P prime, rather. Now, we're going to be looking at debar cohomology, which is the version of cohomology that's relevant to the algebraic geometric structure of a Shimur variety. So we pick a finite dimensional representation of k and pi is a representation of the unitary group. And in most cases, And in most cases, we are thinking of this as a Harish Chandram module, then the d-bar cohomology of pi with coefficients in W is relative Lie algebra cohomology of where instead of taking the Lie algebra of G, we take the Lie algebra of this maximal theta stable parabolic with coefficients in the tensor product. And old says, remember that P minus, the P minus is, I'm being told my internet connection is unstable. Please start waving your arms if you can't hear me. Remember, P minus is the sum of the Lie algebra of K and an abelian nilpotent subalgebra. Nilpoten subalgebra. So this is basically the n Comology of pi tensor W or the K invariance in the NCOMology of pi tensor W. So this was calculated by Schmidt as follows. And so suppose you have a discrete series representation of G, then there's a unique irreducible representation W. unique irreducible representation w pi of k and a unique integer with the following property, the cohomology vanishes unless in all degrees, unless your coefficients are the chosen w pi. And if it is the the chosen w pi, then it vanishes except in one degree, which is q of pi, which we will be coming back to. Be coming back to in the future. So if q of pi is zero, this corresponds to a holomorphic discrete series. If q of pi is the dimension of x, this is anti-holomorphic discrete series. And then, but you have to be careful about which one is pi and which one is pi check. And I will blur that distinction because it is blurred. Distinction because it is blurred in my brain. And so, if I try to be, if I try to be clear about it, I will fail. All right. And then there's a formula for the highest weight of this chosen w pi. A rho is half the sum of the positive roots for the system for which p minus is positive. Well, p minus is positive, and lambda is the harsh chandra parameter of pi. Finally, this should be a pi check. For any given w, there's at most one discrete series pi. This is not the same as the original pi. You should maybe think of this as a different letter for which the cohomology doesn't vanish at all. So, in other words, pi determines w pi, and vice versa. All right, so this is an old theorem. All right, so this is an old theorem. So the goal is as follows. So suppose pi and pi prime is a pair of discrete series representations, and we assume that it satisfies the Gang-Gross-Prossade criterion. So there is a pairing for this pair of discrete series and this pair of unitary groups. So here's the problem. Here's a problem. Suppose q of pi is equal to q of pi prime. Otherwise, there's somehow no question that can be asked. Then we find finite dimensional representations not necessarily irreducible of the parabolic subgroups P, capital, gothic P and capital Gothic P prime, such that there is such that there is a P prime invariant homomorphism from W to W prime, unique, and such that the natural restriction on cohology in degree Q is an isomorphism of one-dimensional spaces. Now let me back up a little bit. In the result that I'm going to report, this W prime is in fact an irritable. W prime is in fact an irreducible representation of P prime. That is to say, it's a representation of K prime. So then this is this fits, then this is precisely the one that has been determined uniquely by Schmidt's theorem. But on the other hand, capital W is not necessarily irreducible. And we're going to be looking at specific examples where. Examples where we can say something. Why do we want to see? Why do we care about this? Well, these spaces, I'm going to get back to it toward the end. These spaces are just as when you calculate the cohomology of a locally symmetric space, the topological cohomology of a locally symmetric space is computed. Computed by Matsushima's formula in terms of relatively algebraic cohomology for GK cohomology, where W is now a representation of the group G, the coherent cohomology of Shimura varieties is calculated in terms of the decomposition of space of automorphic forms, and then it comes down to computations like this. Computations like this. So, what I really want to understand, what we really want to understand, is when this restriction of comology, when this restriction specifically is related to a restriction of comology of Shimur varieties. And let me say at the outset that as far as I know, As far as I know, in no case, in no interesting case, I should, I can regret, I may eventually regret this, but in no interesting case, do these restriction problems correspond to non-trivial restrictions of cohomology of the Shamura variety. And the reason for that, certainly for discrete series, is that the discrete series cohomology and discrete series pi contributes to. Discrete series pi contributes to cohomology in the middle degree of the Shimura variety for U RS, which is R times S. And pi prime contributes in degree R minus one times S. So there's no way that you can get a non-trivial restriction on GK cohomology. Here the Q, here the degree would, if we were looking at GK cohomology, this would be in degree Rs, and this would be in degree R minus one. Rs and this would be in degree r minus one times s unless s equals zero, which is somehow not really a problem. But on the other hand, there are many cases, not the majority, where you can get non-trivial restrictions for PK cohomology. So there is the simplest case. The simplest case is where both capital where script W and script W prime are actually irreducible representations of K. So that says, so in that case, in that case, this says that there's a homomorphism over K prime from W to W prime, which means that W prime is a constituent of the restriction of the representation of UR. Of U R cross U S to U R minus one cross U S. It's an irreducible, say it's an irreducible representation. Then that such restriction comes down to restriction of representations of compact unitary groups, and that is determined by the branching formula, the classical branching formula, in this case from U R to U R minus one. And the US factors have to better be the same. So suppose pi and pi prime are always discrete series, and suppose w and w prime are irreducible, they're determined uniquely by pi and pi prime. And if they satisfy this condition, these are, remember, one-dimensional spaces, then we call pi and pi prime an elementary pair. So I'm going to start by characterizing elementary pairs in terms of the decorations. Decorations of Hongyu He. So, Hongyu He proved the GGP conjecture for discrete series of unitary groups explicitly in terms of the parameters and by introducing decorations. So, pi and pi prime are the ones for which this is the case. And remember, q of pi had better. Is the case and remember q of pi had better be equal to q of pi prime in order for there to be such a map at all? And then pi and pi prime is called a coherent pair without this condition, but where the decorations are the same. So let me tell you about the decorations. Well, first, the conjecture is very roughly a conjecture with my collaborators, Birkit and Toshi, that if pi and pi prime is a coherent. Or that if pi and pi prime is a coherent pair, then we can find w and w prime that solve the above problem. Now it's not unique, even if we add the assumption that they're indecomposable as representations of p and p prime. There's a more ambitious conjecture. We can choose w to be an irreducible representation of g and w prime an irreducible. And W prime and irreducible G prime subrepresentation. And this is known in some examples. This is not actually what I mean. I really mean that W is a tensor product of an irreducible representation of G with an irreducible representation of K, and likewise, where G prime. And either version has applications to special values of L functions. So another, this is not a conjecture, but an expectation is that there is an optimal. Is that there is an optimal pair w and w prime solving the above problem, or there's a natural way to construct w and w prime starting from the coherent pair pi and pi prime. So let me get to the decorations. Some notation for discrete series outpackets. So an irreducible finite dimensional representation of U of V or of G L N is corresponds to its Corresponds to its infinitesimal character, which is if n is odd, it's a descending, strictly descending n-tuple of integers. And if n is even, a strictly descending n-tuple of half integers. So this is the infinitesimal character. And then the Vaughan discrete series L packet with this infinitesimal character has two to the n members. N choose r of them belong to the inner form. Of them belong to the inner form URS. These are in one-to-one correspondence with characters of z mod 2z to the n, which are the same thing as n tuples of sines, and the sines are either pluses or minuses. By the way, there's more than one one-to-one correspondence, and the one which I will be describing may not be the one that you have in mind. May not be the one that you have in mind, so keep that watch out for that. So, if the number of plus signs is R, and then the number of minus signs is S, and then pi belongs to the L packet for U R S. All right. Now, Hurst decorations use, let's say, plain pluses and minuses for the bigger group and For the bigger group and round pluses and minuses for the smaller group. So let's choose the infinitesimal character for the smaller group. And now we are going to decorate the lambda i's. Now we decorate the lambda i pluses with the signs corresponding to pi. Remember, these are. pi remember these are the these are there are r plus s signs r of them being pluses and they are in a certain order and the so we decorate them with that corresponding order and then the lambda i pluses and the lambda j prime pluses are all distinct because one set the even one set is even and the other one degree Even and the other one degree is even the other one is odd, and the even ones are half integers, and the odd ones are integers, so there's no overlap. So then we take the signs, we forget the signs momentarily, and we just write all of these integers in descending order. So some of the lambda i primes are in between some of the lambda, lambda, lambda. Lambda J prime pluses are in between the Lambda I pluses. And there can be a lot of space in between successive, there can be a lot of space in between Lambda 1 plus and Lambda 2 plus for Lambda I, Lambda J prime pluses. So we do that. And then we denote the decorations by delta and delta prime. And And Hong Yuhe reformulates the GGP injector by forgetting the parameters, the conjecture, the condition that there is an invariant pairing only cares about the order, the sequence of sines. There are two n minus one signs, which are the decorations. Okay, so remember. Decorations. Okay, so remember, as I said, the GGP conjecture states that for each pair, lambda plus, lambda prime plus, there's a unique pair in the Vogan discrete series L packet. Oh, this, excuse me, this should be U R minus 1s pi pi prime. And then the dimension is one. And this was the fact that the uniqueness was proved by Buzzard Plessy and Hong Kuhood identified it. And Hong Yi Hood identified the pair in terms of the decorations. And here's the theorem. So the homomorphism is non-zero if and only if, ignoring the lambda i's and lambda j primes, looking only at the sequence of signs, the adjacent pairs all belong to this collection. So in other words, a big, a plus can be next to a minus on either side. It can be next to a round plus. It can be next to a round plus, but a plus cannot be next to a round minus. A minus cannot be next to a round plus. That's the condition. All right, you better see some examples. So suppose s equals zero, then all the signs are pluses. And what do we, we can't, we cannot have two ordinary pluses next to each other. We cannot have two round pluses next to each other. Uh, round pluses next to each other, so they have to alternate. And this, then, uh, this, this should, sorry, um, this this is a misprint. So the lambda, this should be a lambda plus prime one. This should be a lambda plus prime n minus one. And that says that this sequence of decorations corresponds. Decorations correspond to the alternating, the interlacing of the infinitesimal parameters. And that's precisely the classical branching rule for restrictions of representations of compact un to compact un minus one. So that's a familiar example. Let's look at the holomorphic discrete series. Well, we check that the The representation with a given decoration delta belongs to the holomorphic discrete series if and only if its decoration starts with all minuses and then followed by all pluses. And this corresponds to the parameter going like this. This is the highest chandra parameter. The higher-chandra parameter. The Harris Chandra parameter is a permutation of the infinitesimal character. So the last R's, the last R elements come at the beginning, and then the S, the first S come at the end. And then one checks that the only That the only so that means you have a bunch of minuses now. By the way, if you take a holomorphic discrete series of URS and you restrict it to U R minus 1s, then it's been known for a long time that this decomposes discretely as a sum. This restriction decomposes discretely as a sum of holomorphic discrete series. No other discrete series in the restriction. So So the lambda primes had also better have first round minuses and then round pluses. And here, the only way to get a decoration compatible with this is to start with all the minuses in this order. Then you have an extra plus, undecorated plus, because r is greater than r plus one. So r minus one of these and r of the undecorated ones. And this is the only way to get them. Only way to get them to have a legitimate decoration. So this shows that HU's result on the decorations is compatible with what was already known, that only holomorphic discrete series occur in the restriction. And as I said, yes, I said this is well known. Now, there are some inequalities, which Which which remember this the sequence of signs corresponds to the to the sequence of parameters, the interlacing, and the fact that there are inequalities implicit in this sequence of decorations. And in fact, it corresponds to an old result of Jakobson and Vern. The calculation of the restriction of a holomorphic discrete series to a subgroup can be done in complete generality by Jakobson and Ferron, at least far from the wall. But far, at least far from the walls. And the same thing happens for anti-holomorphic. So here is what this is that these are the decorations for a restriction of anti-holomorphic representations. And you see, this is a horizontal mirror reflection of this one. So this is natural because the complex conjugation acting on the Hermitian symmetric spaces exchanges holomorphic and anti-holomorphic representations. Representations. All right. Now, there are some other cases that I can write down. But first, let me tell you how to compute the index, the cohomological degree in which the d bar cohomological degree in which pi contributes. Well, Q is equal to zero if all the minuses are to the left of all the pluses. Q is the top if all of the pluses. Q is the top if all the pluses are to the left of all the minuses, which we've seen on the previous slide. And in general, Q is a sum over the pluses of the number of minuses to its right. So the more pluses on the left, the bigger the Q. And each elementary pair corresponds to a specific pair of decorations in Hu's sense. So here is the case. Here is the case of restriction of holomorphic forms for u21, u11. So, as we've already seen it, the minuses are on the left and the pluses on the right, and there's an extra normal plus. But if q and q prime equal to one, then you see that this is the only pairing that satisfies Hose's rules for the Are his rules for the decoration? The plus, this plus is has a it does not touch around minus, and it doesn't touch another plus. So this other plus has is is banished all the way to the end, which by the way is always going to be the case. This plus is always going to be all the way at the end. So now we consider. So here's how it goes. The i-th round plus has to be between plus has to be between the ith and i plus first, normal plus, but the jth round minus has to be between the j minus first and the jth minus. So we say that the pair with these decorations is a coherent pair. If the signs numbered in the obvious way, so we index the first sign up plus one, the second one plus two, and so on. Two and so on. And first minus sign is minus one. And it's a coherent pair if the signs satisfy this. In other words, this is so this translates into a condition on inequalities of the parameters in certain order. And then we check that every elementary pair is coherent. That's good. So here are the three possible decorations for U21. possible decorations for U21, as we've seen, minus plus, plus, plus, plus, minus, and plus, minus, plus. That's it. So the holomorphic one, the anti-holomorphic, and the generic, as you know, there are three discrete series representations for U2. For U11, the maximum possible is R times S. R times S is two here. R minus one times S is one. So it's not possible for Q prime to equal. It's not possible for q prime to equal two. So this is the interlacing pattern that I already showed you. Plus one, round plus one, round minus one, minus one, and plus two. So the decoration is the same thing as the haris chandra parameter in the Vogon L packet, and it corresponds to a choice of. To a choice of positive vial chamber for G in a chosen in a fixed positive chamber for K. So one characterization is that if delta delta prime is a coherent decoration, then the chamber for prime is necessarily compatible with that of pi. So specifically, if you let phi nc if you let phi nc plus of delta denote the set of positive non-compact roots for this RS-Chandra parameter, then the sets of positive non-compact roots have to match for pi and pi prime. This is a severe restriction. This usually does not happen. It's roughly one nth of the One nth of the cases of where this happens. So as n goes to infinity, the set of these coherent pairs goes to zero. The proportion goes to zero. This is a necessary condition. It's not sufficient. Here is a condition, a complete characterization. So, suppose we have a pair of discrete series representations, and suppose consider a second pair, which I forgot to say, sigma sigma prime, with the same decorations, but suppose it is, oh yeah, okay. And let mu and mu prime denote the Blattner parameters of sigma and sigma prime, so then pi pi prime. So then pi pi prime is a coherent pair if and only if there exists a sigma sigma prime. This is what's missing. If and only if there exists a sigma sigma prime that satisfies the following equivalent properties. First, the minimal k-type of sigma prime is contained in that of sigma and the non-compact positive roots match are equal. match are equal or alternatively the Schmidt representation w sigma is prime is contained in the in the restriction of w sigma to k prime in other words sigma sigma prime is an elementary pair so you have a coherent pair if and only if there's an elementary pair with the same decoration so this so this uh there is missing so please if you're taking notes this is this is missing this condition is missing This is missing. This condition is missing. So here's the conjecture. So, suppose you have a coherent pair, in particular, it is there is an invariant invariant homomorphism. Then, first of all, there is an elementary pair corresponding to the Latiner parameters, which here, instead of being called mu, are called lambdas, capital lambdas, with the same decorations. capital lambdas with the same decorations as pi pi prime. And assuming the infinitesimal characters of pi and pi prime are sufficiently regular, and it should be just that the as minimally additionally regular, they're not only not on the walls, but they're some minimal distance from the walls. And we can choose it. We may choose an elementary pair sigma sigma prime as above and a pair of irreducible representations. And a pair of irreducible representations of G, finite dimensional representations of G and G prime such that F prime is contained in the restriction of F to G prime. In other words, it satisfies the branching formula for G Ln to G Ln minus one. And the pair sigma and sigma prime are obtained from the pair pipe and pi. From the pair pi and pi prime by a certain translation functor, which generalizes Zuckerman translation, in such a way as to induce a non-trivial map on D-bar cohomology in the degree Q, which is the common cohomological degree for all of these representations. So, in other words, if there's a coherent pair, if you have an elementary pair, then there is such a map without the F and F prime. And the conjecture is that there is a map with if you translate the w's by the f's. And this has a meaning in coherent cohomology of Shimur varieties. So here's the conjecture. It's been more or less verified. Yes. I thought that you are the 25 or the 35, perhaps. Or the 35, perhaps could you sort of uh speed up? You perhaps uh we have oh, yeah, yeah, oh, we want it to be a four, a 45-minute talk, not yeah, 40 minutes. But I think we thought about it long. A 40-minute talk. Oh, sorry, I don't think I noticed that restriction. All right, let me let me speed it up. Okay, so you've been, it's been general, it's been verified, and it is the realization on the map on comology of Shimura varieties. More varieties. By the way, the last pages are optional. They were designed to be. So, in other words, if there is such an F prime, then there is a map on comology of Shimura varieties. And the point is that these have rational structures over some number field, which means that the periods in the Ichino-Ikeda formula are actually algebra. Are actually algebraic numbers for good choices of f and f prime. So that's the aim. And here is a diagram. Another way of looking at it is that we want to, so here is the theorem. Suppose we define an equivalence relation by assuming that there is. Assuming that there are maps that are non-zero. Then the theorem is that we can always, if you stick with a decoration, then all the coherent pairs with the decoration are equivalent under this relation. And furthermore, we can always take f prime to be the one-dimensional trivial representation. So, in other words, we can assume that pi prime is equal to Assume that pi prime is equal to sigma prime. And we can always we can relate the pair pi pi prime, the pair sigma sigma prime by diagrams of this kind. Okay. So here's a simpler conjecture. So suppose you have a coherent pair and an elementary pair where the sigma prime is the same as the pi prime, then we have the following commutative diagram of one-dimensional cohomology spaces. One-dimensional cohomology spaces. So that's the conjecture. That's what we're working on now. So if we have this diagram of one-dimensional spaces, then and this, there's already, we know there's an isomorphism, and there's an isomorphism here. We get an isomorphism here by without this label. This label. And so the conjecture is that this, the top, so there certainly is, if this is a one-dimensional, these are all one-dimensional spaces, and this is given by an elementary pair, then there's certainly a map. And the conjecture is that this map is given by the natural G prime invariant restriction maps. So, in other words, that this is compatible with. So, in other words, that this is compatible with the calculation of coherent cohomology. So, let me just ask: maybe the Dyn-Gross-Prossade conjecture for unitary groups can be supplemented by the following question. Suppose you have a homorphism, and you have the minimal blatner type. Have the minimal Blattner types. Is there an optimal K-type in the bigger representation? Well, we know that the minimal K-type of the smaller representation is included in the image. So the question is, can we find an optimal K-type in the bigger representation that maps onto the Blatiner type of the smaller representation? In other words, can it be taken at a minimal distance from you and in a Minimal distance from you and in a direction determined by the decorations. So that's an open question. And I guess I can skip the part about the Shimura varieties. Maybe I go quickly to go back to the formula. So the upshot, if in the case of the formula, The upshot, if in the case of coherent pairs, is that the numerator of this identity can be taken to be an algebraic number. And this gives a formula for special values, this central value of the L function in terms of data that are already known. So I guess I should stop here. Any questions from the classroom? You have computer function for many platforms that are geometric over class biarchy or symmetric space? I'm sorry, I didn't. Could somebody repeat that because I didn't hear it? Yeah, can you can you sort of yeah start with the face ahead? Yeah, can you? You can face that idea. Yeah, so you are conditioned on many plus or combinatory conditions on plus or minus geometric over symmetric space or flag varieties. Oh, you mean a HERS decoration condition? Yes. Yes. I don't see it. I don't see it. I don't see it. It's possible, but I haven't seen that. I think that would be nice to see such a condition. Thank you. This is about variety of KCO. So we have two flood varieties for the diagnostics and this is on the massive conditions of two. Is there an was that an answer to the question? Yeah, yeah. And your co-author has answered the questions. Yeah. Oh, I see. Well, I would like to know the answer to that also. Michael, I have a question. What is the relationship of this work with your earlier work with Steve Kudra? Is that in the case of this the same kind of question with sort of U22, U21? The U22, U21. Oh, okay. My paper with Kudler is on the symplectic groups. Oh, symplectic group. So we have symplectic groups, and that's in some sense, there is a direct relation between that work and I mean, I've been told by Dick Gross that that was a very good thing. That was part of the evidence for the Gun-Gross-Prassad conjecture, the original Gross-Prassad paper for orthogonal groups. Although we were thinking about a symplectic 2 SL2 plus SL2. And one of the, we were interested, in fact, in taking, these were elementary pairs. So we looked at the restriction. So, we looked at the restriction of an elementary pair in that case. So, you can think of it O32 to O22. And there were all these other cases that did not correspond to restrictions of coherent homology that showed up as a result of the calculations. And Steve thought that was important to mention. And I was, since my aim at the time was to understand the arithmetic, I wasn't looking at that, but it turns out that it's an important part of the conjecture. Those other cases that do not have anything to do with coherent cohomology, they are still a unique period invariant, but it is not an algebraic number. Number. One can prove, at least heuristically, that whatever the pair is, this number has to depend only on pi and pi prime. And it's the cases that the coherent cases where you expect this number to be algebraic, and otherwise it's something else. And the reason for that other number, those other invariants, which have something to do with the Which have something to do with the geometry of the hypothetical motive attached to the automorphic representations is still mysterious. Okay, thank you. Yeah. Michael, since we are running out of time, we'll just let's just thank Michael again and before the rest of the question to the co-authors if they have any questions. Yes, and I will ask my co-author to explain the answer to that. Thank you.
