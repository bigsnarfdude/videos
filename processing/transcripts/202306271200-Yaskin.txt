So, this is a joint work with Mark Agranovsky, Alexander Koldowski, and Dmitry Rabogin. Okay, so before I talk about analogs of polynomiant integrable bodies in even dimensions, let me first tell you the whole story about polynomial Whole story about polynomially integrable bodies, where they come from, and what these bodies are. So, we'll start with the following with the following definition. So, suppose you have a convex body in Rn and And C is a unit vector, then the parallel section function section function of K in the direction C is a function of Of one real variable. So A, K, C. It's a function of T, which gives you the volume, n minus one dimensional volume of the intersection of K with the hyperplane Xipure plus T C. Tick C. Okay, so Xipure. Okay, so Xi Pure is the central hyperplane orthogonal to Xi, and this gives you a shift by T units in the direction of Xi, right? So here's a picture, your body K. Then you have a direction of Xi. Let's say the origin is here. This is going to be Xi perp, right? And then you shift. Right, and then you shift C pure in the direct uh sorry C is like this and then you shift this hyperplane in the direction Xi and you have this intersection here right this is this distance between these two hyperplanes is t. You measure this area and this is precisely this function t. So clearly this So clearly this function A. Clearly this function A has a compact support, right? Because for T large enough, there is no intersection with the body, right? So the support of this function is just an interval. And let's make some simple observations. Observation. So, the first observation is that if you take the Euclidean ball ball of radius, let's say R. Then, what's this parallel section function? Here's the origin. So, you want to compute The area of this section at distance t from the origin, so it's again a ball n minus one-dimensional, and the radius of this ball will be what square root of r squared minus t squared, right? So in any dimension, in any direction xi, in any direction x, this function has this form. Has this form. Some constant, which depends on n, times this radius to the power n minus 1, right? r squared minus t squared to the power n minus 1 over 2. So, and again, this is true when t is absolute value of t is less than or equal to r. t is less than or equal to r on the support of this function a right otherwise for larger values of t the the function is here and again using this formula and applying a linear transformation you can you can show that for ellipsoids for ellipsoids you have something similar so for ellipsoids it's going to So, for ellipsoids, it's going to be this parallel section function, it's going to be of this form. Again, you'll have a constant which depends on the dimension. Then you'll have the volume of the ellipsoid. You'll have the support function of the ellipsoid to the power negative n in the direction x. But then you'll have again such a factor. A factor h squared support function in the direction you see minus t squared to the power t squared to the power n minus one. Okay, so for the ellipsoids it's it's of the same structure. So what's the main observation here? If n if n is odd, then Then n minus 1 over 2 is going to be an integer, right? Here and here. So this is a polynomial in t so if n is odd, this is a polynomial in t again on its support because then it's it's just zero, this one. Then it's just zero. This function is just zero. Now, if n is even, you'll just get square roots, right? So this is not a polynomial. It's not a polynomial. So this was a much This was a motivation for Agronovsky to introduce the following concept. So we say that convex body K in Rn, or more generally, instead of a convex body. Generally, instead of a convex body, you can consider bounded domains. So a convex body K in Rn is polynomially polynomially integrable. Let's see, let's use PI for short. PI for short. Polynomial integral integrable if this parallel section function a k c of t is a polynomial on its support. So it's of this form for all All C and T such that this hyperplane C perb plus T X C intersects K. So this is a definition of polynomial integral inverse. Polynomial integral embodies. Okay. And Agronovsky asked for characterizations of such bodies. So we already observed above that polynomials in odd dimensions are polynomially integrable, but is it true that Is it true that these are the only examples of polynomially integrable bodies? Okay, so is it true that the only PI bodies are ellipsoids in odd dimensions. So it's an odd dimensions. Okay, so this is the question, and I will answer this question a little later, but what was the main motivation for Agranovsky? So let me say a few words about the history of About the history of related problems. So, in addition to this parallel section function, you can also consider the function that gives you the volumes of these cutoff pieces, right? So, if this is the hyperplane C perp plus T, you can denote. You can denote this volume by V plus, see, it goes in this direction, see, V plus and V minus, V minus. Okay, so the two volumes into which this hyperplane splits the body, right? So D plus is just the integral from T to infinity of this parallel section. Infinity of this parallel section function and v minus is corresponding with the volume of the other piece. So you have these cutoff volumes, and we say that a body K is a body. Is algebraically integrable if these cutoff volumes are algebraic functions algebraic functions Functions of the variables C1, CN, and the variable T. So in other words, i.e. there is a polynomial, polynomial, let's call it capital F of M plus two variables. n plus two variables such that such that these functions satisfy such a polynomial equation again for all c for all c and For all Xi and for all T, such that this hyperplane C pure plus T X C has non-empty intersection with the body. Okay, so this is the definition of algebraically integrable bodies. So in particular, V of T is algebraically. V of t is algebraic if it's a polynomial in t, right? So if it's a polynomial in t, then its derivative, which is this parallel section function, is also polynomial in t and vice versa. So Agronovsky's question is essentially a question about a particular Is a question about a particular type of such borders, algebraically integrable. So I guess first studies of such bodies go back to Newton, Isaac Newton. It's 1687. So Newton showed that Newton showed that in R2 there are no algebraically integrable convex bodies smooth boundaries. Smooth boundaries. This is a more modern formulation of his result, and his initial motivation was rooted in applications into motion of planets. Then three Then, three centuries later, Arnold, Vladimir Arnold asked for extensions. Extensions of this result to higher dimensions and to general domains and to. General domains and to general domains, not necessarily convex. Okay, and he conjectured that the only such domains should be ellipsoids in odd dimensions. So, his conjecture was partially solved by Vassiliev. Let's see this. Let's see, this is 2015. 2015. So, in even-dimensional spaces, he proved in even dimensional spaces, let me write it as R to N, there are no algebraically integrable bounded domains. With um smooth boundaries. But again, the question is still open in odd dimensions, and that's why Agranovsky was interested in this question, and that's why he introduced polynomial integrable bodies as a particular case of. bodies as a particular case of algebraically integrable bodies. Well, it's actually more it's not really a particular case because here we don't put any assumptions on the on these functions a m. They are just functions of xi, but not necessarily polynomials or algebraic functions. These are just continuous functions. So this is, so to say, more general than the particular case. More general than the particular case of Arnold's conjecture. If this makes any sense. Okay, so let's go back to polynomially integrable bodies back to PI Apologies. So Agranovsky. Prove the following: that there are no bounded domains, polynomial integrable domains with smooth boundaries in even dimensions. Even dimensions for 2n. And he also showed that in odd dimensions, such PI bodies should be convex. Okay, so the problem was reduced to the class of convex bodies. And then shortly afterwards, together with Koldovsky and Mirkuriev, we completed this the characterization of such bodies. So in odd dimensions, In odd dimensions the only PI convex bodies with smooth boundaries there is our ellipsoids. Are ellipsoids? Okay, so this problem was completely solved. Before I talk about the analog of this problem in odd dimensions, let me sketch the proof of this result just to give you some. Just to give you some ideas so that you'll understand what to do in this other case. So, what's the idea of the proof? Okay, since this parallel section function is a polynomial in T. Is a polynomial in T. We have that for, well, first of all, let's assume that the origin is an interior point of k simply because this property of polynomial integrability is invariant under translations, right? So we'll assume that zero is an interior point of k. And then our parallels. Parallel section function is a polynomial of t, then the derivatives of this parallel section function at zero should be zero for all m large enough, large enough enough, right? Since this is just a polynomial. Since this is just a polynomial. Now, we know a lot about the derivatives of this parallel section function. In particular, these derivatives can be written in the form of Fourier transforms. So these are equal to, okay, some constant that depends on. Okay, some constant that depends on m and n times the Fourier transform of the following. So I have the Minkowski functional of the body k computed at x to the power minus n plus minus n plus n plus 1. Then I have here a coefficient that depends on Here, a coefficient that depends on parity of m okay. So, I have this thing here. I take the Fourier transform of this thing in the sense of distributions. And it's actually, if the body is smooth, this is the Fourier transform is actually an infinitely smooth function. And I computed at xc. Okay. Okay, so this Fourier transform is actually equal to zero at xi. So xi lives on the sphere, but by homogeneity you can extend it to the whole Rn without the origin. So by homogeneity, this is also true for all such C, except the origin. So this means that this whole Fourier transform is a distribution that has Is a distribution that has that is supported at the origin, and we know that such distributions can only be finite combinations of derivatives of the delta function. So this whole Fourier transform is equal to derivatives of the delta function. When you apply the Fourier transform again to both sides, what do you get? You get that in the left-hand side. That in the left-hand side you recover this function, but in the right-hand side, since the right-hand side is a derivative of the delta function, when you take the Fourier transform, you get the polynomial. You get the polynomial of x. Let's denote it like this: p m of x. Like this, Pm of X. Okay, so all these for all m large enough, large enough you get this property, and then well, in particular, already from here, it's clear that there are no polynomially integrable bodies. Polynomially integrable bodies in even dimensions, right? Let's see. If n is even, take m also even, then what do you get? Then this function here will be even, right? Because it's of the form f of x plus f of minus x. f of minus x. It's an even function. But on the other hand, the degree here is going to be even, even plus one. So the degree of this polynomial is odd, right? On the other hand, it's odd. But the degree is odd. It's odd. So it's an odd function. Odd function, and since the only odd function which is both odd and even, it's the zero function, we get a contradiction. There are no such bodies, right? So, but then, so as I said, in even dimensions, it's now clear from this that there are no polynomial integrable bodies for odd dimensions. You need some You need some algebraic arguments to conclude that this equality for all m large enough gives you the following, that you can actually solve those equations and write this Minkowski functional in this form, where p of x is linear. Where p of x is a linear, linear function. And this is a quadratic polynomial. Quadratic polynomial. And then it's, I mean, it's easy to see that if your Minkowski functional is of this form, then it's an ellipsoid. Then k is an ellipsoid. So, this is kind of the main idea of the proof of this result about polynomial integrable bodies. Now, as I said, I wanted to talk about analogs of this result in even dimensions. So, in even dimensions, such bodies don't exist. But on the other hand, let's see what we can actually prove. See what we can actually prove. So back to even dimensions. For the Euclidean ball, the parallel section function, if you recall, it's of this form r squared minus t squared. r squared minus t squared to the power n minus one over two. So it's not a polynomial, but it's not far from being a polynomial. It's of this form. So if you separate this factor, which is polynomial, times this factor. Then for the Euclidean ball. For the Euclidean ball and ellipsoids, this function is actually of this form, right? You have a polynomial times the square root of a quadratic polynomial, right? Polynomial of degree two. You have a polynomial times the square root of a quadratic polynomial. Of a quadratic polynomial. So we asked the following question. So characterize, characterize those bodies for which this parallel section function has. This parallel section function has this form. You have a function of two variables, which is a polynomial in t times the square root of another function of two variables, which is also a polynomial of t of degree two. So polynomial in t and this is also polynomial polynomial in t On L in T of degree two. Okay, so we mimic this situation that we have for the Euclidean ball or ellipsoids. So our goal is to characterize these bodies. May I ask a question? Yeah. So can you go a little bit up? So we as can you as you define this algebraically integrable This algebraically integrable function of bodies such that there is a polynomial that for fixed t direction, we have a polynomial dependencies. But I mean, the function for the Euclidean ball or this or of even dimension, that the quadra-squared function is polynomial. Yes. Polynomial, yes, but then you have a polynomial dependencies, so this, yeah, that's a good question. So, remark, remark a squared of t is a polynomial. Oh, but then it's uh but then it's uh algebraically integrable, which contradicts Newton. Which contradicts Newton because you define there is a polynomial such that you put. But for Newton's result, it's the cutoff volume function. It's not this function. Okay, thank you. Yeah, if you just take this function for the Euclidean ball in dimension 2, or 2, then you'll get constant times the square root of 1 minus, or r squared minus t squared. So when you integrate this function, you'll get arc sines, whatever, right? The volume function is not algebraic. Yes. But a squared is a polynomial. But a squared is a polynomial. Okay, so our goal is now to characterize such bodies. And this is our main result here. As I said, it's joint with Mark Agranovsky. Alexander Koldovsky and Dmitry Rabogin. So we proved that this property, this property here is equivalent. Is equivalent to the property that the Hilbert transform the Hilbert transform of the parallel section function is a polynomial Again, it's a polynomial close to the origin, near the origin. And this is equivalent to K being and ellipsoid. So it again in even dimensions. So this property that I described above, this property here characterizes ellipsoids in even dimensions. In the remaining whatever, five minutes, let me say a few words about the proof. Again, Again, the proof will essentially use those ideas above. So the first step is to use some local analysis near the boundary to show that this function here inside the square root is actually. Inside the square root, it's actually of this form. So it's some function of xi times the support function at x minus t times the support function of minus x c plus t. As I said, this is just local analysis near. Is just local analysis near the boundary. Okay, so we have we know what this function q inside the square root looks like. Step two, what does it have to do with the Hilbert transform? So the Hilbert transform of, let's say, of a function f, h f of t. Of t is defined as we have a constant here, and then we have the principal value of this integral f of s divided by t minus s d s. So we'll apply the Hilbert transform to our function, the A, our parallel section function. So what do we know about What do we know about some properties of the Hilbert transform? So, if you have the characteristic function of the interval 1,1, negative 1, 1, times the square root of such a function, and you computed it t, you get a linear function t. Again, this is true on the interval. Again, this is true on the interval negative 1, 1. Here we're actually talking about the so-called finite Hilbert transforms. So it's a linear function. Now, if you make a change of variables, you can do it on any interval. Any interval AB and it's a very good thing. Any interval a b, and it's still a linear function, t minus the average of these two values. Okay, now what's the behavior of the Hilbert transform when you multiply when you have a function phi and you multiply it by s. So it acts as follows. You just multiply by t the Hilbert transform of this function phi. Of this function phi, and minus a constant which is which is like this. So in other words, the Hilbert transform of a polynomial, of a polynomial in S times this function, characteristic function of the interval a b times this square root. B times the square root S minus A It's a polynomial is a polynomial polynomial in T and our parallel section function is of this form, right? So H of K C of T is also polynomial. C of t is also polynomial. And then we apply this Fourier transform ideas to compute the derivatives of this function and at zero, at zero or too large enough. And it turns out that the formulas are almost the same as above. So we have the Fourier transform. Fourier transform of such a thing, except here instead of the plus sign, I have the minus sign. Uri transform at xi. Okay, so this and this, since this is a polynomial, this Hilbert transform is a polynomial, you get that this is zero outside the toe origin. And now this is. Outside the door. And now the situation is almost the same as above, except because of this minus sign, we actually what we had in even dimensions, we now have in odd dimensions and vice versa. And so you can just apply the method above to complete the proof. And okay, I think time is up. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Any question? Thank you very much. I have a couple rather technical questions. One is that when you can you hear me well, no, not really. Yeah, is it better now? Yes, much better. Yes. Perfect. Okay, thanks. So two rather technical questions. So, two rather technical questions. One is that when you define this notion polynomially integrable, then do you assume or does it follow immediately without assuming it that these polynomials for the different xi have a bounded degree? So, that it's not possible that for one xi you have a quadratic, for another xi, it's cubic and so on, and then the degree. Big and so on, and then the degree goes to infinity. Right, you're asking about this degree here. Yes, exactly. Yes, so it's a very good question. So, in the initial definition of Agranovsky, he said that there is a positive integer and capital size, that this is true. So, in his definition, integer for our degree is the same for. Integer for all the degree is the same for all in all the in all directions. But actually, during this semester in Providence, Volberg explained that actually there are no bodies for which this degree n can be different. So it's actually true that it should be the same. It's actually true that it should be the same for all the so if in the definition I allow it to depend on psi, even then there will be like a common upper bound. Yeah, yeah. Thanks. And I have another question. If you can scroll to your previous proof, like not this one, but the proof of that previous theorem, that then you say that in the even case, fx plus f minus x is even. Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah, right, uh, right here. And then you say, but the degree is odd. Why is the degree odd? So M is so my M is even. I take M is even. N is even. So this degree is odd. So it's a polynomial of odd degree. This is a homogeneous polynomial here. Homogeneous polynomial here of this degree. Ah, okay. Uh-huh. Thanks. Okay. So it's a polynomial of an odd degree, which is which is an even function. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right. Got it. Thanks. Okay. Any other question? Yeah, it's Grisha again. So, in general, you kind of In general, you kind of found a way of cooking from your function of certain type a polynomial. Yeah, so you apply this Hilbert. But in general, this approach can be, can you extend it to a more general class of functions? At the moment, no, I don't see how to extend it to more general class. And for example, this For example, this I don't know. So again, with this Newton, where you compute the volumes, yes, as I understand, not of the section, but of the part. And it's solved, it's settled down, yeah, that the conjecture is completely solved, as you explained. Newton's, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's it's still open in um it's still open in odd dimensions yeah but but for example But for example, I mean, if you have a polynomial, you have a polynomial times the square root of quadratic that you can integrate and you understand the class of function that we have. Yes. So, but I mean, then can you say that if we integrate this function, we have a certain type. I mean, it's kind of restrict Newton problems for a certain class of functions. Certain class of functions that not integral, but I don't know, some hypergeometric function or whatever. Okay, you can say it in this way, but it's not the original question. But at least it would cover some cases, yes. Yeah, yeah. But have have you done something like this? Done something like this, right? At least? What we have done is this is what I presented here. Thank you. Yeah. Any other question? Hi. So what happens with fewer directions? happens with fewer directions so you need this hypothesis for all directions xi but if you have um i don't know fewer not all of them not this polynomial equality is not for every direction but for many of them maybe a dense subset or something like that well you make a subset is the same as all okay so in that for that but what about a maybe i know countable many is that trivial it's not true i don't think it's true I don't think it's true because you have too little information. Okay. Yeah, I think you can construct bodies which are not ellipsoids, but this is true for finitely many directions. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Any other question? Okay, the online participants. Participants. Thanks again. So the last, sorry. So the last question is: even if you are just missing a small open set of directions? Small open set. I don't know, but I guess in that case, a counterexample may be. Counterexample may be possible. But again, I don't know. But my intuition suggests that there should be a counterexample. Any other question? No, then thanks again for this talk. Okay, thank you very much.
