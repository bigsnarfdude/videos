I want to talk about the transformations of the composition spaces. Well, I mean, the title is a bit too ambitious for what it is, because it's just going to be a bit what Andy already said, that we are going to talk about some kind of maps between the composition spaces where we get the algebra maps. Okay, but first, let me say that. First, let me say a few things about the composition spaces from a dainti point of view, because, as usual, with the composition spaces, definitions are based in like properties of maps, and then we need to introduce them, right? So, we already saw that we use a lot the active energy factorization system in the simplicial category. In the simplicial category, we already know what active and linear maps are, right? So now we are going to consider the interaction between active maps and what we call reduced covers in the simplicial category. A reduced cover tau is given by a set of inner joint subjects. Of inheritanous objectives to wise from ki to k, right? There may be m of them. Each of them has to be bigger or equal than one. And they are a cover, so that is like if your k is like you can see your k as an interval, then your cover is going to do like that, right? Going to do like that, right? So then a reduced covered square on a simplical object is going to be a diagram of this form, right? From the active map, from the active map from K to N, you get a decomposition into the K path, as we saw before, and then this induces a mark. This induce a map in to simplicial objects from the other direction, right? And then the covers, the inner maps of the cover, induce a map from the XK to the product XK1 to XKN and from XN to XN1 to XNN, right? And then Well, here we have that, what we have here is what was already given, but then what we have in here is given by the active inner factorization of the cover, then the active map. So, in case that the alpha is injective, then Is injective, then the cover is reduced again. There are special reduced covers where the m is equal to k and that means that you are covering k just one by one, right? Interval 0, 1 to 0, 1, 1, 2, etc. So this is the reduced covers and And then uh Guillaume the composition space is usually defined as asking by that all active inner squares and purbax. But there are three other equivalent formulations of the composition space, and these three well more or less Well, more or less, they correspond to the three things that Philip listed this morning, right? So you can as well say, I mean, we're not going to prove that, but that's the equivalence that squares of this form for biactive injections and inner maps are pullbacks. Or you can also Or you can also say that in a decomposition space, the special reduced cover squares are pullbacks for every active injection. And k bigger equal than 1. Or you can say that asking for the reduced cover on X to be pullbacks for all active injections and for all reduced covers, not necessarily special, that's also a way of doing. That's also a way of defining the composition space. So you see that properties one and two correspond to asking for commutative diagrams of these forms, right? The first one is you get diagrams where you ask for alphas here to be composite of just inert faces and the inert. And the inert just com of course composites of outer phases, right? You don't need to ask for the things about the generalis, because you already know that to signal in place, you need to signal. And for the second definition, what you are going to ask is for having commutative squares of this form, just as we have before, but now. As we had before, but now here is reduce cover. The rows are for reduce, right? So these two forms of diagrams are what tells us about what are the good natural transformations between the composition spaces. So and the reason why they are good for getting For getting then later the maps of algebras and co-algebras is because how they behave with these squares. So we already saw that we call curve the map that for every active mass will get us a pullback square, a fullback neutrality square. And that's what I'm just saying, conservative and unique lifting. Conservative and unique listing of factorizations. And we already saw that F coulf is a composition space saying that y is a composition space. But then now we are going to talk about some other kind of maps that are the ones we call IKEA. The name is maybe not the best name, right? But it's a way of summarizing. It's a way of summarizing these things: inner, can and equivalence on objects. Although the definition doesn't use these concepts, right? We are going to see that that holds, but we are not using them to give the definition. The what the ITO condition is is to ask that for every active map, then the score that we get for the associated, remember you remember that when we had an active map, we had a, and if we had a special discover, then we get this series of maps and of course we are going to get them both in edge and them both in X and Y, right? So if the IKEA condition holds, then that gives a square and this square has to be approved. And this condition is the condition that works well for algebra. So basic properties of Aikio transformations, well if F is Well, if f is IQ, then indeed we don't need to look at these reduced covers for all the k's and n's here. It's enough to look for n bigger or equal than zero to the squares that you get for reduced cover of this form. So then for the case n equals zero, if you look at what this means, this means that This means, this means that you need to have an equivalence between y0 and x0. So, this is already a limitation. And now we are going to see how this compares. Okay, well that is what justifies the equivalence on objects, right? Part of the name. Now we are going to see how this relates. Are going to see how this relates with the inner can part of the name. We know that the map is called inner can relatively single. We have pulver squares with the reduced cover but only using here the product over y0, x0, right? And this says nothing for n equals 0. Now, in case F0 is mono, then I key on inner can are equivalent for n bigger or equal than 1. So that is the justification of the name, right? What happens is that many times we have interesting maps that preserve the convolution product but don't preserve the unit. But don't preserve the unit. In these cases, we don't have the condition of the cumulation objects, but we have the IQ condition for m bigger or equal than 1. And this is the one we call 70AQ. Right, so then we also have a basic property of semi-IKEO map, which says that it would. Which says that if we have a semi-KO simplicial map and X is at the composition space, then I is also at the composition space, of course, even more so if it is IKEO, right? So why is this true? Well, because you can, I mean, we already played a lot with diagrams today, so I don't know if we'll have time to do that as well. To the last word, but the proof is based in noticing that you can expand these squares in this form and that the first square here and the fourth square here are perfect squares because this is a material. Squares because f is a material, this is part of the definition. 3, of course, is a pullback because x is a decomposition space. And okay, so that is saying that 2 is a pullback as well. And well, you need to apply again the principle lemma, and as we put it today a number of times. Right. Right, so then I'm going to give you an example of a map, of a span which has one leg which is ITO and another leg which is GOS. Dos puertada and example. So this is an example for calculations with the composition spaces for symmetric functions. Composition spaces for symmetric functions that we have been working on for a while. Let me remind you a bit how the classical symmetric functions work. The symmetric function algebra, all of you know the definition, you know that it has many bases and the most important one is the monomial basis, where you define the symmetric polynomials that Polynomials that beginning with the power indicated in the indices, right, and all the variable combinations possible. And then the other basis that we are going to talk about is the power sum basis, which is defined in this way for the speed three, then it's all the sum for the third power four variables. This power basis is multiplicative. That means that when we indicate, oh, touch that, that's a button. The decomposition space here, there's some S construction of finite pointed sets or something? Or whatever? No, I mean, there are two ways in which we're going to. I mean there are two ways in which you can do that. Either you can use restriction species or you can use the penny machinery. So I'm going to explain the example we're going to do is constructed from a basis and using the Penny axioms and then from that you get a space of algebra. A space of algebra to algebra. Right? Then I'm just showing this to remind people what the things I'm going to talk about are. So that this is the classical symmetric polynomial. So you know how they multiply, you have the elementary basis, right? And which is also multiplicative. And then, well, on the monomial basis, Well, on the monomial basis, multiplication goes in a different way, and it's also a commultiplication and it's a co-algebra. Now, what happens is that you can define the composition spaces for each of these bases, right? For each of these bases, you can begin with With beginning with the group point of subjections, you have the basis B, as on the explained, as your X1, and then you can define the second space in the algebra or the second space in the co-algebra, depending on the basis, using different groupois of cospines with the surjections. Then in the case of the power bases, you do that asking that in the cospanes of surjections the rows are jointly bijective. It's similar to the covers we explained before, right? And it's the same for the co-prad. Then the cospones I mean each of the cospons corresponds to one of the summons in the expansion of the product of the two subjections at the end. And in the case of the co-product, it corresponds, the subjection in the middle is the coproduct is expanded into the Into the tensor product of the first and the second Earth surjections in the diagram. So that's for the E-bases. For the E-bases, it's very similar for the elementary basis because it's also a multiplicative basis of the algebra, but it was different for the coproduct. In the case of the coproduct, the subjections are the subjections are like you have the the the same uh jointly jointly rejective on the on the top but on the codomain it's just join the subjective, right? Because there are important one ways you can put them. And in the monomial basis, well it's in a sense dual of the elementary basis because you find the cospaths that you found before in the product. In the product, and now in the co-product, and the other way around. Right? Okay, so the example, I mean this is how the product works, right? The example of the map is this kind of change of basis map. I wanted to explain two examples, but I decided that we don't have time. So I'm just going to explain. So I'm just going to explain the case of the elementary basis. In this case, we consider the, I mean in both cases, S1 and S1 are both the group of those projections of finite sets, asomorphous classes labeled both bases and evases. And to define a general evasis, we need to define a linear functor be an span, which has some other Has some other group point in the middle, W1, and this group point is going to be the group point of diagrams of this form. And here, okay, so you have one solidation corresponds to the M side, another sojourn corresponds to the E side, and what you get in the WU proper is an injective map from N to map from n to k times r. This injective map has to be such that when you project both sides, you are going to hit all the elements in K and all the elements in R. The span is actually going to have, I mean the S and the T is just And the T is just projecting onto the edge of junction on each of the spaces. So this corresponds to the change of basis when you see the elementary polynomial index by the subjection K as a sum of all the monomial polynomials for P and the sum is over all such. Is over all such diagrams. So that the projection is appropriate. Okay, so the the difference with the classical case is that in this case the composition space for for the M basis and for the y bases are And portable bases are objectively different, right? And you can describe them from the x2 and the y2 corresponding to each of them that we saw before. And in one case, these cospan can be determined by the span of the cospan, which is the same. Which is the same as giving such a span. In the other case, they are determined by the coil bank speed, and that means that they are determined by a composition of the sword, right? So, in both cases, we get a span of simplicity spaces of LiDAR subjections, that is, restriction species, and And then, well, in general, for general M, the form of the diagrams is like that. In the case of the, this is the M-side, it's association, and then M-lighting in the case of the elementary is association, and M-lighting through. From the domain, and in the case of the change of basis, is as we saw before, the pair of subjections and then a map to the times R plus a ligand as well. Okay, so well, then you see it and check that Acto here is a composition space and that it is ideal over X. And that it is ideal over X and its cos over Y. And that in that case, you get a change of phrases in the objective algebra map from Portuguese one to Portugal Y1. Well, I think I'm gonna have to Questions? So the red thing says that you need the change of basis becomes rotant. Is that what it says? No. No, no. I mean, ah, well, of course, if I can use if I can. Well, of course, if I use, if I take cardinality, then I recover the classical change of basis between elementary basis and the monomial basis. Indeed, well, we get like coefficients, we get coefficients from the from the automotive groups, but they agree with other w with the same to delay obtained. No, the minute signs we don't have because I mean there is one thing that is difficult to get used to with these things: is that the span gives you a map, right? But this map is not But this map is not always a change of basis. It's sometimes a change of basis, and sometimes it's just telling you that some space is inside of another. It is even easier to see in the case of the change of basis between the power basis and the monomial basis, because in that case, you know that this know that this change of basis is only invertible over the rational numbers, right? So when you look at what it says, if you are considering the automorphism factors, then it is very easy. It's just saying that the power basis term is just sum of Is just some of all the monomials that are above it in the refinement order. In the case of the elementary basis, this is an integral change. But still, it is an integral change that is invertible only if you have minus signs. If you don't have minus signs, what happens? Well, you have the You have the elementary polynomials written in terms of the monomials. But you kind of see the elementary polynomials as a subspace of the monomials, not the other way around. Well, um right, it has an interpretation classically, yes. Uh if you look at this particular change of bases, uh the cardinality of it is going to tell you that uh you get coefficients which are the matrices on zeros and ones which have like uh index uh Index on one on the what is on the rows is the partition indicating on the elementary polynomial and on the columns the partition on the monomials. But when you look at that from the objective point of view, then what you are seeing is like like the positions in which you put this n inside of each of the elements of n inside of a grid of k times r. So it's precisely the cardinality of the grid, which is the classical one-zero matrix. Also, and also in this case, this So in this case, this change of basis, this is computed out of rejections only. When you look at the classical change of basis, then, well, you write it in terms of the dominance order and this matrix is is like factors into uh products of Costca Cosca transport matrices, right? Okay, it's a big it's a big mouthful. We would need a whole introduction to symmetry. I'm very sorry. I mean, that's how it is. We cannot give it not into a meeting. But in principle, can I ask if I understand correctly? So X and Y are decomposition spaces whose all algebra is. And basically what you're saying is that these classical base changes can be described combinatorially in terms of correspondences by these intermediate case of the power functions, where the intermediate space is just the intermediate space of the composable subjections. Because this tension of basis is indexed by the refined. Of cases is indexed by the refinement order, and this is precisely the refinement of order of composition observations. In this case, the alarms of the projection maps are just like these, right? So you like 100 pages of calculator. I can't show you. What is that instead of 300 pages? Yourself at the moment is making easier in the design. Further questions? Let's thank him again. And now we have 15 minutes to find our way up to. To find our way up to what's the next point of the program. I'll try to put each other. No, no, well, I mean, I think that if you want Algebra Mapo with Algebra Marco, they kill, right? And that's always. But I think that also because it's a condition that I can explain. If you want that form to get that university, then these diagrams have to. These diagrams have to be as that if they want more competition. Maybe we have to spend more heights like heights, like studies like the category of ice objects and correspondence. Yeah, for sure. No, but I mean I have only looked at that for example. We are using the comeback jump to me. Yeah, because we can use the schedule. We've got the fact that it was the one that's not for the fans.
