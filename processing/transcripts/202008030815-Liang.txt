Okay, thank you very much for the introduction. And I want to thank Professor Matano, Professor Ninuminya, and Professor Lukadur and Professor Plateka's invitation for this online conference. I want to talk about the spreading speeds of non-local KPP equation. In fact, first I want to introduce some background about reaction diffusion. Background about the reaction diffusion equation. This is the reaction diffusion equation for X belongs to the habitat R on the real line. And we also can consider more general form of diffusion equation, sorry, where A is operate for the diffusion. Or you also consider A as a migration of the migration of some species. And the domain omega is a median or the Omega is a median or the habitat of the species. And if the omega is unbounded, we can consider the spatial and temporal dynamics. And one fundamental problem for the dynamics in unbounded domain is the motion of the lever sets of the shadow sets. In fact, to describe the motion of the level sets, we have two important concepts. One is the tremendous wave. The channel wave. In fact, in hydrogenous media, you can consider its extension like a proceeding wave, transition wave, and some other extension. And another concept is a spread speed. In fact, the spread speed is a long-term mean speed of the level set of the solution. In some cases, this speed is independent of the value of the level set and independent. Of the data set under independent date of the initial date, which the initial data has a compact support. This is the definition of a spread speed. In other words, we can say the spread speed, we call it C star, is a critical content to consider the different dynamics of the solution U from at the C T. At the CT and T, okay, the first second T is the time, and C T is the location. And sometimes for the C larger than C star, and for this case, C less than C star, the dynamics are different. Then we see such a C star is a critical, and we also call it a span speed. Spreading speed. And we want to consider what can affect the spreading phenomena, like the traveling wave and the spreading speed. Such as the local growth model, like logistic, logistic or general monastable growth model, or bi-stable or competitive or more complicated local growth model. We also can consider the med the structure of the media. Structure of the media, such as time structures and space structures. We all consider the diffusion machines, like the random diffusion, non-local diffusion, or non-linear diffusion. We also consider other effects like the dimension of the domain of the media and the latency species, like the system of equations, and the free boundary. Of equations and the free boundary. Now we want to consider my problem. My question is like this. If we consider the basic logistic growth like KPP feature type, and we want to know what kind of structure of MIDI and what kind of different machines can guarantee a uniform spread speed, the existence of the spread speed. Spread speed. And we also want to know: can we give a variational formula of the spread speed? In fact, here we particularly consider the specially almost periodic media and consider the non-local diffusion. And why we consider almost periodic structure, since almost the periodic structure is one structure between all the other and the between order and quartic structure. And such structure can be used to describe the quasi-crystal. And such concepts were introduced by Bohr and considered by Leons and Buchanan and other mathematicians. And we also want And we also want to consider the non-local diffusion since it is just some sense is a jumper type, never process. And the non-local diffusion also appears in electroge, ecology, and other fields. And there are a lot of work about the spreading speed phenomenon of KPP equations from the From the Karmogorov and the Facet work, and also on the Wimbox work, and Freuderling and the Gartner's work for periodic media, and the Shikizada, Kawasake, Tomoto, and Jackson's work. And then for the traveling wave in periodic media, Professor Baratiki and François Ami and their collaborators do a lot of work, fundamental work. Work fundamental work. And Professor Haz Wenberger and myself, and Professor also give some abstract framework to consider such a problem. And we also, there are some work by Professor Wen Hansen to consider the temporal almost periodic and especially homogeneous or periodic media. And there are lots of A lot of some work considered, especially almost the periodic media, such as neukalosis work and the work of myself for free boundary. And in fact, the definition of the seven wave in almost periodic media was given by Professor Martado in 2002. In 2002. And the best of our case is considered in Martino's work. And there are some work considered spread speed in almost periodic media, like Professor Burstiki and Professor Judge Nadam. And the non-local diffusion also considers non-local diffusion KPP. KPP equation also considered by Professor Wen Hansen and Professor Kore for spread speed and sometimes they also considered chunking rate. And there are some mathematical approaches are used to consider such a problem like elliptic and the parabolic PDAs, non-linear analysis and the oversight. Linear analysis and obstruct dynamic system. And there are there are some, there is some well-known method named pullback method, which is used to consider the traveling wave and the spread speed. This method means that we pull the solution back from far away so that its behavior can be observed. And such a pullback method based on the Back method based on the invariance of the solution with respect to the time or space translation. In other words, it depends on the homogeneity or periodicity of the equations. And there are some work like Professor Wen Chen Sen's work and Professor Karash's work, they consider the following non-local KPP type of equation. Here, the diffusion. Here, the diffusion is described by such a kernel. Such a convolution. Here, K is a kernel. And in that work, the different kernel is always supposed to be continuous or I run. But we want to consider the following problems. How about the case if the diffusion is with jumping? Mathematically, how about the case? Mathematically, how about the case if the kernel is not continuous but a generalized density of some probability measure? In fact, we can find some counter-example to show if kernel is too special, too singular, then there is no spread speed even for KPP quizzes. In fact, here is a In fact, here is a counter example that k is just half a dart function and plus half a dart function at pi. In this case, the kernel is discrete. And we also can see such kernel is such a diffusion is reducible. In this case, we can by calculus, we can By calculus, we can get the conclusion that it is no uniform travel speed. And then we want to give some sufficient condition to guarantee the existence of the spread speed. We give the in the work of Wivadin and myself, we give the following condition. The uniform form In the form, right to stability of the diffusion. That means if we say major is uniformly irreducible, it means the continuum part of the bigger decomposition is not zero. In this case, we can prove if the diffusion If the diffusion is uniformly irreducible, then we can find the spreading speed. In other words, the heterogeneity of the media can be averaged by the irreducible diffusion. And then the long-term behavior is the same as in the homogeneous media. In fact, this also means the diffusion has some erotic problem. And we also use our method is just the generalized classmate theory. By such a theory, we can give the principal argument value for non-compact operates. And then we use the principal function as a upper and lower solution. And then we develop the multin iteration methods which found by Found by Ha Shuenberg, Lajui, and myself, and Professor Xiao Chenzhao. And we use the monotone convergence to replace the compactedness of the function to get the solution. But the condition about the uniform is too strong. So we want to. Strong. So we want to know how about the mod general case. If we want to consider the following case, if the kernel is like this, here is the sum kernel is the sum of some data function, where Sn is just the rational number, the set of recent number. If k is like this, then the support of k The support of K is digital in R, then in this case, there should be some irreducible property. Such a kernel has some weaker irreducible property. But in this case, can we get the existence of the spread speed? The following, the second one is another kind of diffusion, like the like the the the support support of the kernel at a 3.0 and minus s pi and the plus s pi here s is a additional number and then such a number can be make some cognitive property so but we use the method in waving and method from we cannot get the existence of the principal value and the The precipic value and cannot get the existence of spread speed. But in this case, in fact, the media is in fact we also want to consider the case that the media is not periodic, but more complicated, like almost the periodic recurrence or rather. The difficulties are there is no compactness and no principal value. No principal value and the probe method cannot be used. So we consider some other method. The classic method is the probe method. But there is another method which given by Professor Andrew Bastiki and John Nadam. They use the homogeneous method like this. If the if we If we get the spread speed system already, then by the homogenization limit, we can get the following two limits for here, larger than sister, and the different limit for tau is larger system, and different minutes. And then we consider the following question: Can we find the two? Following question: Can we find the two critical contents, omega low star, and omega up star? For these two contents, we have different limits of different homogeneous limits. And if we can get such two limits and limits and the conditions to guarantee, this constant is identical. In fact, omega up star is equal to omega north star. is equal to omega low star then omega c star is equal to omega up star equal to omega low star is just the span speed this is the homogeneous method and in fact the pullback method has some kind it's we can compare it compare it compare the pullback by the Compare the pullback method and the homogeneous method. In fact, the information of both profiles of font and speed is well preserved of the pullback limit. And then the probeback method can be used to consider not only spread speed but also traveling wave. But on the other hand, the heterogeneity of the system is also preserved. Reserved. Then we cannot use this method, the propact method for the general heterogeneous equations in heterogeneous media. If we use the homogeneous method, the information about the perfect disappear after homogeneous limits, then we cannot consider the traveling wave by homogeneous measure. And Professor Bratik and John Nadan consider the homogeneous method and use the homogeneous method and the shape of generalized principal activity to obtain the speed of the KPP recent field increase in almost the periodic media. We hope to extend their work to non-local case. Then we want to divide some shared budget such as But such as homogeneous method for non-local equation, generalize the principal value for non-local equation, non-local operator, and want to use the generalize the principal value to give a variation formula of the variant speed. And we also want to also want to develop some technical like a monitor. Some technical like a monitor convergence and use the integral in part with the tail. And we also want to divide per the extended special Hanaka in equity and use the Python method for nullocle operator to show that the equivalence of the eigenvalues in different definitions. And our result is like this. Consider such a non-local KPP equation with general diffuse and kernel. Equation with Johnny Dottie Field and kernel k. Here, k is here. Also, we can write this equation like this. Here, mu is a property probability measure of R and K is a generalized density function of mu. And we can give the process definition of speed. And then this is our main theorem. We say the major mu is The major mu is criteria provided the support of mu is discrete, like it belongs to R times such of integral Z. And our main theorem is like this. If the major mu is not discrete and the growth function A is positive and almost periodic, then we have the spread speed. Spread speed in the positive and negative direction. And the second one is if the major mu is discrete, but which is not a singular major at z, and here A is positive and almost periodic. And here, since the support of mu belong to R times the set of integral Z, here we suppose the 2π over R and not one of the Not one of the frequencies of the almost periodic function A, then we also can get the existence of the spread speed. This is our main result. And Yao results, we also can see if the tail of the kernel is small, the tail is potential decay, then the spreading speed is finite. But if the is finity. But if the kernel is large, has a large tip, then the spread speed is infinity. Then our question is for the case of the key has a large tip. Can we say more about the spreading speed? In fact, we consider the following factor KPP equations. In D. In D with the dimension of D, and where A is also almost the periodic function and which is also positive, then we can show the operator of this part. The linear part has a generalized principle value, and we can use such a generalized principle value to get the potential. get the potential speed of the spread of the spread like this c star is equal to lambda the possible generalized possible governance lambda lambda over d plus rf for any non-negative on the non non-true initial date you yield with the comeback support and for any episode the solution sorry sorry the solution of you satisfy The solution of u satisfy u t x goes to zero uniformly for any x larger than or equal to the ct power of e. And we also have the following the next another limit for x less than or equal to the city's power of e and this is our result for factor k. Results for factor KPP equations. And such results is first obtained for the homogeneous case in this paper, Capricorn Joffrey's paper. And then Lucretia and Tafli also give the more sharper estimate of the exponential speed. And then Expotential speed and then for the spacely periodic case, Sognetis and Tough Lay also can give the same results, but use the z-principle eigenvalue of the vector diffusion operator. And then our method is the theory of to solve this problem is also the theory of generalized principle values and the comparison principle and homogeneous. And the comparison principle and the homogeneous method, which developed in the paper of Sabines, Ladies, and Taflier. And we also found a very interesting spreading phenomenon that for factor KPP equations, the potential speed is independent of the direction. This phenomenon is totally different from the classical KPP equation in hydrogenous BD. In fact, we know the classic KPP. In fact, we know the classic KPP equations in periodic media. The speed speed depends on the different directions. This is classical results. This is our last result. Thank you very much. I finished my talk. Thank you, Professor Jan. Are there any questions? Are there any questions? Okay, Henri, please. Okay, can you see me? Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Thank you very much for this great lecture and also this very wide presentation putting kind of genealogy of models and. Of models, and it's very nice. And thank you very much for the nice results you mentioned, new results you mentioned. I have a question about this last result you mentioned, that the direction of the C star, the C star you get, is independent of the direction. Now, it's true that, so it's true that it's independent of the direction, but maybe it's because when you go, it's an exponential factor that is independent of the direction. And so, this has a The direction, and so this has a tendency to somehow flatten everything in some sense, flatten the difference because it goes very far. Now, the question would be: Do you imagine that you could get a further information about positions of the front, which would be more precise and maybe would start depending on the direction. You see what I mean? Yeah, I guess so, but until now we have no work on. Work on this problem. I guess you're right. There are something, the lower order term, maybe depend on the direction. But that's my contract, but we haven't worked on this problem until now. Because the exponential factor is just so big that it it erases. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, you're right. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Henry, for the question. And are there any other questions? So, in your slide
