For inviting me. Yeah, thank you very much for inviting me. So it's a great pleasure to be here. So I will give the overview of the very recent proof of the Android conjecture. So it's a problem that has been open for, well, more than 30 years now. And well, it seems like the last step in the proof. Step in the proof has been announced, or at least announced, um, earlier, well, in late 2021. And yeah, so I'm going to talk about this problem. So, this is a question, it's a conjecture question statement about what is called Shimura varieties. In many cases, in most important cases, there are modulated spaces for families. For families of abelian varieties with additional structures, such as endomorphisms, for example. But not always. So there's some exceptional ones which we don't know a modular interpretation for. And it's a Diophantine question. So to introduce and motivate it, I'll first state show Uh, show an analogous question in a simpler setting, that of abelian varieties, and that's the Marion-Manford conjecture. Now, it's not a conjecture at all. This is one of the statements that has, well, I think at least 15 genuinely different proofs now. The first one is due to Michel Renaud in 83. And now, every year there's a new proof coming up. But the statement is. But the statement is this. So you look at an abelian variety, so a complex torus over C, a complex torus with a polarization, well, dimension G. And well, let Z be a sub-variety containing a Zariski-dense set of torsion points. Well, then, the conclusion is Z is a translate of an abelian sub-variety by a torsion point. By a torsion point. So, for example, if you take a curve in a Belian variety, which has infinitely many, contains infinitely many torsion points, then it has genus one. It's a translator of an elliptic curve. So, I mean, this statement was indeed stated by Manion and Mumford. Stated by Manion and Mumford in the one-dimensional case. So, for curves in A, or indeed in curves in a Jacobian. And it was motivated by the model's conjecture. Indeed, there's a more general statement called model length, which actually does imply model conjecture. So, that's the motivation behind it. I should say that there's an even simpler case, which is that of case which which is that of say torus say g m uh so c star over c which is c star squared and if you take a curve there oh sorry i okay it's okay yeah right so uh if you take a curve there uh which so here torsion uh points are roots of unity or pairs of roots of unity z to one z to two and a curve And a curve that contains infinitely many of those is a translatable subgroup by root of unity. So the form equation would be x to the power m y to the power m equals root of unity. And this is a statement that was proven by Tate. In fact, it's all trivial, and you can find it in the latest edition of In the latest edition of Serge Lang's book, Algebra. So that's exactly the same, same sort of statement. So, torsion points are called special in abelian variety, and translates of abelian sub-varieties by torsion points are called special sub-varieties. It's a natural, natural way. An equivalent way of stating this is by saying that Z is. Z in A sub-variety, any sub-variety contains a finite number of maximal special sub-varieties, completely set-theoretically equivalent. So what plays a role also in the proof that I'm going to talk about are weakly special sub-varieties, which are simply translates of a billion sub-varieties by arbitrary points, not necessarily torsion. So So, as I said, there's a very large number of proofs since 83. I think I counted about 15. But the one which is relevant to us and that the strategy that generalized to the case of Android, to the case of Shimura, is due to Jonathan Hiller and Umberto Zane. Umberto Zagne came out in 2006 and that uses a completely new technique that was introduced. They introduced it into diaphragm geometry. It's called o-minimality and I'm going to talk about it. It comes from mathematical logic, although not really, well, you'll see, and functional transcendence. I'll say more about it. So Right. Okay, so the Android conjecture, which is, well, what is a theorem? I'm pretty sure, but it hasn't, the last step hasn't been fully verified yet, but it will be. I'm sure it's correct. So, here, S is a Shimura variety. I'll say more about it. I'll define, I'll tell you what a Shimura variety is in a bit, but for now, In a bit, but for now, think of a certain analog of an abelian variety. It also contains what's called special points and special sub-variety and sub-varieties. And the statement is the same. So the risky closure, components of Zeristic closure of a set of special points are special. And the And the latest result is this is true in full generality for all Shimura varieties, not just moduli spaces of abelian varieties. And the proof relies on minimality in particular and many other things. So the first non-trivial case of this statement, I mean, This of this statement. I mean, the first non-trivial example of a Shimura write is a J line. So upper half plane to C parametrizes elliptic curves over C after isomorphism. And my special points here correspond to single. Here corresponds to singular J invariance or elliptic curves with Cm. And the first question is: well, like very similar, well, analogous to what I stated with GM cross GM. If you take C cross C and you look at the curve here, which contains Infinitely many CM points. So pairs of singular chain variants. Then C is a modular curve. C is, well, is y0 of n or, yeah. Now the word C is a polynomial. Now, where C is a polynomial, is given by irreducible, of course, given by the modular polynomial phi n for some n. So this already is highly non-trivial. And I have to say, the pioneer of this, the person who started working on this problem is Basid Iksovan, who was my supervisor of COSN, who tragically passed away recently. Recently. And yeah. He proved this under the assumption of generalized Bremen hypothesis in 1996. But his method generalized to the very general case, I mean, to this conjecture by Bruno Klingler, Emmanuel Elmo, and myself more than 10 years ago. But really, Riemann's hypothesis here is. Riemann hypothesis here is generalized, is essential, and in fact, used twice. So, but the method of Pilar and Zanya is unconditional. It doesn't use GRH. So, Pilar proved this, this statement here in 2006 unconditionally using the O-minimal strategy. Strategy and functional transcendence. And this is what, well, very recently generalized to the general case. So I'll now explain how briefly, how the method of Pila and Zania works in this case. And before talking, because all the ingredients are there, simply they are easy in that case. So, yeah. So, what you look at is the uniformization. So, pi from upper half plane, H is upper half plane. So, cross half plane to C cross C. So, this is J cross J, then J line, product of the J line with itself. And you choose the so pi is J cross J to C. cross j to c cross c um and you choose a fundamental domain or so this is a quotient by sl to z cross sl to z right so and you choose the usual fundamental domain f is the usual one you know the one you you know this one uh for example well you want it to be connected i think yes but well this one um And uh and you you have a curve here, C you lift it to this, and you have C tilde, which is well C pi minus one. C intersected with the fundamental domain. So they say the strategy in general is exactly the same, except each ingredient is difficult, uh, it's more difficult. Is difficult, is more difficult. So, one thing is this set. So, this is now this is an algebraic curve. This one is transcendental. It's analytic, analytic set. I'll say in a bit what it means, it's definable in a certain or minimal structure. Now, so C contains sigma, the set of CM points, infinite. CM points infinite. So, one thing, so for each CM point, well, in this case, it's a pair of two singular J invariants or two CM elliptic curves. Well, it has a discriminant, which is, well, a CM elliptic curve has, well, it's an endomorphism ring is an order in an imaginary quadratic field. It has a discriminant. Field, it has a discriminant. So you take the, so if this is the point, you define the discriminant to be the maximum of absolute values of discriminants of the two and the Galois orbit of X. But yeah, of course, you can assume that C is defined over of the discretions of the absolute values of discriminants of the endomorphism rings of the X1, X2. The uh x1 x2. Oh, yeah, always you know, yeah, um, yeah, and uh, you can suppose that I mean, C and points are defined over Q bar. So, C itself has the residence of Q set of Q bar points, is defined itself defined over Q bar. And assume over Q line, you take the union of conjugates, it doesn't matter. Union of conjugates. It doesn't matter. And so one thing which is very important and easy in this case is that the Gallo orbit or the degree, well, Galo orbit of degree of x, x is the CM point over Q, grows, well, up to a constant, which is uniform, depends on C, as this permanent to about one half, roughly. But as a small power discrete, one over four, if you like. One over four, if you like. It doesn't matter. And the other thing is, when you lift this point to here, so see tilde, so the height is, well, you view this in as a subset of C2, which you view as you can view as R. You can use R4 if you want. So when you lift it to F cross to C tilde, it's an algebraic point, in fact, defined of a quadratic field, maybe of degree four. And you calculate the height, the height, the usual height, I mean the height of an algebraic number, completely trivial. Completely trivial. Well, it's bounded by something like, I think, jx to the power four, something like this. The exact constant doesn't matter greatly. What matters is fixed. It doesn't depend on the point. And so what's happening is this. You, well, the x goes to infinity when x raises. The x goes to infinity when x ranges through sigma because that's that's how things are and so if you if you count um and all these all the points in the Galois orbit of x their pre-images satisfy this condition so you have for each x you have a X, you have say dx to the power one-fourth points of in C star C tilde of height smaller than Zx1 over four. And then, and this is where all minimality comes in. O-minimality comes in. And I'll say more about this. Well, this implies that this C tilde has to be algebraic by this Pillar-Wilki theorem, which I will state in a bit. So that implies by all minimality, by Pilar-Wiltke theorem, which I will state, that C tilde is algebraic. Or semi-algebraic, rather. Well, in fact, it's a piece of an algebraic curve, intersection of an algebraic curve in C2 with F cross F. And that I will explain why. And then, and once you know that you have an algebraic curve, so you have this, so this is functional transcendence. So, this is functional transcendence. You have a transcendental map between two essentially algebraic objects. And something which is bi-algebraic, so C is algebraic and C tilde is algebraic, has to be special. And this implies, and that this is what I'm going to talk about. See is algebraic. So essentially, all the ingredients are the Essentially, all the ingredients or the proof are here. So you have well, three things. One is that C tilde is definable in an minimal structure. I will say what it is. Second, this bound on height of pre-special points. Third, very important, the hardest ingredient in general is this, is the lower bound for the Galois degree of a special point. That was the final step. Final step that was solved a few months ago in January. And third is functional transcendence. Is that something which is biogebraic is special? So you see all these ingredients already here, but here they are easy. In general, they are hard. So that illustrates, this is the first example, which is non-trivial of the Android conjecture. And well, it shows how it works. So now I'm going to explain in a little bit more detail each ingredient. So what O-minimality is? Well, first of all, O-minimality is something which comes from logic, but in reality, this idea of a minimal structure is due to Grothendieck. Is Judo Grothendieck, and he called it tame topology. It's exactly the same thing. So, except that logicians axiomatized it, but it's exactly the same thing as cross-the-tame topology. So, well, first of all, well, this is this definition given by logicians. Well, a structure is simply a collection of subsets of Subsets of Rn. For each n, you have in Rn a certain collection of subsets. Well, I should say n bigger than one, one is zero. You have one thing. So n satisfies some axioms. So, first of all, contains all semi-algebraic sets. Semi-algebraic means defined by polynomial equations. Polynomial equations. Inequality, sorry. One particular empty set, Rn belong to Sn for each n. So finite unions intersections complements the product, Cartesian product, the projection. So this may be the only non-trivial thing to verify or semi-algebraic set projection. Or semi-algebraic set, projection of a semi-algebraic set is semi-algebraic, it's a theorem of TARSQ. And we say that a subset, so given a structure, a subset is definable of Rn, if it belongs to Snow of course, this definition is slightly meaningless because take collection of all subsets and you get a structure. So you need to, if you want to have something meaningful, you have to impose further. To impose a further condition, and this is where O minimum, so O minimal minimality means order minimal. Well, logicians have an explanation why. But what it means, what it means if is that if you if you look at if you look at S one, so the the So, the set is definable if it belongs to S and for some end. So, it means that definable subsets of R1 or R are finite unions of open intervals and points. So we get exactly semi-algebraic sets. And a structure is O minimal if it satisfies this condition. And so it's usually not easy to show that. It's not easy to show that this structure is L-minimal. While the first one is the collection of all same algebraic sets, and of the condition to verify is number four. So, but that's not enough. So, there are more structures which are minimal. The main property of an L-minimal structure is a definable set in an L-minimal structure. In an o-minimal structure has finitely many connected, topologically connected components. And this is how you show, for example, that certain sets are not o-minimal. So if you take the graph of sine of x or cos of x or any periodic, you see, this is not a minimal because if you intersect with a line, which is certainly definable, well, you get infinitely many points. points and infinitely many components so it can't be all minimal however and this is important important for us actually if you restrict to a closed interval what you get is uh this is definable in no minimal structure which is called r and restricted analytic functions so here are some examples so all semi-algebraic sets as i said So, all semi-algebraic sets, as I said already, the graph of real exponential. So, if you add the real exponential, not complex, real. So, if you look at all polynomials, well, all sets defined by polynomial in y equals zero. So, this that will be a definable set every polynomial. Rn. Rn, which is defined by restricted analytic functions, this is why I said, well, you restrict sine of x to some. And if you combine the two, and this is important to us, and exp, oh, this is an o minimal structure. So to show that these things are all minimal, and exp, these are big theorems. This is not. This is not trivial at all and quite recent, I think, 90s. So these are definable sets. And now, okay, so that's and thing about them is you can count, if you have a set definable in an L minimal structure, you can count rational points on it. So rational points by rational. So, rational points, by rational points, I mean, so you have set in Rn and rational is x intersected with urn. This is what I mean, but really points with rational coordinates in the trivial sense. And this is what Pilo-Wolki theorem is. So let X be a set defined in definable in omega. Definable in all minimal structure and you uh so you the height is is the usual height you know the height of a over b is maximum of an absolute value of a and b and uh and well the height of x1 xn is maximum so and you you count the number of of points up so height t so if x is algebraic or semi-algebraic Algebraic or semi-algebraic, then this function and xt is typically its polynomial in t usually. So there are a lot of points. I mean, if you take a closed interval, it's linear in t. But what Pillar Wilkie theorem says is if you take a definable set in an L-minimal structure and you remove all, well, this semi-algebraic part. All well, this semi-algebraic part, you remove all positive dimensional semi-algebraic subsets. Then what is left, the rational points outside of the algebraic part, or semi-algebraic, and there are very, very few. So this is the statement. So define the algebraic part as the union of all infinite connected semi-algebraic subsets of X. X is defined Subsets of X, X is definable. So the number of points up to high t on this transcendental part is, well, is sub-polynomial. So C depends on epsilon, by the way. There's a constant depending on epsilon setup. It's smaller than C times T epsilon. So outside of, so you have your set, you have all. Your set, you have all these semi-algebraic subsets, and what's left, if you count, well, what's left is small. I mean, if you and that's Peeler-Wilki theorem, and this is what I said when you in this example of C cross C in C tilde, we had Had d to the power something, rational points on it generalized to generalizes to number fields, by the way, on C tilde up to height dx to the power something. That must imply by this theorem that there's something algebraic in C tilde. And it's of dimension one, it will have to be C tilde itself. It generalizes two number fields. It's uniform in the degree of the number field. Degree of the number field. So if you count points on the transcendental part up to degree k. So there's a lot of uniformity in this, which is also good. Well, you have the same thing. So the constant C depends on, well, it depends on epsilon, depends on X. We don't really know how, but it only depends on the degree of the field, not the discriminant. Not the discriminant, so it's quite strong. However, however, there are a lot of questions here, and there are two of them. So how, what can you say about this constant? Can you say something more? For example, can you make this degree come out with, can it be like the power of k times constant depending on C on? constant depending on t and epsilon and secondly can you replace t epsilon by log t to some power in general you can't in many cases but in some cases you can so the wilki has conjectured uh made a conjecture but there's a now a very strong result which which is crucial so uh okay well this uh this can Well, this, yeah, it's a result by Gal Binyamini, which is almost optimal. Well, in some cases, he can have, in some cases, but the cases which apply to Shimura varieties, he can have log t and he can make k come out with a power. So this is extremely strong. I'll talk about it because it's essential for what we're going to do. But this is Pillar WorldCue. And in their statement, And in their statement, the constant is totally, totally ineffective. Right, so let's okay. So this is wait. Is it only mouse? Is this any questions on this? Okay. Well, Schumer varieties in general. So they're defined by a pair, G and X. G is a reductive group. And X, G is a reductive group of a Q, for example GL2, or symplectic group or any others. And X is a certain homogeneous space on G of R. So to be more specific, you look at a character of the Taurus S, which is, well, C star looked seen as a group algebraic. Algebraic over the reals to G over R, which satisfies certain conditions to ensure that, well, on Lie algebra etc, that X is a finite union of Hermitian symmetric domains. And the typical example is GL2 and the union of upper and lower half plane. So this is called the Shimura datum. And to define a Shimura variety, And to define a Schumer variety, you need also a compact open subgroup of G of AF. AF are finite adequates. So the restricted product of QP's. And so one defines this set, this double quotient. So K acts on the left, on the right, so on G of AF, and G of Q acts diagonally on both factors. So it turns out that. So it turns out that it's a finite union of quasi-projective varieties. It can be compactified, so there's a Bayley-Borel compactification, but there are others as well. Now it's usually singular, in fact, nearly always. And what's even stronger is it admits what is called a canonical model over a certain number field explicitly defined in terms of g and x. In terms of G and X of degree uniform in bounded by the dimension of G, for example. Yeah, that's what I said. So if you choose, so X is usually not connected, even in the case of GOP2. So a connected component is, so if you choose GOQ plus, which is the stabilizer of the connected component of X. Stabilize of connected component of X. Well, components of the Shimora variety are quotients of commission symmetric space by an arithmetic subgroup of G of Q. So we usually we're not going to be bothered about connected components. We will say, well, Shimura variety is a connected component. For the sort of questions we are looking at, it doesn't matter. And special sub-varieties are, well, much in the same way as essentially a special sub-variety of an abelian variety is a sub-abelian variety, while here it's pretty much the Shimura sub-variety defined by sub-Shimura datum, so a subgroup of G, G- which induces compatible with the map S2. The map S to G of R with a Hodge character. And a special point is a subshi modatum by T defined by torus. So in this case, it's a point because X is a conjugacy class on the G of G of R. And well, if you have a torus commutative, then of course it acts trivially. You have one point. So this is what a special point is. So, this is what the special point is. And the smallest torus, like this, is called the Manforte group of the special point. And they're defined over explicitly described number fields. And the whole, well, the biggest problem there is to estimate bound below the degree of this number field. Oh, the torus defining uh so you you have a subshimola datum Tx in G T X and the smallest torus so X is a X is a is a morphism from S to G of R. So if it's a special distance, it factors through the torus, rational torus. source. Yeah, and that's the smallest, yeah. The smallest one, yeah. So say if you if you have a an elliptic curve to the power n CM elliptic curve in power g in AG okay they are then in as In as a point of A G, A G moduli space of Google varieties. So, and E has C M by ring of integers. Well, you know, they have you can take the torus etopile G, the character will factor for this, but the Manforte group is simply E star because it acts diagonally. It acts diagonally. See, yeah, this is what this is the man for take group, and this is the maximal torus through which the character factors. So this is what the monthly take group is, is this. Now, the weekly special subrices, I mean, they're very similar to very analogous to what we have. What we have in the abidian case. So, recall in the case of bidding varieties, a weekly special one was simply a translate of an abelian sub-variety by a point. So, in the case of Shimura varieties, it's a factor. In a product. So there's a there's a product of two Shimura sub-varieties contained in S and this effect. So you can think of it's very analogous because if you have an abelian sub-variety of A, then A is isogenous to B cross. B cross B dashed and under this isogeny your translate corresponds to B cross comma X well it's very similar here so there's there's a real analogy And what I said the biogebraic characterization so these things can be characterized as biologic. This by algebraic. And yeah, because so S is uniformized by, well, I didn't say what an algebraic structure on X is, I will, in a bit. Okay, well, the typical example of Shimura varieties is AG, the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties, which is uniformized by the Ziegler upper half plane. Ziggler upper half plane, which is this set of symmetric matrices with imaginary part positive definite. So it's a moduli space of principally polarized ability varieties. So to the point of AG, you attach complex stories, which is polarized principally. It's a quasi-projective algebraic variety. It's a kind of a Algebraic varieties defined over it has a canonical model over Q. So in this case, special points correspond to Cm abelian varieties, which means that the endomorphism algebra contains a commutative Q algebra of dimension 2G. And a Shimura variety is of a billion type if it lifts to a sub-variety of AG. And 99% of Shimura varieties are of a billion type. Varieties are of a billion type. There are some exceptional ones, only three types, I think. But most of them are related to the moduli space of abelian varieties. Okay, so now proof of so the entropy conjecture is what I stated. So you take a Shimura variety. Well, you can think of this one. Well, you can think of this one that contains a Zariski dense set of special points. So think of CM abelian varieties. And it should be special. Well, in many cases, special means that it's a locus of points which corresponds to abelian varieties with additional structures, say in the morphisms. For example, example, you For example, you have Hilbert modular varieties. So abelian varieties, which have an action of dimension, which G, have an action of a totally real field by degree G, for example. So the ingredients of the proof are, well, exactly what I explained in the case of C cross C. So first of all, Across C. So, first of all, you need to show that the map I, the uniformization map, well, I should have said, well, I should have put X plus the connected component, but it doesn't. To S is definable in the structure R and X. But I don't have time. It's not complicated. I don't have time to explain how this proven, but it's easy. It's easy to illustrate in the case of exponential, for example. You decompose this map into a part which is restricted analytic. So restricted, what's essential is restricted to a fundamental domain, f. Otherwise, it's not definable on x at all. In the same way as the, you know, the function sine of x is not definable on the reals. So you decompose this map into a part. decompose this map into a part which is definable which is exponential real exponential really and and and another part which is a restricted analytic function in the case where s is just the day line yeah it's sort of saying that the fundamental domain has this finite part in one direction there's an infinite part where you do the other yeah which is exponential yeah exactly exactly exactly this precisely and in general uh And in general, there's a description of this map by Mumford, which is just very, I mean, very, very analogous to the J line. So you have more coordinates, but it's pretty much the same. Now, this functional transcendence result, which is in full generality prone by Langler, Ulmo, and myself, which is interesting in itself. Well, it says it's Is interesting in itself. Well, it says it's following. If you take, and interestingly enough, it uses Pilo-Walti theorem, the proof. If W is an algebraic subset of X, so I should have said X, the Hermitian symmetric space, has an algebraic structure. So this so-called Harris-Chandra realization of a bounded of a Hermitian symmetric domain is a bounded. permission symmetric domain is a bounded semi-algebraic subset of R Cn. So of course, here it is, R2N a bounded domain and think of a unit disk in C that's exactly this and it's a semi-algebraic set and algebraic subset is simply a component analytic of an intersection of an algebraic An intersection of an algebraic subset of Cn, algebraic in sense given by polynomials with X. This is what is meant by algebraic. And so this hyperbolic axioman theorem says that if you, so we have this pi from X to S, if you have an algebraic subset of X in this in this. A subset of X in this in this sense. Well, pi of W, of course, is not algebraic at all, but it's the risky closure, which is algebraic, is weakly special. It's true for abiding priorities also. So then, just like in, remember, I started the lecture by explaining Explaining we had h cross h twice, so we have fundamental domain here, and we have special point here. We lift it to this and here, so we have this realization in CN and we can calculate height, well, usual height of pre-special points. So, this is in F and this is bounded, so we have a discrete. So, we have a discriminant also. We can associate a discriminant, and next slide, I think I'll explain how to. It's very, very analogous. So, the case of C. And this is bounded by something, some fixed power discriminant up to a constant, which doesn't depend on x. It's a result of Christopher Doe, who was my student, and Martin Lo was my postdoc. It's really a lot of algebra. It's really a lot of algebra, it's complicated. Well, it's hard. And then the hardest part is lower bounds for gala orbits of special points. So like in the case of elliptic curves, if I have a CM elliptic curve by Cm by ring of integers in a quadratic field, the Galois degree is Is a discriminant, say it's well, roughly one-half milliseps, and something like this. But one, one, if you like. So in general, to pro this, that was the hardest, really hardest part, and seems like it has been solved. And then what is sometimes called geometric control. So the first up to here, these are enough. These are enough ingredients, enough to prove the statement for a curve in S. A curve containing infinitely many special points is special. So if you want to prove it for high-dimensional, you need this geometric android, what is called, which has two different proofs by Emmanuel Lilmo and Adolf Richard. It says that it's a characterization of a sub-variety of S that contains a very simple. Of s that contains a Zaristi dense set of weakly special sub-varieties. And what it says is that you can factor out a factor which is a special sub-variety. But it's of this form, special something, a Schumula variety cross something else. And this allows you to do the induction. Because so this contains infinitely many special points. Well, there is special points. points, well, there is the dense special points, Z, you start with. Using Hillty strategy, you produce a Zeristidance set of special sub-varieties. So you factor out a positive dimensional Shimura variety and you get another, which again still contains an infinite dense set of special points, but of smaller dimension. And you do the induction, you start. And you do the induction, you start with this one until you're done. So, and this is proved two proofs. One again uses this. So, use functional transcendence once by Ulmo. And another proof by Ulmo and Adolf Reichard that uses ergodic theory, Radnus theorems, etc. Right. Right. Well, this is the hardest ingredient. So this, this, and this have been known for, and this have been known for years. The hardest ingredient is this. So you want an analog of this thing here. So here we define the discriminant, so a special point. How long do I have left? A quarter past. Okay. Quarter pass, okay. So, um, so we have a special point which is defined by a Schumer datum, where Tx, where T is a torus, and we can assume that T is the Manfotate group. So we can assume that G is adjoint, means that center is trivial. It doesn't matter for these sort of questions. Cautioned out by the center. Quotient out by the center. So the torus, in this case, the splitting field of T, so the smallest field over which T becomes a product of GMs is a CM field when G is a joint. It's a consequence of axioms imposed on Shimura Datum. So a torus, well, the idyllic points of a torus have a maximum points of a torus have a maximal one unique maximal compact subgroup and we have another uh so k t m we have another which is simply the intersection of k with t of a f which is usually smaller and we define the discriminant like this so this index times the discriminant absolute value discriminant of the splitting field so if you think of elliptic curves when you know a CM elliptic curve You know, a CM elliptic curve may have the ring of endomorphisms may be smaller than the full ring of integers. There can be a conductor. F, in which case the discriminant is F squared discriminant of E, and this F corresponds to this factor KTM over KT. And the lower bound. And the lower bound conjecture is, well, is exactly this. So the degree of S, the special point, is bounded below, well, up to a constant that depends on the Schumer variety only, times discriminant to some power, which depends on also on the Schumer variety only. And yeah, as I said before, well, if E is an elliptic curve with C. Well, if E is an elliptic curve with Cm, you have this, and this is easier. In general, again, it was for AG, it was conjectured by Vasily Sloven in 1999 and motivated by the same question. So, well, now it's proven in full generality, but before, so okay, well, yes, I said this already. Yes, I said this already. Okay, well, I'm right. Okay, so let's explain how it's done in the case of AG. So that was done by Jacob Zimmerman, but it was deduced from a really important result and very hard on the faulting site of a CMABelian variety. So an abelian variety has what is called Variety has what is called Falting's height. Well, if it has CM, then well, it has potentially good reduction. So it's really well defined. And so Colmes conjectured the formula for precise formula for the Fauci's height of a CM abelian variety that used him simple and CM by. seem simple and Cm by the ring of integers of Cm field of degree two times dimension of A. It doesn't matter. I mean you can always this the hard you reduce to this this case. So the Colmette formula is still it involves it really is a formula which involves values of the L functions attached to representations of the Gallo group of V. Gallo group of E and their derivatives, the values at zero. But this formula is still very much conjectural. But there's a result, recent, quite, oh, it's not so recent, seven years old, by two groups of people, so Andreata, Gorin, Howard, Madebusipera, and independently and by different method by John and Jank. That they proved the Colmes formula on average, which means that they calculated on average, meaning that you fix a CM type, you fix a CM field, and you calculate the sum over all CM types attached to E, and their 2 to the power G G is the dimension of them. About gg is the dimension of them of the heights of. By the way, Colmes proved that two abelian varieties of same type E phi have the same passing site. So it makes sense. And they found the formula including f of l dashed zero rho over l your rho itself like something else. Your row itself applies something else. Well, it doesn't matter, but they proved it. What it does imply is that the Faulting's height, also Faunting's height of an abelian variety is bounded below by a constant depending on G only. And it's even explicit, I forget. So, what it does imply is that the faulting height of A of a CM Abelian variety. Of a CM Abelian variety is bounded by this kerminant to the power epsilon. Well, for any epsilon, there's a constant depending on epsilon, such that this is a polynomial. And then, so Zimmerman combined it with another huge theorem, Massevostoltz, which is an isogeny estimate on abelian varieties. Varieties and they think that the only thing that, well, what Zimmerman observed is that if you have two CM abelian varieties, well, if you look at all CM abelian varieties with CM by the same field and same CM type, you will find, so it's a set which has the size of the class number of L. You find too that You find too that what the minimal degree of isogeny between them is a fixed power of DE. So if you know that from this, that this is negligible, and this is bigger than a fixed power of dE, then you get an estimate, a lower bound for this. This. Now, thing is, so that implies Galo orbits and Android for all Schumer varieties of abelian type. And that was in 2015, right? So the problem is to generalize this to all Schumer varieties. And there's no even conjectural analog of Massa Wuster. Analog of Masse-Wustal's? I mean, it's an interesting question, and there you have to think about motivic interpretation and things like this of Shimura varieties. But there's no conjectural. Though Harry Schmidt had an idea of using, again, using this strong version of Pilovilkia due to galvania, to attack the problem. So in what And what Gal Ben Yamini proved, I mean, and applied to Shimura varieties, is a very explicit form of pillar world queue, where you see, so this, the degree of the field comes out as a constant. And here the H is a small h, it's a log height. So you have a log bound and you have the degree of the field which comes out. And so using the And so, using this, if you have a bound on the height in terms of discriminant, well, you have it, and this is bounded below by discriminant, so some fixed power, but you have a lower bound for F, which is what you're looking for. And this is what so this is what in our joint work, and this is what we did, we made this conjecture. We made this conjecture. And we also use this result of Chris Dor and Martineau. So it's used twice on the because we need, because, yeah, the thing is, here you can't point on the graph, not just on X. So we conjectured this, that there exists a whale height on S, which satisfies this bound. I mean, the I mean, for any epsilon, there's a constant, such as height is smaller than c epsilon, dx epsilon. And that implies the, our conjecture implies lower bounds. And this is what these people, so this is how I explain just what I said. These people, Pila, Shankar, Zimmerman. People, Pila, Shanka, Zemmerman, Elena Noen, Groshnik just announced, well, not just announced, announced in November last year. I mean, I'm sure it's true, but no, it's, I mean, it's a lot of PRD Hoch theory and things like this. They construct height. And that's it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, Henri, for the very interesting talk. Are there any questions from the audience here in Orfaca? Do we have anybody out there? Oh, what's this last theorem? I conjecture is true. Is that a concept? No, this that they exist a well height on the Shimura variety where special points satisfy this inequality. And from that, it follows then the umbrella can be it follows the Galo orbits, lower bounds for Galo orbits follow, and that that's the last last step. Yeah, what's the constant C in this theorem? Sorry? What's the constant C in this theorem? Oh, okay. Well, the is. Okay, well, sorry, there's a constant here that depends only on capsule S on the variety. Well, this is the height conjecture. So that there exists a height on S. Oh, it was proven by announced in November 2021 by these people. So are these two different papers or? Are these two different papers, or they're over? No, this is a paper by Pila Shanker Zemon with an appendix by Enoch Kroshi. Any more questions? Stop the question. Let's thank Andrea again.
