You heard that. And before he joined the Max Man Society in 2009, 13, sorry, yes, 13, not that long ago. He was in mostly all the time in Oxford. He actually climbed all the steps from PhD students. From PhD students in 1997 all the way to professors in professor in 2009. Evido traveled to Berkeley at the PGEC. When was it 2003? Yes, around 2003. One of the most impactful marks that Miltos has left into the field is his work in establishing Cardaminia Suta as a model for comparative developmental processes and developmental genetics to without it. Chromatogenetics to our ridiculous. And in many cases, this comparative work has helped to hold on to the genes that account for the morphological differences. And they are quite numerous between cardamom and arbidopsis. And I think this is what he will exemplify today by talking about how established complex leaf morphologies and the genetic network underlying them. Thank you, Wiltos. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Guilto. Okay, thank you very much for the kind introduction and invitation. So, what we're trying to understand is how genotypes are translated to phenotypes during leaf development and evolution. The question is basically how can you have leaf buds of different species that look almost indistinguishable despite sort of large evolutionary divergence, but then end up giving very different morphologies when you have the adult forms. So, you see here, for example, the C. So you see here, for example, the sink which aerated lipovarabidotis, which has this small protrusion called seration, and the leap of cardamomsuda on the side here, where actually the leaf is subdivided to distinct units called leaflets that are born from the central stock by linear elements here called pitigaments. So, to understand how this works, we do comparative genetics, comparative development, which is a Comparative development, which is also empowered by doing advanced imaging in different genetic backgrounds. And you see here, for example, time-lapse movies of the growing leaf buds of Cardamini endarabidosis, and the heat map show how fast different areas grow at different times of development. So, by taking this approach, then we can connect distributed gene action to the amount, duration, and direction of cellular growth and figure out how this parameter. Our growth and figure out how these parameters together give different shapes. To do this, we also use computational models to synthesize our information in sort of predictive, hopefully, frameworks. And we have one series of models done by a very talented postdoc, Adam Ranius, who now has his own lab in Calgary. Unfortunately, he couldn't make it to the meeting for family reasons. Nevertheless, he has done great work and I encourage you to interact with him. And so, in Adam's motivation, And so, in adult models, basically, the simple serrated leaf of arabidosis emerges from the dual action of a self-organizing system operating at the margin here to give these repeated protrusions and the positional information system that considers the action of morphogenesia by the growing phase to the team. Now, this margin patterning system is quite important since we look at morphological distance. Since we look at the morphological differences at the leaf margin, and from comparative genetics, we have seen that both leaflet sensorations are patterned by a conserved network that involves the action of the CAC transcription factors, which expression of which we see here in yellow at the margin, that then promotes accumulation of activity maximum of endolic hormone oxygen, and this they do at least in parts by part by encouraging older. By help by encouraging polar distribution of the oxygen transfer therapy in man, which also is encouraged in a well-known feedback loop with oxygen activity. So these interactions together, when kind of coded with differential equations in growing leaves, are sufficient to give repeated production of outgrowths. Now, this is what's conserved between those two species. So you get repeated serations. Species, so you get repeated serrations or leaflets. Now, what is different? That we have come to through genetics. So, layered on this conserved system that produces this oxygen activity maxima that you see here in cardamomy is regulatory divergence of two classes of homeobox genes, expression of which you see here. One of them is called reduced complexity or RCO and has a role of repressing global growth at the basis of the Growth at the basis of emergent protrusions. And to connect to the previous discussion of Christophe, I'd like to say that this gene was identified through formal genetics in Cardamin. It was not known before. So had we done with known regulators, we would have missed a fundamental component of divergence here. And then there's another class of transcription factors called nodes transcription factors that are expressed more broadly in the leap and this prolong and slow down global growth. Slow down global growth, and we show during using both genetics and models that the combination of this is sufficient to account for a lot of difference in form. So, that's introduction. What I want to discuss today is a specific project by a very talented postdoc, Neha Patia, who looks at RCO. And so, this is RCO expression-reduced complexity at the basis of emergent leaflets. RCO is the growth repressor. And if you followed what I said before about the oxygen patterning mechanism. The oxygen patterning mechanism cut is also a growth repressor and is expressed at the lengths of growing leaflets. So, Ney has the question, right, so you have two repressors at the leaf margin patterning leaflets or responsible for leaflet formation. How do they relate to each other during development? And by co-localizing expression of this using confocal microscopy, she found that actually result in this Actually, they result in this nice striped mutually exclusive pattern. So, the question is: why should you have two repressors expressed in different domains at the leaf margin? To ask that, what's the regulatory logic of that? We have forced the expression of RCO in the cart domain in these plants here, and you get a very striking morphological transformation whereby you abolish completely formation of this lateral luclex and their corresponding oxygen maxima. The corresponding oxygen maxima, you see here in this transgenic strain, and you subdivide the terminal leaflet here into this trifolate form. This is rewarding because we knew that unlike HAC2, RCO is expressed in the terminal leaflet. So it makes sense now that when you put the growth repressor here, if you subdivide, you can get a completely normal geometrical form. What does RCO do to the growth of cells to cause these changes? By using the time-lapse approaches, we By using the time-lapse approaches we found before, we could see that RCO represses both cellular growth and proliferation. Here you see a heat map of growth, and you see you have no growth here where you don't make the lateral linklets. And we have also shown that other than being sufficient, which this shows are COVID necessary for erasing growth to separate these linklets. And you see the quantifications here. Now, to study this in more kind of fine resolution, Kind of fine resolution. Neha is employing a genetic mosaic strategy where basically using transgenic manipulation we induce clones of RCO activity in patches of the leaf. And you see here what these clones look like. Then if we combine this experiment with time-lapse, imagine we can go and sort of track growth of a clone and proliferation of a clone as the leaf grows. And you see examples. It grows. And you see examples of such clones here where we've overlaid the quantification over the expression marked by GFP in the confogal microscope that you saw before. And what you see is that if you compare the RCO sectors to control ones, you actually reduce both proliferation and growth. So this seems to indicate that RCO represses both of those two parameters. We wanted to relate then this back to wild type. Relate then this back to wild type development and to CAC, which, as we said, has a mutually exclusive pattern, even though that is also a regressor of growth. And this we have done by fake mapping the cells that express CARTOR RCO early development and following basically what they do later. And what you can see here, hopefully, is that CAC2 expressing cells, we, despite the fact that We, despite the fact that they experience growth repression, will eventually grow out and give these enders, whereas RCO ones seem to be in a sort of permanently repressed state and have much less proliferation. So what we conclude from this then is that CAC2 limits growth in proliferating sales. That to us is logical because CAC2 defines this pattern in domain where oxygen will promote the Whereoxy will promote the outgrowth. So, therefore, it makes sense that you would need proliferation there. Whereas RCO actually represses, which acts after patterning during differentiation of the organ, also repressed proliferation. And it may be that one of the effects we see in these strains that you where you block completely leaflet formation also involves other than growth repression actually limiting the pool of leaflets through. The pool of leaflet progenitor cells. So, we now want to take this information and construct models of these different processes of growth repression. And the question for this meeting is like this, what are the most appropriate frameworks for incorporating these two distinct modes of growth repression and their different relationship to cell proliferation in tissue-level models. And to do that, actually, if anyone is interested or you know anyone who is interested, we have. Anyone who is interested, we have an open PhD position for a theoretician to work on for making salient fission-level models of these processes, working with Adam Radiums in Calgary with the Max Planck Partnership program. So, as take homes, I'd like to say, well, I hope you've sort of been convinced that understanding how genetically related networks influence the distribution of the amount, direction, and duration of growth is fundamental to understand. Growth is fundamental to understanding not only form but also its diversity. I've shown that regulatory evolution influenced local post-patterning growth through RCO and broader differentiation-linked growth through NOx divergence separately. And that our docceliana is actually stripped down with respect to both because it has neither an RCO gene in its genome nor NOx expression in its leaves. So, therefore, this would. Leads. So, therefore, this would argue. I would argue to understand development fully, you need to study not only the modeller apidopsis, which is derived in this case, but also its relatives. And specifically, I've shown that you have two growth-repressive modes sculpting the complex leaf margin of cardamom. One implemented by CAP, which allows proliferation and continued oxygen-based patterning despite promoting that repression, and the post-pattern. Repression and the post-patterning one involving RCO, which also prevents proliferation as the organ differential. So, thank you very much, and happy to discuss. Thanks a lot, Richard. And of course, to acknowledge everyone who helped this project. And particularly, I'd like to thank Richard Smith, whose computational tools have been invaluable for this work, and also Sam McRuzinti, which is in Calgary. Femekrus Institute in Calgary with whom I actually started modeling these processes over 10 years ago, and other modern PhD students in his lab. So the thing, thank you, Miltos. Maybe you can stop sharing so you see the audience. There is time for questions. Very good. How would you link these findings to the first talk we heard from Aradafan? Because you have a Fun because you have very strict domains where you have different growth and proliferations, so there is a conflict there going out of play. Do you see anything like this? Do you have any thoughts of things a bit? I can't see a necessity to involve the type of process he was involved in. And actually, when doing through various kind of sometimes genetic accidents, other times. Genetic accidents, other times more intentionally would make chimeras, leave chimeras with different levels of RCO growth repression in different side of the leaf, left and right. For example, we also once got a chimera where it's active only on one side of the leaf. No, the other side didn't care. So it seems to me that you don't strictly need this notion of coordination. No, it continues to develop as it would normally, at least with this dream. So, I don't see. I mean, let's say I very much share that idea of the left and right arm that recorates. That's how I thought about this. But, of course, I mean, I'm not a physicist. Question from Eric. Just to follow up on this. So, when you did your clonal analysis, did you see a change in the neighboring sectors to kind of compensate for a lower drop in the yeah. For a low roll in the yes, we are actually looking at this now, and also Richard Smith is generating some models. But so far, I would say with the, oh, this is not only now, I don't see tremendous, we don't see tremendous effects on the neighboring cells. So, what we would like to do is get clones of increasing size and evaluate the effect. So, in my Effect. So, in my, I predict that there will be some distortion, if you like, and this will reflect what I think Rico had actually called the difference between specified and result and true. And aside to this, Neja has evaluated or has started evaluating pin polarities in cells that are kind of expressing RCO and their neighbors that don't, because one might predict. Because one might predict that there's a mechanical conflict there and that maybe things would change. But so far, we have not seen changes of pin polarity there. We are now going to do this in the sectors that it's a bit better controlled and also include that in interpretation of what you raised, which is, I agree, a very important question. One question uh and Rico Rico is Yeah, thanks, Miltos, for that very interesting talk. One of the issues it raises, this is more of a comment. When we've got this term repression of growth, it's not just that growth is not just in one dimension. So you're dealing with different orientations. To what extent do you think these issues are to do with orientations as well as rates of growth? And how do we deal with that? Because I think in the literature, quite often. In the literature, quite often people talk about repression of growth versus non-repression, but actually, growth is not isotropic. So how do we as a community kind of develop a language that goes beyond repression of growth? Yes, I mean, I agree. This is very important. So how we try to approach that is sort of quantify effects and direction and talk, you know, about isotropic and nomadic. Know about isotropic and non-isotropic growth, and try to see if we can find evidence for expression of a gene also influencing direction. And for RCO so far, we haven't seen compelling evidence that it influences direction. However, as we were discussing also with Henrik, this will very much depend on the kind of cell level contacts. So I think that's very important there. That's very important there. Thank you. But I would say, I mean, concretely to link here for CAG, there is evidence you can measure an effect on the direction of growth much more easily than what you can do for RCO. But of course, they're expressed in different domains, and calculus more linked to patterning. So, you know, one needs to think carefully about that. I think that if I may come back, the in. In the world of cell division, they had these terms periclinal and anticlinal in relation to the surface. And so, I always found those confusing terms, by the way, but let's forget that. It's almost like we need another vocabulary to be able to talk about growth directions. Because when you start, the question is, what do you relate them to? So, pericline and anticline is related to the surface. But maybe we need to think about. But maybe we need to think about sort of growth rates like parallel to an edge or I don't know. I don't have a solution. It's just that we don't have a vocabulary to discuss these things. I agree. I mean, we try to decompose growth and cross-the approximate distal and meteolateral axis. And that's the best approximation we know n at least we have now. And I think that's a a useful one actually. A useful one actually because then it can be linked to models as well, so it allows some kind of more nuanced comparison between models and time large series. But of course, it's an artificially imposed coordinate system, so one has to be aware of limitations of that. Though useful, it is useful. Thank you. Yeah, there is time for one brief question. question if any not the case okay thank you and we will move to the next speaker on zoom it's um amir vile amir are you here i hope so yes hi this is uh can you hear me oh yes okay excellent so amir is from mcgill he's a mechanical engineer by trading if i'm correct to If I'm correct, to turn a couple of years ago to apological modeler. And we had the market interest for Francis Erwall, and he's going to talk about how penmans have become wavy and what could be the function. Florida, yours. Exactly. Thank you so much for the introduction. So I am a former postdoc and PhD student of Ania and as a part of And as a part of my PhD and my postdoc research, I investigated the effect of, I mean, the how and why of pavement cell vapy shapes. So first of all, I should say that I'm very glad that I'm here today and presenting my results among you great scientists, which I consider as my extended family. So with that said, I move on to the topic. So pavement cells. Topic: So, pavement cells they form wavy cells, you know, whether that in many is very prevalent in many plant species, and they form interlocking shapes that give the epidermis an integrity, as opposed to the underlying layers of mesophiles that sometimes can have large air gaps. So, this pattern is very prevalent, as I mentioned, amongst different species. Among different species of both dicots and monocots, of course, to a varying degree of waviness. You can read more about it in the paper by Shivan and Woffly. It was published in 2019. The two questions that have fascinated scientists and modelers alike for years has been why and how these wavy shapes are formed. So today I'm exploring our results. Exploring our results about the why question. So, the hypothesis, our working hypothesis was that the patterning, the cellular patterning, increases the toughness of the epidemic. But to test that, they required an isotropic material so that we can only investigate the effect of patterning and not the material. For that, we engraved the patterns obtained from epidermis of Arabidopsis and onion onto PMMA or plexiglass, and we And we made samples so that we could fracture and investigate the forces required to fracture as well as the fracture path in the samples. So we had a total of five different groups of samples. We had samples with rig shapes taken from onion and then a 90 degree orientation of a reorientation of these as well as two baby patterns, which were essentially a reorientation of each other. Of each other. And the fracture of this specimen showed that when the cells are aligned with, when the crack is aligned with the grain, it can travel long distances into the weakened interfaces. While when it is traveling against the grain, it has difficulty and it just mostly cannot follow the cell lines. For the baby cells, we had a mixed type of fracture. So we had Type of fracture. So we had fracture following the cell border while also entering the cells at some point. And when the interdegetation is getting deeper. And looking at the force of fracture, comparing these, we saw that the control specimen, I mean intact or unpatterned specimen, had a very brittle fracture behavior. The force increases and then suddenly The force increases and then suddenly fractures the whole sample at one go. While the sample where crack travels along the grain is very similar to the unpatterned specimen, very brittle, but the ones, the other patterned specimens, they showed a resistance against fracture with the continuous load bearing for the sample. And we had up to 60% increase in the In the work of fracture compared to the controlled specimens. So I also asked one of the co-authors, a colleague, Olivier, to perform some simulations. This was fantastic because simulation of crack propagation is not trivial and many available techniques, for example, the extended finite element, they tend to be reliant on the meshing, mesh size, meshing technique and the results. And the results are not always reliable. But with his code that he has developed as a part of his PhD, he was able to simulate the propagation of crack in 2D, in a 2D tissue with interfaces that have different toughness and different mechanical properties. And we observed that there are combinations of the toughness and stiffness. And stiffness fluctuations between the cell borders and the cells that we get close to the experimentally observed pattern, that the control behaves very brittle. And then the samples that they're pattern wavy or the grains are stacked against the perfect direction of the crack, they become tougher. But how about the real tissue? How does the real plant tissue? How does the real plant tissue behave? For this, I performed tests on onion tissue and I did various tear tests. So, in this case, for example, you see the tear that is being forced to travel along the grain of onion epidermis. And it could also, we also tested it to, I mean, we forced it to travel against the grain. And as you expect from the previous simulation and the plexigo. Simulation and plexiglass results: the travel path, the force required to tear the tissue along the grain showed a brittle behavior, increasing the force to some degree and then falling rapidly, while traveling against the grain showed a consistent and persistent load bearing and increased toughness. And here are like the comparison of the work to tear the epidermis against and along the tear. You see, like it's about three times how. It's about three times higher to go against the grain. And we have a reorientation of the tear when traveling against the grain, sometimes 45 degrees, sometimes 90 degree, but along the grain, the tear can travel straight past. So looking closer to see what is happening there, I observed that frequently when the tear gets into or gets against a cell. To or gets against a cell border, it can travel against the cell lines very quickly, and the force required to propagate this tear drops. So the interfaces are weak points or weak passes for the crack. And that's why going along the cracks or along the cell lines can reduce the work or the energy requiring to propagate the tear. To propagate it here. What about in other tissues and epidermal cells of onion? What about tissues that they have wavy cells? So for this, I squeezed arabidoxis embarrio cut out of the seed between two glass slides. And I observed that the tissue can crack with the cells apparently getting separate from each other clean. From each other clean, without the cells themselves breaking and releasing the content. As we can see, that the nuclei remain there and the anticlinal walls of the neighboring cells are visible, meaning that most probably the cells were fractured at the middle amyloid. But other than that, this confirmed that in a multi-layered tissue of samples other than onion epidemics, we can have cell cells. Epidemics, we can have cell cell separation. But these were embaryonic tissues, and also the cell shapes were simple. Would the same be observed if we had fractured tissues with very wavy and inti-degitated cell shapes? For that, we performed crack tests on leaves with wavy cells, including Arabidosis and tomato, and we observed results. And we observed results that they were very similar to the flexi glass model: that we have a propagation of crack along the cell lines at some points, but then due to the waviness or due to the reorientation of cells from the trajectory of the crack, they enter the cell wall. And we have shown before using both physical models and numerical simulations that this would lead to increased toughness. Would lead to increased toughness for that tissue. So, to summarize, the wavy cell shapes would prevent the weak interfaces to be all aligned in one direction so that it increases the tissue toughness in all direction, prevent so that the brittle fracture is prevented and the tissue can bear more and more load, or the crack can be stopped. Be stopped and minimized. So, there are, of course, questions that we would like to explore. For example, how could we consider the third dimension or the mesophyll cells in the simulation or in the experiments? And of course, your comments and questions are most welcome and I would be very glad to take them. With that, I would like to acknowledge my colleagues and would like to thank you for listening to my talk. For this interview. Thank you. Flora is open for questions. Chris. Charlie. Charlie. That's okay. Chris. So, yeah, so thanks, Amir. That was a really interesting talk. And I'm curious about how this tissue might differ from something like a hypocrite. Puddle. We published a paper right at the beginning of this year that suggested that in the case of ripping a hyperpuddle, the cells tend to tear across the wall rather than separate from one another. And do you think that has something to do with the geometry of the hyperpod?
