You've been here at this time, making you miss the sunset. I hope you all had a good afternoon. We went to Lake Louise and then passed past that and then we looked at the spiral tunnel where the train goes into these two spirals. That was crazy. And then we went to these waterfalls with the three K's, what they call here? But that was also really good. Anyway, so let's get back to sort of soft matter and To sort of soft matter and biophysics. So, I will mostly, hopefully, mostly talk about one kind of recent, not yet quite published story about connected to microeology and something we do in cells, actually. But let me start a little bit back and kind of motivate a few things. And I also sort of stimulated by all the other fantastic talks I've heard. I'm going to throw out some food for thought, some little glimpses of other things we do. Of other things to do if there's time at the end. But if you look at one of these movies of a developing flame, we know that's of course the Holy Grail. That's what we, I guess most of us who are into active matter and this interface between soft materials, soft matter physics, and biology, would like to ultimately understand how does this very complex biological system evolve and form these structures out of just a single cell? And how are all these small And how are all these motions and forces and sort of phase transitions and whatnot coordinated? Now, of course, there have been very successful macroscopic theories, active pneumatics, and of course, Jean-Fran√ßois has been one of the pioneers in this area that sort of back off and then take a sort of descriptive mesoscopic or macroscopic view and explain quite a few things. But then, of course, in the end, you really would like to understand what's going on. What's going on in the cell or on a microscopic level, where you kind of know the layers, the proteins, and you want to understand how they exert forces, what they exert forces on, and how they are regulated, and the whole nine yards. And that's, I guess, is clear from also from many other talks. That's kind of the hard part in this whole business, to really connect the microscopics, the molecular microscopics, to the macroscopic events, collective motions and shape formation and structure formation. This is a movie from Dan. This is a movie from Dan Kiratz group where I collaborated with a Duke showing using basically a sim microscopy technique to see the top surface, the apicus surface of amniocerosa cells during doors enclosure in these phi embryos. And what you can see here is one cell is about this size here, so you see about six, seven cells here. And you can see phenopodia and you can see all sorts of structure on the edges between the cells. The edges between the cells. But you can also see in this, what's called the medio apic layer, you can see actin filaments. And you can see single filaments here. This is the leaky turf system so good that you can actually resolve the individual filaments if they don't bunch up too closely. But what you really nicely see is that there's a lot of tension, like these guys can be straight, and there's a lot of motion. And we know the motion is, like in many other cases, is generated by non-muscle bias in two. So the strongest motor in many events. And it oscillates, so this is. And it oscillates, so the system here, for example, contracts really strongly, and then in other parts, it gets pulled apart, extends, and so forth. And so, we really would like to understand, of course, how all this is regulated and how the material properties of the involved proteins, of course, but also the cell boundaries, the membrane, the cortex, and so forth, are all collaborating to make this interesting dynamics happen. What are the thick bundles? The sphinopodia, these guys are sticking out. Oh, yeah, these guys are sticking out. So this is a. This is kind of an embryo turned upside down, and it's sort of sitting flat on the glass substrate. And the leaky turf is sort of not quite turf, so the angle is a little bit below the critical angle, so you have some light getting crystallized. But here you can see a lot of action in this one plane. So, this is, of course, we want to understand. But we have also, of course, heard a lot about model systems. And like way back in the 90s, we started doing this microbiology in model systems, in vitro reconstituted model systems. This is, I guess, Sargent. This is a network which you know this is a one two micron meter in this case. And I'm using an optical trap here to pull it away from its equilibrium position. So the essence, this is social essence of radiology using this method. So you have a particle, a pro-particle that either fluctuates but does brownie motion in some kind of complex environment, or you'd use an optical trap to pull it away from its equilibrium position. And that's called active microbiology. So the first is passive microeology. Microeology. So the first is passive microoriology, just evaluating these thermal fluctuations. The other one is active. Now, this has been, of course, further developed by many groups. Dave Woetz Group has done a lot and many people have been using it in the meantime. It has a couple of advantages. You can get into small systems. You can also go to high frequencies. And if you have any experience in reality, you know that the interesting stuff uses over a very wide frequency range. And it's many decades of And many decades of time or frequency scale to look at. And being able to go to hundreds of kilohertz with these microscopic probes is actually a big advantage. Now, that is one thing, but you can also get you can test the independence, so you can test internal length scales in the system. And you can, if you look at an in-homogeneous system, of course, you can also look at different places and so forth. And in the end, the idea was, of course, to get into cells. And Mingo has, of course, also done quite. And Mingo has, of course, also done quite a bit of that, so you can do that in cells. But I'll show you some more recent developments, which I think are even better to apply than just a speed microeology. So I want to keep this first introductory part short, but one thing I want to point out is that you can actually use this combination of active and passive microoriology to study non-equilibrium systems. If everything is equilibrium, it gives you the same, basically the same information. The same, basically, the same information, and it's a bit more tedious to do active microoriology because you have to do it, for example, just by using a lock-in amplifier and go through different frequencies, so it's time consuming. But if you have a non-equilibrium situation where the fluctuation theorem doesn't hold, and well, you probably all know, but you use the fluctuation dissipation theorem and the passive rheology to get to this response functions, and from that you can get the g prime to double prime of your material. A material, but that doesn't work in the active system anymore because this emission is violated. You have more fluctuations than you would expect from the temperature that your system is at. And so you can use the combination of active and passive in the same sample with the same probe particle to figure out which part is not equilibrium. So basically you, for example, in this story we looked at a vitro system again of active filaments powered by a misomb. Powered by myosin motors. These were muscle myosin reconstituted minifilaments. And this is a movie, you sort of see when you look closely that they're moving a little bit. And they're kind of more or less, it's a stationary system because they're cross-linked. That means they're not doing this super precipitation phenomenon where it separates. And we just observe these fluctuating particles. And using this. And using this combination of active and passive, you can actually, I guess, don't even need to look at this. If you look at basically the response function plotted here, there's a big discrepancy between what you measure in the active method, which is the dots here, which should reflect the real mechanical response of the material, and the fluctuations that exceed what you expect from the material properties because the system is. Properties because the system is actively driven. So, having this two of these two measurements in hand, you can just subtract from your passive fluctuation data the response function that you generate by the active method. And what's left is the interesting non-equilibrium part. Not going to go deeply into that, but you can do that with cells, the same kind of thing. So, you can do it not just with an artificial reconstituted thing. With the artificial reconstitution, yes? But the passive, you showed the particles. Were you doing the particle tracking microogy, or was it the passive where you had the B trap? Are they both? Yeah, so technically we just use back focal plane detection. So we have quadrant outs, we image the back focal plane on the quadrant dials, and we keep the particle weakly trapped, so we don't crank up the power to suppress the fluctuations, because then you don't see the low frequency particle fluctuations anymore. Frequency part of the fluctuations anymore. And you can do that with one particle, two particles, and the whole nine yards. The video you showed there were there was a particle tracking? The video, well, well, okay, I should have said that. So you can also do video particle tracking. Jadell has done a lot of that in the beginning in DevHerts code and so forth. So you could do video tracking, but you're limited in frequency. And so if you have 60 hertz videos or so, you don't get very fast and you don't get very much bandwidth. So it's much better. You get much more. You get much more resolution at least if you put your laser trap on one of these particles and then just use the quadrant photo to take the data to 200 kilohertz bandwidth. So that's what we usually do. In cells, for example, you can also do particle tracking. Okay, so now getting closer to the living system. So you can track fluctuations when you, for example, track a cell. This is a highly active cell. It's trying to eat these beads. But we attach colloidal particles, polyscattering or silica spheres, by fibrodectin to a cell, and then do the same thing. I mean, I didn't mention two-particle microeology, which is also one of these extensions of the regular microeology that was first developed by John Crocker and then Tom Mason and people in Dave's lab. So, here you basically look at the fluctuations of those two beads, and you can also oscillate one of the beads. So, oscillate one of the beads and you can do active and passive at the same time. This one shows, of course, extreme fluctuations. And then you do the same thing, you can subtract the active from the passive, and you can isolate the non-equilibrium part with these fluctuations. And just again, very briefly, you see this very, in this case of beads on two cells, these were fibrobus, two beads on a cell, you see this very generic omega to the minus two fluctuation. Get to the minus two fluctuation spectrum, force, I mean the power spectrum of the force fluctuations. And I just want to point that out because that is seen in many situations inside of cells, on the outside of cells, and seems to be a very universal phenomenon in these biological living systems. And there's a very nice explanation for that, simple explanation in the paper by Alex Levine and Fred, also going back to Andy Lau's work with Tom Lewenski. Work with Tom Lewenski. So you can understand that as basically a Brownian motion in force space. So you have distributed dipoles, force dipoles in your elastic sample or hisco elastic sample. And they're randomly distributed and they act on that beat that you're looking at. And that gives you exactly something that looks like Brownie motion. So it looks like in the mean squared of space it goes like a straight line with a slope of one. With a slope of one, but it's actually coming from these forces. If you turn off the force, then when you turn off the ATP, it goes away. So that's one thing you can see very universally in cells. But the next problem that I want you to realize is that in many cases, people look at it here in cells. This is typical, this comes from their waterman's lab. It's a nice picture, and I like it because she has a different color scheme. Like, usually, everybody's doing Color scheme. Like, usually, everybody's doing microtubles in green and actin in red, and so it's really a nice variation of that. I like that very much. And in any case, so this is sort of a typical cell picture with the other two main bed words. Sorry, so it's not the bimentin you don't see here, the microfilaments, but in yellow the microtubules and in the purple the active filaments. And this looks like the whole cytoplasm is filled with this polymy network. With this polymer network. And that's misleading because that may be the case in an adherent cell. But if you have a cell in a tissue, or in a simpler case, a suspended cell, like the ones we were suspending with the two optical trucks, the actin is actually quite confined into the so-called cortex, which is what, half a micron to a micron thick. And then so there's not much actin in the middle. There's microtubules, which I don't show here, and there's, of course, intermediate filaments as well. But all the actin is out here, and not all the myosin is out here. Not on the myosins out here. So you see that here in a similar image, also with fibroglast actually, where the non-muscomyosin 2A is labeled. You see, it's pretty much in the cortex. And interestingly, when you turn off the myosin by using the Sleb-Statten drug, the myosin immediately goes away from the cortex and the actin stays there. But what I want to point out with this is that thinking about the mechanics and the sort of relevant properties of actin in cells, you should worry about. You should worry about the cortex and not so much about this sort of space-filling three-dimensional network of actin. And also, here it's interspersed with microtubules. Here, the microtubules are coming from the microtubule organizing center in the middle of the cell, and they only kind of touch the actin near the cell membrane. So I wonder if mixing microjubose and actin is realistic for this case, maybe for this, but for the sort of suspended case, which I think is also more. Which I think is also more representative of what cells look like in tissues, in many tissues, that probably would not be the case. Now, what we did with these cells now and the optical chart technique, we did microbiology, but in this case, in the simplest case, not by going through all these frequencies and looking at high large bandwidth, but we just indented the cells actively with fairly small amplitudes and very low. With fairly small amplitudes and very low frequencies. And what you then get is just a force displacement curve, so an elastic sort of indentation curve. And that is, I think, telling us a few interesting things. I want to spend a few slides on that. So what I think is important to realize is that you have to worry about two things. You have to worry about the volume of the cell, which is basically kept constant by osmotic. Basically, kept constant by osmotic conditions. So the cells, the mammalian cells, have a little bit of turbopressure, very little, like fraction of 0.1 atmospheres or so. But that's, of course, what makes the cell round, quite spherical when we suspend it. And then it's sort of viscous on the inside, but it has this cortex that is an active network. And if you model that, I mean, if you take these experiments and you take data and you get these curves, or these sort of more or less straight lines with quite a bit of noise, of course. We have been modeling this with finite element methods, and we have been modeling it with a shell model. So we take basically a thin shell model filled with, or basically keeping the volume constant and filling it with a viscous fluid in the time-dependent simulations. And this is sort of what you see in terms of the fluid movement, if it has fluid inside, and this is the stress distribution, and so forth. But the point is, what happens when you have a spherical shell and you indent the shell? The shell and you indent the shell, what you do, the response comes from stretching the cortex. So it's not coming from the deformation of the interior or anything, it's just coming from stretching that cortex. That's the stiff part, basically the mechanically elastic part in the cell, and that's what you have to work against. And we can discuss later if that's in any way relevant for adherent cells and so on. So that's, you know, if the cell is not exactly spherical, of course, you can also deform it without stretching the cortex. Stretching in the cortex. But for the suspended cells, that works pretty well. And so we use this finite element method to fit the data, and we get some numbers that are quite reasonable when you think about what is known for active networks. So this is the Young's modulus of the cortices that we get in various measurements. We tried bead radius dependence because if you have a If you have the other model that people have been using as a first approximation, it's the Hertz model. And in the Hertz model, you should get a very bead size-dependent response. And the fact that we can vary the bead size up to 8 microns and we had smaller ones, and we don't see much of a difference in the result is already a point that tells us, or a result that tells us we are dealing with a shell with an elastic shell rather than an elastic solid. And also, interestingly, maybe, but I don't want to go deep into that. When people do that, if you put in that stat, and at first we thought it might change, but with this large arrow bar, at least we don't see much of a change when we turn off the miser. The other point is that if you try to, and then many of you probably know that Paul is co-authored an important paper trying to figure out what's going on with all these measurements of cell stiffness. This concept of cell stiffness has been around, and people have. Stiffness has been around, and people have tried it with AFM and you know, rock and beads. And there's many, many different experiments measuring cell stiffness, and they come up with numbers that are many orders of magnitude apart. And that has been a bit of a puzzle. But I think the resolution to that puzzle is that we see here, if we use the Hertz model to fit the initial part of our data, I mean the Hertz model doesn't predict the straight line, but if you just use it to fit the initial part of this compression curve, we get something that's for the young sportiers of the material that's 10 tests. Of the material, that's 10 to 20 Pascal. The cortex is something like 10 kilopascals. And so there's the orders of magnitude difference. And if you use now the finite element to fit the data here in this one case, we get a much better fit. So we don't get this. The steep downturn of course comes from indenting the hell deeper into the solid. You would expect a fairly steep increase in in in the force, of course, if you have a solid, but much less steep of an increase when you have a shell. Much less heat of an increase when you have a shell. So the Hertz model really doesn't fit for cell mechanics. And once you give up on that, well, get a number of some of them before that, right? Yeah, so here you can see we get that for a shell, if you assume a thickness of 0.5 microns. So that's a reasonable assumption, but maybe also a factor of 2 or so. But then we get something like 5 or 6 or so kilopascal for the Young's modulus. So that's 3 times the G, so it's a kilopascal. G, so it's a kilopascal or so arrange for the shear modulus, which is consistent with what people have seen in methods that address directly the cortex, like the Rocky method of fretworking patterns. The other point that's important is this volume conservation. So you basically, many of you have probably heard about it, but the point is that the concentration of osmolites in the surrounding medium, in the buffer, and in the cells is so high that it's extremely. So high that it's extremely, it takes a lot of force basically to squeeze the water out of a cell. And that force is so large that it would disrupt the cortex easily. So if we take the numbers that we, the acidity numbers that we found for the cortex and calculate force displacement, force indentation curves for different assumptions for the osmolarity of the solution and the inside of the cell. So we just assume this is the real thing. The 7.4 atmospheres corresponds to 300 milliosmolar, 350 mm. To 300 millios per R, 350 milliOhs per R, which is 150 millimolar buffer. And so that's the real situation. But even if you go down your factor of 1000 in the osmolite concentration, basically, it still doesn't change the volume if the cell has the cortex as a stiffness of 10 kilobytes per. So that's clear. Of course, a cell can change its volume in different ways. It can open channels and let ions out, potassium ions, and so forth. So that is an active. And so forth. So that is an active method that we don't take into account. But the volume changes that you would get for the physiological buffer conditions are 10 to the minus 7 or something like that. So you can totally neglect that. And of course the reason is, yeah, I don't want to spend too much time on it, but if you think about the Laplace pressure and the tension on the membrane, given the radius of a typical cell, and you put in numbers for the osmotic conditions and for the Osmotic conditions and for the rupture strength that you would expect for the actin cortex. There's sort of a hand-waving order of magnitude assumption that the maximal tension that the material can withstand the rupture stress is typically the youngest audiobooks for the material. So that's just engineering experience. And if you then calculate what kind of pressure a 10 kilopascal cortex could withstand at a radius of 5 microns. At a radius of five microns for the cell, it's like a fraction of an atmosphere. So basically, the cell cortex would rupture if you try to squeeze water out of the cell. But now comes the next question. So now we know we need to worry about the cortex in the living cell. How can we actually get more detailed information about the cortex? So, brief excursion about methodology. So, we have been using these fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes for a while to basically use them as. Use them as stealth probes to look into confined volumes. Because the cortex is only 0.5 microns, so if you try to get a bead in there, that's not going to work. Because the bead is either getting expelled or it's too large to get inside the cortex. So you can't really get information from that. Now, the carbon nanotubes were something that came in collaboration with IS University, especially with Battio Paswali's group. And Nikta Fakhi joined the I mean, Nikta Fakhi joined the group as a poster, and she brought the know-how and the carbon analytics from Rice. We started playing with them. And they're kind of nice because they don't bleach. If you do fluorescence, you can shine 500 milliwatts of laser light on them. They just stay around for days and weeks. They also have a very small diameter. So this is, of course, diffraction limited. But if you look at the actual diameter, the diameter is only a nanometer. So they can sneak in very tight places, like in a mitotic spindle or into a cortex, it's important. Into the cortex at some point. So we'll be using those. I'm going to skip over the next story anyway. And then get to what I really wanted to tell you, the slender filament macroeology story. So the idea is now to use these filaments and look at their fluctuations and use them instead of the probe particles, the rigid spheres, the rigid beads. And the advantage of that is, first of all, they're stealth probes, so you can get them. They're stealth probes, so you can get them into these tight spaces and they don't really perturb the network. So, if you imagine an active network or even a polyochlamide gel, they can sneak in there and then the gel itself is not going to care. It doesn't feel much extruded volume from these very thin probes. But on the other hand, they have long length scales. The length of the modes, the first mode, second mode, third mode, are in the micron range. And so we can probe a material on length scales on the on the micron range without perturbing the material, without being blocked out of the material. Without being dropped out of the material. Christophe, can you remind me about the fouling? I mean, carbon energy is probably, stuff will stick to it, but it just maybe it's so stiff it doesn't make a difference if something sticks to it. Well, I skipped that part, but so what we do is they are water-insoluble. So you get them as soot, basically. So you get a bag of soot and you have to get them into into solution. So you can either use some some more active philic detergent or something to to wrap them, but that's not so good if you want to get them into cells. Good if you want to get them into cells. So, the standard method to get them into cells is to wrap them in single-stranded DNA. So, we get 30 oligomers of DNA and we sonicate the hell out of them. So, you have to use quite a bit of force and they get wrapped in a sense. Michael Strano and people at MIT have worked on that also. So, you get the bases sort of flattening out on the hydrophobic surface of this sp2 hydrogenized carbon, and the backbone is sticking out. The backbone is sticking out, that means you have fairly highly negatively charged outsides. And so they don't stick too much inside the cell. DNA doesn't stick. And they also don't get attacked by DNAs because they're denatured in a way. It's only the backbone that is sticking out. Yeah? Alright, I'll have to hurry up. Okay, so we have these filaments, and we want to evaluate their fluctuations. So you parameterize your filament in the Fourier space. Parameterize your filament in Fourier space, so you look at modes and mode amplitudes. Turns out the eigenmodes of a filament with open ends, you can look up in this of the course, Sergei Aragon's paper from the 80s that they developed for DNA fluctuations. Actually, it's a bit of a slightly complicated hyperbolic sign, but it's a well-known spectrum of eigenmodes. And so we write down the equations for each mode. Down the equations for each mode, the equation, the Langevin equation for the modes, and then, of course, relate those fluctuations in the end to the embedding medium. So basically like this, we have a G here that comes from the surrounding medium that we want to probe. And the both amplitudes will feel that the will of course feel that surrounding medium and be larger or smaller depending on the stiffness or softness of that medium. So we're not going into too much detail. So, without going into too much detail, then in a passive system, in an equilibrium system, you again use fluctuation dissipation, and you get a response function out of that thermal, so it's a KT. And then you calculate from your video data, you calculate the amplitude, the mode amplitude as a function of time for as many modes as you can see, like one, two, four, five moles. Five modes. And then you get for each mode a time series of amplitudes. This is, for example, this is a five micrometer long carbon nanotube in a test solution. So instead of a cell or anything, it's in a hyaluronic acid solution. Very soft polygon solution, I would say. It's not even a gel. So you see these fluctuations of different amplitudes. The first mode has the largest fluctuations, of course, because it has the lowest bending amplitude. Fluctuations, of course, because it has the lowest landing energy and then the other modes. And if you calculate the mean square amplitude differences, so how they develop over time, you can fit all three modes and you get information about the G prime and the GW prime of the material. So we tested that against conventional materialogy in the same system. And so a short answer or a short upshot from that is that it pretty much fits. Upshot from that is that it pretty much fits. Of course, as microoriology goes, data is always noisy, but it fits the conventional methods to develop. I should say there's different philosophies about interpreting or showing microoriology data. So Dave Waits and then people who are using his methods usually show a functional fitted curve and then you have very smooth curves. We have always been trying to show the actual data that is quite noisy. But in any case, yeah, reality is noisy. But in this case, we have, of course, a lot of. But in this case, we have, of course, a lot of information because we have many modes that are reporting on the same medium. So, what Kengo Nishi, the poster group who was working on this, figured out sort of using all these different modes or many, a couple of different 10 filaments or so, different length filaments and 10 recordings, globally fitting the power spectral densities of all these modes with one plane. And this plane, I mean, this fit, of course, includes also the bending stiffness of the carbon nanotubes. Of the carbon nanotubes, which I didn't mention yet. So, this is the medium, right? And the alpha double prime, the total alpha here, and then the bending stiffness, of course, of the filaments is part of that, that determines the mold spectrum. Now, last two minutes I want to spend on the continuation of this story in cells. Now, the first part was kind of a test in a simple solution and showing that it works, but it actually works also in. Works, but it actually works also in cells. That's what I find sort of the most interesting feature or application of these methods. And what we did is we looked at Michael2 rules and Michael2 rules fluctuated cells. That's well, everybody has seen that. They're driven by myes and motors normally, so that the thermal fluctuations are almost negligible, but they are fluctuating quite a bit when you look at a movie. And so, actually, I should also say, we also use magnetic tweezers with a magnetic bead to test the. With a magnetic beat to test the viscosity of the cytoplasm as an input parameter that we can use to decrease the parameter space when we do the fitting. So these were healer cells. This is SIR2 million labeled labeled 2 million in life microscopy. And this is sort of a zoomed-in view. So you can see these microtubules are fluctuating quite a bit. Now, these are not sort of fluctuations. These are driven by actomyosin that you don't see. But then we do the same and with. The same evaluation that I showed you before, but we include an active term. So we have a term here that includes the driving forces. And we have to make some assumptions about those driving forces. We need to know basically how far apart they're spaced. But we basically have a free parameter here that describes the characteristics of these driving forces. Talk more detail later. But that makes the whole fit function a bit more complicated. Complicated, but we in the end don't have too many parameters. We have this CFF, we have the response of the medium, and we have the bending stiffness of the microterioles. So now we can do either one of two things. We can stick in some knowledge about the bending stiffness of the microterioles and then calculate the alpha and the CFF from the data, or we can sort of do a separate experiment that I showed you with the magnetic beads, measure the alpha of omega, and then stick that in here, and then get the kappa of the microtubules. And that part I want to. Mycotubules. And that part I want to focus on in the last slides because post-translational modifications of microtubules in cells are one of these rays ones that people don't know. Well, people know a lot about the chemistry, but it's not so clear what the mechanical implications are. Like if that makes the microtubules stiffer or softer, and that's not so easy to do in vitro. So we try to do that in cells. And first of all, yeah, this is you can skip that. So we use the magnetic piece to estimate the The magnetic beads to estimate the alpha of the cytoplasm in the cells. And then did the same fit that I showed you before for the hyaluronic acid. So we have different mode, different Q values here on this axis, frequency on this axis, and we have these power spectral densities. And we can again do a global fit of this sample of curves. And in this case, get a kappa of the magnitude. Kappa of my cat tube was all of that. And if you, well, let's see, I think there was a value somewhere here. Oh, yeah, here. So that's the bending stiffness you get, which is sort of in the range of what people have seen in video experiments. But as I mentioned before, those numbers are all over the place. But it's a reasonable number. And then we did, oh, one more thing. Yeah, we looked at also, there was an idea that Kengo had, that if you look at microchips that get called really Look at microchivers that get pulled really far, like this guy here, get really pulled far from their sort of straight equilibrium configuration. It's a good assumption to assume that at that point there's sort of a motor pulling, and when the motor lets go, it just snaps back, driven by its bending stiffness and by the surrounding medium. And if you don't even look at the time of the relaxation time, but you just look at the shape of the microtubules, the shape tells you basically something about the ratio between the menu's the. Something about the ratio between the menlinic stiffness of the microtubule and the response of the medium. This is the famous fourth root of this ratio of kappa and g prime of the medium. And so we fitted, Kango fitted a whole bunch of shapes and also got a pretty reasonable, so they fit quite well. And he gets a shear modulus out of this for the actin that's surrounding these microtubules. And you can see he compares the two. And you can see it compares it to the data found from the GADIT TWESES experiment, and also that's pretty consistent. And also, importantly, if you put in latrine A, then that bending length gets much longer, which means, of course, there's less confinement. So, if you pull the microtubule, it bends over a much longer length. So, that is all quite consistent. So, that's one sort of little thing that you can also do. So, this is a few more of these shapes. This show you that we didn't use just for that one. Just for that one. And now the last slide is the post-tension modification. So we worked with Antonina Rolberchak from the NIH, who is a specialist in these post-tension modifications of microtubules, and looked at polycutamylation. And we overexpressed the enzyme that polycontaminates the microtubules in these cells. And then also, of course, the e-hook of So, of course, the e-hook of microtubules is already quite negatively charged, and that's where all these modifications usually take place. So, you change the charge. And if we do all the procedure we did with the heavily glutamylated microgals and compare that to the control cells, we find the model factor of two difference in the sense that the cells that have the poly contaminated by control. Have the polycontaminated microtubules have a stiffness, the microtubules have a stiffness that's about two times the stiffness of our control cells. So I think, yeah, that's what I wanted to tell you. I just want to show you one teaser because we were talking about actin networks and actin microtubuled mixtures and so on. So this is something we, slightly different story, but we started this with Kinder at Caron. So we made these emotion droplets with Xenopus extract. And you can see here a really steady state flow system. State flow system where actin gets contracted from the edge of the droplet to the middle, but the depolymerizes goes out to the back. So, this is a steady-state flow pattern that has, of course, driven by ATP. And in this first case, we knocked out microtubules. But what I really want you to sort of appreciate is this one. So, when you don't knock out the microtubules, and you have kinesin in there as well, then you get this really cool spiral flow. So, you get this is microtubule-labeled, this is actin-labeled. So, it has the top. This is actually labeled. So it has the time, it changes the time. So, and this is the DLC image or phase contrast image that shows you sort of dirt with surrounding oil. It starts from the beginning. You can see that at first, here you get sort of a Milky Way of microtubules that has a chirality that drives the rotation of the whole contractile flow. And when that is contracted to the middle, then the rotation stops. There's a counter rotation in the outside oil that of course balances the force. So that's just Balances so force. So that's just a cute teaser I wanted to show you. It's also not published yet, so we're working on that. So, in conclusion, I wanted to remind everybody of microology, and then I mentioned these omega minus 2 fluctuations, but that was not the main point. So, the main point I wanted to get across is that you can use these, you know, we sort of developed this new way of doing microeology using filaments and looking at their fluctuations and then using these different length scales of the different modes of the filaments. Different length scales of the different modes of the filaments, the eigenmoles to do analysis basically on different length scales. And of course, you can use MicroGUs or other intrinsic filamentous structures in cells, so you don't need to introduce any probes at all. Since I'm seriously running out of time, there's a lot of people involved in this. So Kango did most of the work I showed you with both the ayuronic acid system with the filament rheology and then also the self-system. With the cellular assistant. Anfam helped him. Somebody at Bezat did the work with the cells. Nichta was a postdoc and, of course, now risen to fame at MIT and brought the nanotubes into the lab. And I didn't show you, I skipped over some of the early data that she got. This has been a long-time collaboration with Fred, of course, and also Matthias Postfalli at RISE for the multi-tubal modifications that was going on with Antonina. Is still going on with Antonina. Jim Hardin and his student Rahil Golipo were involved in the, and yeah, I just skipped over the details, but we are working with them on trying to understand these flow patterns. And Frank J√ºlicher and his postdoctoral Seani Ducli were involved, or still involved in that. Dyske did the early work on these non-equilibrium gels and this method of active and passive. He's now been for a long time now at Fushu University. I think there's a lab in MIT, and Kinrit did a sabbatical. Kinrit did a sabbatical and G√∂ttingen helped us with setting up these contractile things. And Duke, of course, other posters here, John Go actually has been doing the contractile networks. And Dan Kiar's lab, I only showed you this UV in the beginning, but we also worked quite a bit with him on tissue mechanics. So I hope I didn't flood everybody with too much information. No, Dan? So with a summon fluctuation, if I understand correctly, is that you basically are treating the media as a simple continuum, like one component thing, up until contact with the film in itself. Isn't that questionable in the... Well, I mean, like, the active network, or is it not obvious about the fluctuating filament, but we assume it's a homogeneous spectrum. So not just one contact pointer. So not just one contact pointer. So for the force. For the force sometimes. Sorry, I didn't say one I thought I meant that it's a one component meeting on the outside. Like you're not allowing you don't have like poles that the filament can bend in and stuff like that. That's right, then we assume a continuous continuum or continuing background. Yeah, which is like a case like an actin mesh where it's not obvious. I don't know if you just comment on the mesh size of actin is on the on the scale of 100 nanometers in the cortex or even if you have a Cortex, or even if you have an adherent cell, because these were adherent cells, so you squish the two cortices together and then you have multi-tubes in there. So, a typical mesh size is on the order of 70 to 109 units. So, that's way below the smallest mode we are looking at. But the first mode is 5 microns, second mode maybe 2.5 microns, and then 1 micron. So, so you get down there to maybe little micron, half a micron or something. But still way above the typical measurements. Ray was first. Rabel's first. Back to where you had the two beads that were pulling on the cell and you did the force extension curves. You said that they were linear. It seemed like in both of those that you showed, you said it was noisy, but it seemed like there was a distinct kink. Yeah, I have some more, some extra ones that I can show you. So they're all quite crazy, but you can. Right before they start. Yeah, it seems like both. It seems like both of them write at like zero. There's a bigger one. Yeah, but others don't have that. Yeah, but others don't have that. And so it's really just every individual cell is acting a little differently. And of course, the bead may give this bead is sort of stuck in this little groove here. And so there's details that give you these crazy shapes, but we have quite a few curves that on average give you a straight line, but there's detail in there which is... We did some smoothing here because the correlations, this looks like a correlated curve here, but there's actually quite a bit of noise that we filter out. So this is a low-pass filter. Filter out. So, this is a low-pass filtered version of the actual force displacement curve, and these correlations are coming from the low-pass filtering. But not all of them, maybe there's some underlying crazy stuff happening with the B system and so on. But what I didn't point out is there is a bit of hysteresis, and we also fitted that in with a finite element, but it turns out to be fairly negligible on the on this time scale of uh a few seconds. We we we go back and forth, um, I was a I think uh twenty seconds or so back and forth, so so fairly slow. Forth, so fairly slow. So, historesis, yes, we can see it. We focus on that, then we go faster, but the structure is still quite under control. So, I don't think it means anything. One last question. You saw the big spread in Blettas. Why do you get so much more noise from both the Saturn? Yeah, I'm not so sure. So, I guess we would need to. Sure, so I guess we would need to repeat that and get more statistics. I mean, we can talk about later. Technically, we have a better setup now. We have one of these Lumix C trucks, and that's going to be much better. But I should get all the way.
