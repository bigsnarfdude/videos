Pablo, thank you very much. You have done a great job. I love this meeting. And also from the organizing team, Janos, thank you for advising me and inviting me. I would also like to thank Luis Montejano, who has introduced me to this beautiful. who has introduced me to this beautiful area and supports the Mexican team working on this area and also to Rolli who has supported me all my career. Thank you very much, both of you. And so I will talk about a theorem of Louis, which, in my humble opinion, besides Twerberg's theorem, is Besides Twerber's theorem, it is one of the deepest theorems in convex in combinatorial convexity. And let me tell you first the original one because I will change a little bit the setting. So he observed the following, which is beautiful. So if you have three red convex sets in three dimensions and three blue convex sets, And three blue convex sets with the property that each red intersects each blue. Then there is a line transversal either to the blues or there is a line transversal to the red ones. And the original proof goes more or less as follows. Correct me if I'm wrong, please. So you have this configuration in three dimension and you project it to the And you project it to the line. And then, in the line, you can apply a colorful Heli, which will give you a point transversal to one of the colors. And then, if you look back to the fiber, then you have a plane transversal to such a convex set. But you can do this in any direction. So, this gives So, this gives you, in this case, two coloring. So, if it is transversal to the reds, you put that direction in the corresponding Rasmania, which in this case is the projective plane, and you paint it red. And if it is transversal to the blue, then you paint such a point blue. So, this gives you a two-coloring of the projective plane. And using some bit of topology, you can find there a monochromatic Moebis bond, which gives you a lot of transversal planes. We call this an essential line transversal, or also we used to call it a virtual line transversal. And in this case, since we have very few convex sets to have a virtual To have a virtual line transversal turns out to be equivalent to have a geometric line transverse. So, more or less, this is the idea of the proof. And this was later generalized in a joint work with Roman Karashov. And when Luis was presenting this problem, he said, well, you know, we are using all these tools, you know. All these tools, you know, Halley, colorful theory and projections, and topology, and this essentiality in the Grand Banyan. So is there a simpler proof of this fact? And he offered $100 for such a proof. So that was enough for me to go. Yeah. So that was enough for me to go into the problem. And I found the following. And I found the following proof. So the first thing I observed is that this is really a problem about nine points on three-dimensional space. And these points will represent the intersection of the, you know, the red, blue, and so on. So you have nine widness of the corresponding intersections. So you can. Sections. So you can change the setting a little bit and say, well, now you have nine points. Choose your favorite nine points and partition them in three red triangles. And then partition them again in three blue triangles with the property that each green intersects each blue. And then the solution to one is the solution to the other. And of course, the conclusion is that there is a line transversal. There is a line transversal either to the blues or either to the red, and so this is what I will prove. I hope it's nice to talk on the very last day because every single tool I will use has been mentioned already on the previous days. And you will see it's very simple. It's really very simple. Hey, yeah, yeah. Now the special effort. I think it's the empty report, right? I'm sorry about that. Here's a little perception. It doesn't have to happen, but you're going to go out anyway. So, it was not online, so I will start from the very beginning again. I'm sorry. I'm joined back to Monday and. Demanded then. In blue, yeah, means This is the rascal combination. Oh, my goodness. Okay, so maybe maybe I can continue.   And uh so if you have a separation Separation. This means that there is a two-plane which lets one of the convex sets on one side, the other two on the other side. And then you can so we were here, so we suppose it is not true. True, and I arranged my nine points as I said. We just give names to the nine points. And so we may suppose that U is separated from BW, right? Because there is no line transversal to the blues. And since there is no line transversal to the reds, then we may suppose. To the reds, then we may suppose that A is separated from BZ. And we will encode this in the following way. So we take a plane, which is the witness of such a separation, and we will point a unit vector in the direction of the set U. So just to remember on which side was the single. Remember on which side was the singleton, right? And we do this for, for example, for these two separations, and this will give me two points on the unitary sphere. And then I can take a spherical segment to join them, which has all the right to be named A, which is the point that is the intersection of U and A. And I do this with all separations that I have there, right? So I have plenty of separations there. And if you think a little bit of it, what I have done is just a drawing of K33 on the two-dimensional sphere. As you may all know, K33 is not planar, which is Which is tricky in the sense that it may be seen as a topological argument, therefore, a counter argument of Louis saying, hey, maybe I should not give you $100. But on the other side, it is also a very easy geometric fact, which you can prove without any knowledge of topology, right? Just by trying, you try, try, try. try try and if you and if you insist to use it and and even if you insist and i'm going there so the the original k33 is uh it becomes topological when when you allow to to have a strange segments but if you want to do it with the straight segments then it's very easy right then it's completely geometric so i got my hundred dollars And so you do this with all separations, and as we know, we will have a crossing there. And I say that this crossing is the contradiction we were searching for. And for that, I will prove the following lemma. I change a little bit just the notation just to. Of the notation just to keep it simple. So the crossing edges now are named X and Y. And without loss of generality, I may suppose it's X and Y, right? And so I will prove the following general lemma. So now I have four semi-spaces orthogonal to the vectors A, U, W, and Z, respectively. And I have a point. And I have a point X which is on the positive side of A and U, but is not on the positive side of W and Z. You know, it was on the positives and for the Y, it's the opposite, right? So Y is in the positive side of W and Z and not in the positive side of A and U. So this is our hypothesis. And the conclusion of the lemma says that the positive cone of A and U and W C should be empty, and therefore, this contradicts the existence of such a crossing, right? Of course, this is the positive code intersection, the unit the sphere, right? So we can now concentrate on proof this lemma, and this will contradict the crossing. The crossing. For that, clearly, this is translation invariant. Therefore, I can suppose that the origin is in the intersection of the two planes, HA and HU. Now I cannot suppose that the origin is in WZ, but I just pick up a point there which will allow me to write things easy. And the hypothesis. And the hypothesis of the lemma can be written just in this very simple form, saying that x is in the positive side of A and it's in the positive side of U, but it's on the negative side of W and C. So if you see, this is just a translation of the hypothesis. Very simple. And now again, we negate the The conclusion trying to find yet another contradiction, and we suppose that there is a point on the positive cones of A, U, and WZ, which I can write as a positive combination in this way. And now comes the magic. You know, dot product is very powerful. You just put this on a sag. On a SAC and make some accounting. So what happened with Z dot X? Well, I can substitute Z in this case with this representation. And we know this is positive, this is positive, i and j is positive, positive plus positive is positive. Positive is positive. On the other hand, Z plus X minus P, and now I take the other representation. And then this is negative, this is negative, this is positive, positive times negative, negative, negative plus negative, negative. And then you substitute, and then you get to z dot p is positive. That's very easy, right? Very easy, right? This should be taught in first semester of any mathematical career. You knew how to do it on the first semester, right? But now we do the same, but instead of taking X, we take Y and we do exactly the same, and now it turns out that Z dot P is negative. P is negative, but as we all know, it cannot be positive and negative at the same time. So, this is a contradiction. And this contradiction came from the fact that I supposed that such a point exists. Therefore, such a point does not exist. Therefore, these two edges do not cross. Therefore, I can embed K33 on the two-dimensional. K33 on the two-dimensional sphere, which contradicts the fact that I cannot. So this ends up the proof. Very simple. But now Luis said, well, I already paid 100 pesos, the $100 for this thing. Come on, push it a little bit more. Give me more. So I okay, say okay, okay. I will go a little bit further as far as I can. And so the first thing I want to observe is that this general lemma, first of all, is independent of the dimension. And secondly, it can be generalized. I mean, I'm using here to have spaces A and U, but you can have a whole pair. And u, but you can have a whole pencil of hyperplanes there, and another pencil with in the side of wz. So this can be generalized in the sense that you have two pencils of hyperplanes satisfying the corresponding hypothesis, and you will find that this is these cones of vectors of one pencil and the cone of the other vectors of the other pencil has to be. Vectors of the other pencil has to be empty. This is just a straightforward generalization of the lamp. Having this in mind, then some other things came to my mind. First, as I said, to have a line transversal in the separate Separated language, we would say that it has the Radon dimension at most one, namely, given any three of them leads to a Radon partition, right? And if not, then we can say that this has dimension two, rather than dimension two, very simple. So the first question that comes to the mind is Is this inequality in general true? So I have two separate, the blue separoid, I have three convex sets. I have the red separoid, which is the red ones. And this arrangement can be interpreted in a kind of product. If such a thing exists, it doesn't have to exist always, but we arrange them. It, but we arrange them in such a way that they do exist. And now we read this. So, what it says is that it was very important that we were in dimension three. So, in dimension two, this result is trivial, and in dimension four, it's non-true, right? And if you read it here, it And if you read it here, it exactly says that if in order to be in dimension three, you need that not both of them are dimension two. And therefore, one of them has to accept a line transverse. So, this is one interpretation of the problem. And to be honest, this is still an open question. I think it I think it with the correct translation in general, it will be true, but I haven't written the details. So I think it is nice to have in mind. And the other thing is we can go one step further. So what happened now if we go to R4? So in R4, the correct statement The correct statement is well, first I have to use the blackboard before this. There is another generalization which is trivial from what I say and is taking also in dimension four, but now I have reds, greens, and blues. Blues and I if the correct graph that you have to do is kind of complete three three three but with the notation that someone used yesterday with put here three and then you take all these uh triangles Triangles and it's easy to see that this three regular graph cannot be embedded in S3 or in R3, if you will. And for that, it's just simply look at what is the link of this vertex. And then this vertex is seeing K33 there. So therefore, there should be a crossing and this crossing traduce crossing. So for three columns. So, for three colors, it's easy to go to dimension four. The correct dimension is four. But this is trickier. There's another way to go in dimension four, which is now you have 12 points and you partition them in four triangles and in three tetrahedra, such that again each red intercepts each blue. intercepts each blue i recall you three times four is 12 and you take this uh this hypergraph whenever you have a a pair on the left you join it with a guy on the other side and and in general you have to take the the small half let's say on the sides again this is easy to see that this it doesn't embed on the corresponding It doesn't embed on the corresponding sphere again, just by watching on the link of this vertex, for example. It's watching a K33. So there has to be a cross intervention is that either the three tetrahedra accepts a line. Tetrahedra accepts a line transversally, or the four triangles accepts a two-plane transverse. However, I have the impression, this has not been yet corroborated, but I have the impression that the conclusion is a little bit stronger. And I would like to see a proof of that or a counterexample. If you remember, what we really used to get the witnesses of the separations, it was really what we can call to be in convex position, namely that each singleton is separated from the complement. And with four convex sets, you can be plannar. Is the plan R in convex position or not? And I think that the contradiction goes a little bit further, that it is not in convex position. So it's not only that it accepts a plane transversal, but the conclusion is that a little bit further, it is not in convex position. And And I would like to see approval for this for the next workshop. In R4, yes. Can it get a stronger conclusion? Well, again, this is very tight. This is known to be tight. So in dimension three is trivial, and in dimension five is non-true. And you can expand. This is a beautiful theorem. I mean, the full power of the theorem proved by Karashov and Mondekhano. They can go expanding colors, expanding the number of sets in each color. But the numbers are very, very precise. So if you push it here, then you have to push the dimension one. Depending where you push, it's very strange. And they have. it's very strange and they have uh some of them not all of them this is still an open area they they have uh many many tight results which they can prove this they are tight but uh there are still some other ones which are just bands on the damage Thank you very much.
