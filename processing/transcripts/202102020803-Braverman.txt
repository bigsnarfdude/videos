Our talk this morning is one of the survey talks. So you've had already two of them, and there's five totals that will cover various aspects of the monopole story. And this morning we start with Alexander Breverman talking about monopoles and quasi-maps in representation theory. All right, thank you for the invitation. Now, I have to apologize that I'm extremely bad at giving survey talks. So I will, well, I will try to do my best. Well, I will try to do my best. Not sure how much representation theory will appear there, but basically, let me sort of give you some kind of rough plan. Rough plan is going to be so. Well, I'm going to start by discussing. Well, I mean, another point about which I have to apologize is that my knowledge actually Is that my knowledge actually of what monopoles are is extremely limited? So, in a sense, that I'm sort of an algebraist. And so, that's why the purpose of the first part of the talk will be to sort of get rid of monopoles and push everything into algebra. So, let me write it like this: algebraic interpretation. Of maybe some uh moduli spaces of monopoles. Now, I should say maybe already at this point that there will be some statements that they're going to formulate, but I think that most of them, well, maybe at least some of them are. Well, it is some of them are actually probably not me, or is there someone else? So at least some of those statements I think have now been proven carefully by anybody, at least to the best of my knowledge. So let me just put into randomnesses that there will be if you Parameters that there will be, if you wish, some open problems and then the second part will be actually discussed the same The same modular spaces now as algebraic varieties and explain where the appear in let's say geometric representation why the same variety why people care about the same varieties geometric representation Now, maybe the key, I mean, there'll be like several instances, what kind of model spaces we'll consider and how they will appear, but sort of the key relationship to variety appearing in geometric representation theory will be various kinds of mostly, how do you say mostly affine. Okay, that's kind of the plan. Well, maybe there will be part three, which is somehow. I mean, all of them, this part one and part two is something relatively old, but part three is going to be. Old, but part three is kind of more recent. Also, let me talk about relation to Coulomb branches of, let's say, 3D and equal four supersymmetric gauge theories. So I'm not sure, I don't have much time to talk about this, but maybe I'll mention something like I'll talk a little bit about this towards the end. Talk a little bit about this towards the end. Okay, and that's kind of at least partly parts of this and more recent. All right, so now what's the setup? So the setup will be as follows. First, I'm going to fix some group G, and because I want to sort of eventually make things algebraic, that will be a complex algebraic group. That's a complex. Group. That's a complex algebraic that's a semi-simple, maybe simply connected group. For example, we can think about SLNC and we'll denote by And we'll denote by GC its maximal compact subgroup. For example, in the case of SLN, that will be the group SUN. Well, and sort of, I want to give several examples of sort of if you. Sort of, if you want, correspondences between a modular space of monopoles and some complex algebraic writers. And so the monopoles, so there will be some kind of correspondence. So here I'll have monopoles, and the points at monopoles will be for the group GC and well and And well, and typically one are free, maybe with singularities. And so, here I want to relate this to some moduli space. Modulus basis of algebraic data. Now, typically here on the left, the thing on the left will be known to be a hyperkiller manifold, except that, you know, I mean, I'm going to start with an example when it will be truly a hypercolonial. Example, when it will be truly a hypercaller manifold, but in some sort of a little bit more advanced examples, that will be not precisely the case because sometimes this modular space I will consider here will be singular. So sometimes singular. And here, the thing that will be on the right, that will be just an algebraic variety over C. But in fact, well, let me ignore the issue of singularities for now. But the point is that if you see the sort of smooth parts, then it will be. Then it will be an algebraic variety, and usually it will have an algebraic or complex symplectic structure. And so these two structures, I mean, hyper-Kelly manifold and say, say, algebraic variety with the holomorphic symplectic structure, this is not the same thing. This is not the same thing, of course, but these two things are kind of pretty close to each other. So formally speaking, well, the statement will be of the following sort, that on the left I have hyperkeler manifold. And then if you choose one particular complex structure among this, say one word of hyper complex structure you have from the hyperkelin structure, then that thing actually comes from an algebraic variety. And actually, if you start with any hyperkeliman, If you start with any hyperkali manifold, if you pick one complex structure, then the corresponding complex manifold comes equipped with a holomorphic symplectic structure, and this holomorphic symplectic structure will also have an algebraic interpretation. But that thing is, well, I mean, the thing that we got on the right, so the formally speaking. Right, so the formally speaking contains a little bit more information. Well, I mean, even that, I mean, if on the right we just considered the structure of holomorphic manifold with a complex with a holomorphic simple structure, that would be strictly less information than just having hyper-Kannon manifolds. If you see the algebraic structure, then, you know, algebraic structure, because these monopoles are going to be non-compact, and algebraic structure will be sort of cannot be recovered from the holomorphic structure. So somehow it's not completely right to say that. It's not completely right to say that the right-hand side contains less information than the left-hand side, but it sort of contains a little bit less information. So you certainly won't be able to see the metric on the right. But this is something I'm going to ignore. Okay, now what's the kind of main example that I think almost everybody in the room knows about? So main example. Is uh sort of framed GC monopoles one R3. So these are kind of some data. I'm not going to, I think I shouldn't, especially given that it's the second day, I'm not going to write the actual equipment, monopol equation. Actual monopolar equations, but this is kind of a standard sort of Gamolean equations. And so framed means that we can so frame means that we impose some standard boundary conditions, some condition. And such things have a charge. And the first thing is, where does the charge lie? Well, I mean, like, if you look at the T. Hitchen book, then this is all about SL2 and or SU2 for this matter. And there, the charge is just a non-negative integer. In general, the charge is an element of the following lattice. So let lambda be. Lambda be the core weight, and that's the same thing as a core root letters of G. So in other words, if T and G is a maximal torus, co-way the same as coral because I assume my group is simply connected. So this is a maximal torus, then we put the latest lambda to be just the latest of co-characters of the torus. Call characters of the Taurus. And this thing is, well, this is spanned by core roots of G and we put here lambda plus inside lambda. This is positive linear combinations, no negative linear. Combinations or negative linear combinations, combinations of positive core roots, and then the charge of a monopole. Is an element in lambda plus. So again, example: if g is SL2, then lambda is naturally z and lambda plus is naturally z greater than zero. So in that case, So, in that case, it's a positive integer. And then we can consider this, let's call it Mk. This is the modular space of monopoles as above with charge. With charge, with charge k and k is again an element in this lambda plus. So a little later we'll consider also monopoles with degenerations, but for now let me not do this. Let me just do it. Let me just consider actual monopoles. So Uh, yes, sure. So, with this definition for SUN, you do admit monopoles with non-maximal symmetry breaking. You allow them? Um, frankly, I'm not sure what this question means. Uh, so well, I mean, so well, essentially, well, the Hicks field at infinity has eigenvalues, right? And the question question is. Like I said, some so it will take me a second to translate this to a language I understand. So yes, I think so. I think so, yes. Okay, thank you. This would probably be special. These would probably be special points on the model, I space. No, Sasha? You know, I mean, like I said before, I mean, my knowledge of monopoles is close to being negative. So I just, I mean, I know kind of formal definition, and that's it, because I always work with algebraic interpretation. So, but in terms of, yeah, I mean, you're right, I should be able to say what the boundary, uh, properly, what the boundary conditions are, and uh, yeah, I've. Yeah, I I think you're right. Yes, I think you're right. But I mean, there should be a mass as well as a charge from the physical point of view. Yes, and Sasha elegantly put it all in the words boundary conditions. Right. So as a manifold, this will depend on the mass, but as a variety, as a continuous parameter, right? I mean, and charge is a discrete parameter. I mean, and charge is a discrete parameter, so I only sort of care about the discrete parameter, right? Because as a variety, as a complex variety, it will not depend on that. So, I think that no, actually, you know what? I think, let me take back what I said before. I think I want to fix the angular values of the Higgs field at infinity. Am I right? No, sorry, I don't want to. Yeah, okay, sorry. Yeah, so I allow. Yeah, so uh so I allow uh and you want it to be in the regular orbit, I imagine the we find charge, yes. Uh well that might be maximal symmetry breaking, mightn't it? Or I might be no no, maybe you're right. Maybe I do want maximal symmetry breaking. Moro and moreover, I want to fix it. Yes, I want to fix it. Okay, you do want maximal symmetry breaking. Yes, I do have for this purpose I have maximal symmetry breaking and this is going to be and I'm going to fix the actual eigenvalue. Fix the actual eigenvalues. That's good because I started worrying. Sorry, yes, they're fixed and it's you know it's maximal symmetry breaking and the indexual eigenvalues of the fixed heat field are fixed. Okay. So then what I want to say is that, right, I mean, in principle, right, because we discussed it, because this discussion of the mass, then in principle, you know, as a manifold, this As a manifold, this doesn't depend on any additional parameters, but somehow, if you want to put a metric on it, and things, then somehow it actually depends on continuous parameters like the mass. But this is something I'm going to ignore because for my purposes, somehow it will never show up. What I want to say is that there's the following theorem, but somehow this theorem is also, as far as I understand, not really proved in full gene. Not really proven for generality. So actually, let me change the notation slightly. Let me put the letter C here, so to indicate that I'm working with a compound group here. As opposed to that, I want to consider a different modulus space, which is just Mk, which now will be kind of algebraic writing. Variety and what this consists of is the following. So, first of all, I take my group G and I take its flag right here. So, B here is the Borel subgroup and this is the flag variety of G. And well, and so well, embrace of flag variety is defined even without the choice. The embers of flag variety is defined even without the choice of particular browser group, but the choice of a particular browser subgroup allows me to choose a particular point in this. Let me call this variety actually, let me call it X, and I will choose X naught in X. This is a special point, which just in this interpretation, when I write as G mod B, this is just the point one, if you want. And then if we look at the second homology of X with integer coefficients, this thing. With integer coefficients. This thing is our is the same lettuce lambda. And then we can consider then mk without the c will be the following space. It will consist of all maps from projective line. When I write projective line, I mean complex projective line to X which are Which are which have the following two conditions, which first of all, the based maps, and based maps means that infinity, the point infinity in P1 goes over to this fixed point x0. So this is something I want to, this is some point I want to fix. And second is that the maps, let me call this map F. f and the degree of f is equal to k and again degree degree is an element of the second homology of the of the target and and that's so that makes sense okay now let me formulate the theorem and i think that again some people in the room will tell me what what precisely is proved through so i think that first of all maybe when before formulating actually the the full theorem let me say that if g is so t Full theorem, let me say that if G is SO2, then let me give a precise formula. I mean, let me describe the space more precisely. Then the point is that if G is a CL2, then my X is also P1. And again, I can choose this point, X0, to be whatever I want in P1. It's actually going to be convenient for me to choose this point to be choose X0 to be also infinity. So then we're talking about So then we're talking about maps F from P1 to P1 of degree K at which send infinity to infinity. Now, a map from P1 to P1 is a rational function of one variable. And the fact that they send, so f is going to be, I can write it as a ratio of two point nulls P of Z over Q of Z. And since I want infinity to And since I want infinity to be sent to infinity, then it means that I can normalize this thing in the following way and be of degree k. And so it means that P of Z is going to, I can write this Z to the K plus lower order terms. And Q of Z is going to be just Is going to be uh just degree of that is less strictly less than k and uh and and i want this p and q to be co-prime yeah usually in monopoly it's f inverse that is considered well okay i mean okay i'm i'm i'm right it right to denote it by f inverse but it's uh um so um And then I think it's a theorem of maybe, I don't know, probably Hitchen and Donaldson, maybe separately Hitchin Donaldson, that this MK C is naturally isomorphic to MK and this isomorphism. Well, it's so I said that, well, what I said before is true that this. What I said before is true that this guy is hypercaler, and this is an isomorphism, and this right-hand side is naturally an algebraic right, in particular. It's a complex manifold, and so they are isomorphic as complex manifolds where you use some particular complex structure on the left. And moreover, it's not difficult. I'm not going to write a formula, but it's not, if you use this algebraic interpretation, it's not difficult to write an algebraic simplicity. Not difficult to write an algebraic symplectic form on this thing. This is essentially an exercise how to do that. And if you want, you just describe the tension space to such a thing. And in fact, this is an isomorphism of complex symplectic manifolds. Now, I think that the same thing is actually true for all groups. So I think it's due to Jarvis. But as far as I understand, so So he only constructed a bijection sort of bijection. And it's a kind of question. I don't know if it appears anywhere in the literature. If anywhere in the literature it's written, it's proved that this is, for example, an isomorphism of complex manifolds. Well, for classical groups, Well, for classical groups, I think this follows from the paper of Hertubis. Oh, yeah, Hertubis. Yeah, that's very good. I said it. I forgot to mention Hertubis, and this is also, yeah, definitely Hertubis should be mentioned. Yes, but I think that, yes, for arbitrary groups, I'm not sure this is known. And also Algebraically, this on this MK algebraic, one can also construct an algebraic simpleactic form. Well, you can write just some kind of explicit formula for this. There's a paper by, I think, there's an old paper by Fig and Figen Finkelberg uh I think uh maybe Kuznitsov and Markaryan where this symplectic form is written explicitly in algebraic terms and and and and and part of this question whether the symplectic form is the one which comes from the hyperteller structure. From the hypertele structure, and I think that this question is probably formally not settled, but it's not for arbitrary groups. And I think that it's a kind of one of those situations where that everybody is sure this is true, but nobody ever bothered to check this. Okay, so that's sort of the example of this algebraic interpretation. Now, let me do some variants on this concept. Discussion, sorry, but again, for classical groups, that's known. Uh, is it actually known for classical groups about the symplectic form? I'm not sure. I mean, the question is how to define the symbolic. I mean, you have to first of all describe the algebraic definition. Once you have isomorphism with spaces of Names equations, then this follows from just the construction of products of Slodovis slices. Of Sladovi slices with their natural symplectic structure? Well, then there's a kind of, yeah, okay, I see what you mean, but that's not the definition of symplectic form I have in mind. So, I mean, I'm sure you're right, but somehow the point is that, I mean, then you have to compare this, then you have to take this MK algebraic, and then you have to, I mean, for classical groups, you can interpret this in terms of slow. classical groups you can interpret this in terms of slowly slices and then and then you have to but then there's a kind of uniform construction of simpleactic form for arbitrary k and g and uh and you have to compare just for classical groups where you have the correspondence with moduli spaces of solutions to numbs equations no no i understand but what i'm saying is that this definition if i understand correctly what you're saying is that uh somehow you in the end you're going to be comparing you're going to be interpreting this thing in terms of slow division You're going to be interpreting this thing in terms of slot of the slices, and then in the end, I'm going to interpret it in terms of rational maps. Of your right-hand side, MK. Yes, and the symplectic form, you're going to be writing also by twist formula in terms of rational maps. Okay, no, okay, then it's fine. But again, I think that for like E8, maybe it's just the same. I mean, I don't know. I'm not sure this is written anywhere, but again, this is not a question to me. Question to me. So now let me talk about the variance of this construction. They're kind of two directions in which it can go. First of all, it can allow degenerate monopoles. And then, you know, if you live not on R3, but You lived not on R3 but on a compact free manifold, then the point of allowing the generate manifolds would be to get a compact moduli space. Now, on R3, it will only be a partial compactification, so we get partial compactification. Let me call it MKRC bar and again. And again, the question is: what is its algebraic counterpart? And the algebraic counterpart can also be described. But again, I don't know to what extent this is Ethereum, especially. I mean, it's definitely Ethereum for SL2. Whether that's Ethereum in general, this is something I don't really know. The algebraic counterpart is as follows. As follows. Well, so we have to sort of allow some degeneration of maps, and the idea is that we need to consider what's called quasi-map. Maybe I'll give a definition quickly, based quasi-maps from P1 to X, which was my flag variety. And so let me say what is a quasi-map. What is a quasi-map? Well, in this particular case, and this particular case, quasi-map means the following. So, what does it take to define a map from, say, P1 or actually any source to the flag variety? Well, the point is that a map, so from P1 to G mod B is the following thing. Just let is equivalent to the following data. Is equivalent to the following data to the following data. For any lambda, which is a dominant weight now, not a co-ex of G, let V lambda denote the corresponding irreducible representation and then. And then a flag in general, in general, an element of X defines you a line in V lambda for any lambda. And so an empty flag variety defines you a line in such a thing to, well, over any point of your P1. So you can package this into the following date. Package this into the following data. So, this map F, let's say, from P1 to G mod B is, first of all, let me call it maybe F, which is a T, T is the maximal torus T bundle. Of degree minus k. K is my charge, so I'll give an example for SL2 in a moment. And so for degree of a T bundle is precisely again an element of my latest lambda. And then if I'm given such dominant weight lambda, I can turn this into a line bundle. I mean, lambda. I mean, lambda is a homomorphism from T to C star, so I can take the associated line bundle. And on the other hand, I can take the trivial bundle with fiber V lambda, and I need to embed this F lambda into, let me call this Kappa Lambda, embed this F lambda to Kappa Lambda, and this has to be a sub-bundle. And this data should satisfy some relations. So, this is for any lambda, but this should satisfy some relations, which are called fluker relations. And well, I'm not going to write down explicitly what they are, but the point is that this is all the data that you need. So, and well, so example. Well, so example: if g is SL2, then this is just equivalent to the then because of fluker relations, we can only consider lambda to be just the basic dominant weight. And then what this thing is, is just that you take, let's see, let me call it L, a line bundle of degree equal to minus k, and you need to put it into O of P1. into O of P1 tensor C squared. So C squared is the corresponding representation, well, this kind of smallest representation whose highest weight is the fundamental weight of HESL2. And this should be some bundle. And so, and kind of it's essentially obvious that such a data is the same as a map from P1 to P1. So I mean, you get, and you get here a line over every fiber. Line all over every fiber, and all together it gives you a map of degree k because this L has degree minus k. And so, well, and there's a base condition, and base condition is that at infinity, you get something standard. Sorry, just to, if you don't mind, sure, this condition too, you're saying there's a F lambda for all dominant weights, you can modify F. Is that what you're saying? Well, there's no modification. What you're saying? Well, there's no modification here. Well, I mean, I'm saying that for every weight, I mean, you can like if you have, I mean, kind of the first data is stored. I mean, here, the fact that it's P1 is not relevant here. I mean, I can, I can, I mean, I'm describing here what does it map, what does it mean to have a map into a flag variety from any target, from any source, I'm sorry. And so, what I need is that I need a T bundle on that source. And then And then once I have a T bundle for every weight, I get a line bundle because the weight is a map from T to C star. So I get an associated C star bundle, which is the same as lambda. And then what I need is I need to send this line bundle to the corresponding trivial bundle whose fiber is given by the corresponding bundle. bundle whose fiber is given by the corresponding representation. So it's instructive to think what happens when my source is a point, when you replace P1 by a point. And I claim that to define a flag, to define an element of the flag variety is the same as to define a line in every irreducible representation. But these lines all together should satisfy some conditions. And these conditions are precisely called Kluker relations. I can. Relations, I can okay. So, I get it. So, the f lambda is obtained by taking the transition functions of f and applying lambda to it to obtain new transition functions. Yes, so I mean, whenever you have a bundle with respect to some group, once you have a map between two groups, you can you can sort of you get the bun, if you have a bundle of spectral first group, you get a bundle respect of the second group. And so, here, my first group is T, my second group is C star. And C star bundle is same as the line bundle. But, I mean, Maybe, maybe, let me give you another example of G's SLM. I mean, usually it's enough to, because of flipper relations, it's enough to look here at lambda being the fundamental weights. And for lambda being the fundamental weights here, we have fundamental weights, let me call them omega 1 up to omega n minus 1, and the corresponding representations V omega i, this is the ith exterior power of Cm. And so here, what I need, I need, so for SLN, the data I need, and also the T bundle is uniquely determined by the corresponding associated line bundles for fundamental weights. And so here I need for every I, which again runs from one to n minus one, I need li, which is a line bundle of some degree. Of some degree, and then I need this map from Li to allow us to the trivial bundle with fiber x to the power of Cm. And but now this time we do need the relations, and the relations are precisely the Spluter relations, which again, I can. Which again, I can write them down, but they don't. I mean, I mean, the point is that you should, it's just the question, I mean, it's just the statement that just an element of the flag variety of SLN, just the usual flag, is the same as a line inside lambda i of Cn. But this is not an arbitrary collection of lines, but these lines should satisfy some conditions. These conditions are called Pluker relations. Okay. Okay. Okay. Actually, this is taking a little bit more time than I expected. But anyhow, what I want to say is that now, kind of main message is that degenerate monopoles, I mean, like when I say degenerate, I mean possibly the gen allowing degenerations. Allowing degenerations, possibly degenerate monopoles, correspond to allowing quasi-maps, and quasi-maps means that these line bundles are allowed to be just subsheaves and not necessarily line bundles, which means that this embeddings These embeddings, I call them F lambda into this O of P1 tens of V lambda are allowed to be sub-sheaves rather than sub-bundles not necessarily Um okay, and uh uh um so maybe again an example if G is SL2 then again you just take this O of P1 tensor C squared and here take some line Squared and here take some line bundle, well, or invertible shift L, and again you put it inside here. But the point is that on the level of fibers, this map is now allowed to have zeros. And well, but still, you require that if infinity, I mean, we still want this to be based, so it means that if infinity, this thing is still standard. And in terms of rational functions, this means that, so now this is the same. So So, uh, so subsheaf and degree of L is minus k, and so this corresponds to just pairs p of z, q of z, where p and q are as before, p is z to the k plus lower the terms, and degree of q is less than k. But the point is that this time we do not require them to be co-prime. Not require them to be co-prime. So, for example, q can be can be identically zero, no coprime condition. And so, in general, we get a singular. A singular variety, let me call it single algebraic variety mk bar. And again, I want to say that probably this MKC bar, when you allow degenerate monopoles, is the same as MK bar, but again, I don't know a reference. Sasha, um, yes, what what uh what happens if V of lambda is higher than C2? What does the question mean? I mean, uh, so uh no, I mean, I mean, you get the you get you get some line bundles, uh, but uh, I mean, for Okay, no, no, for SL2, this is easy because for SL2, I mean, I mean, weight, dominant weight is the same as a positive integer, right? And so all the reducible representations of SL2 are just some symmetric powers of C2. So you have some, let's say, nth symmetric power of C2, then so if you have this subsheaf. If you have this subsheaf L inside the OP1 tensor C2, then here you can take L to the power n, tensor power n, and it will naturally embed into an amp symmetric power of C2. So you can go from here to here. Okay. So this is what Pluka relations will tell. I mean, this is like a trivial case of Pluto relations. This is what Prukla relations will tell you. So let me give you. Tell which so maybe let me give you let me maybe give you an example of SL3. So, example, so if g is sl3, then uh you have, I mean, it's again enough to look at fundamental weights, but you need to impose some relations. And in fundamental weights, you have, so you have what are fundamental representations, you have C3 now and C3 dual. So, I mean, so here C3 dual as a representation of SL3, it's not isomorphic to C3. So, so, and then we need this line bundle L1 inside. bundle L1 inside O of P1 tensor C3 and L2 inside O of P1 tensor C3 dual and the relation what what what and in this case you have only one to put the relation so to say is that L1 and L2 are orthogonal which makes sense because the leaves sort of I mean fiberwise it'll even They leave sort of, I mean, fiberwise, they leave into dual vector spaces, but they are talking to each other, so and that thing is already essentially, well, and then, and you have degrees, so your k is now it's an element in two-dimensional lattice now, and essentially determined by the degrees of L1 and L2. And so we get the singular space. Space and well, I don't know any kind of reference to why this is the same as models 50 degenerate monopoles, especially for arbitrary groups. I mean, I don't know in what generality this is known. And especially, what does it even mean? Because somehow this time this is a singular space. And so it doesn't really make sense to say that it's a hypercallium manifold. So somehow, if you look at the kind of left-hand side, which is more actual modular space of degenerate manipules. Actual modulus space of degenerate manopoles, I don't really know how, in principle, we can turn it into a complex algebraic variety, or at least, well, I mean, we simply don't have, don't really have a language for that. So it's not that I just don't know a reference. I mean, I don't know a good formulation. But at least, you know, esthopological spaces, they should be the same. And again, I don't know if such a thing is known or not. So massage, well, unfortunately, I don't have too much time left, but maybe say. Don't have too much time left, but maybe as a message for the future, what I'm going to say, maybe in five or seven minutes, is that singularities of Mk bar are important in representation theorem. Representation theorem. Now, since I'm really running out of time, let me extremely briefly mention sort of another direction of generalization. Another direction is to consider monopoles with singularities. For SU2, this has been extensively studied by, for example, Chargis and Capustin. And again, I don't really know what's a good reference for those arbitrary groups. And this time, these guys are in bijection. Well, so the discrete parameters for this thing, let me say, like the discrete parameters for the modular space are pairs. Let's say, well, I hope this will not lead to confusion. Let me go ahead. I hope this will not lead to confusion. Let me call lambda and mu, but now lambda mu will be again co-weights. These are elements in lambda where same, these are co-weights. And the condition is that, first of all, lambda is dominant, little lambda is dominant, and lambda minus mu lies in lambda plus. So in the case. So, the case we consider before previous case falls into this paradigm in the following way. The previous case corresponds to lambda equal to zero. And then mu is forced to be in minus lambda plus. And so Lambda plus and so minus mu is okay. But in principle, you can define the spaces by allowing the modules to have some certain singularities at zero. So in fact, then you can define. Well, actually, you can do even more. You can allow singularities not just one point of referee, but many points for a free. And this will also have some interesting interpretation. Have some interesting interpretation, but let me just for simplicity do it at one point. And then these are parameters by such things. And again, you're going to have some smooth part, which is going to get called double lambda mu. And again, notationally, let me now for simplicity not distinguish the kind of differential geometric space and the algebraic space. Space and the algebraic space. I mean, I'll, in other words, I'll define. I mean, this will be the space of my single polynomials, but I'll say what the algebra-gematic interpretation of it is in a moment, maybe under some assumption. And again, by sort of doing some partial compactification, I can allow this to be to also put some bar here. And now, what I want to say is that this has again. Again, has a nice algebraic interpretation. And again, when I say has this means that it should have a nice algebraic interpretation. And let me tell you what the answer is, but somehow I don't know any place where that answer would be proved. Answer answer would be proved. And this is already very closely related to geometric representation theory. Namely, well, let me assume for some assume also assume that mu is also dominant. There's an interpretation even without that assumption, but that will take me like too long to explain. Let me so then I have a pair of dominant co-weights and so. pair of dominant coates. And so lambda and mu dominant and lambda is greater equal than mu, which means by definition that the difference is in lambda plus. And so these are also weights of what's called the Langlands dual group. So now the interpretation in this case Is in terms of what's called the affine Grassmannian of the group G. And so let me briefly say: so, how much time do I have? I have maybe, so when exactly am I supposed to stop? Hello? Trying to unmute myself. Trying to unmute myself. Uh, our plan is to have the next talk at 11. Uh, but then I have maybe four minutes, so then maybe it will be probably enough for me to say what I'm going to say right now, but I won't be able to get the actual representation theory. But this will be just an object from geometric representation theory, which is like in geometric representation theory, this is like an object, this is one of the most basic objects. This defined graph mine. And so, let me just maybe say briefly what this is. So, we take this field of Laurent-Power series, and inside we have the ring. And inside we have the ring of Taylor series. And then the affine Grassmannian of G, this is the quotient G of K mod G of O, and that's a scan of some kind of infinite dimensional algebraic variety. It was called an in-scheme. But the point about it is that it has some fine-dimensional flavor. The group G of O has fine dimensional. Finite dimensional orbits on this Grassmannian. And in fact, these orbits are in one-to-one correspondence with elements of the dominant part of Lambda. Now, let me warn you: Lambda plus and Lambda dominant aren't the same things, but this is just a different cone inside Lambda. And so we'll denote them. And so we'll denote them like this. And the closures are actually singular projective varieties. And the geometry, well, okay, so this will leave me too far apart to form out the statement. I don't really have time for that, but the geometry, let me say like this: the geometry. Of these guys has to do with something which is called geometric Satake equivalence, which is the starting point of another big subject. Another big subject of geometric Langlands correspondence. Again, I don't have time to talk about any of these things. But let me say that one sort of very small piece of geometry of this: that somehow, if you take closure of one orbit, it's going to be union of other orbits, and the union is over mu, which is. The union is over μ, which are lesser equal than lambda. And again, lesser equal means that the difference is the sum of positive core roots. And now, one sort of, well, let me put in a quotation mark a theorem, but again, I mean, it should be a theorem in some sense, that this W lambda mu bar is the transversal slice. And again, there's a particular construction of transversal slices, but no, transversal, you can view transversal. Well, transversal, you can view transversal slice, you can think about transversal slice as kind of in the kind of obviously obvious kind of intuitive geometric sense, but in fact, there's a precise construction of transversal slice slice to the smaller orbit inside the bigger orbit, and again, so these things are as algebra. And again, so these things are as algebraic varieties, they're perfectly well defined. They are actually affine algebraic, but this is an affine algebraic variety generically, it's kind of Poisson, generically symplectic. So it's smooth part is symplectic and Plexic, and uh, it should be really, it's, you know, this should be a theorem that uh should be an actual mathematical theorem that it's the same as this modulus space of singular monopoles. I mean, monopoles with some perception glaring at the point zero, but again, I don't know if this is proved anywhere. Uh, now let me uh also let me just finish by saying the following two things that this uh well, first of all, this is, I mean, this is only remember. first of all this i mean this is only remember this is only under the assumption that mu is dominant there is some similar well but more complicated i mean it takes more time to explain but uh but there's a similar interpretation for all meal And now, this maybe the last thing I'm going to say is that if you go back to this MK bar, which actually has to do with the case when mu is when lambda was zero and then mu is almost necessarily not dominant, this mk bar also has to do. So the point is that here, this theorem says. So, the point is that here, this theorem says that this double lambda mu bars they have to do with they're related to singularities of this orbit closures in the affine Grassmannian. And so one thing you study about singularities usually in geometric representation theory is their intersection Camology sheaves. And these are really related to some representation theoretic objects that I don't have time to talk about. And this MK bar has to do with singularities. Singularities of so-called semi-infinite sugar to rioters. And I just want to throw in the name, but I don't have time to explain this. So maybe let me summarize that the red is spaces of monopoles and Monopoles and they all have interpretations, or at least they're supposed to have interpretation as certain algebraic varieties. And these algebraic varieties appear as kind of geometric objects, which all have to do with geometry of some maybe infinite dimensional objects, which are related to the algebraic loop group of G. So, kind of maybe upshot is that algebraic internal Algebraic interpretation of various moduli spaces of monopoles on R3 has to do with The group G of K, which is sort of the group G of T, with the loop group of, or the formal loop group of G. And such guys, such things, such spaces, let me say it like this, spaces are very well known in geometric representation. In geometric representation theory. But this will take me at least another talk to describe how they appear in geometric representation theory. Okay, thank you. And sorry for going over time. Thank you very much. Are there any questions? I think we can take a few minutes for questions and then we're going to maybe pause for a couple of minutes and go to the next talk. But before we pause, any questions? But before we pause, any questions? So I had a question about the partial compactifications. Yes. So if I understand right, the partial compactification is never actually compact. No, it's not compact, but this is because we can kind of leave one R3 rather than a sphere, for example. If we leave it on a three sphere. Yes. Right. The point that we have to allow the generations to get this compactification, but we. To get this compactification, but we don't allow things to degenerate near infinity. So, I was wondering what the motivation is then. So, people are often interested to find complete compactifications, but why do okay. So, you see, one thing you may care about is that when you consider this particular coefficient, you get some single spaces, and you might be interested in. Be interested in trying to understand what kind of singularities you get. I mean, how singular spaces are. And this question is local from this point of view. So somehow now, also for a lot of physical interpretations, like for writing, it's actually for, I mean, a lot of integrals studied nowadays by physicists actually are written over non-compact spaces and they only Spaces and they only make sense because they're written over non-complex spaces. For example, and this is very close to what's going on here. So, the things like Nikrasov partition functions, they're kind of equivalent. I mean, the point is that you can have certain spaces which are maybe not compact, but they're compact in some equivariant sense. So I didn't talk about this here, but on all the spaces, some groups act. And so, for instance, if you have a space with a torus action, and if you have And if you have, say, finitely many fixed points, or if the space of fixed points is compact, then you can still integrate. I mean, usually you want to get compact modulus spaces because you want to integrate over them. But if there's a group acting, then you can integrate equivariant homology classes, even on non-compact spaces, provided that the space of fixed points for the corresponding toruses can be. Fixed points for the corresponding toruses come back. And this kind of was going on here when, when, when, so, for instance, if you go back to this space which I call the Mk bar, then you can integrate the unit chromology class over this MK bar, but in some equivariant sensors, I mean, there's some big group acting there. So, if you take this big torus actually acting there, and so if you take, if you work equivariantly, if you integrate equivariantly. You work equivariantly, if you integrate equivariantly, uh, but but for this, I really need mk bar of mk mk. And uh, then if you say, take the generating function of these things, you get what's called j function of the flag variety, which is uh some familiar object when you start a quantum. So this is this is some function which is sort of in a sense responsible for the quantum chromology of the flag, right? Something like that. So, so in fact, for uh in physics, for a lot of enumerated. In physics, for a lot of enumerative purposes, you do want to have a non-compact space, but it shouldn't be kind of if it's too non-compact, that's bad because I mean, I said that there's some torus acting here. So, if you study this difference between Mk and Mk bar, then on Mk the stories will have no fixed points at all. And then all possible integrals over that thing will be zero. But Mk bar is not compact, it's not smooth, but you can still integrate things over it in a covariance sense and you. Sense and uh you get some interesting objects. That's for example one okay, yeah, thank you Lorenzo Just short question Sasha if we consider uh periodic monopoles so what will appear instead of the geometry of a final well I mean maybe Misha will talk about this uh in his talk but somehow uh he uh it's um said theoretically, it's the same thing as Theoretically, it's the same thing, it's the same as the same based maps from P1 to the flag variety. But now, in addition to putting some condition at infinity, you also need to put some condition at zero. So it will be some kind of open condition at zero. So in fact, it will be an open subset of this space. But this is a little bit misleading. It's misleading and following sounds because, I mean, as an algebraic. Following sense, because I mean, as an algebraic right, it isn't just open-sum write of this, but not as a symplectic algebraic right. The symplectic forms will be different. But I mean, like, if you consider this SL2 example, in SL2 example, you had this rational function f of z, which is, which I wrote as p of z over q of z. And now you have to just periodically just correspond to condition f of zero is not zero. Something like that. Like that. So they will not be realized as transversal slices anywhere. Ah, from this point of view, no, no, this is, well, okay, so transversal slices appear in a slightly different situation. No, they're not. They're still as varieties, they're still, I think, open subsets and the old ones. But in some sense, the statement is true, but not useful. But not useful, I think. So, for example, one way to see why this statement is not so good is that, in principle, all these varieties, you know, they're all Poisson varieties, I mean, the single ones are Poisson, all the smooth varieties are actually symplectic. And this opening beneath one into the other, it does not preserve the symplectic structure. Symplectic structure. I mean, for instance, if we take this motor space rational maps with essentially Space rational maps with such that we send zero to non-zero, then you can write a symplectic form here, which will actually have a pole at the boundary, I mean, which will not extend to the space of all rational matter. And this is kind of typical thing. So, I mean, somehow the idea is that all these spaces have some kind of some kind of multiplicative brothers. I mean, this is all, I mean, I mean, this is all, I mean, the space I talked about, they were kind of, they have to do with the additive group, and they also have some multiplicative versions. And I think that Misha and his talk will also talk about the elliptic versions. Okay, so but the elliptic versions are more complicated, but elliptic versions are no longer open subsets in the additive ones. But I mean, multiple ones are still interesting precisely because they are kind of they have different subjective structures. Different sybactic structures. So, for instance, if you want to develop some kind of mirror symmetry for these guys, then usually mirror dual to something to some kind of non-compact guy like this will have this kind of, will be the multiplicative guy, corresponding multiplicative guy, at least in a certain sense. But still, these multiplicative guys are sort of, which are periodic monopoles, are not terribly different from just the spaces I talked about, but the The spaces I talked about, but the elliptic ones are kind of considerably more complicated. But I think that you'll hear about those in the next talk. So I'd like to give the last question to Lorenzo, and then afterwards, we're going to pause for a few minutes. Yeah, thanks. I just wanted to know whether, so I didn't quite understand how I should think about these degenerate monopoles that should appear in this partial compactification. Partial compactification. Well, for SL2C, is there's a more concrete description of this partial compactification one can give? Sure, but I mean, I don't know what's the good reference. I don't remember if it's discussed in the AT Hitchen book. I think it is discussed actually in AT Hitchen book, but I don't remember. It's like it's sort of similar to the Ulenbeck and boxification of instant of the modules.
