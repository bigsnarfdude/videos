So I'd like to talk about some recent work with Kevin and Heavy. Essentially the idea is to apply the notion of gauge duality to try to understand how renormalization group flow works for fractal models. And uh in particular, I'll be talking about gapped fracton models. Gapped fracton models. So thankfully, Dominic gave a really nice introduction to this topic in the talk this morning, but just to sort of briefly reiterate, so starting in 2005 with the Shimon model and then later with the Hawk code and in many later works, especially in recent years, there have been all these new models that have been introduced. Introduced that sort of challenge traditional paradigms in some sense. And it's sort of starting to become clear that this is really a unified family of models and that all of these particular examples are sort of different variants of a unified phenomenon. And so we sort of say that they exhibit what's called fracton order. Order. So, like I said, I'll be talking about gapped lattice models. So, this isn't necessarily to say that gapless models are less fractonic or anything like that, but I'll just be using the term fracton order specifically to refer to gapped models. So, fracton order is essentially a form of long-range entanglement. Long-range entanglement. And what's so interesting about it is that all of these models are sort of fundamentally beyond TQFT. So, okay, so I'll add a caveat to that because Kevin's actually giving a talk later where he sort of has a TQFT interpretation of fractal models, but I'll say that really they're beyond any sort of like bulk TQFT description. So, okay, so. Okay, so why is this the case? So, to sort of summarize the essential properties of fracton order, it's useful to compare and contrast with intrinsic topological order. So, both these types of order occur in gap systems with long-range entanglement, and as a result of this entanglement, some interesting things happen. Of course, if you put Of course, if you put a system on a torus, then these systems will exhibit a ground state degeneracy that's robust to any local perturbations. And furthermore, there are these fractional excitations that sort of cannot be created or destroyed locally. But whereas in topological order, the excitations are fully mobile. Are fully mobile, of course, in fractal order we have these weird constraints on mobility. Furthermore, whereas we have a constant ground-state degeneracy that just depends on the topology of the spatial manifold for topological order, in fractal order we have this ground-state degeneracy that grows exponentially with linear system size. And sort of hand in hand with that, there's a constant topological danger entropy versus a linear one in topological versus fracton. Topological versus fracton models. So really, these interesting properties all fundamentally arise from the long-range entanglement. And so to try to make sense of these properties, we want to study that. And one of the most useful conceptual tools for doing this is the idea of entanglement renormalization. So this is essentially sort of a modern take on. Sort of a modern take on the traditional Wilsonian Rg. The essential idea is to do a real space RG using local unitary quantum circuits. Sort of as is depicted in this figure in the bottom left. We start with some system, do some local unitary to disentangle some degrees of freedom, and that once we throw those degrees of freedom away, we've essentially coarse grained um our our state. Our state. So, this was sort of originally introduced as sort of a starting point for doing numerics in highly entangled quantum systems, but like I said, it's really also an important conceptual tool to understand fundamentally what gap phases are. So, the essential idea is that these local unitary circuits can remove short-range entanglement, but they must preserve. Entanglement, but they must preserve the pattern of long-range entanglement. This is sort of what fundamentally characterizes a gap phase. And this is equally true in fracton orders as it is in topological orders. So the fixed points of these types of RG flows are zero correlation length states. And what's nice about these fixed points These fixed points that you can write down sort of explicit local unitary circuits that realize this fixed point, RG flow. So first, so let me talk a little bit about what we know about entanglement RG and fraction systems, and then I'll sort of come back and connect. And then I'll sort of come back and connect it to this notion of gauge duality. Okay, so let me just very briefly go over how this works for topological order. So the simplest example, of course, is the toric code. You're probably all familiar with this. So this is a model with one qubit on every link of a 2D lattice, as a vertex term, which is a product of polygy operators and a Plaquette term, which is a product of poly x operator. Is a product of poly X operators. If you put it on a torus, it has a fourfold degeneracy, it has E and M particles that braid non-trivially each other. So shortly after this model was discovered, it was realized that you can sort of modify the spatial lattice using local unitaries, in particular these controlled X gates. So, for instance, if If we want to add this turquoise link to the lattice, we can essentially, what we can do is add a qubit there, which is in an eigenstate of poly x, and then sort of apply this pair of gates to essentially sew this qubit into the lattice, and then we get a modified lattice. So we can sort of We can sort of do this procedure of adding qubits and then sewing them into the lattice simultaneously throughout a system. And in this way, we can coarse grain or refine the underlying lattice as depicted here. So, sort of the key point here is that the degrees of freedom that we add are in a product. Freedom that we add are in a product state. And this sort of type of fixed point RG for topological order generalizes to all the string map models. And really, this is something that we generically expect of topological order. Can you go back one slide? I kind of missed. So, from going from left to the right, are you splitting or what did you do? Did you move the. The light blue degrees of freedom. Yeah, so I guess this is sort of refining the last. You could just sort of do the reverse to core string. But so essentially what, so first we add these light blue degrees of freedom, and then we do a bunch of CNOT gates throughout the lattice to sort of transform the ground state into the refined torque code. Torque code. So, how do you couple those light, like in the middle picture, how do you couple the light degrees of freedom to the original degrees of freedom? So, the idea is to do a local unitary circuit which maps the ground state, which is like torque code ground state plus all these product state qubits. You do a circuit, and then you get the ground state of the refined torque code. I mean, that circuit also acts on the Hamiltonian, but what's Also acts on the Hamiltonian. But what's a little different about entanglement RG is that you don't necessarily exactly map the Hamiltonians. Right, so you focus on the ground state. Yeah, yeah. It's really, that's fundamentally what's. All topological models include chiral? So there aren't exactly solvable models, and so for chiral topological orders, and so you can't write down these explicit circuits, but Circuits, but this general principle of having product state degrees of freedom and there exists some local community, that is expected to also hold for parallel. Is expected or somebody did it? I don't think I don't think that's ever been because there's no model that you can write an archival. Probably add that as a caveat that that's not something that's been done. It's sort of aside from the point, but yeah, that's, I still think it's something that we would say is expected. So you're writing it, you know, the transformation, you're writing for the Hamiltonian, but you're doing it for the ground state. So is there understanding how those two are related? Yeah, so this arrow, basically, it's an equivalence. It's an equivalence, it's a local unitary equivalence. So basically, all it's saying is that these two Hamiltonians have identical. Equivalent ground space. Yeah, that's really all that. Okay, it's not saying, it's not making a statement about excited space. Yeah, yeah. Right, so this is the case for top order, but let me now talk about entanglement Rg for fracton order. So the first example. The first example of an RG transformation for fraction order was discovered by Zhang Wan for his own Hawk code. So I think we're probably mostly familiar with this model here, but let me just briefly summarize. So it's a stabilizer code with two qubits per site. The Hamiltonian terms look like this. All of the excitations are fractons, or all of the fractional excitations. Excitations. The fractons are created at the corners of fractal operators, which have this Sierpinski tetrahedron geometry. And the ground state degeneracy grows roughly exponentially with the length of the system, but it has a very sensitive dependence, which is captured by this sort of complicated formula on the system size. In size, the exact dimensions of the system. So a few years after discovering this model, Zheng Wan worked out this fascinating property about this model, which is essentially that the model on a lattice of size 2L is local unitarily equivalent to a copy of the lattice. To a copy of itself on a system of half the size, and a copy of a different system, a different model, which is this so-called HA-B code and has this Hamiltonian here, HB. So HB is, it's a bit more complicated, but it's again just a stabilizer code model. So in addition, In addition to this first transformation, someone also worked out that this B code has a similar transformation in which the model on size of 2L is equivalent to two copies of this same V code on a lattice of size L. So Dominic sort of talked about this fair amount in the talk this morning, but the But the essential idea is that this type of RG transformation is what we call a bifurcating transformation. And so in this case, because B goes to two copies of itself, we call that a self-bifurcation. Whereas in the first case, we have simply an A-B bifurcation. So we were sort of inspired by this result to try to find similar transformation for a simpler model, and this is. Simpler model, and this is so with Ken and Junghan and Che, what we sort of found is that the X-cube model has a similar transformation, which we call, we essentially call this a foliation structure. So the idea is that by using a local unitary transformation, you can essentially exfoliate you can exfoliate, or essentially you can disentangle a 2D Toric code from an L by L by L plus 1. L by L by L plus 1 X cube model to obtain an L by L by L X cube. So you can sort of also do this simultaneously throughout the lattice and essentially find a transformation that is very similar in spirit to Joan 1's. So in this case, the A Hamiltonian is X cube and the B Hamiltonian is three stacks of toric codes. And so again we have a self bifurcation and an A B bifurcation structure. And an A-B bifurcation structure. So just to sort of summarize, we have these different possibilities for how entanglement RG can flow in three-dimensional models. And so we have this non-bifurcating flow, which is for topological order. And then we have two kinds of bifurcation, which applies to different types of fracton order. And I should mention that, okay, so this is actually 2019. So there's a very recent work by several people. Recent work by several people who are here, Arpit and Dominic, where essentially they find this exact structure in a much broader class of stabilizer cooking models. So the question that we want to ask is, can we sort of understand this sort of bifurcation behavior through the notion of gauge duality? So it's well known that topological order can be thought of as emerging. Logical order can be thought of as emergent gauge theory in many cases, in which case it's a gauge theory of global symmetry. But what these sort of seminal works showed is that many fractal orders can be similarly understood as emergent gauge theory, but with so-called subsystem symmetry. So when you gauge the subsystem symmetry of a paramagnetic model, you obtain a fractal order. Model, you obtain a fractal order. Okay, so for topological order, so for like the toric code, the gauging procedure works as follows. So we can imagine that the toric code is dual to a paramagnet which has one spin, spin half on every plaquette of the lattice, and there's a global symmetry which is just a Global symmetry, which is just a spin flip throughout the system. And the essential point is that this sort of RG procedure that we discussed for the Tori code can be equivalently understood in terms of the ungauged paramagnet. So, in particular, if we want to modify the lattice, we Essentially, what we can do is we say we want to create this triangular plaquette here, we add a spin to that plaquette, but now the global symmetry doesn't act on that new spin. So we now have to redefine the global symmetry so that it acts on the new degree of freedom. And so we do that using this very simple gate. And this is how we can understand entanglement RG in terms of the unengaged. Entangled RG in terms of the unengaged paramagnet. So we can sort of do this simultaneously throughout the lattice to coarse brain and refine the system. And this sort of procedure is, in a very precise sense, dual to the entanglement RG transformation that I discussed earlier. So essentially, a very similar principle works in the case of fractions. Works in the case of fracton order. So Sager and co originally wrote the execute model as a gauge theory where the ungauged model has planar spin-flip symmetries. So we have a cubic lattice just in a trivial paramagnetic state, but the model is symmetric under spin-flip. The model is symmetric under spin flips along every elementary cubic plane. So that's depicted in this figure on the right. So the essential idea is that the procedure of exfoliating toric codes from the XQ model can be equally well understood by essentially decomposing this planar symmetry group into. Group into two subgroups, essentially. So what you can do is you can sort of do a change of variables to redefine the symmetries so that the y, z, and zx symmetries don't act on this middle plane here, whereas the u, whereas the x, y symmetry acts only on this plane. So actually by doing this change of variables, you decompose You decompose the symmetry group in this way. And this change of variables, this procedure, is essentially exactly dual to the process of exfoliation. And similarly, you can sort of do this process throughout the lattice to get this similar decomposition of the Symmetry composition of the symmetry group, which corresponds to this transformation on the bottom. Okay, so I want to quickly, so this is very nice. Can we apply this to these sort of bizarre fractal spin liquids? The answer is it works equally well in this case. It's really sort of a general principle. So, as a simple example, let me talk about the Sierrapinski prism fracton. Sierpinski prism fracton order, which the ground state of this model can essentially be thought of as a condensate of these Sierpinski triangle prism-like objects. And all the fractional excitations are linons. We can think of this model as a gauge theory, where the gauge symmetry is a subsystem, spin-flip symmetry, where the subsystems are essentially stacks of. Stacks of Sir Pinsky triangle fractals. And by thinking about the geometry of these fractals, essentially what we find is that this symmetry group sort of self-bifurcates in this same way. So essentially, what we can do is a similar change of variables, which shows that the generators Generators of the symmetry decouple precisely in this self-bifurcating way. And correspondingly, we see that the Hamiltonian of the gauge model also obeys a self-bifurcating entanglement RG procedure. So just to sort of summarize, because I'm running out of time. Because I'm running out of time. Let me just say that sort of the lesson, the overarching lesson here is that containment RG fracton systems directly reflects sort of an RG structure in the symmetry group of the underlying gauge theory. And so for topological order, topological order arises from global symmetry, self-bifurcating fractal order arises. Self-bifurcating fracton order arises from self-bifurcating symmetries, and fracton orders with an A-B bifurcation structure correspondingly arise from symmetries with an A-B bifurcating structure. So I will end there and thank you for listening. Go ahead. Have you? Go ahead. Have you identified the A B gifted symmetry for 3.1? For the hawker. Yeah, so Ben Yoshida had a transformation which sort of writes the symmetry generators as like products of 2D fractals. And so And so yeah, for that particular, for stabilizer codes that have this sort of intersecting planar structure, there's sort of a general RG, containment RG procedure you can write down that similarly engages to an RG for the symmetry. Would team be p be part of a symmetry group as a cell property gateway. Yeah, yeah, but I but I think that basically follows from ungauging what you did. Is the way in which these like the type 2 guys bifurcate controlled by geometric things like the fractal dimension of the excitations or something? So there's no straightforward answer to that, but There's no straightforward answer to that, but there are certainly different criteria that you can write down for when a model, when a certain type of fractal self-bifurcates and when AB bifurcates. There are sort of ad hoc criteria that we've come up with, but nothing like super, super general. But it essentially does depend on the geometry of the fractal, but not specifically on the fractal dimension or something like that. Is it correct to think of like this renormalization as ungauging and then forgetting some of the symmetries and then re-gauging? Like forgetting some of the layers. Yeah, essentially you can think of it as ungauging, decoupling the symmetry group by some change of variables into two different subgroups and then regauging. Yeah, that's essential. And then regauging. Yeah, that's essentially how you should think about it. But so there's a subtlety because if the undergaught model is an SPT, then it's not guaranteed to bifurcate in the same way as the symmetry. But for any time you have a trivial paramagnet, then this procedure will exactly work. So here when you talk about the symmetry, global symmetry here, the charged objects, charged under the symmetry, is always zero-dimensional object, is that right? So the notion here was trying to push with the concept of a higher symmetry where the charge, the object can be line, line operators. Yeah. And I want And uh I wonder is there any sort of um where the symmetry can be also well sorry the sym the chalk objects of the symmetry can be extended. So let me clarify, so but when you say the charge objects zero dimension, you mean the symmetry generator or the operator that X on the charge objects in codimension one. Codimension one. So that's the operator that we that measure the symmetry of the generator. Right. And when you consider charge objects one dimension, then the symmetry generator is a co-dimension too. Well, but for the notion here, for the symmetry, it looks possible. Maybe we can also consider this symmetry example. Maybe not? Yeah. Yeah, I've only really thought about global symmetry, but I mean it's I mean it's certainly possible that sort of similar principles apply for higher symmetries. I mean that would definitely be an interesting thing to think about. Sort of like a different direction of generalization of higher form symmetries and subsystem symmetries. If I consider the 3D short code, it has both, but can be getting both 041, I guess. Obviously RG did, but the RG is the same, but I think it's gauging in the different Yeah, so I mean for for like simple things like stabilizer codes at at different levels of gauging At different levels of gauging, like all these procedures sort of directly map onto corresponding procedures on the different level. So yeah, like in the case of 3D torque code, you can make similar statements if you sort of regard the loops as like gauge charge. Did you get any idea from this kind of simpler condition on when things are self-bifecating or AB bifurcating, what some invariance of the AB bifurcating phases might be? That will be zero always for the self-bifecating. Oh yeah, I'm quite glad you asked that. So for the foliated fraction orders, Kevin Shenai came up with these ABC basically entanglement methods. See basically entanglement measures that sort of generalize the sort of what and when and press field schemes. So you can do essentially the exact same thing for AD bifurcating fractal spin liquids. You can basically design ABC prescriptions which are sort of robust to like small deformations and capture this notion of. Capture this notion of A-B bifurcation. It's basically they isolate the constant universal correction to the area law. Yeah. And there'll always be zero for the... Is there an easy way to see why they would be zero for the self-babricating ones? So the answer is basically you have to construct them. The way you construct them is by finding things that are zero for the B parts. So you sort of, by construction, it's like that. It's not obvious. Like that. It's not obvious, but generally speaking, we've found that you actually can find schemes that do this. So does that entanglement measure depend on which border you're looking at? Like, if you have two different AD bifurcating things, do you have to use a different entanglement? Yeah, you have to design a prescription for the model. So yeah, like practically speaking, it's not useful. And also, it's like highly geometrically constrained, like the length of the overall. The length of the overall region has to be close to a power of two because of the weird fractional structure, but that's just the best you can do, it seems. That's what you have to do, pretty much. All right, so if there's no other question, I think the speaker.
