composable involving solution to the Young-Bach's equation of size P squared, which is a joint work, a recent joint work with Harsten, Nitzel and Senetraponius, recently appeared on our site. Again, I will recall again what is the set-theoretic solution to the Young-Max equation. So it's a set with a bijection such that this brain relation is such that this braid relation Such as this braid relation holds. I'm gonna use the same notation as before, so r x of y is equal to lambda x of y rho y of x. And again, the solution is called non-degenerate if lambda x and rho x are bijective for all x, and it's involved if r is an involved map. In this talk, I'm going to say solution, and I mean finite, which means that the Finite, which means that the set X is finite. Involitive, so X squared is involved is the identity. Non-degenerate, and which is that solution to the Jambach equation, just for sure. Observe that in this case, so in the case of an involved even non-degenerate, the raw map is actually, you can write the row map in terms of the lambda. So actually, I'm gonna just use lambda x for the next. Lambda x for the max for the rest of the talk. What is what when two solutions are equivalent or isomorphic, when there is a bijection between the two sets such that this equation holds, or in terms of lambda, f sends lambda x to y, lambda x y to lambda f of x of f of y. What is the problem? So, what we want to do is to plug So, what we want to do is to classify some out solution of a given size up to equivalence or isomorphism. As you can see here, this is the numbers that Hilario was giving this morning. The number of solutions is crazy, like just of size 8, 9, or 10 is a huge number. But if you take only solutions which are indecomposable, the numbers are, I mean, I mean, they are not so huge, and so it means that indecomposability is a big constraint. What does indecomposable mean for a solution is that you cannot decompose to non-trivial subsolutions. So by A squared, you mean the partition. Yeah, so there is no non-trivial partition such that I can restrict R to That I can restrict R to these two subsets. As an example of classification of solutions, of indecomposable solutions, we have the one of size p, where p is a prime, and you can write all these solutions um all these solutions, sorry, are equivalent to the solution on zp with lambda x of y, which is just a transition by one. By one. Again, I'm not writing the raw map because you can reconstruct this from lambda. In case also when p and q are two different prime, you can also classify solution up to equivalence. And they are all equivalent to a solution on zp times zq, where lambda ax by is this kind of map. Of map. So here is not any more adjusted translation, but there is this term that depends on A and B. So what we did in this work was to classify, so the next step is when this P and Q are equal. So what we did was classifying the composable solution of size P square, where P is a prime and up to equivalence, of course. How did we do this? How did we do this? Well, we studied the permutation group of a solution, which will also be again a skew brace. But for now, let's just define the permutation group. So I have a solution, XR. I take the subgroup of the permutation group on X generated by the lambda X. Why is this group useful? Where, well, this of course acts on the solution, and when the solution is And when the solution is in decomposable, it acts transitively. Of course, you want to see the solution somehow inside this group, but it's actually not included in general. And what you can define is the image of the canonical map that sent an element x on lambda x to lambda x. And this image is called the retraction of a solu of x. And you call a solution retractable if Solution retractable if the retraction is smaller than the original one. So somehow you lose some information in the group. Otherwise, you call this irretractable, and you can do this retraction again and again. What can happen is that at some point this retraction is trivial, where trial I mean that it's just size one, just one element. In this case, we call this solution finite multi-variant multiplier. a finite multipermonus multi multipermutation level or multipermutation solution and the first n such that the retraction and the end retraction is one is called the multipermutation level. So for the classification of size p squared, we divided this in two cases, the retractable solutions and the irrefractable ones. So we said we lose some information So we said we lose some information if the retraction is smaller than the original one, but the retraction is still a solution. If x is indecomposable, then it is still indecomposable. And moreover, the size will divide the size of x. So if I have a solution of size p squared, the attraction can be just size 1 or p. And if it's 1, well, it means that all the lambda maps are equal. The group, the permutation group is just. The group, the permutation group, is just a cyclic group, but it has to act transitively on a P square size group, sorry, set. So this has to be a P square cycle. Remember that this group was a subgroup of symmetric group on P square element. So this is easy. If the retraction is of size P, well, we know what is solution. We know what is solution an indecomposable solution of size p, it's of this kind. This means that if you do the retraction again, you get, because all these lambda x are the same, is that they don't depend on x. So the second retraction is trivial, and x is multi-permutation level 2. And we could use a classification of individual possible solutions of multi-permutation level 2 done by Jet Lichke in Italy. So what we have up to now is all retractable in the composable solution of size p squared. And we could also characterize when two solutions are isomorphic for equipment. Last part is about irretractable solution, which was the hardest part. But for this, we also need this Q-base structure. So again, So, again, you know what this scribber is. I'm writing here in a different way, but it's the same definition. So, you have two groups and a group action. So, the multiplicative group is acting on the additive group via automorphism, and this is the action. And we can define a software, which is the kernel of this map here, the lambda map, intersect with the center, and the fix are the fixed elements by this. Yeah, this action. Why is this important in this case? Well, given a solution, I can also put a Q-bar structure on the permutation group. So I can define a second operation. In this case, it's a linear. So the plus is fine. And the lambda map, this lambda, coincide with the so with the lambda. So if we identify lambda x with x, Lambda x with x. This is just saying that the lambda map of this cube race, if I restrict this to x, is again the lambda on x we defined before. What we can say in this case, well, if the solution is irretractable, so the case we want to consider now, the sock is trivial. So the curve of this lambda is trivial. Moreover, if in general in general, if the skew brace has prime power order, then the fixed Prime power order, then the fix has to be an antibiotic. With this information, then we started with the case when you have a retractable solution of size p squared and the permutation group or rays, of q rays, is a p group. So with all these conditions, we could find the retraction as a double cosets, and we could write all the solutions up to isomorphism. The general case turned out to be actually, you could just look at the PC loss upgroup, at the PC Lo subgroup of the permutation group. This is again as cube raise. And it's actually, it acts again transitively on X. And it turns out that all solutions are somehow deformation of solutions with P group, sorry, with a permutation group, which is a Sorry, with a permutation group, which is a p-group, we add this deformation. So we also got this classification in general. Just adding this alpha parameter and the one before. So that's all we got. So thank you, Peter, for the talk. The questions. But some of the solutions in the case you need oh well extension in what sense? Not this in your piece, but maybe yes. How much is the difference? That's that's not what how we constructed them. So we try to generalize for higher powers of the public. Maybe Yeah, but we really use the fact that the permutation group is a subgroup of the seal of in the case of where is it in this case no the previous one okay here we really use the fact that the permutation group is a subgroup of the C law of the P C law of the symmetric group on P square elements which acts transitively so we really use the fact that the side We really use the fact that the size of V square, of course, we can try, it's not immediate, let's say. Maybe it's a similar question, but it's related to Victoria's question. Some of these solutions, in the final conclusion, can they be simple solutions? They are all simple solutions. They are all the one that appears in the set of Minister papers. But that also then makes the tech cannot be characterized by expressions. Yeah, yes. This that's why I'm asking because I think they are similar. Yeah, yeah. The answers also a question in their favorable solution of this problem. Other questions, comments? Uh no, it's fast because you didn't ban any person earlier about it. I don't know. I mean, but it's definitely some factor to have. He has this story about hiding in the hotel from screaming children to come to the crystal.
