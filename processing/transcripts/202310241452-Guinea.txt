Okay, but I have the time. I will also speak about supercomputing, and I have the time. I will speak also about a very hot topic this year, which is multi-layers, dry layers and layers with more than Layers with more than three layers, whether they have flat bands, and whether those flat bands are interesting or not. So uh This is the first time that happens to me. Sure, yes. Yeah, I will just oh something will happen so to respond. Okay, the idea I wanted to start with was that to stabilize. Was that twisted by layer graphene is significant. It has similarities and differences to other strongly correlated systems. I will show previously some of the famous ones like hebifermions and cuprates. And all of them have a narrow band, but mostly because those narrow bands are placed on very well localized atomic orbitals, the hopping between them is very small. And moreover, interactions tend to make the bands even narrower because Make the bands even narrower because these quasi-vitals are strongly renormalized and that makes them heavier and so on. While the canonical model for twisted by layer graphene doesn't include interactions, all the parameters that it plug in are of the order of 100 MeVs, and nevertheless, you have it's a very flat path. I'm still stuck in this point. So uh but the cool thing about Moire's, especially if they are very large, is that they allow you to classify a function of Moirelatis size or number of atoms inside a moire unit cell, different interactions. And in the case of twisted biliographene, the most important, the strongest interaction by far is the Coulomb energy, among other things, because the charging The charge distribution, as soon as you move away from neutrality, is not uniform. And that's also evidence, kind of peculiarity of these systems. And because of that, this kind of charge inhomogeneity leads to what's called band flattening. The electrostatic potential is very strong. I want you to notice that we published this paper with a dielectric constant of 66 because we didn't want to scale. Because we didn't want to scare potential readers, but actually, the effects are even larger. And even the Chiral model becomes dispersive when you have electrostatic interactions in a mean-free way. And it all comes thanks to the discovery in this paper, and then we work it out on that, Ns. Warek and I, in this other paper. Wallet and I in this other paper that the chart distribution at different positions in the flat bands is very different. Most of the bands have a sharp peak in the chart distribution at the AA region, but not the gamma point. And this is also the basis of this nice work by Andrei Bernard in terms of topological condor effects. Let me see if I can sort of do this nice animation made by Made by Porzoc in the group. This is what happens when you increase the chemical potential. It's just a calculation of a system which has a TBG with strains and a gap. And you see as you reach the flat bands, everything is changing a lot. Now you get into the middle of the flat bands, and that is when the canonical model of the flat bands apply. And then you increase the chemical potential and things try. Chemical potential and things change again until you pass the conduction band and then nothing happens. And this is very unusual and it's not typical of any strongly correlated systems I know of. Okay, this has been corroborated by many other theory works and also by experiments. But let me mention before, and now let's talk about superconductivity. And the first thing I wanted to mention about superconductivity is a very nice, very, very It's a very nice, very, very simple model put forward by Valentin, Kreter, and Jan Fu a few years ago. And it's just spinless electrons in the honeycomb lattice with strong sub-lattice barriers and our nearest neighbor interactions. I mean, they are spinless electrons or hubbard, that's not the word. And just by hand waving, you can show that two, I mean, when you dope it. Two, I mean, when you dope it away from half feeling and half feeling, the fibromore lattice is fully sublattice is fully occupied, you go away from half feeling, and then you have some few holes, let's say that the red sub lattice is fully occupied, then you have holes which move around and in order in the other sub lattice and in order to move, let's say these are the white dots, the blue dots are empty, the electrons in the other sub lattice in order to move around, you have only In order to move around, you have only near neighborhoods, they have to displace the atoms which are already in the preferable solaris. And it's easy to show, just with hand-waving arguments, that two holes together move faster or have lower energy. I mean, they have better kinetics than a single hole. So it's the simplest model you can think for a superconductor, made from topological, from propulsive interactions. Actually, as my colleague Misha Karnoson mentioned to me that, as in many other cases, Soviet scientists already found this situation, let me leave it here. And our contribution was to put this whole formalism in more diagrammatic terms. I cannot go back. First of all, First of all, we found that's also part of our contribution, we collaborated with Barnett Kinkerpe and Yanfu. And first, we found that the superconductivity that this system gives rise, you have pockets, you have two pockets, the Fermi surface has two pockets, and it's gapped, but the sign of the gap is opposite in the two pockets. It's a kind of F-web superconduct. And we also put the whole thing in diagrammatic terms, and what happens, you start, this is a pairing interaction. You start with this is a pairing interaction, this is a Cooper pair, how it propagates. You start with a repulsive interaction, you screen it with the relevant second-order diagrams, and this is a crucial diagram. Here, through this electron-hole pair, an electron and the iso, here electrons can only interact between the A and when they are at the A or the VC lattices. Here, an electron at the ACO lattice can interact with another electron at the ACO lattice. Other electron adiasolity. This is a long-range interaction, which is a local interaction cannot take place. But it's attractive because this is a second-order perturbation theory by definition, which gives you an attractive contribution. And this is what is happening in the system. And again, you can put very, very simple numbers and check that the effective interaction is dominated precisely by the diagram I show to you. And it has a resemblance to twisted by Legend. Here, what we are using is degrees of freedom within the unit cell, which allows you new pading channels. In crystal bilayer graphene, this thing is greatly augmented because you have a lot of um clap processes. If you start with the coulomb interaction, then Muare allows you to transfer um clapper moments at a Moments at no cost, and that creates a similar effect, but on a much larger scale. Okay, now let me mention here: this is a review we wrote, and we put together what is known about superconductors, including graphene superconductors. And there are kind of two classes. This is the bilayer graphene. These are the trilayers, these are the untwisted. These are the untwisted systems, the Rhombohedral and Bernal. Bernal Rhomohedral. And this is a newly discovered non-moire trilay found at the MIT. So, this is one class of graphene superconductor, this is another class, and in between, we have this metamoir. Metamoid, the price layer metamoid. As I mentioned, a possible mechanism for superconductivity, and it's typical of strongly correlated systems, is via excitations of a nearby broken symmetry phase. These are some old references, but that's not what I'm going to talk about. I'm going to look at the problem from a different perspective, namely the cold Latin Gerutes. People studied already. Studied already way back in the 60s of the last century superconductivity via repulsive interactions. They focus on the electron gas, which was the canonical model of the metal at that time. And they just looked at these diagrams, second-order perturbation theory, second-order perturbation theory with repulsive interactions. Let me mention this one, which is the one we are going to focus on. That means that. That means that you can, this is just superconductivity mediated by electron-hole fluctuations, such fluctuations, electron-hole pairs. This paper contains two interesting claims. First, that the superconductivity took place at very, very low temperatures. And second, is that if you include electron hole pair, you have also to include longitudinal acoustic phonons because they are capped. I mean, an electron. Capping. I mean, an electron hole pair can decay via the electron phonon cap into a longitudinal acoustic phonon. The transverse phonons do not participate in such a process, but at the longitudinal acoustic phonons, they do. And it turns out that Walter Connolly and Joaquin Latinger, as they focus on the electron gas at that time, that is what you call the metal, they didn't notice that if they had applied their scheme to much more anisotropic systems, it would Or anisotropic systems, it would be come up immediately that it was a very good route towards superconductivity. This is what I'm trying to say for the couprays. The typical way of explaining superconductivity in the couprays is using the fact that they are highly anisotropic. You assume that there are two Fanhoff singularities where most of the electrons reside. You quantify the interactions by a few numbers, and if both of them are repaired. And if both of them are repulsive, but the interpocket repulsion is higher than the intra-pocket repulsion, you have the superconductivity. Okay. So that I pass a number of references looking at superconductivity via the conlatitude mechanism. In a way, in graphene, in crystallized graphene, it's more justified to include electron-Hall pairs along with Whole pairs belong with phonons and plasmons because they occupy the same region of phase space. I mean, small energies. If you compare it to the electron gas, we just show and disappear, sorry for all these glitches, they are completely different. In crystal dialographene, everything happens within a narrow window of small energies and small momenta. The plasmons were calculated in a nice paper by Cicily. In a nice paper by Sifiando Vandowski and Lenik Levito. And then, as I said, you keep plasmons and electron-hole pairs, you add phonons, and at the end of the day, basically, your parameters are the deformation potential, the Fermi velocity, the twist angle, the interlayer hopping, and the dielectric cost. And this is what we did. We looked at the philosophy. At the critical temperature, using only the bubbles in the four conlatin diagrams, but extrapolating the bubble, we use an infinite number of bubbles. We use the full RPA screening function. On the basis, it's like a one over n approximation. Here we have n flavors. So, if you don't consider broken symmetry faces, the bubble diagrams are four times as large as the other bubble diagrams by definition. And then, Definition. And then we looked at, we linearized the gap equation. We went to high temperatures and slowly took the temperature down until we found an eigenvalue such as one, which meant that we have hit the critical temperature. So this is the idea. So machine is getting crazy. Okay, but at the end of the day, the results we got were critical. Here we are neglecting broken symmetry phrases. We are neglecting broken symmetry phases, that's why the critical temperature peaks at HAF, because we know that HART3 FOX will kill the metallic phase at HAF feeling no matter what. We were using the Hart3 bands and we found, similarly to the Foucault model, we found a full gap in each pocket. The calculations we did first were single pocket superconductivity calculations, so we couldn't tell how the two. So we couldn't tell how the two pockets related to each other, so we could have either spin triplet, value singlet, or vice versa. I will talk more about that later. And in addition, the electron phonon coupling cycle. The fact that we added the electron phonon, also the leading interaction is highly repulsive, the fact that you have the electron phonon coupling circuit. By the way, this F. By the way, this F-wave superconductivity we found in agreement also with the toy model put forward by Cretan Foux is topologically very interesting and it's probably a good subject for another talk, but I will not deal with it here. Okay, this is again more results of the critical temperature. We looked I mean the the whole point and what I tried I tried to mention before is that the susceptibility is very complex. That the susceptibility is very complex. It's a matrix defined by D and D prime, which are reciprocal vectors. It's crucial to take this matrix dependence into account. And these are the kind of four parameters we got with and without phonons and matrix elements. If you take them out, it's totally different. So let me mean, I mean, we know that there are broken symmetry faces. In principle, the model should work for. In principle, the model should work for metallic faces with program symmetries, polarized faces, only you have less than four flavors, of course. And let me also say that the mechanism seems to be very intensive to twist a bilayer graphene. And it's interesting that at the end of the day, we find a fully gap system, which is good because it means that long-range scattering within each valley is not perverted, it's not harmful to. Is not harmful to extra conductivity. Now you know that, following suggestions by theorists by Parcelin et al., some trilayers which you twist back and forth could be reused to bilayer and a VIRAC code. And experimentalists look into these problems. They found superconductivity and also in multi-layers. So we repeated our calculations for the system. Our calculations for these systems, and the results for the other parameter and the critical temperature are very similar, as we could expect as the ones we obtain for a single layer. Now let's go to graphene, untwisted graphene superconductors. You know that there are Bernalby layers which are superconductors at very low temperatures. The situation improves a little bit if you put Improves a little bit if you put a TMT nearby and also thrombohedral trihase. And we did calculations and now here you get something way different because now you have the order the order parameter has noise within each layer. The critical temperatures are much lower, they are all below half a Kelvin. And what we also found in agreement with the experiments is that With experiments, is that an icing spin-orbit coupling increases significantly the critical patients. And that, all this is a relatively simple explanation. Here, there are no processes, there's no complexity of the wave functions and so on. So, you only have a screen potential which is repulsive at all Qs. But the screening is very large at Q equals zero and is weaker at larger Q's. And that allows you for more conventional. And that allows you for more conventional you can ask Andre Chu who is an expert, a more conventional superconductivity. If you fully transform such a repulsive potential, you always get some minimum with a negative energy. So there is some attraction when it's not at the S channel, which will pick at R equals zero. And basically, this minimum is related to the screen potential, which you can write like this. If you lose Write like this. If you lose one flavor, which is what happens if you have an alchemy spin-orbit coupling, you increase the repulsive potential. But at the same time, it means that you also increase the depth of the minimum. And that gives rise to a higher critical theft. So this is a more conventional type of superconductivity, more along the lines of the superconductivity you find in heavy ferric systems, for instance. This is all a theoretical. This is all a theoretical work. If you want to know more about untwisted systems and all the many theories which have been put forward, you can read this paper by us. And this is the calculation we have just finished. These are the untwisted graphene multi-ledges, ABA, ABCA stacks, 3, 4 stacks. And in all of them, we get nodes in the order parameter within each valley and local. Niche valley and low critical temperatures. So it's more like of the second type. And more interesting, this is unpublished, we have been looking now to a double twisted bilayer. So two bilayers twisted with respect to other two bilayers. I don't know if you have followed the experiments on this system, but lately, this year, it was found that this system is superconducting, but at very low temperature. But at very low temperature, there were early experiments from MIT and Harvard where they found all the length of superparities. And what we did for this system, we, as we are theorists, we can afford to do it, we put a parameter into the interactions between the top layer and the next layer and the bottom layer and the layer previous to it. And we change this parameter between zero, in which case we have a printed by layer decoupled from two. By layer, decoupled from two graphene layers, and one where we have a two couple by layer, and the change is enormous. Because you go through with kappa equals zero, you have a critical temperature as function of Phi of the order of the one. I mean, this I already discussed with you this result. For kappa equal to 0.1, already the critical temperature drops a lot, and it continues dropping until it's very small. And it makes sense because if you It makes sense because if you look at the flat bands you get in this system, they don't have by any means the complexity of the flat bands you have in a twisted double binary. Okay, so I think up to now we can say that this scheme of including rectron-hole pairs plus phonons is a model that is an interaction which should be present in all graphene stacks. The model that has The model has very few adjustable parameters, basically epsilon and the deformation potential. The main drawback is that broken symmetry phases are not included. Broken symmetry phases are typically included by diagrams like this. This is a diagram we are including, and this is the diagram we are missing. We are working on that, but it's really complicated. If your interaction is hobbled, like doesn't depend on Q, it's easy to work out the effect of diagram. To work out the effect of diagrams like this, but if it depends on severe pain. So, all we can say is that first, even if one has polarized phases, one cannot avoid the presence of charge fluctuations like the ones I have discussed here. Second, the phenomenology of TBG doesn't exclude, does not necessarily require broken symmetry faces. I've taken this results from Leni from Vice Corner's talk yesterday, and this is another recent paper from this last collaboration, which basically leads to the same results. And third, if all you need is narrow bands and broken symmetry, then you can now use how come there are so few carbon superconductors? Because we know by now that it's very easy to get flat bands in many carbon star conductors. In many colon stack graphene stuff. Okay. So that's it. So now let me change gears. I think I still have some time and talk about dry layers. The study of trilayers started way back. We looked into twisted graphite, actually. So an infinite number of layers, each one twisted a little bit with respect to the next. San Carda-Sarma and co-worker did the same. Andre Bernardin looked at the Same, Andre Bernardin looked at the trial and Netim Cashira's Luskin and collaborators they also looked at trial. So these three were based on the continuum model. This is a most atomic scale calculation. And the idea of the ones like me who use the polymedia to clarify, it's actually a continuum model that's phased. Continuum model that's faithful to the atomic scale, I'll put it that way. Yeah, for the trilogue, yeah. That's what I'm going to address. Okay, that's a very good question. Okay, so the idea of the, for of us who looked at the control, if you have a small angle, these are the corners of the pre-lund zones of the three layers. And they are called, and if you had only two, you could define a twisted by layer, and this vector here will describe the landscape. the the the one zone. And so so the the lay layer one and layer two are described by by this every one zone determined by this vector, layer two and layer three alone are described by every one zone described by this vector. If these vectors were collinear, you could use only one blue one zone and that's it because they are equal and the only problem is that they have a small angle here. And here. Okay, that and moreover, sorry, I forgot to say that, there is an interesting second thing. In a twisted bilayer, it doesn't matter how you twist. So you can start from an AB region and twist, or from an AA region. A displacement of one of the ledgers with respect to the other, you can deal with it with a ledge transformation and it's zero. with a H transformation and it's zero. In the case of a trilayer, the displacement of the se there is a displacement which matters, which you can never get rid of by Hegel transformation. That was noticeably in a series of papers by Lynn. Okay, so what is happening? If you want to do better, you notice, as I said, that these two, the white vectors, the original vectors, White vectors, the original vectors of your twisted tri-layer. I'm now talking about a tri-layer where the two angles are the same, but the scheme can be generalized to any set of angles which are conventional. What is missing is this little tiny vector here in order to go from these two vectors to two vectors which are collinear and then they allow you to define a single more not too large units. Not too large units. But the two vectors are very different. So if you think of them as periodicities in your system, one of them defines a typical periodicity, let's say you are at a magic angle, or graphene atomic angle of 10 nanometers. The other one is of order 1 over theta squared, which is much larger. So there is a metamoire anemoire. And the whole thing is nicely discussed in this paper. Nicely discussed in this paper, one of the authors is here. How at the end of the day, you can describe a tri-layer like this as a moire with this unit cell plus a displacement of a central layer which creates this metamorph. So locally, you can work with a single model. But then you have to match, you have to glue different pieces, they define but this. Different pieces defined by different displacements of the central layer or whatever layer you're interested in. Now, let me talk about experimental and the reason why the topic is becoming really hot. The reason why the topic is really becoming really hot is because there are very interesting experiments coming. Coming like this one. First, there was this experiment from MIT. Sorry, first there was this experiment from Minnesota, then this experiment from MIT which showed superconductivity, this one blue, and this one which didn't show superconductivity, but variety of strongly correlated. This one was these two, I think, correspond to situations, but we twisted the same direction but the same angle. We twist in the same direction, but the same angle. This is not that here. One angle is three, and it's three times about 4.4 degrees, and the other is one is like 1.2 degrees, and the other is like 1.8 degrees. But they are commensurate, actually. They are in a ratio very, very close to 0 or 4. And these are, so a lot of theory papers are coming out. These are a lot of very interesting theory. Uh a lot of very interesting theory papers. Uh these two com very complete divining results and these are also based on the continuum model. The theory of electal tri-layers and beyond is going very fast. Many of those works are based on the Keigal model, or you can also call it the non-abelian gauge model. And the reason being that if you want to know And the reason being that if you want to identify magic angles, if you find flat bands, that's it. You have done it. And more recently, these are from last month, basically, people are paying, theories are paying attention to interactions in drying. But I would like to talk about our own work, which is listed here. And we went beyond, I mean, the scheme I presented to you of The scheme I presented to you of making collinear vectors associated to different twists can be generalized to situations where the angles are multiple of each other, are commensurate, and to any number of layers you want. And in all of them, this is not only our resource, we have found similar resources, we have done a very extensive analysis of when you find flat bands using the chiral. Flat bands using the Chiral model. For instance, in a dry layer, there is a large number of combinations of angles where the Chiral limit gives you flat patterns. And in four layers, as well. Here there is a table compared in collaboration with Addis Trener and Roland Markov from the Weissman. We went up to nine layers and beyond. So definitely you have flat bands, and this is the stacking configuration because the more layers you have. Configuration because the more layers you have, the more shifts, the most non-trivial shifts you can include to work in sufficient detail. We also look precisely at this question of how things depend on the shift. For instance, in this case of four layers rotating in the same direction, the shift changes very much, the density of state. So it means that the gluing of different regions in the metamoire is not. In the metamoir, it's not a trivial thing. For the MIT case, which is also these two angles, the nice thing is that you can do calculations in the continuum limit and no matter what the shift you have, basically the results are similar. And actually, they did in this paper, a lot of theory work by the Anfu and collaborators, which they didn't use a continuum limit, but they found the execution of state very similar to the ones I'm reporting here. ones. I'm reporting here. Another interesting thing is how different are these multilayers from twisted bilayer graphene in the sense, as I said, that in twisted bilayer graphene, K and K prime are very different from gamma. Here they're also very different, but in a different way. I mean gamma is not uniform, it's peaked at the edges. So in the three cases, the charge density is peaked at the edges of the edges. Of the unit cell, of the real space unit cell. Let me finish by saying these are very rough calculations of the Moire. It's another way of seeing where the bands, the topology of the bands and so on, how similar it is to crystal bilegeography. These muarets are obtained in the symmetric case, the case which can be reduced to a bilager. Use to a bilayer and a monolayer, then you have the famous feature, spinal shape, with a lot of noise because we are not experts in calculating molecular, but they are fairly well localized. I mean, the method used is the one described by Cossino and Fou. So these moires are single-value moires, they have power law tail, but I don't think it matters much. And actually, And actually, these the three pieces in the fit experiment, they fit very well also the theory of Andrea Magnavich at all. Andrei Magnavich at all, they get done with a single Gaussian central DAA region, but two Gaussians, plus dispersive bars which describe the gamma point. If you want to describe the gamma point with Gaussians, this is the best you can do. You adjust the faces of Adjust the faces of these three Dacia, then you can go to a situation where the charge density at the K point is totally different from the charge density at the gamma point. But for that, you need the feature spinning. The signal graph theorem would not. And actually, we could have figured out. Because we worked out matrix elements of different operators in crystal by layer graphy, and we found out that they could very well approximate the assuming that the binias were single routes. Assuming that the Barniers were singled out in this paper. But the funny thing, I think it was Schentil who named this Moirese, FART Moire. If you look at twisted trilayers, this is a trilayer. Here you are twisting in opposite direction. Here you are twisting in the same direction, but this is near a magic angle, and here one angle is twice the other. These are really flat marks. Flat moire. These are, I mean, as I said, we are not particular experts in calculation of moire. They are fairly localized, but they are even fatter than the moire in the crystal bilayer. And moreover, I mean, these arrangements break inversion symmetry. So the A and the B sublargages are by norms equivalent. But one Mari is very localized with respect to the other. The other is more of the spinter pattern. The features feature, and the other is more like a gauss. But still, we have to figure out how to make sense for this. And that's it. This is the group, this is the funding we have received and will acknowledge, and these are also external collaborators. Thanks a lot for your attention. Okay, we have some time for some discussion. Time for some discussion. Let me ask a question to get things started. So basically, this is superconductivity from repulsive coolant interactions. And it's VQ over screen cooler, as you said, VQ over one minus VQ pi expanded to second order in interactions. No, right? No, no. It's the sum of infinite bubbles. So, okay, so infinite bubbles, okay. So it's RPA. So it's RPA. Oh, sorry, I forgot to put the main component, but you're finding pairing channels because the structure in case this. Yeah, precisely. The directive function is a very complex matrix because of. Because of the reciprocal lattice vector you have in memory. And that's all static approximation for the polarization. I'm trying to go beyond the photon. So given all that, and let's say, you know, we think this is, if this were always predictive, we know superconductivity occurs in twisted bilary graphene. What would this type of theory say about where you should look in TNTs? But that's a very good question. For instance, what we already say is that don't look to multi-layers, to just untwisted multi-layers. You will get a more conventional superconductivity out of repulsive interactions, which doesn't go beyond 100 or 200 millicles. With respect to TM, one needs to have, as I said, One needs to have, as I said, the complexity of TBD at the first magic angle, neither the angle. Because if you go to the higher angles, the charge densities are more uniform, the very face, everything is less strained. I think the first magic angle of twisted bilateral graphing is rather special. Even a twisted double bilayer belongs more to the class of more compact. More to the class of more convectional superconductivity out of the fascinating interaction, where you don't have fully complex wave functions. Actually, they have vaguely the idea that people have tried to extend the topological model problem to twist the double value layer without success. And I think you can see it at first side, the first. At first side, the first thing which seems to suggest that is that the Hartree potential is totally different. There's no deformation. I mean, the bands are very rigid in the twisted double, the double twisted one of the geography. It's non-rigidity of the bands. It's very unique to twisted one. Okay, next, Oscar. It went a bit fast, but I just want to make sure that I understood. In the magic angle twisted biology, your calculation kind of floor. Your calculation got a full gap for a superconnector. In the magic angle twist of Eliography, your gap was your superconnecting gap was finite.
