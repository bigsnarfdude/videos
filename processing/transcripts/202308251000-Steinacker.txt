No, I don't mind. It's perfectly fine. Okay, excellent. Thank you. Let me upload this thing. Here we can see perfectly your slides. So from our side. And you can see my mouse pointer on it. We can. So you have forty five minutes, including a question. So it could be great if it's forty plus five. Great if it's 40 plus five. So, shall I tell you when you have the 10 minutes more, or you can manage? Okay, I will do great. Thank you. Okay, well, so first of all, thank you very much for the kind invitation. I really would have liked to come, but the timing is very unfortunate. It's in between two things, and I have to be here in early September, and so on and so forth. And I tried to follow a few meet talks, but it was again the sort of time shift is. Again, the sort of time shift is quite substantial. Anyway, so I would like to explain you a particular approach which is really relevant to the precise title of the workshop. So it has to do with quantum geometry, gravity, and in some sense also cosmology, even though I won't talk about cosmology. And it will be a rather physics-oriented talk. And the claim is that there is a mechanism for obtaining tree plus one dimensional gravity as a quantum effect on quantum space-time. quantum effect on quantum space-time. So that's kind of a long-standing idea, which now seems to be substantiated quite well in a particular model, namely the IKKT matrix model. So I will try to be not too technical and then be more qualitative. So let me before going into any details, let me explain the motivation for the particular approach that I'm going to do. For the particular approach that I'm going to explain to you, because it seems that I'm the only person in this meeting, at least talking about this particular approach. So, and there is a reason for it. Now, obviously, we all like quantum geometry, otherwise we wouldn't be here. But there is lots of different approaches and directions. And in particular, it depends very much whether you have your sort of a more formal mathematical background or if you're more physics oriented. Now, I'm a physicist. Now I'm a physicist, so I will focus on an approach, on an approach which I believe is sort of has a chance to lead to real physics. And then I'm not so much oriented on the structural mathematical side. And as a physicist, so the guideline for me is that physics is really governed by models rather than axioms. So axioms always just come after you have the theory, then you can try to axiomatize it if you like, but physics is about models. If you like, but physics is about models, very specific models, and hopefully, there should be one model which somehow describes real physics. Now, that means we should find or use a framework which offers a kind of specific or preferred model. And in particular, such a model for physics, which should describe non-commutative geometry and space-time and gravity, such a model should be well suited for. A model should be well suited for quantization. And physics is all about quantum theory. And in the example of the standard model, the most important feature about the standard model is not that it can be derived from a spectral action, but that it is a renormalizable quantum field theory. And that means you can define it as a quantum theory, at least more or less to any scale in some more or less acceptable way. And the same, of course, should apply to gravity, if gravity should be incorporated in such a framework, which we... In such a framework, which we all somehow hope. So that's the main motivation or the main sort of guideline for me. Now, the point is that matrix models are a particular framework which really seems to satisfy these criteria. So it gives you a specific, so they are specific enough so that you can try to learn the mechanism for physics rather than sort of trying to follow some axioms. Trying to follow some axioms. And in fact, there is a preferred model. And the preferred model is the one that I'm going to talk about. It's the so-called IKKT model. And again, so from a physics point of view, this is a good thing. So I'm not interested in some categories of universes, but in sort of hopefully unique universes. And there is this one model which has a special status and it has special properties. And I will try to explain these special properties. Try to explain these special properties. Now, it so happens that this model is related to string theory, but it won't play a role today. So, you don't need to know anything about string theory. It is true and it has to do with the sort of special properties of this model. But as I say, it's just kind of an it's a nice observation, if you like, at least for the purpose of the talk here. And the mechanism that I'm going to talk about is really completely different from what people do in string theory. What people do in string theory. In fact, so there will be a kind of a novel mechanism or particular mechanism which directly leads to three plus one dimensional gravity on non-commutative types of brains. So brains is what string theories do, but the kind of mechanism is different from the one in string theory. And in particular, there will be no complication and there is no issue of landscape as there is in traditional approach to string theory. So the bottom line will be that if you The bottom line will be that if you are trying to be guided by that model, then all the mathematical structures required for gravity sort of automatically emerge in the model and you don't have to impose them, but sort of you should understand what happens in that model. And that's what I would like to explain. So here is the model. It's a very simple model, which is defined, which is an action for matrices. So the YA, those are matrices, they're Hermitian matrices. Think of them as large but finite dimensional matrices. Of them as large but finite-dimensional matrices, even though they can be infinite-dimensional, and A goes from zero to nine. So they're nine plus one matrices, and the action is basically the trace of the comic data of these matrices contracted with eta AB and eta AB is just a constant thing. And then there is also fermions, but I will largely ignore the fermions today. So that's the action. And the model is: well, first of all, if we introduce somebody. Well, first of all, it was introduced some modus now 25 years ago. And it happens to be related to string theory. And the main point is that the model enjoys maximum supersymmetry. And that's important for the quantization of that model. And I will talk about the quantization of this model. Okay. But if you ignore the fermions, the most obvious property or the most obvious symmetry of the model is gauge invariance. So you can conjugate any of these matrices by large by unitary matrices. And obviously, that's a symmetry of the model. Obviously, that's a symmetry of the model, and this will be treated as a gauge symmetry, so this will be identified. And this gauge symmetry is the origin of all the gauge symmetries that will arise on the physics arising on this brain. So that's the origin of Young-Milstab gauge theory and also of parts of the diffeomorphism gauge theory that exists in gravity. Now, the model itself doesn't know anything about geometry. The geometry arises sort of on non-trivial background. So there's something like spontaneous symmetry break. Background. So there's something like spontaneous symmetry breaking, and we will consider particular backgrounds, so non-trivial matrix configurations, which let me denote them here by y bar. So that defines a background. And the physics around this background will then lead to something like field theory and gravity. And I will discuss a particular type or class of these backgrounds and then try to understand the physics arising from fluctuations or perturbations of these backgrounds. The basis of this background. And the backgrounds will be chosen to be three plus one dimensional suitable brains. Actually, there is kind of a reason why four is preferred. It cannot be larger dimensional. It would be inconsistent. Lower dimensional would also not be good. So there's actually a kind of a reason why three plus one is natural, but I will not talk about that. So we'll just use them as backgrounds, which are put by hand, which had to satisfy, of course, consistency conditions and so on, and then we'll study the Consistency conditions and so on, and then we'll study the physics on these backgrounds. And these backgrounds will define non-committee spaces, so they will define quantized symplectic spaces. And then we'll see that fluctuations of these backgrounds, they will naturally, well, the fluctuations of a background always means that the geometry fluctuates. So this is some kind of a gravity that's clear. It's not obvious if it is anything close to general relativity. And in fact, if you just look at this action as a classical action, it will not be. Action as a classical action, it will not be general relativity, of course. So it's something which I would like to denote as pre-gravity. And this pre-gravity, so it's different from real physical gravity, but it has the nice properties that you can quantize it. It's well-behaved under quantization. It's something like a Young-Mills prototype theory of gravity. And the effective Einstein-Hilbert action will then arise in the quantum effective action of this classical action. That's the point. So this is a very different approach from usual attempts to quantize gravity. So here you Attempts to quantize gravity. So here you start with some model which a priori seems to be completely different from gravity, but it can be quantized in a nice, well-behaved way without divergences. And then at the quantum level, you will recover the Einstein reduction and some other stuff. So that's the point. And this quantization is defined in a very natural way. That's the whole point about matrix models. You know how to quantize them. You just integrate over the space of all matrices. And in this particular model, this integral is well behaved. So the point of this talk will be, I will briefly explain to you how at the one loop level this leads to an induced answer-Hilbert term and some reasonable tree plus one-dimensional gravity. And this is really the only model where this works. So any other model will not work. In any other model, if you try to do this one-doom computation, you will find disastrous divergences, which means that the effective theory is very strongly non-local and therefore not acceptable. So the reason why this model is preferred. The reason why this model is preferred is really only visible at the one loop level or as soon as you quantize it. And then this particular model is not ultraviolet divergent. So you can compute it. And all other models would be divergent and you find ultraviolet infrared mixing and it just doesn't make sense. Okay, so this is roughly speaking the qualitative content of what I would like to explain. Okay, now the outline is Okay, now the outline is a fraction of the following. So I will first explain a little bit how you can understand the geometry of such backgrounds in this matrix model. And we will find geometric structures, including a frame, a metric, and a certain torsion. So this will kind of emerge in the low energy regime of the theory that they are not put in by hand. Then I'll discuss briefly the quantization, so and only at the one-doop level, and we'll see how our Answer-Hilbert action arises, plus some extra stuff. Action arises and plus some extra stuff. And then I will briefly mention that there is a nice class of backgrounds which is kind of covariant quantum space-time, which has nice properties. And I think that's that's kind of these are the nicest known candidates for quantum space-time, but I won't have time for any details here. For references here, this is a short introductory review, which contains lots of references to other, to the more detailed papers. And for the for the aspects of the quantization and the answer-Hilbert action, you can. The quantization and the answer reduction, you can read this in these two papers. And there should be very soon a book where all these things is explained in great detail so you don't have to look for all the papers. Okay, so let me start with the geometry of Young-Mills matrix models. Now, the idea is that, well, it's an action. Dominant or important configurations of an action are those where the action is small. The action is Small. The action is small if the commutator of the matrices is small, which means, yeah, so the relevant configuration will be almost commuting matrix configuration. So they're collections of 9 plus 1 matrices, which sort of almost but not quite commute. And if you think about such, what is the meaning of such things, sooner or later, it's quite clear generically that the picture of such almost commuting matrices is that of quantized simplicity. Matrices is that of quantized symplectic spaces, or at least quantized Poisson spaces, but the irreducible components are quantized symplectic spaces. And then you just use what you know from quantum mechanics. So functions, oh sorry, matrices or operators are quantized functions. So the matrices here of such a background, they will generate some operator algebra and some endomorphism algebra, which is interpreted at low energies as quantized functions on the manifold. Quantized functions on the manifold, some symplectic manifold, and the commi data are basically that they should reduce to Poisson brackets in the suitable low-energy regime. So that's the idea. And then you can start to do geometry. And from now on, I will only look at this low-energy regime where I can replace commutators by Poisson brackets, and then we just do Poisson geometry, basically. So it's an action for Poisson manifolds, if you like. Okay, so that means these matrices, YA. These matrices, YA, you should think of them as quantized functions. Well, and these functions are, they take values, a goes from 0 to 9, so they take values in r to the 10. V should be 10. So in these matrices, you should think of them as quantized embedding functions of some brain, of a submanifold in nine plus one dimensional target space. That's the geometric picture. So a background corresponds to a brain, or more precisely, a quantized brain, which is a sub-manifold. A quantized plane, which is a sub-manifold in target space. And basically, we consider almost flat sub three plus one-dimensional sub-manifold, and this will be space-time. And then, fluctuations of this background will be fields and physical objects propagating on this background. So, that's the idea, and it's a very natural one, and you can just start to work it out. And by the way, to some extent, it's even possible to reverse the procedure. You can even extract from the given matrices if they are reasonably nice or almost convenient. Nice to almost commuting, you sort of recover these underlying symplectic space in using some way, but I will not elaborate on this. So, what you should have in mind is the correspondence between operators and functions, commutators and Poisson brackets, and also the trace corresponds to the integral with the symplectic volume form. So, these are the natural structures that you have from quantization. Okay, so let's just apply this. And so, this already allows you to understand. And so, this already allows you to understand the effective metric on such a background. So, suppose we have given such a background, then all the fluctuations of the background, if you look at the matrix model, are governed by an action of this type. So, for example, transversal matrices, you can think of them as scalar fields. They are governed by this action. And I claim this is just a standard kinetic term for a scalar field propagating on a background. Now, if you apply this dictionary, replacing commentators by Poisson brackets, you can write this action in the You can write this action in the form of a usual kinetic term for a scalar field. So you can read of an effective metric. The effective metric is defined in terms of an effective frame. And the effective frame is just basically the symplectic vector field defined by the matrices. So these are nice geometric structures. The frame is basically the symplectic vector field defined by the Vector field defined by the matrices or the background. So you have a frame, and this looks a bit like it's already reminiscent of gravity, but these frames are a bit special. They satisfy some constraints. So because the frame arises for some brackets, they satisfy a divergence constraint. This is an easy consequence of the Jacobi identity, if you like. So you don't get the most general frames, but you have this kind of constraint. And that already tells you that here the frames will not enjoy a local orange. The frames will not enjoy a local Lorentz invariance because they would not be consistent with this thing. But it doesn't matter. Local Lorentz invariance is a Q-symmetric. So it's not a problem. It's just a feature of the formulation. And this has some consequences, but I will not use it very much. So you have a metric which is composed of a frame. There is a scale, a conformal factor, which is a dilatone, and all of these things you can sort of work out. Okay, so this is sort of the building, the geometric building blocks. Now, Blocks. Now, because the background has defines a frame, now the question is: what is the natural connection? Usually one works with the Levitic-Kuchiwetter connection, but it turns out here, Levitic-Chiveta connection is not nice. There is a more natural connection, which is the Weizenberg connection. The Weizenberg connection associated to some given frame is the one where the frame is defined to be parallel. It can always be done, symmetric compatible. And it's always, it's a flat connection, but it has torsion. Connection, but it has torsion. So it's just sort of a different way of doing geometry, and this is more natural here. And the reason why it's more natural is because the torsion tensor of this Weizenberg connection associated to the frame is in fact itself a symplectic object, namely it's a symplectic vector field generated by the field strength of the background. So this is a nice identity, which comes from the Jacobi identity. And that's the reason why this kind of connection is more useful to understand the geometry of matrix models. Of matrix models. So it's just, yeah, it's natural here. So we have a torsion tensor defined by this background. Okay, now you can also understand a bit the geometry of gauge transformations. Gauge transformation of this background just boils down to the symplectic vector fields on this background. I don't have time to explain this here. And so naturally, gauge transformation of the frame, for example, is really the For example, is really the you find naturally the usual form is just the d-derivative respect to this vector field. Now, you may think, of course, well, symplectic vector fields are special, you don't get all of the full diffeomorphisms. But on the so I just want to point out here that on the nice class of covariant quantum spaces, which I won't have time to explain, in fact you get all volume-preserving diffeomorphisms essentially in this way. This sounds strange, but it's really true because there is some extra structure. Some extra structure. Anyway, so this makes sense. You can make some, there is a nice way to understand this gauge symmetries geometrically. And now you can also understand the equations of motion for this matrix model, which a priori have a very strange form that's not usually familiar, but you can now recast it as an equation for this, as a covariant equation for the Weizenberg, for the torsion of the Weizenberg denser, which happens to look like that. And now, once you have this thing, you can translate it also in terms of the Levitic depth. Translate it also in terms of the Levitivita connection if you prefer, and then it looks like that. And there is the anti-symmetric part of distortion plays an interesting role, it has to do with axions and so on. Anyway, let me not go into these details. So there is a way to understand or to describe this geometry arising at the classical level or at the semi-classical level from this matrix model. Now, we want to make contact with gravity. And in fact, there is a nice identity which allows you to rewrite the Einstein-Hilbert action in terms of the torsion of the Action in terms of the torsion of the Weizenberg connection. This is essentially well known in the context of the Le Parallel gravity. It's a little bit different here, but essentially it's the same story. So the S-Hibbert action, you can write it as a quadratic contraction in terms of distortion and some extra stuff. And that will play a role later on. And you can also compute the Ricci tensor for on-shell solutions of the classical model. And it looks like that. So again, it's a quadratic expression in the Ricci tensor. Quadratic expression in the Ricci tensor, it's not a trivial identity. And what it tells you is: first of all, in general, you don't get Ricci-flat geometries because, well, this is non-zero here in vacuum. But the thing is, it's quadratic. So what this tells you is that if you linearize the gravity around a flat background, in fact, the linearized fluctuations are rich flat, which is quite interesting. So naturally, this matrix model defines your theory of pre-gravity where Of pre-gravity, where the linearized fluctuations are actually rich, if not. Okay, but still, it's not gr. So, this is the classical story about the geometry of this matrix model. Now, to approach the quantization, let's make one, there's one important remark. So the action of this matrix model, you can write it, well, it's the contraction of two common data. So, semi-classically, let me denote the common data with theta. So, it has this. With theta, so it has this form. And the point is that this action has two derivatives less than the Einstein-Hilbert action. This is a very interesting observation. The reason is that the Einstein-Hilbert action, using the identity which I just told you, is a contraction of the torsion, and the torsion is essentially the derivative of this theta object. So the Einstein-Hilbert action is a second derivative action, so it has two more derivatives than the bare matrix model action. And what this tells you is, first of all, And what this tells you is, first of all, there is no analog of this action in the usual formulation of general relativity. You just don't have these objects. But more importantly, it tells you that this action is well suited for quantization, because if you know anything about quantum field theory, having less derivatives means that it's better to actions with higher derivatives are not suitable for quantization. The answer-Hilbert action is not good for quantization because it has too many derivatives. But this action is good for quantization. So that's. For quantization, so that's that's the thing, okay. And just as a remark, let me point out that on a nice class of covariant quantum space times, you can now, in fact, you can recover the linearized Schwarzschild solution in the setup and so on and so forth and so forth. So, these things can be found in the literature. And you also, by the way, you also get an interesting cosmology, which is a word in the title of the workshop, without any finding. Without any fine tunnel. So that's also kind of an advantage of this framework compared to general relativity. But now let me talk about the quantization. So, how to compute the quantum effective action? First of all, the point is again that because the model is supersymmetry, the quantum effects are mild and there is no one loop divergence. There is no ultra-velled divergence at one loop. In fact, you can argue that there won't be any divergence at any loops because it's related to any cross-fossil pairing. Because it's related to n equal force of Bearing Mills, but let me not, doesn't matter, so we'll only look at one loop and then you see explicitly. So, all the computations are finite, they're well defined, you just compute what it is. And the point will be that if you could, there is a term in the one loop effective action, which looks exactly, which is exactly the contraction of distortion. So, it is essentially the Einstein-Hilbert term, and it is finite, which means that, well, there is a Is a well, this the fact that at the one loop level you get an induced angle-Hilbertum is not surprising. There's an old story going back to Sakharov. Um, that happens expected generically, but usually, of course, you have uh this term is divergent and there is a the coefficient in front of it is the ultra-valid cutoff, which you have to put by hand. Here, you don't have to put the cutoff. The coefficient is a number which you can compute. And it turns out, well, what I told you is only true. What I told you is only true if there is if there are in the presence of fuzzy extradimensions. So this works if the background has a product structure, space-time, time, some compact extra dimensional space still embedded in this target space. So that is a requirement for this mechanism, but it's actually a self-consistent requirement because these extra dimensions are stabilized also by this one-loop effective action. Effective action. I won't explain this in detail, but the bottom line is that you can compute the Newton constant here. And the Newton constant is related to the Kalusa-Klein scale of these fuzzy exodimens. So that's a result of the computation. And now I will just very briefly indicate how to do this computation. And it's not completely trivial, but I would like to explain the main steps. So again, so a priori, it's clear how to do the quantity. It's clear how to do the quantization, you just integrate over the matrices. And this is actually well defined even in the Minkowski setting. There is a nice way to regularize the oscillating behavior of this thing. It's a bit like the fine mana epsilon thing. And then it's really well defined. And the one loop effective action can then be really computed. And it boils down to the usual trace log formula. So all one-loop effective action can be written as trace log of the fluctuation operators. Of the fluctuation operators, and in this case, you have bosonic and fermionic things. So now the supersymmetry becomes essential. Supersymmetry means that in this universal trace log formula, the first three terms will cancel exactly. So the leading term and the one-doop effective action is kind of suppressed at fourth order, and that's very important. And it looks like that. So it's a very complicated expression. It's some multiple nested commit data of some background stuff. stuff and you have to compute the trace of that. And that's the one of effective action. And the challenge is to recast this abstract formula into a geometric setting. And that took a long time. And now there is a way to do it. And I would like to briefly explain to you how you can rewrite this trace in terms of geometric objects. And the key is to use objects denoted as string modes. Now, string modes are nice, a kind of a nice basis of operations. A kind of a nice basis of operators. So remember, the matrices are operators, and a nice way to, you can write these operators in terms of harmonics or plane waves, but this is not a good idea. The better organization is organize the operators in terms of these objects. So X and Y are kind of coherent states. And then this thing, this operator is kind of a link between two points X and Y. So it's like an open string starting at one point X and ending at the other point Y. X and ending at the other point Y. And this gives you another complete basis of function. And in terms of this basis of function, there is a nice trace identity. The trace of any operator over the endomorphism algebra is exactly, you can write it exactly in this form. And this thing you can compute. That's the point. So and the nice thing is that these, well, the string modes, they have nice properties because they are almost eigenmodes of the kinetic operation. Eigen modes of the kinetic operator. So they're almost eigenmodes of the effective Laplacian. In fact, the Laplacian of these string modes is essentially the length of such string square. So it means that the energy of these strings is proportional to the length, which is a reasonable thing. And also there are eigenmodes of these comet data, and the eigenfunction is just the difference between beginning and endpoint. And using these properties, you can compute this trace. And now I'm just going to tell you the result. By the way, there is a nice Ah, by the way, there is a nice, by the way, there is a little discretion. Using the same technique, you can understand the important topic of ultraviolet-infrared mixing, which is a universal thing in non-commutative field theory. And that comes exactly from the same mechanism. The point is the following. Whenever you have a quantum field theory, even if it is re-normalizable, the loops are dominated by the ultraviolet modes. Now, on any documented space, the most ultraviolet modes are actually these. Ultraviolet modes are actually these string modes. So they are outside of the semi-classical regime, they're high-energy modes, so they dominate the loops, even in re-normalizable models. But they're highly non-local, which means the quantum effective action of these models is totally non-local. And that's a disaster. And this disaster is called ultra-velled infra mixing. And it always happens except in the maximally supersymmetric case, which is the model I tell you about. So that's the story of UVR mixing. UVR mixing. So, so Harold, 10 more minutes. Okay, 10 more minutes. Thank you. So, and in this maximally supersymmetric case, you can use these string modes now to compute this complicated trace, and it acquires a geometric form. And to evaluate these geometric forms, you have to refine a little bit this analysis. So, it turns out, well, because the integral is ultra-valid finite, it's actually short string modes which dominate... Short string modes which dominate. Now, short string modes you can identify with Gaussian wave packets. There is a precise way to do it using a Wigner map. And that means that the trace formula which I gave you, which I wrote down before, acquires, it just means basically you integrate over Gaussian wave buckets, integrate both over their positions and their momentum. And then this quantum effective action becomes an explicit local expression in position space, which can be computed. Space which can be computed. And that's the way to do it. And so I will just give you the results now. The result is the following. So if you compute this one-loop effective action without extra dimension, you find a four-derivative action, which is not enzyme production. But if you take a background which has a product structure, space-time times k, and the k sort of involves these extra dimensional matrices, then there is a mixed term in this effective action, and that mixed term leads to the induced Einstein-Hilbert action. Used anti-Libradion. And so, just to give you an idea why this happens, this mixed term involves double Poisson brackets between the field strength and these wave brackets. And these Poisson brackets, they can be written in terms of these objects. And this is the torsion of the Weizenberg connection of the background. That's how this geometric object enters. So it's a quadratic expression in terms of the torsion. And if you put everything together, you find that the one-doop effective action contains a term, which is the. Action contains a term which is the contraction of distortion in terms of the metric. And this is then precisely the answer-Hilbert action with some extra stuff. This is axionic stuff. And the coefficient is set by the Kaluza-Klein mass scale and some large integer, which depends on the structure of these things. So that's how this result arises. And the details you can find in some papers. Okay, so the bottom line is the one-doop effective action in this model on such a background generically. Such a background generically includes an Einstein-Hibel action with a Newton constant that you can compute, which is set by the Kalusa-Klein scale of these extra dimensions. Now, there is also a vacuum energy contribution, of course, as always. It's again finite. It's a large, but finite. So it's large even in the supersymmetric model because the background breaks supersymmetry, but it's finite. But it's not a cosmological constant. It turns out, if you evaluate its meaning, it's not an integral square root g, so it's not the Riemann. Square root g, so it's not the Riemannian volume form which enters here, it's the symplectic volume form and the dilator. So that means that the physics of vacuum energy is different from JR, it's much more reasonable. And I claim, this is also in a recent paper, that one consequence of this vacuum energy contribution is that the radius of this fussy extra dimension has a Mexican hat potential and is stabilized. So that's kind of the reason why this is self-consistent and why this assumption makes sense. Assumption makes sense. And I think it's very interesting from a physics point of view, so it's not a cosmological constant. All right. But of course, the overall one-do-beffect action is the combination of this induced Einstein-Hilbert term plus the background term, which means that there will be two scales. At the cosmological scale, the classical model will dominate and lead to some cosmology, which is actually computable. And if you go to shorter scale, I don't know what is the scale, but some sufficiently short scale, then the Einstein-Hilbert take. Resort scale, then the Einstein-Hilbert term will dominate, and hopefully, you recover general relativity. So, all of this makes perfect sense. There was one remaining issue which you may have in mind, which is the fact that I assume that the space-time is a symplectic space, and symplectic spaces are strange because we don't see any symplectic structure in nature. And there are several ways to handle this. I think the most interesting way is to go to a class of backgrounds where the symplectic structure actually averages out. And this is what I call. Averages out. And this is what I call covariant quantum spaces. There are some nice explicit examples. What they are, they kind of have a product structure, space-time times an internal sphere, and the Poisson structure averaged over this internal sphere averages to zero. So they're nice, explicit group-theoretic objects, which you can write down. And then there is no conflict with the apparent non-existence of a symplectic form because it just averages out. The price you have to pay for this is that you get the higher spin theory. Have to pay for this is that you get the higher spin theory, but again, this can be controlled, and this seems to be a well-behaved one. There are no ghosts and things like that. So, that's I will not, I don't have time to explain you. So, this internal structure is a nice mathematical object with nice group theory, but let me skip this and let me jump to the conclusion. I want to leave some time for questions. So, the main conclusion is the following. And I think, so the main statement is that gravity arises as a quantum effect on three plus one dimensional quantum. Three plus one dimensional quantum space-time in the IKKD matrix model. And I think this is a pretty solid statement. So I really am pretty convinced this is correct. So the matrix model itself at the classical level is a different, it's kind of a pre-gravity theory, which is different from GR, but it's suitable for quantization. If you quantize it, then you get an induced Anschel-Hilbert action, then hopefully it can be sort of realistic. Hopefully, I mean, this is throwing. Of realistic, hopefully. I mean, this is remains to be understood, of course, and there are good hints that there will be no cosmological constant problem in this model, but this remains to be understood better. There will be some crossover between a GR regime and a cosmological regime, which I think is also interesting. And finally, there is this issue that one should probably consider covariant quantum spaces, which lead to higher spin theories. And so that's a somewhat complicated story, but. Somewhat complicated story, but so that needs to be worked out better. But I think, well, so there's enough place to do work, and I think they have nice properties, but much more remains to be done. And of course, this model will lead to new physics. There will be axions, T-Lada, higher-spin stuff, and all kinds of things. And lots of things remain to be done. In any case, whatever you think about this, I think the main message is that matrix models are great models for emergent non-commutative geometric structures. Geometric structures and possibly even real physics. This remains to be seen. Okay, so let me stop here and leave some time for questions. Thank you very much, Harold. Any questions from people present here? Any questions from people online? Maybe I would. Maybe I would start with a question here. Yeah, please go ahead and then we'll go. Yeah. Yeah. In the beginning, you define the two matrices to be almost commute. What do you mean? Yes. It means that essentially the commute data in some sense is much smaller than the matrices. I mean, there is a way to make this more precise. Um so roughly speaking this is this is the criterion which means that the that the approximation of matrices in terms of Poisson structures is a good one. So it's like in for example in quantum mechanics the commutators of matrices are is constant so then of course this is this is kind of satisfied and there is a scale associated with it and it tells you that if you look if you look at scale tells you that if you look if you look at scales sort of which are length scales which are large compared to the blank to to to the scale of non-commutativity then it's a good approximation to replace the the the the matrices with functions so roughly speaking it it's and it is something that you have to verify on a given background so some very some for example fuzzy spaces the fuzzy sphere when the quantization integer n is large then they satisfy this criterion and it's a good approximation to replace the sphere with a semi-classical one. The sphere with a semi-classical one. But if you work with a fuzzy sphere and a small integer n, then this approximation is not valid. So this is very hand-waving, but this is made more precise in the paper, which you can look at. Yeah, but I just want to offer some comments here. In mathematics, if you have two linear operators, we say that they almost commute if the commutator is, say, compact or in some trace class. Yeah. Yeah. For two matrices. Yeah. Yeah. For two matrices, we sometimes say that they almost commute if the commutator is seeing some ideal of matrices. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Something like that. Yeah. Okay. No, but this is really, it's a completely different thing. I don't think, so this is not what I have in mind because I was talking, the whole doc you can consider is only finite dimensional matrices. So all operators are compact and they have the simplest possible mathematical properties. It's really a question of scale. So the question is, is there a So, the question is: Is there a scale for these backgrounds which sort of separates a semi-classical regime from a totally non-commutative regime? So, and you could say take the semi-classical limit, but I don't want to do that because in physics you cannot really take the limit. So, in physics, a limit is always replaced by choosing a scale. So, if you choose wavelengths which are much longer than the scales, then the approximation of Approximation of the semi-classical limit should be good. And that just depends on the wavelength of the objects that you look at. So it's an intuitive thing. Let's proceed with another question from the audience here. Is your quantum effect the loop expansion that you're doing? It's controlled by different agents. By a different h-bar or something than the usual quantum mechanics, or is it related? Yeah, very good, very good. Yes. So when I say one loop, it really means it's the expansion in terms of h bar, and there is a one over h bar in front of the action, which I didn't write down. So the one loop is the usual one as you have in quantum field here, and that should really be h bar. And this has nothing to do with the non-committee of space-time. So the h bar is a priori independent from the committee. A priori independent from the commutators of the background. And I'm assuming that I work in the weak coupling regime so that the one-loop approximation is good. So, again, that's a question of regime, and they have to choose my background such that this is the case. Is there any other question? If not, let us thank Harold. There is one by okay. Please. Yeah, thank you. Is there any interpretation of the matrix side? Any interpretation of the matrix size? Probably I miss it, but yeah, yeah, the metric size has more to do with the volume of the space. So basically, the trace is proportional to the symplectic volume, which means so on finite dimension, if you have a finite dimensional Hiveward space, basically the trace is the symplectic volume of the space and it has to be compact. Otherwise, the trace would diverge. So basically, in the finite dimensional setting, all these symplectic spaces are compact. Dimensional setting, all these symplectic spaces are compact, and the volume of the symplectic space is the dimension of these, very roughly speaking. Okay. It's the number of quantum cells. Okay, thanks. And this flows? I mean, this size is somehow flowing if you take a continuum limit or something like this or incomplete. Yeah, yeah. Okay, you should think of take n to be so large that you have so many quantum cells that you can choose your scale such that your scale Your scale such that your scale is larger than a quantum scale, but still smaller than the volume of the thing. So it's a question of scales. You can think of it in terms of a limit, but I don't want to take a limit because you have a given background. But yeah, it's. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Okay. Let us thank Harold and move on.
