Emergent space-time completely spotted on tweets. Thank you. Wonderful. So, first of all, sound check. Can you hear me? Yes, yes, yes. And can you see the slide? Yes. Full screen and the small curse as well. Yes. Okay, wonderful. So, first of all, I'd like to thank the organizers for putting on this event. And I'd like to. Event. And I'd like to apologize to everyone for not being able to be at Banff in person. I was really looking forward to participating in person. In particular, I really love Banff and I encourage all people who are new at Banff to really make use of all the wonderful facilities. And someone should climb up Self-A-Mountain for me, because that's one of the things that I always enjoy doing when I was here. Okay, so again, thanks to. So, again, thanks to the organizers, thanks for all the participants. And since I'm the first speaker, I should try to be provocative, to basically lighten up some discussions. So indeed, I will try to be provocative in the first half of my talk. Okay, so I think you all know, or you've all been told, that the inflationary scenario is the current paradigm of all universal. Is the current paradigm of all universe cosmology, and inflation is usually analyzed using an effective field theory framework. And I'll later on I'll say exactly what I mean by effective field theory, because maybe Cliff will disagree with my definition of effective field theory. So I'm going to argue that there are fundamental conceptual problems for an effective field theory description of any expanding universe. Of any expanding universe, in particular, of a rapidly expanding universe. And these are not small problems, but they are problems of unitarity and inconsistency with the second law of thermodynamics. And so if I've convinced you of that, then the conclusion is that we need to look beyond an effective field theory description if we want to understand the whole universe. So, what I'll say in So what I'll say in that part of the talk is robust, but probably provocative. But then in the second half of the talk, I'll try to take the lessons and I'll try to look at an approach which goes beyond an effective field theory description. This second part of the talk is based on work in collaboration with Shudu Brahma and Samuel Lalibati. And some are liberty, but any errors are mine. So Frederick goes to them. I take to blame for errors. So I will start with the Transplankian censorship conjecture. There's a question. Go ahead. Can you hear us, Robert? I can hear you, Cliff. So how talkative that the first things were depends a little bit on what you meant by the third bullet point on your first slide. The third bullet point on your first slide. So, when you say that effective field theories break down for a rapidly evolving universe, do you mean that they shouldn't have applied at all if there's no hierarchy of scales, and so you wouldn't expect them to work for rapidly evolving universe? Do you mean that you think that effective field trees break down within the domain of their applicability? Or are you saying that you're interested in areas that are not in the domain of applicability at every level of the right? It's the Latin. Okay, so that's not very controversial. Okay, so that's not very controversial at all, right? Okay, but uh but it's going to be controversial to some people, particularly some people at Stanford. Okay. So anyway, this is a figure from a paper which Romartin myself wrote more than 20 years ago. It shows a space-time diagram of inflation. So the horizontal axis is space. axis is space, the vertical axis is time, and the period of inflation is between t sub i and t sub r. Okay, on this graph I plotted several length scales. First of all, the horizon, which is this line which I'm tracing out now with my cursor. And during the period of exponential expansion of space during inflation, the horizon expands exponentially. The second blank scale is the Hubble radius, which is important for the Which is important for the evolution of fluctuations. And during the period of inflation, the Hubble radius is constant. And so during inflation, you get this exponentially growing hierarchy between the horizon and the Hubble radius. Now, the third length scale is the length scale that corresponds to fluctuations that we observe today. And the reason why inflation is successful at providing a source of fluctuations is. Is that scales that we observe today start out at the beginning of inflation with a length scale smaller than the Hubble radius? But if inflation lasts a little bit longer than it has to last, then the lengths of all scales that we observe today start out with a wavelength smaller than a Planck length. So we argued back 20 years ago that new physics must come into play. Now, based on these arguments, Now, based on these arguments, three and a half years ago, Medroya and Waffa postulated a censorship conjecture. They said that the bad evolution that you see in the red line, namely that initial transplanckian physics becomes super hubble and eventually measurable, that this simply cannot happen, that quantum gravity will prohibit this. Prohibit this. So, this is a mathematical statement of the trans-Planckian sensitive conjecture. You start out at any early time t sub i with a Planck length. You let that length scale evolve to a later time t sub r, any later time t sub r, and you have to remain inside of the Hubble radius at that later time. So, this is a trans-Planckian censorship conjecture, and I'm going to give you three justifications for this. Three justifications for this conjecture. So, one of them is in analogy with Penrose's cosmic sensitive hypothesis. So, here you see a space-time sketch of a black hole with charge smaller than a mass. And there is a singularity at the center, but the observer far away from the black hole is shielded from any bad stuff that happens at the singularity by A horizon. However, Einstein gravity Einstein gravity, as a low-energy effect of theory, admits solutions with charge greater than the mass. And for those solutions, the observer far away from the black hole is not hidden from the singularity, from that stuff. So Penrose postulated that the correct ultraviolet physics that completes GR must enforce that external observers are shielded from the bad stuff by a horizon. Horizon. So let's translate that rows to cosmology. So position space for black holes becomes momentum space for cosmology. The black hole singularity becomes the set of trans-Plancky modes. And the black hole horizon is replaced by the Hubble horizon. And so Henro's paraphrase is in the statement that observers measuring only super Hubble horizon modes must be shielded from trans-planking modes. Now, the reason why I'm taking the Hubble horizon to generalize the black hole horizon, this is a conservative choice, because all I'm demanding is that stuff that can classicalize, that that remains insensitive to trans-planking modes. So, this is the reason why I'm taking the Hubble radius as a generalization of the black hole horizon. Okay, so this is number one. Okay, so this is number one. Justification number two for the transplant central conjecture that comes from a non-unitality of an effective field theory in an expanding universe. And this argument goes back to a paper by Nathan Weiss, UBC professor back in 1985. So now, when I talk, what I mean by in fact the field theory is we take all fields, we expand. We expand the fields in co-moving modes and we quantize each co-moving mode as a harmonic oscillator. So now to avoid the transplant, the Planck catastrophe, you have to introduce an ultraviolet cutoff, and this ultraviolet cutoff has to be at a fixed physical scale. And to maintain the fixed physical scale in an expanding universe, you have to have continuous mode creation. Creation. And so, if you demand that the classical region be insensitive to the non-unitarity, then you get precisely the transplant sensitive conjecture. So that's number two. And as a side remark to number two, which I'll come back to at the very end of the talk. So lays a famous cosmological constant problem. If we take effective field theory, we expand all fields in co-moving free. Expand all fields in co-moving Fourier modes. We quantize each Fourier mode like a harmonic oscillator. Each Fourier mode has a Brown state energy. We add up all Brown state energies. We get the cosmological constant problem, the quantum aspect of the cosmological constant problem. So the provocative statement that I'll make is that the usual quantum view of the cosmological constant problem is an artifact of an effective field theory analysis. And at the end of the talk, you'll And at the end of the talk, you'll see an approach to emergent space and time where we never quantize harmonic oscillators, and the space-time doesn't feel any cosmological constant. Okay, now. Can you pause for a sec there? I want to just clarify whether or not for the motivational story, how this pairs to earlier motivations. To earlier motivations for the transplankant problem. So, normally, the way the transplankant problem used to be phrased was that it can be a problem, but it need not be a problem because the assumption that I made was whether or not the modes that were coming in from high energies were achieving. But what you several times here said that there must be a problem. So, does that mean that you are no longer thinking that you could have avoided the problem just by having things behave at it? That's right. That's right. So, in the first slide, when I had the space-time diagram of inflation, when I was referring to the Buako-Geron matter, I basically said new physics has to enter. So that's exactly what you were referring to. But then come Bedroy and Waffer, obviously inspired by this diagram, and they said this is a principle. And so these are now arguments that I'm giving in support of the principle. In support of the principle, saying that bad stuff comes in, so there's been a change. There's been a change in my view on this. I've become more radical. But then let me continue with number three, because this argument number three, I think I consider that to be the weakest of the three, but it has some relation with. Three, but it has some relation with quantum information, which is one of the main topics of this workshop. So, in black hole physics, there's been a lot of talk about entanglement entropy between sub and super horizon modes. So, obviously, in cosmology, there's also entanglement entropy between sub and super Hubble modes. And if we have a cosmology which involves a phase of inflationary expansion, then the Expansion, then the entanglement energy dense entropy density increases in time since the phase space of superhub mode grows. And if you demand that this entanglement entropy density remain smaller than the post-inflationary thermal entropy density, then we get precisely a limit on the amount of inflation which is consistent with the Trans-Plankene censorship conjecture. With the transplant sensitive conjecture. Okay, so these are the three arguments in support of the transplant sensitive conjecture. Now, what does this TCC mean for inflation? And here's my space-time diagram of inflation again. Vertical axis time, horizontal axis space, physical spatial dimension. The period between T sub i and T sub i, that's a period of inflation. This This length scale, the horizontal, the vertical line without a label, that's the Planck length. And in this space-time diagram, I drew the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture to be marginally satisfied. The Planck length at the beginning of inflation grows to exactly the Hubble horizon at the end of inflation. But if inflation is supposed to create fluctuations that we observe today, That we observe today. Then the current Hubble horizon, T0 is the present time. This is a present Hubble horizon, trace back to the past. It has to originate from inside of the Hubble radius at the beginning of inflation. So the TCC sets an upper bound on the duration of inflation. Inflation being successful sets a lower bound on the duration of inflation. And whether these Inflation and whether these bounds are consistent depends on where the Hubble horizon is located relative to the plant length. The lower the energy scale of inflation, the larger the Hubble horizon is, and the easy it is to satisfy these two criteria. So let's do the math. This is a transplant censorship conjecture, the upper bound on the duration of inflation. Here, the second equation, it's a lower bound on the duration of inflation. On the duration of inflation by demanding that the present Hubble horizon trace back to the beginning of inflation, t star, is smaller than the Hubble horizon, the beginning of inflation. You mix these two equations together, and you find that the energy scale of inflation has to be less than three times tentative energy, so about five orders of magnitude lower than what is usually assumed. So, okay. Now, the QCC has implications for dark energy as well. Dark energy cannot be a bare cosmotical constant. And even quintessence models of dark energy are constrained. But I will not talk about dark energy in the rest of the talk. Okay, now some people may worry based on this slide, they may worry whether early universe cosmology is in trouble since inflation is in trouble. But this is not the case. Trouble. But this is not the case because there are alternatives to inflation with which you can reproduce all the data that we have today. So this is next. So this is one data slide. This is the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background. So horizontal axis is angular scale, large angular scale, small angular scales. The vertical axis is power. Particle axis is power, and the black dots are the data from the W map satellite with some statistical errors on small angular scales, cosmic variance on large angular scales. And an artist was given the task to draw a six-parameter curve, which fits the data quite well. And this red curve is this artist's curve. And the artists were. And the artists were Zeldovich and Zunyaev back in 1969, 1970, and Peebles and Yu at the same time. So what I want to say here is that the physics that goes into these acoustic oscillations in the caustic microwave background were well understood 10 years before the development of inflation. And here's a slide which demonstrates this, taken from the paper by Zelda Richmond Zunya. By Zelda origins in the IF. Vertical axis is time, horizontal axis is space. Here I'm using co-moving coordinates, coordinates in which fluctuations have constant wavelength. Here you see two wave modes, one wave mode, another wave mode. This diagonal curve here is the Hubble radius before recombination. Recombination is... combination. Recombination is this time here. Now what Zeldovich and Zenayath and in parallel Peebles and you argued is the following. Given an approximately scale invariant spectrum of density perturbations on all scales in the primordial universe, so super Hubble scales. Given that, then these perturbations will be standing waves until they enter the Hubble radio. Until they enter the Hubble radius, and then they will start to oscillate. So the mode that enters the Hubble radius right at recombination, it has had no time to oscillate and you catch it at a maximal extent, which gives rise to maximal delta T over T on the corresponding angular scale. This mode, which has done five quarters of an oscillation, you catch it at a node, and that gives rise. And that gives rise to a local minimum of delta t over t. So, this picture here explains these acoustic oscillations in a microwave background. This is the angular scale that enters the Hubble horizon at recombination. Now, what Zelda's in EIF did not have is a mechanism to produce perturbations in the early universe. And indeed, inflation is a first mechanism. Indeed, inflation is a first mechanism based on causal physics, which explains the origin of such perturbations, but it is not the only one. So this is what I said. So these are the three criteria for a successful early universe cosmology. First of all, the horizon at late times has to be much, much bigger than the Hubble radius at late times in order to explain. Times in order to explain the rough isotopy of the microwave background. Secondly, if you want a locally causal structure formation mechanism, then scales that we observe today, they must originate at some early time inside of the Hubble radius. And if you manage to satisfy those two first criteria, then you also, the mechanism that satisfies the second criterion also has to produce roughly. Criterion also has to produce roughly scaling down cover perturbations. And inflation indeed satisfies all three criteria. Because, as I already told you, the horizon becomes exponentially larger than the Hubble radius. That's criteria number one. Scales that we observe today start out subhubble, criterion two satisfied. And the fact that the energy density is constant during the inflationary phase, this Phase. This, after some calculations, leads to the conclusion that the curvature perturbations will be scale invariant. But let's go on and let me show a second scenario in which you can satisfy all three criteria. And this is a bouncing cosmology. So, in the bottom sketch is the scale factor as a function of time. You assume that the universe starts in a contracting phase. There's some new physics. Phase. There's some new physics that cannot be described by natural vector field theory that gives rise to a transition to an expanding phase. And on top is a corresponding space-time diagram, time, space, micro-moving spatial coordinates on the horizontal axis. This is a bounce point. This solid curve, which is diagonal in the past and diagonal in the future, is the Hubble horizon. And these And these vertical lines are wavelengths of fluctuations constant in co-moving coordinates. So, first of all, you see that the horizon is infinite because time runs from minus infinity to plus infinity, prior to one satisfied. You see immediately that all scales enter the hub that start out inside the Hubble radius at early times, prior to urine two satisfied. And it is a Satisfied. And it is a fact that there are classes of such bouncing models, not all of them, but classes of such models in which the perturbations which originate at early times in the contracting phase develop a scaling variant spectrum of perturbations. I'm not going to discuss which classes these are because that's not the topic of the talk. I'm going to focus more on the emergency. I'm going to focus more on the emergent universe. And a classical picture of the emergent universe is to have the following time evolution with a scale factor. So time here is the horizontal axis. Scale factor is the vertical axis. So there's an emergent phase which can be modeled as constant scale factor. Then there's a phase transition to standard Big Bang expansion. This is the assumption of the emergent universe. Universe. This is the corresponding space-time diagram. This is the emergent phase, quasi-static, phase transition, standard Big Bang expansion. Physical length, Hubble radius, the horizon is infinite, criterion one satisfied. Perturbation start out sub-Hubble, criterion two satisfied. And the statement is that if you start with thermal fluctuations in this emergent. Fluctuations in this emergent phase, which have holographic scaling, then you get scaling variant curvature perturbations and gravitational waves. So, and in fact, the model that I will discuss in the last third of my talk is going to give a realization of this scenario. So, bottom line is that there's more than one early universe scenario, which is consistent with the data. All scenarios require going beyond an effective field theory. An effective field theory. So I'm not saying that inflation is dead. I'm just saying that if you want to have a viable inflationary model, you have to go beyond standard effective field theory. And this afternoon, you'll hear a talk by Keshofta Skupta talking about this. So obviously, to get a bouncy cosmology and to get an immersion cosmology, you have to go beyond an effective field theory. Okay. Okay. So let me hold for questions now. I think your point, but the fourth criterion that you're not listing here would be, do you have a control over the calculations that you know that the things you're neglecting are smaller than the things in the sheet shape? And in particular, because you're doing, when you did your bouncing plot, you're without the classical calculation. You're not the classical calculation, and so then one of the questions is: what controls the classical approximation? And in almost every no, in fact, the field theory is the answer to that. So, if you're not in that regime, you need another answer. So, what would be your answer to what controls the platform approximation in these alternatives? Right. So, I haven't given you a model for a balancing cosmology and for an emergent cosmology. So, wait with that question, that part of a question, until the end of the talk, because I will give an emergent cosmology. I will give an emergent cosmology and then you are completely right in asking that question. And I will then give a tentative answer, but not a convincing answer. But I will say that an effective field theory description of inflation, in the standard way of effective field theory, high scale, you do not have control of the terms that you're neglecting. Why is that? Anyway, but let me now move on at this point, Cliff. Let me now move on at this point, Cliff. Because we could discuss it for a long time. Is it okay? It's just like the last statement you sent is a controversial one. Yes, yes. Okay, please come back at the end. But see, the other part of a question is very well posed. So it looks like... Uh, it looks like inflation is self-consistent, whereas for the other scenarios, you have obviously from the start, you have to go beyond effective field theory. And we have much less control of that. And so, this is a very important question. And I will try to discuss an attempt. So, here's now an early attempt. And in this early attempt, I will fail to satisfy you, Cliff. To satisfy Eucliffe. And this is string gas cosmology. This goes back to work that I did with Kumundwaffer back in 1989. So the idea in that work is simply to take standard Big Bang cosmology, but to replace point particles by strings, and to look at the new degrees of freedom and new symmetries, which distinguish string theories from point particle theories. So strings have also. So, strings have also drawing modes and they have winding modes. And if you have a gas of closed strings and you compress it, then the temperature will never exceed the maximal temperature. So something very different than what happens to a gas of point particles. And if you have a compact space, and then you can wind this compact space with string winding modes, and you cannot wind this compact space with point particles. Point particles. So, our idea back in 1989 was to try to explore these features and to develop a toy model for all universe cosmology, which will not satisfy your criterion. So now the symmetry is r going to one over r, where r is the radius of the space. The space, space model as a torus. And here you see the energies of the momentum modes and the winding modes. So, this is the famous T-duality symmetry of closed strings. And if you use this symmetry, you look at the temperature of a gas of closed strings, temperature as a function of radius of the box. Then you see that if you start with a large box, the temperature will initially increase, but then once the But then, once the temperature reaches spring scale or Haggedon scale, then the density is so high that you can create the oscillatory modes and the temperature will not increase further. You just have more and more modes excited. And once you hit one in string units, you go beyond one, then the energy will drift into the winning modes, the temperature will go back down. So, based on this temperature radius plus, A temperature radius plot of a gas of springs, we postulated that there would be a phase in the early universe where space would coast at this temperature. We assumed that. And this is exactly the assumption which we had no dynamical control over. So this is what we postulated. This is the Haggadon phase, post-Haggadon phase. Phase, post-target on phase. This is obviously the space-time diagram which you get. And then we went on and calculated thermal fluctuations in this early phase. And we computed the induced curvature perturbations in gravitational waves. So, the procedure for doing these calculations, and now I think that this part of the analysis. I think, Cliff, that this part of the analysis is under good control. So, we computed the matter correlation functions in the Hageron phase. We converted matter fluctuations to metric fluctuations on infrared scales, and we just evolved the infrared fluctuations through the Big Bang epoch. So, this is a three-stage process. And if once you have the finite temperature string gas partition function, you can compute all of these matter perturbations. These matter perturbations. So I focus on the method. And here's the mathematics. We want to compute the curvature perturbations, this capital Phi, the gravitational waves, Hij, transverse traces tensor. So this is the metric of a cosmology which has small amplitude curvature perturbations and small amplitude gravitational waves. And the curvature perturbations. And the curvature perturbations are induced by the energy density perturbations, and the gravitational waves are induced by the off-diagonal pressure perturbations. So the string gas partition function tells us what these quantities are, and then we can compute the observables. So that's the logic of the calculation. So to compute the curvature perturbations, we have to compute the energy density perturbations. The energy density perturbations. They are given by the specific heat capacity in this way. This is general. For a gas of closed strings, the specific heat capacity has this holographic scaling, string length, updown temperature. This is a temperature when the scale exits the Hubble radius. You merge these two equations together, and then what you get is the power spectrum of curvature perturbations. Of curvature perturbations, it's given by this expression. So it's essentially given by string length divided by plunk length to the fourth power. And you see, to first approximation, there's no k that appears here. If you look a little bit more carefully, then since T is the temperature when the scale K exits the Hubble radius, and since smaller scales exit the Hubble radius, Smaller scales exit the Hubble radius a little bit later when the temperature is a tiny little bit lower, then you get a slight red tilt, like for inflation. And we get the right amplitude if you use the Green Schwarz-Witten value for the string length. So, no good. We have nothing to distinguish the scenario from inflation. So, we go on and compute gravitational waves. For gravitational waves, For gravitational waves, we find a slight blue tilt, unlike for inflation. So we even have a prediction with which this scenario can be distinguished from inflation. But what is not under control in this setup is a background, because we put in the background by hand without having any equations for it. So I admit to your criticism, so let's try to do something. So let's try to do something better. And now I'm on dangerous ground because I'm not a string theorist, and I'm going to try to do something using string theory. So we have to, if we want to understand the whole universe, we have to go beyond an effective field theory description. And so we need a non-perturbative definition of superstring theory. Of superstring theory. And so, what we did is we took a particular proposal for non-perturbative superstring theory, namely the BFSS matrix model, Banks-Fischel-Schenker-Susskind. So this is a quantum mechanical model of 10 n cross n Hermitian matrices. There's no space, there's times. It's a quantum mechanical model, and no spatial singularities. And no spatial singularity since there's no space. And there was a good reason for proposing this matrix model as a non-perturbative definition of superstring theory. And this is a model. This is a Lagrangian. We have nine matrices x sub i. There's something that looks like a kinetic term, and it involves time derivative of the matrix plus i times commutator of the matrix with respect to another. With respect to another matrix A sub zero. So here we have our 10 matrices, and there's an eta mule symbol which is hidden in raising and lowering these indices. So this is the Lagrangian. This is the model. Now, what we do is we consider this matrix model in a high temperature state. Now, there's no more time. And so by high temperature, we mean the following. temperature mean the following we expand the matrices in matsubara frequencies and we take the temperature to be so high such that the homogeneous matsubara modes the n equals zero modes dominate the action so the bfss action is given by the contribution of the n small n equals zero modes which i call zero modes, which I call S I K K T. And then there are terms which come from the small n not equal to zero modes, and they are of order one over t. And it turns out that the action of the small n equals zero modes, the bosonic action, is precisely the bosonic action of the IKKT matrix model, which is this matrix model. This is a pure matrix model, has no time, no space, only a partition function. No space only a partition version, and here I added the fermionic terms because these are supersymmetric matrix models. So this is the model that we are considering. So we are considering the BFSS matrix model, and these small n equals to zero modes are the modes that satisfy this action. And the idea is that we use the these A sub B. Sub V matrices to get the space-time background and the fluctuating contributions. So the small n not equal to zero parts of the matrices, they will give us the fluctuations. So that's the logic. Small n equals to zero modes, bosonic modes give us the background. Now, luckily, we had a lot of help. Nishimua and collaborated. Nishibua and collaborators have been working on this IKKT matrix model for 20 years. And it is quite obvious that we should work in a basis in which A naught is diagonal and the diagonal elements are time. So this is what we do. And then the expectation value of A naught square in this matrix model has a property, as this property here. This property here. And this leads to the fact that in the capital N going to infinity limit, the maximal eigenvalue scales are square root of capital N. The eigenvalue, temporal eigenvalues are symmetric about zero. And the fact that the maximal eigenvalue scales as square root of n implies that the difference between eigenvalues scales as one over square root of n. So in the capital N going to infinity limit, Capital n going to infinity limit, we get infinite continuous time, and we get time that runs from minus infinity to plus infinity. There's nothing new here. So, good. Now, we continue to work in this basis in which A naught is diagonal, and we look at the spatial matrices. And the spatial matrices have these three properties. So, Ai is a spatial matrix. So, AI is a spatial matrix. We are looking at the matrix elements and we're looking at their scaling as we go away from the diagonal. This is expectation values. And we can show that these expectation values decay fast if you go sufficiently far away from the diagonal. And this N sub C scales are square root of n. So this line, line 3. So this line, line three and line four, you can show using the Riemann-Loebeck lemma from the IKKD action. Numerical studies also show this last line. And it would be nice to have some analytic understanding for this last line. Okay, so these are properties of these spatial matrices. So now what we're going to do is we are going to use a spatial matrices. To use the spatial matrices to define space, so we'll do the following. We want to define space at a particular time, so we identify the time by going a certain distance down the diagonal of the temporal matrix. So the point which I'm illustrated with my cursor, that's time. We go the corresponding distance down the spatial diagonal. Then we look at submatrices, small. submatrices small ni cross small ni submatrices where small ni is variable so these are submatrices which i call a i tilde of t so now following again nishimura collaborator's work we can define extent of space parameters so we look at the trace of these The trace of the subma of the square of these submatrices, the expectation value of that, and that gives us the square of the extent of space parameter. Obviously, this xi depends on n that I chose. Now, it's been observed using numerical simulations and confirmed using Gaussian expansion methods that in a thermal state, there's spontaneous symmetry breaking. The SO9 symmetry of the Lagrangian. SO9 symmetry of the Lagrangian breaks to SO6 cross SO3. SO3, this break-in is in the sense that only three of these XIs become large. Now, this is very similar to what happens in string gas cosmology. In string gas cosmology, you start with a nine-dimensional torus. You have to get rid of winding modes to have any dimension expand. Winding modes can only disappear in three maximal number in three dimensions. Number in three dimensions. So we get in string gas cosmology spontaneous SO9 breaking to SO6 cross SO3. The same thing that happens here. And I'm sure that the reason is the same. So, okay, so now what we are going to do is we are going to define the size of these submatrices and i. We are going to define these as co-moving coordinates. And the extended space parameters, we are going to define that as a length of the curve from ni equals zero to ni. So physical length, that's the extended space parameter of the previous graph. And well, I'm free to choose whatever co-moving coordinates I want. So I chose my ni as my co-moving coordinates. So now, based on the properties of spatial matrices, it follows. Matrices, it follows that the physical length is proportional to n sub i. And from that, you can get the metric, the spatial part of the metric by this simple derivative. So to step back, we have a procedure for emergent time, a procedure for emergent space, and here we have a procedure for an emergent spatial metric. Emergent spatial metric. And the spatial metric that emerges is spatially flat, E3 dimensions, and it's infinite. So who needs inflation? Okay, good. So now I'm actually almost done. There are just a couple more things to do. In the subspace of three large dimensions, I can try to obtain length. I can try to obtain late time evolution by satisfying the, by solving the classical matrix equations. And then you find that this A sub T, the thing that plays the role of the scale factor, that this grows as T to the one half, like in a radiation-dominated universe. There's no sign of a cosmological constant. And there shouldn't be a cosmological constant because we are never quantizing any harmonic oscillator. So, this is coming back to the beginning of the talk. Now, so we it has been shown that this symmetry breaking, SO9, breaking to SO3 cross SO6, happens in the IKKT matrix model. So we are working in the BFSS model. So, we've recently been able to show using the Gaussian expansion method that also in the IKKT model, Also, in the IKKT model, there is symmetry breaking. The SO9 phase is not the preferred phase. Using the limited methods that we were capable of using, we were not able to show that the symmetry breaking goes to SO3 cross SO6, but I have no doubt that this is the case. So given this, we can compute thermal correlation functions in the three large dimensional subspace because we have the partition function. Because we have the partition function of the BFSS matrix model at finite temperature, so we can compute all of the correlation functions, energy density, pressure correlation functions in exactly the same way that we did in spring gas cosmology. So, okay. So you see the same equations. These energy density perturbations and pressure perturbations are given by and pressure perturbations are given by partial derivatives of the BFSS finite temperature partition function. So these are a couple of equations which I don't want to belabor. And what we get is we get a scale-invanced spectrum of curvature perturbations with a Poisson contribution on ultraviolet scales. And we get a scale-in-vanc spectrum of gravitational waves without the Poisson contribution ultraviolet scales. Contribution ultraviolet scales. Okay, so what we have is we start with the BFSS matrix model. We get emergent influence time, emergent inference space, an emergent spatially flat metric, and an emergent early universe phase with thermal fluctuations leading to scaling around curvature perturbations in gravitational waves. Okay, so now obviously I'm going. Now, obviously, I'm going out on the limb because I'm not a string theorist. There could be big mistakes in what I presented, but I'm excited. And there are a huge list of open problems. So some of the calculations did not include the fermionic sector. And we know that the fermionic sector is very important, in particular, if you give a symmetry breaking. We haven't understood the phase transition, the dynamical. Transition, the dynamical evolution of the phase transition. So, we are not able at the present time to compute the spectral indices. And we should also show that general relativity arises in the infrared end, that also low energy effective field theory arises in the infrared. So, there's a huge research program. And at the very end of this research program, there's finally the mystery of dark energy. So there's a huge number of open problems. And I want to finish up before the bell rings, well, before the bell rings. So with some conclusions. So here are the robust conclusions, maybe provocative, but robust. So inflation is not the only scenario of early universe cosmology, which is consistent with current data. So if your model of quantum gravity doesn't like inflation, no problem. Then I was arguing that, in light of the transplantian censorship conjecture and other conceptual problems, note that in my discussion of the transplantian censorship conjecture, I did not use spring theory. The three arguments were independent of spring theory. But there are other conceptual problems. And so I was arguing that effective fear theory models of inflation are not liable. And also, a corollary is that dark energy cannot be a bare cosmological constant. And we need to go beyond point particle effect of field theory in order to describe the very real universe. And maybe quantum information will play a very important role. So these are sort of robust conclusions. But then, based on myself believing these robust conclusions, and maybe not everyone will believe these robust conclusions. Believe these robust conclusions, we went on to try to do something which is not based on effective field theory. And this looks rather exciting to me. We started with a well-defined matrix model, which was proposed 25 years ago as a non-perturbative definition of superstring theory, this BFSS matrix model. And then we have a prescription of getting emergent time space in the metric. And the emergent space and time are infinite. And space and time are infinite. The emergent metric is spatially flat, all very nice properties. And we get scaling random spectra of cosmological perturbations and gravitational waves. Who needs inflation? No cosmological constant. But let me go back to things which I think are controversial but robust. So thanks for listening. Further questions from the audience maybe I can ask the audience a question. So, Cliff, you asking me questions before so I'm happy to ask questions. But can I ask you a question in light of Me a question in light of the last part of the talk. So, what are the calculations which you would like to see done to improve the status of this B Ephesus cosmology proposal? So I would say that it's hard to say, but I think the me, I'm very sympathetic with a lot of the speculations, except for the statements. Except for the statement that there's that, I think that what you're seeking is some sort of control over the calculations. What you want to do is, whatever your framework is, you want to have a, since the end of the day, your calculations are ultimately going to be possible ones. You want to have a dentification of the width of the approximation. I think that's the key thing, no matter what the current is. I think that that's one of the things that. One of the things that if you can ask why inflation is so popular, I think it's because it's the one thing on the table where that question is answered. And I think that there's no evidence. I just want to make sure that it's clear that there's no evidence that the patient has trouble with effective field treaties, that the transplant conditions are not a failure of effective field treatment. Given that, they're the only thing we have for which these Thing we have for which these control and approximation issues are dealt with. I think, see, I disagree with you on this. If you have a short phase of expansion, I would completely agree with you, but if you have a long phase of expansion, then the expansion of wavelengths washes out this distinction between ultraviolet and infrared. Ultraviolet scales go into the infrared and you lose the control. Well, I think that we've had this conversation before, but you know, the same issues that happen in inflation also happen in time-dependent situations. In time-dependent situations, such as when you turn off a magnetic field, in the sense that all the landmill levels collapse, and any finite energies taken once you turn the field off came to you from a moment of time scale. And if it were true that there was a fundamental DFT issue for inflation, then there would be a fundamental DFT issue every time someone turned off magnetic fields. And what we don't believe is the problem. So I don't see any issue there. No, I think all other theories are defined in a background Minkowski space. I think there's a crucial difference there. No, but the issue is time dependence and age. But the issue is time dependence and adiabaticity. That's potentially the thing that's controlling for effective setup. See, if you have adiabaticity, then yes, everything is under control. But the point is that things are not adiabatic. Nothing requires you to violate. You can violate adiabaticity. I think you're forced to violate adiabaticity. Why? Because the transplanking modes are get are moving into the ultraviolet. Moving into the ultraviolet, or most of it's moving into the infrared. Well, we, you know, this is something where we could probably discuss it in depth, but it's, I think that the same issues arise in the magnetic field case, and they're not an issue because the important thing is that those moments arrive in their radioactive vacuum, and that's the key assumption. And again, so that means that there's a regime in which that makes sense of it. Robert, let's come back to the question that I asked you, Cliff, now about this matrix model. This matrix model? So, what are the things that bothered you in that particular model? Or that you would ask us to improve on? Like in terms of the calculation of fluctuations, I think we have a well-controlled scheme. I would disagree with that because if you don't know what the background is, you don't know what the fluctuations are. So, the same issues arise for the fluctuations. So, I think it's still a control issue. The control issue, so and then so I think that's what the string people in the matrix business do: they try to control identifying the control parameters, and I think those are the tricks, but for fluctuations, it's one over t for which t the temperature of the state well I guess that's I don't understand that, but it's uh I'll take your work. So so that part of that part of the calculation you Part of that part of the calculation, you have the finite temperature action of the matrix model, and we expand that. So there's no thing you're talking about, you do not have to follow it, but you agree with that. So you're talking about the background, yeah. Yeah, but if you don't know the background, then you also don't know what the fluctuations are. That's, I don't understand how you have the one without the other. Right, now let's look at the background. So, what would you like to see? Well, maybe that's a question for private discussion. Yeah, I would love to have that conversation. I have a question about the matrix model. Okay. So I'm just wondering what, so this SO3 symmetric vacuum, what's the evidence for it? Is there a physical kind of understanding or intuitive understanding for why this symmetric breaking occurs to SO? So in Springer's cosmology, so that was the paper that I wrote with Waffar. So you start with a state in which you have winding modes about. Which you have winding modes about all spatial dimensions excitedly. Now, the energy of a winding mode increases as space increases, as radius increases. So there's something, so this would want to prevent expansion. And so the only way to get spatial dimensions to become large is by the winding modes to annihilate. And winding modes correspond to two-dimensional world sheets, and they cannot find each other. And they cannot find each other in more than four large space-time dimensions. So, this is a mechanism that allows three spatial dimensions to liberate themselves from the winding modes and to become large. And the other six will remain confined by the winding modes. So, that's the mechanism in string gas cosmology. Now, the matrix model is a proposal for Model is a proposal for string theory. So the strings should be contained, they should be excitations of the matrices. One, they should be solitonic excitations of the matrices. So I conjecture that the same mechanism that Raffa and I explored back in 1989 also has an embedding in the matrix model. So I think, so it's this one-dimensional solitons needing to Dimensional solitons needing to find each other to annihilate. Right. I guess I kind of understand that line of reasoning, but I was just wondering what's the evidence? Is this a numerical work that's looking at? Right, so in the IKKT model, there's two sets of evidence. So there's first numerical studies, and then there are also And then there are also Gaussian expansion calculations, where you, in the Gaussian expansion, you calculate the free energy and you make certain guesses, you make unsatisfactors for the states and you compare the free energies for those states. So you take an SO9 symmetric state and you compare the free energy with SO7 cross SO2, SO3 cross SO6. SO2, SO3 cross SO6, and then you find that it is the SO3 cross SO6 that minimizes the free energy. And what we've been able to do for details, please ask Samuel, because he's actually at Banff, oh but you're not at ban. So we've been able to show that in the BFSS matrix model, the SO9 symmetric S ona in symmetric state is not a minimum of the frequency. Thanks. I have a quick question, Robert. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Yeah, so in the BFSS metrics model, the D0 prints are actually coming from the metric itself. So these are the modes of the metric among the Are the modes of the metric along the 11 direction? Yeah. So there is already an input of the metric in the analysis. So when you go from... Yeah, I just see we are the BFSS matrix model was justified initially via the kind of reasonings which you are giving. So you're going from M-theory to a majority. M-theory to a matrix model by some arguments. But what I'm doing here is I'm just saying, forget about these arguments, just start with this Lagrangian which I have here and see what it tells us. The brains will appear as two-dimensional, well, two brains will appear as two-dimensional excitations of the matrices. So this is my philosophy. Okay, thank you. If not, let's thank Robert again and we'll come back for coffee at 10:30. Thank you. Thanks, Rob. I'll stop sharing. Thank you, Robert.
