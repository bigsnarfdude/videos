So first of all, thanks Daddy for giving me this amazing introduction on things that I'm going to present from the industry in 3 point of view. So I'm going to report on mainly these two recent papers that I did with some people in this audience. So if you have questions, you can ask me or many people here in the audience. Feel free also to interrupt me anytime during the talk. So my main motivation is actually so this Motivation is actually so this picture we have seen lots of reports about experiments in YouTube for axions and also, for example, about photos. And this picture, I think it's quite interesting because it shows really the efforts that now people are putting in looking for an axion. And as a string theorist, I think this is really a great opportunity to try to push string theory to the point where we can see what string theory has to say about all these. String theory has to say about all these experiments and all the parameter space that it's going to cover in the next years. So, what I'm going to talk about is two types of fascios. So, first I will talk about ultra-light axon dark matter, in particular fascia dark matter, and then I will be talking about this other type of mechanism to produce ultra-heavy axons. So, with two different types of mechanism. Okay, so the different type of mechanism to produce an axion, so I'm listing here some of them. So I'm listing here some of them, and I'm calling them model-independent and model-dependent for the formula reason. So, we have the famous Miserable mechanism, of course, and every axion has this Miserable mechanism, which produces them in the universe, and this always happens when you have an axion. Otherwise, if you have different types of cosmologies, you can also produce axions through, for example, these ways. So you can produce it thermally, you can produce it by a particle decays of a heavier. By a particle decays of a heavier particle that decays into light at once, you can produce it through topological defects, so if you have a certain electrode, only walls, and so on, or through parametric resonance, which is the type that we are going to see at the end of this talk. And this depends on the type of cosmology that you have. Okay, so Jakob already introduced the EFT of an axiom, but I would like to remark here a couple of features. So when we have one axion coming from string theory, this is basically the EFT distribution. So, this is basically the EFT that you get. So, you get this following Lagrangian with the kinetic term and the potential. And the features of this Lagrangian are the following. So, here in the potential, you always have this exponential suppression. This is quite typical from string theory. And this exponential suppression is in the instant direction S, which scales like the volume of a cycle, which is some manifolds of the gladial. Then it becomes constant, scales is said like one over this. Instead, like one over this volume here, and the mass, of course, from here you can see that it goes like exponentially to the minus the instant reduction, which means that the mass is exponentially sensitive to the instant reduction and the volume of the cycles, whereas the decay constant is not as sensitive as the mass. Now, this is the very easy theory for one axion, and if we want to work with multiple axions, as we will be doing later, this is the theory that you have. Is the theory that you have to deal with? So you get the kinetic terms here, and this is the potential. And this lambda here is containing my instanton action here. And these are the instanton charges that are mixing all the type of axions. So here you will get a linear combination of axions in the cosine, for example. This is the decay constant, how to compute the decay constant, which will depend on how you go from the non-canonically normalized field to the canonical normalized field. Canonically normalized field to the canonically normalized field. And then, of course, you can keep the mass H as well as 134 over F squared H. Question? Yes. One thing that worries me about this parameterization, which is you seem to be ignoring the possibility that some of the excellence pickup masses dominantly from truly strong coupling dynamics, let's say in some strong pickup or hidden sector. So this is taking everything with a semi-classical function that's exponentially good. And of course, that's not true for QCD or QCD-like theories. So, knowing whether things you're going to tell you later in the talk are at least very dependent on that being exactly that formal one-minus cosmic potential. You only have truly potential. Yes, yes. So, this is the potential truly coming from string theory. Then, of course, you can have additional strong dynamics. So, for example, you can have the QCP action potential that comes from these V-theory ingredients that you said. And on top of that, then you have the string key correction to that. So, this is like a pure release thing from ALS, for example. Oz, for example. But indeed, you can have lots of these effects. Yeah, so that can change things. I mean, in fact, my question is: is do you happen to know later on whether or not that might feed into your result? Do you know whether any of your later results in the context? Okay, yes. I will show these for the QCP axioms. Okay, other questions on the UT? Well, you could have other minimas, so you get other masks. So you could add different things. What do you mean by the leaf? Like possibly you're explaining around theta equals zero here. Yeah, I'm gonna. Yeah. So this theory could have other vacuum up that are not the one at theta equals zero. Yeah. And then perhaps maybe other expressions for the other construction. Yes. Yeah, no, here we are minimizing indeed a key takeaway. No, here we are minimizing indeed that theta equals zero. Yeah, so there are some assumptions underlying all these equations. So, yeah. So, for example, here another input from string theory is that we're going to consider only 83s. We're all considering these seven brains wrapped in cycles. Or for example, we are to compute the mass, uh you have to impose some kind of hierarchies among the the the scales to to be able to to compute at at least what we are going to do is is What we are going to do is this. So, yes, there are some assumptions. That changed the masses. Yeah, I'm not if you have the order one phases. Other minimum of a conspiracy where things somehow aligned to give you different minimums. And the spectra didn't change massively around different minima. Massively around different minima, but I don't know whether we were in a case where there was, but we did check whether they were really distinct minima, like you guys said, how many minima there are, and so on. I don't know how different your minima have to be, but like things didn't change massively when Vera first expanded around different minima. Because like it's parametrically all the same stuff, right? The lambdas in the f's don't change. Yeah. Yeah, I just remarked that the formula could be the difference in the form. Okay. Okay, so we're going to apply this EFT to a model fuzzy dark matter. So what is fuzzy dark matter? Well, Doddi already explained it very nicely. So what we're going to do is use for fuzzy dark matter, auto light axions and in particular axons coming from string theory. So it was pointed out in this first paper that to have fuzzy dark matter to be the total of the amount of dark matter you should have something that goes like 10 to the minus 21, 21, 22, and then you get constant 10 to 16, 10 to 17 g. 10 to 16, 10 to 17 Gb. And this was pointed out as a possible sign of the string axioms for the following reasons. So, first, you have a very high degree constant, which comes from nicely from string theory. You have a plenitude of axions in string theory, so we saw that we can have 100 of axions. And for example, these can all have different masses because they are exponentially sensitive to the exactoscales. So, you can have these like clusters of alos with different masses, so it's very interesting. And also, it was pointed out. And also it was pointed out in other papers that having a fancy action could possibly crash into the graphic conjecture. So for this talk I'm not going to open these parentheses, but we can discuss later if you want about this. So I'm going to ignore this problem here. Good. So to compute the faster dark matter abundance, you have to compute this, basically, these equations here depending on the mass of your axiom. So for example, if the mass is bigger than 10 to the minus 28 electron volt, you have To the minus 28 electron volt, you have to use this formula here, which depends on the constant, the mass, and the initial detail angle. Then, again, instead, if you are in this regime, so before the output today is more than 10 to the minus 28, this is the formula you have to use, it doesn't depend on the mass of the axion. And otherwise, you can also have something, an axion that is heavier than the half-wheel air heat. And here, you can compute the abundance, and you can. You can compute the abundance, and you can see that it crucially depends on these values of W and H during rate heating. This is going to be very important because when you want to compute the diagram abundance, you have to sum over all possible contributions of all axions. So, for example, if you see the axiom, I don't know, I didn't write it here, but you should include it as well, it makes up dark matter, then you should include this the abundance computed during matter determination. Computed during matter combination, the balance computed during relation combination, the balance coming from this axiom here, and all of them should sum equal or below the total tarparables that we see. So something that is quite common from string theory probably is the fact that since we have so many actions, you run very frequently into the problem of overclosure of the university. So, this is something that as screen theorists, when we remote the building, we should think about how to describe. Model building, we should think about how to deal with this problem. So, what we implemented in the paper is the following. So, for example, all the atoms with masses bigger than H at reheating can be diluted away in the following way. So, this is a sketch of what happens during matter domination, radiation termination. And during reheating, you can see how the masses scales. And we plotted some different cosmologies. So, for example, during kaenation, So, for example, during kination, this is how it will be diluted during the universe. So, you can see that the abundance actually increases. So, instead, if you stay in this part here, you can dilute away all the axions heavier than H of R. So, this is one way to get rid of some axions, and they won't contribute to the total d energy density of the universe. Another way that you can do is play with the initial theta angle. So, since these are str string theory reactions, String theory actions, they come from the pre-inflationized, so they belong to the class of the pre-inflationary scenario. So we don't really know what is the distribution of theta initial, so it can be any value. Of course, there are some values that might be more probable than others. But in principle, this is a completely free number. So what you can do is tune this initial angle in such a way that in the end they contribute to the right amount. In the end, they contribute to the right amount without overcausing the influence. Okay, and these are the two ways in which we dealt with having a lot of axions. I tried to pass their point. And for example, in our ensemble that I'm going to describe very soon, this is what we found. So this is the tuning that in general you have to impose if you have this following light number of axions. So as you can see, you should somehow engineer. Somehow, engineer small thetas in your theory to not only include the universe. Okay, so to model fasi dark matter, we are going to work in Title B Caladial compactifications or orientifies of Calabia. And so I'm going to focus on two different aspects to do moduli stabilization. And the first one, to do fuzzy dark matters, sorry, the first one is from a paper that I put out some years ago with Mikhail. Some years ago, with Michael, Veronica, and Alexander, where we focused more on the interplay between ultra-light axons making positive dark matter and moduli stabilization, so for example, KKT and LBS. And instead, in this recent paper with basically all of the people here, we focus more on understanding the street landscape. I think only clear is missing. Okay, so we focus more on Okay, so we focus more on uh on on seeing uh what happens if you want to make fast dark matter with the uh with the uh the straight mask, so studying the straight mask and so. Okay, so to focus when we focus on modular stabilization, the first is that uh we stabilize all moduli like LA KKST and LBS, and in particular this uh this uh this uh was uh it was possible then to to differentiate uh between uh axions that were that were coming from a KKELT scenario. were coming from a KFT scenario and an LPS scenario. But in this work we ignored the QCD axion, we totally just took two ALPs and that was it. And since we did it analytically, we focused only on one and two axions, max. We ignored the cosmological history, but we worked with different types of axions. So not only C4 axions, which are the ones that Jakob presented yesterday, but also different axions coming from different data potential. Instead, in this Instead, in this more recent work, we are assuming modularized stabilization, so we are not really working out all the details of modularized emulatization. We assume that they are stabilized at some point in my modularized space. But the perks is that we are going to work with real gravios. So we have this database of possible gravios, and we can inspect which of them have the right properties to give fuzzy dark matter and what they give in exchange. So, if I want to give fuzzy dark matter, what I do. I want to build faster dark matter, what I get in exchange from these kind of axioms. Then we can also include the Kisiki axiom, following from the previous works by the people, some of the people in our group. And then we can also increase the number of axions. So we did something some studies up to seven axions. The reason being that after that it's quite difficult to get the the the right fat window regime. The right fat window regime. And then we have more insight on cosmology. So we did also a study on what happens to the cosmology with having so many actions and so on. But we only considered C4 actions. So for this reason, I'm going to focus only on C4Axions for the rest of this talk. Okay, so when we studied modularized stabilization, for C4ACON, we found out that the So, we found out that the best way to give quasi dark matter to substructions was through Large Volume scenarios. So, if you don't know that, what is Large Volume Scenario is basically that you're considering a volume of the Calabiao that is much bigger than the string length in such a way that you can have control over your yet pieces. And these are computations that you can do analytically with plan and paper because you have, you can see there only one axion or maximum. Consider only one axion or maximum of two axions. Here are how the masses scale with the volume of the Calabi L and the instant on action corresponding to the volume of the Cala VL. And here with two axions. And this is the final result that we found. So here I'm plotting the parameter space of the mass of the axion and the dark matter abundance, where this line corresponds to the total dark matter abundance being falsified matter. So here we have a difference between radiation. Difference between radiation domination, matter domination, and then dark energy. Okay, so this was the prediction from based on modern stabilization, where I know that it looks like a very sharp line, but actually we made all the three parameters of the theory vary a lot. And in the end, it turned out that actually the position is quite sharp. Okay, so we have. Okay, so we have this from under stabilization, but then what can we say for a bigger ensemble of axioms? Sorry, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Why is it about the step? Why? The step, this, this thing was. Ah, this comes from the feature. This comes from, yeah, exactly, because you have to change the when I showed the dramatic abundances that you have to change depending on the mass, how to compute them, because they are starting to see. Because they are starting to oscillate in different moments of the universe. So you're gonna have here that you're oscillating in radiation domination, here you're oscillating in matter domination. So you are, for example, the fact that you see this straight line is the fact that this doesn't depend on the mass. The first step is a change between variation and energy. Yes. The second step? Between matter domination and dark energy. So domination of dark energy. And dark energy, so domination of the ecological concept, which is similar to this, but just with a different scope. And the way you hit, and then you cannot describe all the metal knowledge anymore, and which is tens of good. So, yes, this is a scrutiny because we did this paper five years ago or three years ago, I don't remember. But now, what we did with the most recent paper, we considered so here we were looking for a fuzzy dark matter actually. We are looking for a fast dark matter actually with 10 to the minus 21 electron volt, doing all the abundance. In the recent paper, we shifted this mass to 10 to the minus 18. At 10 to the minus 18, still has a width to be 100% of that matter. I mean, we required the fuzzy axiom to have a mass of 10 to the minus 18. We looked for an axiom with 10 to the minus 18 electron volt. You have here a prediction. I don't want to say that. This is higher cannot be changed, right? It's a prediction of the model. It's a prediction of the model, but we require an action to have this mass. Like when you impose the total dark matter abundance, you have to also look for a certain mass range. So we asked when when like when is a certain axiom with a certain mass doing all Certain mass doing all the dark matter. You change the volume, right? You choose your parameters to stabilize at a certain volume to get the mass that you want. Sure, but then we get more than one. I mean, if it is plot, I go to 100 minus 18, I get much more. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You have to shape your setup. Yeah, define your conditions. In this setup, yes. In this setup, yes. In this case, you would need to fine-tune. You will need uh either to fine-tune or to change the parameters of the models. For example, to heat exactly this mass, I could choose a specific volume of the Calabiao or some other parameters like that or not, or things like this. But you could also shift this. I thought that freedom was the split width of your life. Yes, but you can also increase it. Yeah, you can make it bigger. This this this was a freedom with reasonable. We don't we'll but you can yeah you can make it bigger. Other questions? Okay. So to move further and to have like a bigger ensemble, we used the powers of CY2s. So yesterday you saw already Raja describing this and I guess we also discussed this. So what CY2 does is basically taking What CY2 does is basically taking all these possible caravials from the quantum scatter database and giving you the tools to extract the gravias and doing the computations. So this is a pipeline of how it works. So I'm going to be very quick here because I guess Amias will discuss this more. But basically from Chris CAC you choose first a positor, then you do what is called a triangulation, and this uh allows you to construct a carabia tree for you. Allows you to construct a Cadabio tree fold. Then, when you have a Cadabio 3 fold, you have to choose an oriented projection, which we were able to do thanks to Jakob's recent paper. And then, here you can choose one of the devices to host a QCD. And if you want to build, of course, a QCD action. Then you have this colon, which is basically parametrizing your modularized space, and then you have to fix a point where you assume that stabilization. Where you assume that stabilization is occurring, then you have to compute the superpotential, inside a superpotential of W, and then finally you can write down your axial Lagrangian and do all the computation that you want. So thanks to this pipeline here, we produce the following ensemble. So we consider, as I said, H11 between 2 and 7. And one thing is that we found out is actually that, so H11 plus between 2 and 7, and H1. between 2 and 7 and H11 minus in 97% of the orienting force coming from the outer proceeder had H11 minus equal to 0. What is H11 minus again? Good. H11 minus are the axions coming from the C2MB2 gauge for fields. So these are, if you want, there could be possible other types of axons, which we found out that they were not generic in our ensemble. They were not generic in our ensemble. Then we impose all volumes in figure of one to have control of the EFT. We assume the modular stabilization happens in some point of the KR con. And then we look for a cycle with the right volume to host TCD. So the right volume means hitting the right case capital of T C D. Then, yes. So i this is like the third last step is that you choose a point in the scalar bone which says that you would stabilize the moduli and that's basically like choosing a minima right yeah but how do you know that like because once you compactify and get to a 4D theory you can have flat directions so like before doing that and checking the potential And checking the potential, you should check. So, like, do like once you choose the cone, like the point in the cone, do you check that? No. No. We just assume that there is some perfect turbulence. I was discussing yesterday, right? That we are we looked at civilization, yes, and we don't know about that. That's a good point. That's a good point. But this is this is an assumption that you have to live with now if you want to. I mean, there are progresses, of course, because like Liam and many people here did some these papers on reciter and EPS KTF destabilization. So there is a way to stabilize everything. But in principle, so that point can actually be not a minimum. Yes. Okay. Yes. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. It's almost certainly not a minimum. Okay. But it's a geometrically consistent one. And then, for the previous discussion, one would like to build the technology to do at this kind of scale of stabilization. And we did look at how much the physics changes, like, in regions around that point, so in other regions where QCD has the right divisor volume, for example, how much does the axiom physics change? We shuffle things, but it doesn't change the qualitative conclusions. Yeah. Because for example, you can pick a point and then do some sampling around this point and see what happens. No, but that's a good point. Okay. So this is the ensemble that we... Ah, last one. So at this design, we require an axion to have a fatty mass of 10 to the minus 18 electron volt. And then finally, all the moduli to be much heavier than the axion. This is like another assumption required. Assumption required. So, yes, yes. Do they also contribute to the dark metal, like the volume modular, switches heavier than oh no, they they are so heavy that no, they don't should be somewhere. Yeah, it's like uh they yeah, they did I guess they are so happy that they have decayed the it's like they don't yeah all volumes greater than one, do you scale the whole volume or do you scale GS or scale? Or do you scale GS or something? Or how do you scale the G? You scale the volumes of the cycles. So you have, like, I'm going to show you later a plot of the modularized space, and I will show you. But you use case the you pick a point where the volumes of all the cycles are bigger than one. And also finally, um this two uh going from two to seven, do you scan every all? You you scan what's going on. Yes, it was kind of fun. And then we did some some sampling of also higher intron and not just all polygons, all triangulation. All triangulation. Yeah, just a finite setting. And all oriented. All inheritance. All the reactive was studied by young. So, ah, indeed, I have it here. Okay, so first example as a warm-up. Okay, so first example as a warm up, this is one of the examples that we have in the paper, which nicely shows what's happening because you have only two axioms, so you can literally plot the modularized space. So what is going on here, so you have two divisors where you can choose where to put your TCP axion. So here this red line is where the TCP oxygen can be and have the right age capping. Then the blue line is where the paltry oxygen Line is where the paltry oxygen can leap to have the right mass. And here I'm plotting the volume of two curves. So, as you can see, this black line here is telling you where you have control over your EFD, so inside this black lines. And then we also plotted this green dotted line, which is where, above which you solve PQ quality. So, later I'm going to comment Pfupolity in the whole example, but yeah, so as you can see, But yeah, so as you can see, you can solve peak equality sample values. And then you can see that there is an overlapping region between the QCD axion and the FASI axion. And in particular, in this point here, are the numbers that I'm showing you. So we get the mass of FASI and QCD axion, and then the decay constant of FASI and QCD axon. And in particular, in this example, it was particularly nice because you can have the dark matter made of half the QCD. Have the dark matter made of half the QCP acid and half the fuzzy, and with a theta of as dark matter that is not tuned, and a theta of QCB that it must be very small to not overpermute. Okay, so this is how it works, and then you do the same for H1 and bigger than 2. This is the question. In the right part, you have this black dot where you see an example model in the overlap region. But then this is a point where you are not. But then this is a point where you are not on the tip of the stretch scalar corner kind of thing. So this is one can view as an example that the actual stabilization that you have to still work out. Someone has to still work out. It matters. Yes. Absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Not all the predictions from the tip of the search category necessarily carry out. Actually to find fancy you have to go away from this particular stage carecloom. But it seems that there is two actions already. With two axions, or it seems that you can do whatever you want, basically. I mean, giving, like, if I take several axions, I take the third axion, you know, there's so much freedom. By visioning yourself in the duplicator code, you can directly choose the masses of the various axions. Yes. So you can choose whatever you please. You would think so. But then when you start requiring uh everything to be consistent, like not overproduced, and then having eighty threes and then having uh eighty three. 83s on certain cycles. When you start imposing all these constraints that are not modularized stabilization, you realize that actually you have discarded a lot of oriented foods and a lot of possible colonials. What is cardboards? Because for example they would overproduce a lot because they what if we discard does not look as favourable is Does not look as favorable, you say. Yeah, yeah, it's not favorable for FASD, for example. You cannot hit also, it's not favorable to have a QCD axiom. So, all these things put together actually give you a lot of restrictions. Sorry, if I could understand, so I mean, you're saying it looks like it looks awfully easy, like it just works. It looks before looking at the work, it seems to me I have the axial form. Three axions or four axions. I have the freedom to choose either cycles. Basically, I can get any mass relation of direct absorptions that work. If I think one of them should be light, I just make one cycle bigger. Or I make the cycles bigger that provide the masses of axial and so on. Yes, but for example, if you want both the axial and fancy, I mean, this region is very small. I can have. I mean, there are two different. Okay, but there are two different axes. I mean, there are two different, okay, but there are two different oxides. One is the ducture, one is the oxygen. You're saying there's a particular region where you can have both. But that is kind of clear. You have two parameters to play. You require it, so you can play. But you don't always find an overlap inside the stretched telecom. So this is a deceptively successful example that shows all the stuff you could want. But it's not like immediately upon looking into the ensemble one finds that that's the typical behavior, right? No, it doesn't. It's an exceptionally good example. Do you remember how many we had to discard the percentage in IJ? Like getting everything right getting everything right means QCD and fuzzy.meter. QCD axion and fuzzy.member is that sorry fuzzy not fuzzy.metax, not fuzzy.met is too little. We just pick the mess that we wanted. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Missing was. I'm sorry about the constraint you're imposing on the dark matter abundance here, dark matters. Are you including the stochastic axion scenario too? Because of course there you can have high FI You can have high FA, you know, small hubber constants during inflation, and of course, as you know, you get very suppressed, you know, so that's a whole different scenario. It's not only at all in this scenario. Some could like later I will show a plot that has also lighter axions to have to be like a stochastic background. Is that what you mean, right? Yeah, so it's but it's the it's it's the so-called um inflationary stochastic axion reduction mechanism, which I don't think Your production mechanism, which I don't think is really one of your mechanisms that's not misminded anyway, but it's not relevant, right? Yeah, no. Because the XMS is all on the height, the XM potential is large enough, the AI is large enough, you never actually explore the default parameters for students. I think in some sense you're doing that by playing with the equation of a state of otherwise the Hubble parameter wouldn't show up. Only regression of Hubble parameters should show up. Is that true? Is that true? That's what it does include that scenario by having that reheating proof. If the reheating, if the equation of a state is close to inflationary... I guess it's similar. It's maybe not the exact same dependence, but related. That's what we saw in the equation, in the videos. So we did a case where we have instantaneous reheating, equation state minus one down to H, and then you can interpret that H as H inflation. And then you can interpret that H as H inflation. And then we did include the contribution of the variance from H inflation into the Interlike angle of those. That is included as a limit. Correct. Right? We do have the variance. Second is H inflation to the fourth is smaller than Inflation to the fourth is smaller than the height of the axial potential, so it's smaller than ma times fa squared squared. Well, I would say x squared and plan squared is greater than alpha. So there's a plane squared is bigger than that. Well, it's saying great, but yeah. It's saying h inflation is tiny, right? I mean, for instance, there's no axiom where you sit, but H inflation being, say, you know, a few times 100 EV, you know, something like that. So the height of the hydro is large. And that while you've So the hyper potential is large. And that way you can have a QCPX and you'll be able to dark round a preferred FA being close to the main scale. Yeah, but we have very poor understanding of inflation theory, so who knows how to overcome. If I'm just investigating just axial parameters for explaining it all to be true, surely open looks fluid actually. That's if you usually get a very small misalignment, I think. Yes, yeah, exactly. It's like we don't have dynamic. Yes, yeah, exactly. Tighten the tiny dynamic. I can write a very tiny line with everybody without tuning. Yeah, yeah. I mean, w if you ignore the fact that you have an involving question, but we don't understand about any other work. Also, just to respond to one thing Arthur said, he said that it looks already pretty good, unconstrained here at H11 equals 2. So the moment you add more axions, it should get better. I think that intuition is maybe in some ways the. Maybe in some ways the opposite, that it actually gets more constrained as you go up in H11 because the moduli space, the K-ler column, shrinks. So you more constrained volumes. That's because you demand intuitive control in all the two cycles, in all the cycles. But obviously you need it for physics reason. Well, I don't even think it's demanding control of all the two cycles. In control of all the two cycles, even if you only demand that all the divisor volumes are bigger than one. Why would I do that? I mean, I really know where many cycles are small and many cycles are large. The divisors, you need them to be bigger than one, otherwise the ED3 superpotential is completely out of control, and that's what's being used to calculate the axion potential. So even if we imagine some perturbative magic stabilizes this axions, if we let divisor bonds be less than one, then the superpotential that you wrote down at the beginning. The superpotential that you wrote down at the beginning doesn't make sense. I think so. Okay. Yeah, but actually, that's why I asked my question. That's exactly the question, right? But that's a calculational for us to go to calculate models of nature, doesn't it? It's a semi-classical calculation. It could be that nature is just not semi-classical. So, what cuts are you actually imposing? Is it just four seconds volumes or also two circles? Just four cycle volumes or also two cycles? Because at the bottom looks like there's some volume. I think it's four cycle. It's four cycle. Yeah. Okay. So this is another example. Here we went up to H11 equal to 7. And this is an example where you can hit all the dark matter in fast dark matter with theta fast dark matter equal to one. So here in this plot we are plotting the the black line is this uh is this nice example with theta equal to one and then we we also uh parametrize how many changes. Parametrize how it changes with these different emissions alignment angles. Here we have this region that Donnie talked about before, and we also superimpose that with the previous things that I showed you before by changing some parameters in such a way that they overlap, like they are consistent with the two papers are consistent with each other. So, as you can see, we hit the future experiment, which is something. The future experiment, which is something very interesting. And in particular, okay, so we have one axion that is speaking fast dark matter, but we also have to deal with the other axions that are present because we have H11 equal to 7. So what we did here was diluting this axion by entropy production. And what we find out is that to have the right temperature, eating temperature, to be able to do so, this actually imposes a constraint on W0. So here we found there is a correlation between theory eating and W0, and in this way, we were able to divert all the other axes away and just... Dilute all the other axes away and just have not hypervariable than second. So, this is one of the reasons why you should deal with cosmology to avoid variable insensitive. And this is, I think, a nice plot of the various behaviors inside this ensemble. So, as you can see, we have the fuzzy line here because we posed the fuzzy action to be present with 10 to the minus With 10 to the minus 18 EV mass. Here we have the Hidden Deaxion, this point here. Then there are some examples where you get something in between the Hiddexion and the Palm Deoxyon, which are a bit hard to deal with because they contribute to the abundance. And here, these are all the heavy axions that can be diluted away. Why is there that line like this, that's 45 degrees? Yeah, because there is a relation between T-Reating and the mass of these heavy axions that it gives exactly this T-Re-heating proportional square root of MA, I think, right? Which use TV heating in those modules in order to get rid of the heavy axiom. So there's the relationship between the mass of the lightest heavy axiom and the value that you need of TV thing, the TV heating to get rid of you. Yes. And it causes all things. So it creates this. So it creates this point. Okay, good. And this instead is what Dallas was saying before. So okay, we find we pick a point in modular space, but then we also went around to maximize, to optimize our point and our ensemble. So here you can find the optimized blue lines are the optimized points, and the black line is actually the maximum abundance example that I showed you before. And instead, the orange line are just the That the orange line are just a random thing that you would get in a random calabiao on a random point in the one-player space without optimal influence. Okay, since yesterday during the discussion session, the people that were with me were very interested in the constant of this example, so I also included this plot that shows based on the number of H11, this shows the decay constant. This shows the decay constant of the fashion oxygen in our sample. So, until it is from 1 equals to 7, this is complete, and then we have some coarse sampling, which depends also on the abundance that the fashion oxygen is making out of the total amount. So, as you can see, in general, there is some kind of not too much separation, but you can try to engineer some hierarchies. And we have an example where we engineered a hierarchy between the decay constants in a way that reminds a bit of idea. That reminds a bit of ideas for interest. Okay, so finally, I have two comments, two features that we found out in our ensemble. First, the quality problem. So, this is a plot of the fraction of the cravials that are solved in peak quality based on the mass of the lightest axiom. And we found out that in our example, this of scales is quite common, where lambda p. Is quite common, where lambda PQ is the lambda that is responsible for the quality problem. And if you pause the PQ quality to have this standard ratio between PQ quality and lambda QCD, then you get that the lightest, and using this quantity here, you have this bound where you get the mass of the lightest axon over the mass of the QCD to solve which equality must have a RP of 10 to the minus 5. And indeed, for example. And indeed, for example, you can see here that when you drop below the fuzzy axion, then not every example solves the equality, but as soon as you go around the FADSI regime, then almost every example is solving the quality. And this is interesting because this points towards the fact that if I have FATZI axioms, it means that almost always you solve the Q even if you have You solve the Q even if you have H11 that is more than 20. Okay, a last comment is about dark photons. So, in this paper, we applied Jakob's paper on oriented fold of the Crystal Sky database. So, we also did some exploration of what this oriented fold will impose, and we found out that in our ensemble to a small edge of one, we found out that. Small H1, we found out that the H21 plus is different from zero and 95% of your antiflues. And having this H21 plus different from zero means that you have dark photons. In particular, because you can expand your C-foractions, as we were discussing also yesterday in this discussion session, and this would be your dark photon production. So here you can see a plot depending on H11. You can see the numbers of H11 and the changes with the changes with H21 plus with an average one one. So it seems to be a generic feature that at low H11, at low H11 you get a lot of dark photons. So FAZI naturally also brings you the presence of dark photons. They are we didn't we didn't really dig too much into their masses or capping, so this is for sure something that has to be done in the future. How much do we have? Ten minutes. Okay. Okay. 10 minutes. Okay. Okay. Okay, so I will go quickly also in this result that it's considering parametric resonance. So what is parametric resonance? So first, parametric resonance has been considered and there is a huge literature about parametric resonance. So later I will explain quickly what is parametric resonance, but let me just show all the papers that there are on this topic. So parametric resonance is we consider for acid approach to produce acid dark matter. To produce astrid matter, to produce dark photon dark matter. But in stream theory, we found out that actually people did it mostly with the perturbative decay, to produce axions via perturbative decay. So for example, when you have a modulus, then this can decay into lighter axions because they can. So however, we wanted to explore also a different possibility to produce axions. And in particular, this I showed you before, these are the I showed you before, these are the ways in which an axion can couple to the modules. You add your kinetic coupling for the kinetic terms, but also in the potential, you get a quite peculiar coupling that is typical of string theory that is an exponential term here. So, this is a very simple theory, but it's quite generic when you do the generic LAPAO or the ATI for compartmentification in the geometric regime with simple actions. So, we wanted to explore the features and the So we wanted to explore the features and the phenomenology of these, the difference of these two capacities here. And we applied this to parametric transonance. So parametric trans is a period that happens right before reheating and it's at the end of the end of mutation and right before reheating and it's a period where you have a number two button production and explosion of particles. So what you do to study this regime here is first you so you have your inflationary field that is this high which is coupled Field that is this high, which is coupled with an theta axion, so an axion and the theta here. You expand around the depth of this axion, then you compute this equation here with the volume showing up, the volume, sorry, the potential showing up here. And then for certain, so you compute this equation for the quanta k of the axioms and for this region of quanta, then you can you can. Of quanta, then you can solve this equation here. This is Code-Fouquet theory, and then you can see that you get an exponential production of particles which depends on the mass of the infection. So you can see here that it really, the more that you it oscillates, the more you get production of these particles. Then you can compute the co-moving occupation number, which again is exponentially dependent on the mass of the inflaton. And if you integrate over all the momentum, then you get the number of particles that are produced during Article that are produced during projecting. So we asked ourselves what happens if we do that in string theory. Is it different by and how is it different? So now we consider the modulus being like my stationary field, which is coupled to its axiom. And so what you have to solve is this equation here. So here I'm including also the expansion of the universe, and this is the Of the universe, and this is the second dimension of the potential, which is basically the mass of the axion, the bare mass, let's say. But then, when you introduce the expansions around the bell, you can see that the effective mass of the axion after parametric resonance happens is equal to the bare mass times these oscillations here. And this really comes from the fact that in the potential, the axion couples with an It has an exponential coupling with the suction. So, what we found out in this paper is that parametric resonance in string inflation is intrinsically different from just normal EFT inflation exactly because of this exponential cut. And this gives a very, very different prediction from the normal EFT point of view that would be interesting to explore also, for example, in simulations because we did everything numerically. Okay, so what we found is that when the kinetic energy is bigger than The kinetic energy is bigger than the potential, then you have a production of axions that are ultra-light. So you get something that is like light radiation, and this will contribute to Delta effective, but the contribution is very light. So it could not screw up the prediction on Delta NFF. But what is interesting is when the potential of the axiom is bigger than the kinetic energy, then you get a production of axion that has a huge mass that is almost comparable to the mass of the ink catalog. So basically, what happens? The capital. So basically, what happens is that the axon is light, but then as soon as you start oscillating, this cosine switches sign, so you get a real exponential production that changes your effective mass. And this can give you really, really heavy oxides. Now, since these are produced during radiation domination, they shift slower than radiation, and this means that they might lead to overclosure, and therefore you have to find a way for them to decay efficiently. them to decay efficiently. So basically, let's say you have your favourite strain theory inflation line model. You have to compute how many of these axions are produced and which mass. And then you have to ask yourself, okay, then I have around these super heavy axions, what is this implying to my cosmology? So we applied this finding to a typical inflationary potential in screen theory, which is called fiber inflation, which basically Inflation, which basically comes from AVS or direct standardization plus some corrections. And this is nice because fiber inflation is known to have parametric resonance, so we applied our theory to this inflationary potential. And this is how parametric resonance works. So in the beginning, you start producing these quantum, then you produce more and more and more. At some point, you arrive at some kind of saturation. Arrive at some kind of saturation where you stop producing particles because the inflaton has already given all the energy to the most of the energy to the axon. And so for example here we use some values to have right fiber inflation with all like the NFL with the number of e-fold which is right and everything that is right. And this is what you find. So you get And this is what you find. So you get a mass of the axion, an effective mass that is 10 to the minus 5 and Planck. So it's and this axion can do some things. So for example, it can be dark matter, but especially it can decay. And here, so in this paper, we studied a lot of the possible decay channels. So for example, it can decay to massless KH bosons, it can decay to gravitons via the AR12 capping, it can decay to standard mass. Capping. It can decay into standard model, if it comes to the standard model. So it really depends on how you build your stream theory model. It can decay into LiDAR axia or in condensed engagement. So when you build a model, then you have to check what are the decay rates into each sector and see what example you're seeing. Okay, I'm almost done. So what we learned from these papers and in general from studying the string axiomers, I think is that in general when you Is that in general when you study all these features from string theory, you get novel features, but also sometimes novel troubles that you have to deal with. So, for example, overabundances, you get a very rich cosmology because you have a lot of particles, but then you might have some problems. Then, another very interesting thing is that the string theory point of view sometimes is intrinsically different from the EFT point of view. So, for example, you get high quality, but also you get some couplings that are peculiar of string theory. Things that are peculiar of string theory and might be interesting to explore them further. Then, as I was saying at the beginning, we have some parameter space of axioms from experiments that is still unchecked, and I think it's a great opportunity for Swin Theory to try and test something about that parameter space that is going to be covered in the following. So, since we are in a workshop, if I have two minutes, I would like to show something that would be nice to be done in the future, I guess. So, we have to deal with our photos. So, we have to deal with our photons. We knew that they were around. I think in string theory, there are not many studies, and in this paper, we actually found out that they are quite common, especially when you have a small number of axes. So, there is no problem if they are massless. Well, there are some problems from the cost-monished point of view, which would be nice to study, but also it would be nice to study to see how to give them a mass that is maybe lower than the KK scale and so on. So, there is a whole window. So, there is a whole window under photos. Then, something else that will be interesting to be done is to implement CY2s for other types of axions. So, now CY2s can deal with C4 axions, but there are plenty of other axions. So, for example, this is the same plot that I showed you from Fuzzy Dark Matter with modernized stabilization for the C4 axion. But then you can also give other predictions for other types of axions. And as you can see, you can cover different points of the parameter. Different points of the parameter space. So, this is something that here we consider only one axion. Again, you can increase the number of axions and simple outputs. Then, consider the production mechanisms. So, for example, cosmic strings, I think, might be interesting, might be very, very constrained by string theory. So, maybe there's something that can be said that is very constraining for the landscape in this regard. And then, something else that I think would be interesting is in general access and. Interesting is in general axioms and gravitational waves. So there was this paper here that we discussed yesterday during our session that checked how a spectator acts under inflation and produces some peaks in the gravitational waves. And in general, I think it would be interesting to discuss a bit more isocurvature. So here, this is some result that we had in this paper with Nikil and Alexander: that we had only one and two oxygens, and we found. Had only one and two axioms, and we found out that isocurvators didn't have a much stronger bound that is known. So, H inflation smaller than 10 to the 11, or if you have, this is for two axioms, it's always for two axions. Okay, so these were different setups, and as you can see, it's around 10 to the 11, 10 to the 8. This is the upper bound for isocarbon inflation. And it would be interesting to explore this maybe also for the steam galaxy for. Also, for the Senghasi first coming from C12. And my last bit is the ARR board. I think it would be extremely interesting, and you can tell us something, maybe not from the cosmology point of view, but from the condensed matter point of view, because we did some study in this paper about this coupling, and of course, it's much, much more suppressed than, for example, FF2 coupling. But maybe in some specific condensed matter experiment, something can be checked. Something can be checked also is picked up. With this, I'm done. Thank you. Yes? I have a comment. I mean, so this isocurvature is, of course, I think it's not as harmless because it forces you to a small age and it forces you basically to a large volume. Yeah, it's not too easy to get them. I mean, the lower your lower, the much you know, the more you. The more you lower the scale of inflation, of course, the more fine-tuning you have to catch up that. So it's really. Yeah, I didn't want to say it was a hardness. Here I wanted to say that when we studied this for one or two axions, we got the normal prediction that we would expect for a string theory axion. So in general, it was expected that for a string theory axion, since f is very big, you get 10 to the 10 pound of. 10 bound on Hi, which is harmful, I agree. Which is a significant constraint. It's very, very constraining already. So I was wondering maybe with having the whole mobile space to check with the CY2s and so on, might be even more constraining. And you have another comment or question. Yeah. Concerning uh over statement that for more actions things get easier. That for more axioms, things get easier. I'm so much too confused about it because I imagine.
