Before with the Octonians. And like any mathematical object, we need to put the Octonians in their proper context. So the Octonians are a normed division algebra. And the remarkable thing about normed division algebras is that there are exactly four of them over the real numbers, everything in this. Over the real numbers. Everything in this talk is over the real numbers. This is a differential geometry conference. And those four norm division algebras are the real numbers themselves, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions. And if you look at this list, each one of these is normed in the sense that it has a norm. And if you take the norm of the product, The norm of the product, you get the product of the norms. That's what it means to be normed. So I hope that you're familiar to some extent with all of these algebras, but even if not, let's begin at the very beginning with the real numbers, going back to antiquity, perhaps to Javdaksas in Greece, with his definition of proportions. Proportions. Like I said, these are norms. The norm, of course, in this case is the absolute value. A little more recently, just a few centuries now, we have the complex numbers. Perhaps the idea of taking a square root of minus one was first introduced by Giuseppe Cardano. He's one of the candidates to have done this. And of course, these are also normed. These are also normed, and the norm in this case is the modulus. Getting a lot more recent, getting into the 19th century, we have the quaternions. This was discovered by William Rowan Hamilton, the Irish mathematician. And he did the complex numbers two better by introducing two additional square roots of minus. Square roots of minus one, satisfying these relations that they all square to minus one, and the product of all three of them in that order is minus one. And of course, since the quaternions are associative, whoops. Since the quaternions are associative, you can derive all the other relations. All the other relations just from this one. If I take this expression and I multiply it by minus i, I get jk equals i. If I take the inverse of this expression, I get i equals negative um kj. And similarly, And similarly, for other products of imaginary quaternions. And a handy mnemonic for this is given by this figure. And the way you read this figure is if you multiply two unit imaginary quaternions, the result is the third dot on the figure. If you multiply it in order, no minus sign. If you go against the order, you get a minus sign. And now. And now I'm going to introduce the Octonians. The Octonians were first discovered, although only much later attributed to, Hamilton's friend from college, John T. Graves. They were corresponding about Hamilton's discovery of the quaternions, and Graves said about generalizing it to the Octonians. So now we adjoin seven square roots of Square roots of minus one. And the mnemonic, what was previously a mnemonic, for the moment it's going to become our definition of multiplication. And that's, we draw this funny figure. This figure is called the Fano plane. It's the projective plane with two elements of over the field with two elements. And you put some funny orientations on this figure. And then the rule is that if you multiply. Is that if you multiply two elements, you get the third element on that line in the plane with the minus sign if you're going against the order. So you may notice that I've been inserting these little descriptions of these various algebras and number systems along the way. And this comes from a paper by my PhD advisor, John Baez. I really like the quote, so I'm just going to. I really like the quote, so I'm just going to read it to you. The real numbers in the family of algebras, the real numbers are the dependable breadwinner of the family. The complex numbers are a slightly flashier but still respectable younger brother. The Quaternions, being non-commutative, are the eccentric cousin who is shunned at important family gatherings. But the Ectonians are the crazy old uncle nobody lets out of the attic. They are non-eccini. They are non-associative. So let's get that out of the way right away. They are indeed non-associative. Here's a product associated in two different ways. And we're going to see that you get a minus sign instead of having associativity hold. So, and we're also going to do a little practice with multiples. Practice with multiplying Octonians using this figure. So E, E2, E1 times E2 in that order, that's E4. And then E4 times E3 in that order, so that's going against the order. I get E6, negative E6. And this one, E2. And this one, E2 times E3, in that order, that's E5 times E1. And now E1 times E5, I'm going with the order, so I get positive E6. So indeed, this equation holds. They are not associative. But they are, in some ways, the next best thing to being associative. To being associative, which is that they are alternative, which means that if you take a triple product, but just of two elements, you can associate it in any way that you like, no matter the order that you're multiplying them. And that turns out to be just enough associativity to do many constructions in mathematics, including the constructions that we'll see in a future. That we'll see in a few minutes with spinners. So, but before we get into that, I wanted to give you another way to multiply Octonians, to define the Octonians, than that screwy final plane figure. And just as you could think of complex numbers as pairs of real numbers. As pairs of real numbers, and you have some funny way of multiplying them to give you complex multiplication. So too, you could think of octonions as pairs of quaternions. And then you generalize that funny formula for complex multiplication. Except now order matters because quaternions don't commute anymore. And now you have some conjugations because quaternions are not real. So you can conjugate them. Conjugate them. And you get this formula. So you may wonder now, and yeah, on the rare occasions when in my real mathematical life I have multiplied Octonians, I've used this formula rather than the Fano plane. And you may wonder even how this formula comes about. So I'm going to briefly tell you, which is that the idea is. Which is that the idea is that this, these are q1 quaternion 1 plus q2 times L, where L is now a new element that I'm introducing. It's another square root of minus 1. And it has the property that if I conjugate any quaternion by it, sorry, that's. Sorry, that's bad ready. If I conjugate any quaternion by L, I get the conjugate of that quaternion. That's where this formula comes from. Are there any questions? A funny thing that is that you can now use this construction to now O2 and the O2 and the product on O2. Thanks for the great setup, Gonzalo. Because this works for any star algebra. In other words, a star algebra is just one where you have some conjugation. And it's called the Cayley-Dixon construction. So in particular, you can iterate it. Can I ask a historical question? Absolutely. I suspect this is why we call two very different things conjugation. Things conjugation. That's a beautiful, that's a beautiful remark, and I don't know. But I think you're right. Yeah, a lot of algebra was being discovered, invented in the 19th century. And that's probably one of the reasons. Like the Octonians were influential. Hamilton was the person who defined associativity. Defined associativity. He did it after he knew, learned about the Octonians. The one on the right has to do with the presence of a real structure, the one on the left is group multiplication, conjugation has like group multiplication. They're very different things, but they turn out to coincide, and that's probably why we use the same word. But I don't know. Yeah, well, no, I think you're right. I think you're right, but I don't know either. I don't have a source that can verify that. Anyway, as Gonzalo astutely pointed out, you can. Astutely pointed out, you can iterate the Cayley-Dixon construction. And if we start with R, where the conjugation is trivial, but real numbers are real, so then we get C, because this is the formula for complex multiplication. We get H if we apply it to C. And we get O if we apply it to H. But then we can keep going. And we can get a 16-dimensional algebra that people call the Sedanians. That people call the Sedanians. And we can do it to the Sedanians and get some 32-dimensional algebra that people call, I don't know what. And it goes on forever. You get this sequence of algebras with dimensions powers of two. It's an infinite sequence, but only these first four, only R, C, H, and O, only those are the norm division algebras. Division algebras. So let's talk about why that is, but first let's be a little more precise in the definition of norm division algebra by actually giving a mathematical definition. A norm division algebra, A, is a possibly non-associative real algebra. I should also mention that I'm assuming it's finite dimensional with one equipped with a positive definite quadratic. Positive definite quadratic form satisfying this normed property. The norm of the product is the product of the norms. And I just want to point out that being normed is enough to be division. So division means division means there are no zero divisors. So x times Zero divisors. So x times y equals zero implies x equals zero or y equals zero. That's what division means. And how do you conclude this from being norm? You just take the norm of that equation. This norm is non-degenerate, positive, definite. So you can't have zero norm without being zero. And that being said, let's now talk about this theorem of Hurwitz in a little more detail, where he proved that there are only four non-division algebras, the reals, complexes, quaternions, and octonions. And I'm going to give a proof, probably not at all the proof. Probably not at all the proof due to Hurwitz using Clifford algebras because we need Clifford algebras. So let's go ahead and introduce Clifford algebras. So of course Clifford algebras are named after William Kingdom Clifford. Here's a drawing of him performing his adeptness at rotation in real life. I have no idea, like, I have no idea how accurate this is. This is drawn way after Clifford lived, but it was a fun drawing. So I thought it'd be fun to include. So the Clifford algebra on a real inner product space is the real associative algebra generated by that real vector space V modulo the Clifford relation. The Clifford relation, where if you square a vector in the Clifford algebra, then you get its inner product with itself, or what we might call its norm squared. Except I'm taking G to be non-degenerate, but possibly not positive definite. So norm squared, it might be the square of anything, which is why I brought it like this. This Clifford relation is often equivalently written in its polarized form, right? You could take v and substitute v plus w and cancel some things, and you get this formula, which says that v times w plus w times v in the Clifford algebra is equal to twice the inner product of v and w. The inner product of V and W. Any questions about this? I imagine everyone in this room has probably seen the definition of a Clifford algebra. So the thing that we need to do with our Clifford algebras now is we need their classification. Usually you see this first for complex Clifford algebras. Complex Clifford algebras, but I'm going to go ahead and do the real case because that's what we really need, and it's not that much harder. So I'm going to write CLPQ for the Clifford algebra of RPQ, which is just RP plus Q with the inner product where you have P vectors of norm plus one and Q vectors of norm minus. Q vectors of norm minus one, or norm squared. And so here's the theorem, the classification theorem. Second, what is the your notation for the relation? Are you using the plus or dimension? I don't know. I am using the plus sign. But because I'm going to consider both signatures, I can sneak a minus sign in just by changing signature. That's why I'm using both signatures, honestly, instead of thinking purely positive. Instead of thinking purely positive definitely. Any other questions? But then I think your convention for the signature on RPQ is wrong. You mean a minus sign? Is the RP0? That's your plug. And I would put a minus sign in. Oh, you mean down here? Yeah. You mean down here? No, no, I'm pretty sure that's right. We'll get into it in a second. We'll just talk about some examples. So as a real algebra, all Clifford algebras are matrix algebras. They're n by n matrices for some number n over some algebra of coefficients k. Coefficients k. The size n is fixed by the fact that as a real vector space, the Clifford algebra has dimension 2 to the p plus q. It goes exponentially with base 2 in the dimension of the vector space. And the algebra of coefficients is fixed by what I'm calling the Clifford. By what I'm calling the Clifford algebra clock. So, this is a clock with eight hours on it. Because real Clifford algebras have this period eight phenomenon that is sometimes called Bach periodicity. It is an avatar of the topological Bach periodicity. Where if I add plus signs to my signature, I go around the counterclockwise. I go around in the counterclockwise direction. And if I add minus signs to my signature, I go around in the clockwise direction. You're right, sorry. I didn't notice the conference. Oh, thanks. And all right, so let's see this classification theorem in action. You notice that sometimes, most of the time, it's just a matrix algebra with coefficients. Just a matrix algebra with coefficients in R, C, or H. But sometimes it's a matrix algebra with coefficients in H plus H, or R plus R. And that actually just turns it into the direct sum of two matrix algebras. Because a matrix with coefficients and pairs of numbers is the same thing as a pair of matrices. All right, so let's give some examples. So, of course, the first example, the most degenerate example, is when we're doing the zero vector space. And this is the real algebra with no additional generators. So it's just the real numbers. But then I want to go. But then I want to go clockwise around the clock. So I'm going to take the one-dimensional vector space with negative definite signature. And by the Clifford relation, that means I'm adding one generator, one basis element. The Clifford relation says that it has to square to minus one. So that's just going to be C. It gets a little more interesting when I add two additional generators, because then you have to check that the Clifford relation says that, well, of course this says that both of them have to square to minus one, but it also says that if you're orthogonal, you anti-commute. So you have two generators that both square to minus one and anti-commute, and that's An anti-commute, and that's H. That's the quaternions. You could say, take the generators to be I and J, and then their product is going to give you K. And finally in dimension three Dimension 3, I get an 8-dimensional algebra. It has to be 2 to the 3-dimensional. And you've already seen on the last page what it is. Otherwise, I would try to trap you into saying it's the Octonians. Why is it not the Octonians? Why can it not possibly be the Octonians? Because Clifford algebras are associative by definition. So it's this associative algebra. Algebra turns out to be the sum of two quaternion algebras. And there are two more examples that I really need for this talk. So I'm going to skip ahead to the seven-dimensional negative definite space because we're going to talk about Octonians. They have seven square roots of minus one. So, what is this? So, this has got to be 2 to the 7 dimensional. It's the 2 to the 7 dimensional algebra. And where in the clock is it? You go around 7 clicks here. So it's r plus r. So it's the 2 to the 7 dimensional algebra with coefficients in r plus. With coefficients in R plus R. And that means that the coefficient ring is two-dimensional. So you can get one of those twos in the dimension from the coefficients. So that means it has to be a matrix algebra. In eight by eight matrices. So this is just M8 coefficients in R plus M8 with coefficients in R. Is that good? Okay, good. And finally, again, And finally, again, because we're talking about the Octonians, and Octonians are eight-dimensional, we should have the Clifford algebra of dimension of the eight-dimensional positive definite space. And that just has coefficients in R again, but it has to have dimension two to the eighth. 2 to the 8th. So these have to be 16 by 16 matrices. And those are also the same as the negative definite space. Is there a mnemotech rule for the for clock door? Sorry? Is there another name for it? No, no, is there a nemotechnic rule or you just need need to know it? There is the mnemonic and um um And yeah, it's a bit silly, but you learned the Clifford algebra song. I am a serious mathematician, but I also really enjoy just standing in front of talks and entertaining people. So we're going to learn. So let's go ahead and learn the Clifford Authority of the song. What is the tune of this song that I remember? It's a very famous song. Yeah, it's to the tune of the, this is like, I never even watched this show. People in this room probably never even heard of it. It's to the tune of like the howdy-doody theme song. R-C-H, H plus H, H C R, R plus R. So now, if you really want to learn it, you should sing it. So come on, let's not be shy. RCH, H plus H, H C R, R plus R, R C H, H plus H, H C R, R plus R. Okay, very good. Great. I can't tell you how much. I can't tell you how many times I've sung that to myself. So these are the examples that we're going to need. I want to point out one further thing, which is that for these, the modules of these algebras are going to be really important. The simple modules are going to be important. And when your algebra itself And when your algebra itself is simple, then the module is just the algebra with its left multiplication module structure. So the modules for these, the modules for the top three are just the algebra again. But when your algebra is not simple, if it's the sum of two simple algebras or central simple algebras, then you have two simple modules. Simple modules, the left one and the right one. And how does this, like, how does this work? Well, the thing is that our algebra elements here are pairs of quaternions. Again, not in the octonionic sense. And the way that it acts on an element of the left module is you just multiply by the left one. Multiply by the left one. And similarly, for the right one. This will also be important going forward, coming up real soon. So let me sketch this proof that there are only four norm division algebras. I guess what I'm really going to prove here is that the norm division algebras have to have dimension one, two, three. 1, 2, 4, or 8. It has to be one of those numbers. And then once you know those dimensions, you can apply the Cayley-Dixon construction to the one-dimensional one, which is always R, and you get the isomorphism type of the norm-division algebras. So my claim, my basic claim, which I'm not going to prove, but I could talk about if there was time. I could talk about if there was time is that if I have a norm division algebra, I take the imaginary subspace, the subspace that I'm going to call the imaginary elements of A, to be the subspace perpendicular to the unit. And my basic claim is that the whole algebra A is then a module for the Clifford algebra on Algebra on the imaginary subspace. This makes sense. Remember that by definition, these norms are coming from inner products. So it makes sense to take the Clifford algebra of A or any subspace of A. And I'm just going to show you how this construction works in the example of the Octonians, since that is the focus of art. Since that is the focus of our talk here. So, what do we need to do? We want a module structure. So, when A is the Octonians, I want an algebra homomorphism. This is just real endomorphisms, just real linear maps. This is just 8 by 8 matrices again. I want an algebra homomorphism from the Clifford algebra on the imaginary. From the Clifford algebra on the imaginary octonians into the endomorphism algebra. And I'm going to define it in the following way. On the generators of the Clifford algebra, which are our imaginary octonions, I'm going to send it to the operation of left multiplication by that element. So each of these octonions gives you a linear map on the octonians, and that linear map is just And that linear map is just left multiplication. Is this clear? Okay. And then, so I've told you what to do with the generators, but that's not enough. That's enough to define this as a homomorphism, provided what else happens? Yeah, I need to satisfy the Clifford relation. These generators have to go to something that's to a sub-algebra here that satisfies the Clifford relation. And then I know I've got a homomorphism. This is called universality. The Clifford algebra is the universal algebra. On that vector space satisfying this relation. So once I have another algebra, once I have a map of generators that also satisfies that relation, I get a homomorphism. So let me check that. So what does the Clifford relation say? It says that X L squared has got to be Got to be the norm of x. So these are maps. These XLs are maps. So I should apply them to an element. And then by definition, this is left multiplication. So this is x times x times y. With that parenthesization. Times y with that parenthesization. This is not associative anymore, so I have to be careful. But it is alternative. Hey, great, it's alternative. So and now this is the that thing, that x squared is the square of an imaginary element. And just like for complex numbers, if you square an imaginary element, If you square an imaginary octonian, you get a real number. And just like for complex numbers, you get a negative real number. So this negative real number is the norm of that imaginary. It's its length squared. So, what did I do wrong? It's the signature. Yeah. This is the signature. This is the Clifford relation for the negative definite signature algebra. So, yes, this is in fact a map provided that I'm mapping out of this Clifford algebra. Or if I adopt the other convention for the Clifford relation where you include this minus sign. Any questions? Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes. So some minus one is there, which may not signify. Oh, no. Sorry. Sorry. Minus, that's minus that's minus braces. It's basically a minus two. Is it clear now? Okay, good. So back to this argument. If we have this claim, if you grant me this claim, If you grant me this claim, that when I have a non-divided algebra, then A is a module for the Clifford algebra of the imaginaries of A. Now you know it's with the negative definite inner product. Then what I'm saying is that if you give me a norm division algebra, then I get a Clifford algebra C L of V and a module M of V such M of V such that they have the following relationship with their dimensions, with their real dimensions. The dimension of the module is equal to the dimension of the vector space plus one. Because the imaginary subspace is just, it's co-dimension one. And this This relationship between dimensions for modules of a Clifford algebra is very rare. Because the dimension of Clifford algebras grows exponentially in the dimension of the vector space, the dimension of the modules also grows exponentially in the dimension of the vector space. So here are the situations where it happens for a negative definite signature, which we saw. Definite signature, which we saw two slides ago, is the case that we care about. It happens for the zero vector space, for the one-dimensional, the three-dimensional, and the seven-dimensional one. Those are the only ones where you have this relationship between the dimensions. And remember, of course, in these last cases, there are two modules. I care about the simple module. Module. So I'm not taking like a direct sum or multiple of these. But both of these, all of these modules are still supported on the same space. So it's same dimension. All right. So that means that when you get to dimension eight, your norm division algebras have to stop. So whatever the Sedanians are. So, whatever the Sedanians are, this argument shows they are not norm division outcomes. Are there any questions? Yeah. But we still didn't show that the Octonians are informed. Or well, we know they're, but we didn't relate this to the Octodians yet, I guess. Which part did we not relate to the Octonians? This M8R plus M8R? Yeah, we haven't. Yeah, we haven't. So we have related that to the Octonians here. So this is the Clifford algebra of this. This is another way of writing Cl07. So I've got a map from Cl07 into endomorphisms of octonions. That's the relationship. And it's given by octonionic multiplication. Does that answer your question? Okay, cool. Does that answer your question? Yeah, yeah. Okay, cool. Maybe following up on that, would it be an isomorphism if you add also the right multiplication? It would. Thanks for spoiling the surprise. No, that's coming later. When we talk about Octonians as spinners. But for now, we're still finishing up with. It only shows that those algebras exist, but those dimensions, right? It doesn't show that. That is correct. That is correct. That is correct. That is correct. Yes. Yes. I said, but didn't write that I was only going to show you that you have clearly the only possible dimensions are 1, 2, 4, and 8. Once you know that, then you can show that if you have a norm division algebra, then you can kind of find an imaginary unit inside of it and then take a subspace that's our thought. A subspace that's orthogonal to that imaginary unit. That's a sub-algebra. And the whole algebra turns out to be the Cayley-Dixon construction applied to the sub-algebra. So you always end up bootstrapping up from the real numbers using the Cayley-Dixon construction. And that proves that you really get exactly RCH and O. Other questions? Yeah, so I guess you know, so Yeah. So I guess you're also using the classification of Clifford modules. Yeah, I'm heavily using Wedderburn's theorem, which says that these central simple algebras, which are the types of algebras that these are, unless they're the sum of two things, then they're the sum of two central simple algebras. Their simple modules are just the. If you have a matrix algebra, then its simple module is just the vector space. Simple module is just the vector space of the coefficients. May I have one more question? And does the theorem, Hurry's theorem, holds also for terms that do not come from the inner program? Yes, it does. Yes. So you can also prove, it's just more work. So for expository purposes, I chose to leave it out. You can prove that if you just take a norm that's not from the inner product and take a norm division algebra. Take a norm division algebra with respect to that norm. Take a norm that you're not assuming comes from an inner product. Take a norm division algebra. You can prove that it comes from an inner product. Okay, so let's see how much time we have left. Organizers, how much time do I have left? Sorry, a little late. Sorry, a little late. Ten minutes fifteen? Okay. Okay. So now I want to talk about how Clifford algebras. We already saw how Clifford algebras are related to Octonians by this proof of Hurwitz's theorem. Now I want to talk about how they're related to geometry, especially to spinners. But first, I need to talk about how they're related to the geometry of rotations and reflections. And the fundamental calculation for seeing how this works is you let V be a unit vector. I guess I'm assuming that everything's positive definite here. So this really is just a norm one vector. And you compute that, you compute the conjugate. That you compute the conjugate of some other vector in the Clifford algebra by the unit vector v. And I just want to do that calculation for you. So I'm a little worried about my time so. So applying the Clifford relation, I have a V inverse there. I would like to get the V next to it. So I'd like to use the Clifford relation to change the order of V and W. And I can do that, except I get a minus sign. I'm using that second form of the Coffee relation now, where it's got V and W. And I get an inner product. So, of course, those go away. And by the way, because v is a unit vector, v squared is 1. So v inverse is v. So what do I get? I get v w v inverse equals negative w plus this. Plus this kind of projection operation, projection of w onto v and this may look more familiar if I change the signs I need to what is that operation? Operation. With the V to V minus one, potentially V minus one to V inflex, minus V influx fraction. Oh, the V which one? Did I change? Yeah, V minus one by minus V. So this is, so that's V to the, that's V inverse. And because V squared is one, it's a unit vector, V inverse is V. That's why that is like that. Like that. And this, and someone said the name of this operation. Do you want to say it again? Reflection. This is reflection. So this is reflection in the hyperplane perpendicular to the unit vector v. And that's the result of this fundamental calculation. I put a bunch of more space. I put a bunch of more space so I could like extra convince you that it was true, but considering the time, I'm just gonna leap to the result. Reflection in the hyperplane orthogonal to V is given by negative conjugates in the Clifford algebra. This doesn't really need V to be a unit vector. It also works for any non-isotropic vector. But of course, you know, it is a little. But of course, you know, it is a little weird to think of reflection in a non-positive definite circumstance. And how do these reflections then relate to the geometry of vector spaces? Well, that comes from Cartan's theorem, which says that if I have any element of SOV, then it can be decomposed into an even number of reflections. Number of reflections non-uniquely, but it can be so decomposed. And yeah, this is also true in the indefinite signature case. And why is this true? Well, I'm just going to draw this figure. So these are my two reflections. So this is reflection one and reflection two. And I'm going to. And I'm gonna reflect this guy, this figure. So, first I reflected this figure across R1, and now I'm going to reflect this figure across R2. So, I end up with that operation, and what is this? Well, this is a rotation. This is a rotation. Rotation. This is a rotation by whatever this angle is. This is a rotation by twice that angle. So pairs of reflections always give you these rotations. And that's the basic idea behind this decomposition. This fact allows us to construct the cover of the group's SOV. So I'm going to find So, I'm going to define the spin group to be the subgroup of the Clifford algebra. So, these are invertible elements in the Clifford multiplication generated by, well, I mean, it's just equal to this set, actually, but you can also think of it as generated by products of even numbers of unit vectors, where now, because of Where now, because of my indefinite signature, unit vector means plus or minus one inner product with respect to itself. And it's any number of those, as long as it's even. And given this definition, so this is some weird subgroup inside of the Clifford algebra. Given this definition, there is a two-to-one and on-to homomorphism that just takes these words and even numbers of unit vectors and spits. Vectors and spits out the composition of the corresponding reflections. And we already knew from Cartan's theorem that this is onto. Every element can be written this way, so this is onto. And it's a theorem that it's also, in fact, two to one. So at least in the positive definite case, this is the two to one, i.e., universal cover of SOB. Any questions about this? This is a really quick introduction. About this. This is a really quick introduction, but I imagine most people have some sense of spin groups in this audience. Okay. I'm hoping that most people have some sense, because now we're moving fast. So because finv is kind of twice. Because finv is kind of twice as big as SOV, it has more representations than SOV, and in particular, it has the spin representations. Those come from the fact that spin V is a subspace of the Clifford algebra. So Clifford modules give us representations of spin V. But if we want to be really precise and we want to talk about irreducible And we want to talk about irreducible representations. You need to go one step further and note that because spin v consists of products of even numbers of vectors, it's in that sub-algebra of the Clifford algebra that consists of products of even numbers of vectors, which is called the even part of the Clifford algebra. Clifford algebras are z mod 2 graded, by the way, and this is their even part. So, So, by definition, simple modules of the even part of the Clifford algebra, they're going to give representations of spin v, and those representations are called the spin representations. So what do those look like? So, here's an easy proposition that we're going to just blow through. As an algebra, the As an algebra, the even part of the Clifford algebra is another Clifford algebra. So the same classification theorem applies. In particular, it's a matrix algebra with some coefficients. And depending on that choice of coefficients, it's either like one algebra of matrices or the sum of two algebras of matrices with coefficients R, C, and H. So depending on those two different situations, you either get Different situations, you either get one module, one spin representation, or two spin representations. But sometimes, for some special dimensions, it makes more sense to think of these coefficients as being the Octonians. And we've already gotten a taste of that in our discussion of Hurwitz's theorem. Of Hurwitz's theorem. So let's get into it. So we know that the Clifford algebra that showed up in Hurwitz's theorem, the Clifford algebra of negative definite R7, that's the sum of these two matrix algebras, eight by eight matrices. And they have two modules, both defined on R8. And secretly, this R8 is the Octonians. This is the vector space of Octonians. So these are going to be our spinners. But in fact, it will turn out that the Octonians are spinners here in dimension 7. So recall that I constructed this homomorphism with left multiplication, and this worked. And this worked because of alternativity. Because of alternativity, it satisfies this Clifford relation. And as someone in the audience astutely observed, it works just as well with right multiplication. So there's also that homomorphism. And if you incorporate both of those, then you get both of those halves of the algebra Cl07. So here's a fact. So here's a fact. Cl07 is the subalgebra of endomorphisms of O plus endomorphisms of O generated by left and right multiplication respectively for all elements of the imaginary Octonians. And in turn, this implies that you can write the spin group as products of even numbers. As products of even numbers of these operators, I could have taken the left ones or the right ones in this case. They're isomorphic. And this way of writing it, this is the spin representation. It's already the spin representation. The way that this acts, this element of the spin group acts on a spinner is just the octoniotic multiplication. Multiplication for any s in the spinner representation. So in summary, in dimension seven, vectors are imaginary octonions. The spinner representation is the full space of octonions, real and imaginary. And the action of spin 7 on the spin representation. 7 on the spin representation is induced by left multiplication of octonions. That's my time. That's all the time I have for you.
