I cannot see that. Sorry, I cannot see many people. First, I would like to thank the organizers, Chelsea and Jason, for everything, organizing my teaching. You were sort of organizing. But anything really easy, you know. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, so today I'm going to talk about some open questions. Hopefully these questions of injection is still open by today. Because I did this a few days ago. Non-commutative algebra arises from many subjects like group algebra from group theory. Let me try to do this, group algebra. And universal enveloping algebra from Lie theory. Quantum group. The list here, but now I realize that this one is actually commutative. Symmetric functions. Functions. Sorry about that. But most of these are non-commutative, I believe. Non-commutative is mentioned function. But really? Ring is still non-commutative? No anymore. Okay, yeah. So, okay, alright. Great. This is a sixth also non-commutative. Alright. All right. So, as I said, I will talk about some open questions, but these are on my top list, but maybe not on your top list. Maybe your list are different, but that's okay. But I think most of these have significant consequences if questions are answered. And most of which are also related or motivated by other fields, as I listed like from group theory, Lee theory, non-commutative geometry. And some of these were proposed after 2000, although that's like 22 years ago. Okay, so are you ready? I'm ready. Let's go! So I would like to first recall a definition, the Gelfander Kurdoff dimension, because I'm going to use this as a measurement of the algebra is. But so we have a definition here. We don't need to worry about this definition. If you know the definition, that's great. If you know that they're finishing, that's great. Maybe I should give an example, which is this. If we have a commutative alpha algebra, and of course we know the crew dimension, the GK dimension is equal to the cruel dimension. Okay, so we have lots of examples. If the algebra is finite dimensional, then the chicken dimension is zero. zero and if the algebra is nice enough I don't know what the what is the definition of nice enough but just by the meaning of the words nice enough to say this is the integer but from the definition it's not clear why this should be an integer limit of some numbers First of all, it's easy to see actually that GKD mission cannot be strictly between 0 and 1. Now it's not completely trivial or not easy to see there is no GK machine between 1 and 2. But the Bogeman proved that there's no GK machine between 1 and 2. You get a machine between one and two. So that's called the Plagueman-Scat theorem. Then for any number bigger than or equal to two, there is an algebra so that you can imagine convex. But of course, when we say dimension, at least in the topological sense, we will think that this should be an integer. But in the non-commutative world, non-integer is possible. Integers possible dimension. Okay, so hopefully this gives you some idea about the GK dimension. Now, it is impossible to classify finite dimensional algebras or the GK0 algebras. This so many me. It's impossible to do that. Then we like to think about some other classification problem which is easier and also infinite, GK dimension. Now to do that, we need to add some hypotheses. Without extra hypotheses, it's impossible. Same idea, it's impossible to classify CK. We cannot do CK. We cannot do gk0, and we cannot do gk1, 2, etc. But if we add more hypotheses, it is possible. So remember that the first letter of hypotheses is h. So we'll add h there. Then, since we're going to talk about infinite dimensional algebra, infinite dimensional algebra. If an indimensional, then the GK dimension will be positive. But remember, if we go back to the previous slides, remember, there's no GK dimension between 0 and 1. So the smallest possible is it will be the 1. Then if we cannot do GK1, then in the next case, we should consider GK2 because nothing between. Because nothing between one and two. So that's the idea. Alright. Oh, sorry. Go backwards. So this H, I replace the hypothesis H by HOF. But Hof algebra is kind of extra hypothesis. So now let's consider the Hof algebra. Consider the half-algebra of GKMAG1. Then we need to add more hypotheses. That's not enough. We need to add more hypotheses. And on this page, one extra, another actual hypothesis is a regular. This means that finite global dimension. So in some way, we actually can classify half algebras, regular half-algebra. Half algebras, regular half algebras, GKD measure one. That's not true. So we can classify prime regular half algebras by GKD measure. So this was in 2007, Chen Zi Wood and Demon Lu started this program. And here is the complete list of our find. Alpha prime half algebra of GK diminishing work. So there's lots of hypotheses. Regular alpha prime half. This is a complete list. So probably we don't need to we don't want to see the details of all these algebras. For example, the last class, uh just for the definition, one page probably not enough. One page probably not enough. Lots of data meters, lots of relations, definition of co-product, definition of entripod. It's a really complicated algorithm. But we have a classification, these six classes. If you want to know the details, you can ask me after the talk. If you ask me now, I don't really know how to. If you ask me now, I don't really know how to do like number six. By the way, if you want to ask questions, please speak up or you can type us some questions and maybe the organizer can help me put your question. Okay, so you see, if we go up to GK dimension, So up to DK imaging, we can do classification with actual hypotheses. Alright, so this is a kind of the complete story about the regular alpha and prime of algebra subject in this form. Then there are lots of open questions. First, we can delete the prime. Delete the prime. If it's a regular, it's always semi-prime. So this was proved by King Brown and King Goodeve. With the PI half-algebras, there are lots of nice properties. So this is one of the nice properties of regular PI half-algebras. And in this particular setting, In this particular setting, they proved a kind of short exact sequence. The H discrete should be a finite dimensional, some kind of braided half-algebra. And the H connected should be the prime regular alpha Hoff algebra, which you can mention one. So this part is completely understood. Completely understood by now. The six classes. Then this part is still lots of open questions. We don't know how to handle this. So when you relax one of the hypotheses, then this becomes open test. And we can relax another condition. Condition, if it's not regular, but you can still require the prime. And this is again an open question. And you started this project in 2020, and this is not finished. This project is not finished. Oh, I forgot to say in this talk, mostly we are consider the case, the base view has The base view has zero characteristic, then if you debate this by this condition, then again, it's an open question. So, lots of open questions. One classification results, if you relax one other condition, you can have seven open questions. Okay. So, this is a kind of the GK1 picture. Now maybe you still remember there's no check division between 1 and 2. So when you leave 1, then you jump to 2. So for 2, can we start this project try to classify all half algebra half domains of GK dimension 2? Oh sorry, this should be the capital K. I think you understood this, right? Now here is some examples. Then here are some examples of GK2 half domains, committed ones. So we have three committed ones, then we have a group algebras, and we have developing algebras, like that. Then we're going to prove that under this extra hypothesis, then H is letting them off to These classes. Sorry, Ken. This is as it is DE. There's two more classes missing. Sorry. I forgot to have this. This is my fault. Should be more half-algebras here. I thought I kind of catched all the typos, but still there's some errors. It's all my fault. Here's some errors. It's all my fault. It's not okay. He's not complaining online. All right. Then we can also... The same here, we can relax some other hypotheses. Without this, then there's more algebras. And without the theory, yeah, without the Ethereum condition, there's more algebras. So there's lots of, if you relax one of the. Lots of if you'd like to wanna leave more seven different open questions from there. Alright. Well, then we can jump to three if we want. But there are algebra, not half, we don't know how far algebra are algebras of gk dimension between two and three. Between 2 and 3. We know that. But for half algebra, we don't know. But then there's more open questions. If you go to the high dimension, we can look at the like, if you add all these conditions, if we can classify this open question. Then if you go, you can also consider the Nicholas algebra. Lots of work in that direction, final GQ dimension problem. Imagine power. Okay. Oh, do you have any questions? Yeah. Did you ever mention this? There's a result of Agatha that isn't, doesn't she have a gap theorem for GK dimension 2? I didn't mention. Yeah, so let me mention that. So if we consider connected grid domain, so Agata proved that there is no G. Agata proved that there is no GK imaging between two and three, strictly between two and three. This is a really, very strong result. So now if we just consider kinetic gradient algebra, there's a lot of dehydration between two things. Yes, I guess uh I will mention that uh there exists things, but yes. So I forgot to mention that I got series out, but To mention like ISB, but great. Alright. Anyway, why we want to do the classification result, our classification problem, it's always fun to discover some new algebras. And it will, well, usually they will help us to understand the structure of this class of algebras. And sometimes when we try to classify, When we try to classify, we want to introduce new invariants. This is usually the classification problem. If you want to classify, you will say, okay, this is that kind of invariant to classify these algebras. Then, sometimes you will suggest new research direction and also some new construction of algebra. It's always fun to do the classification, however. Okay, so now I want to mention the algebra the j dimension bigger than if the two case. This is a very strong result proof near 2,000, one less than 2,000. So there are connected gradient alpha algebra of secret dimension R for any object that is equal to 2. But 2.7, right? 2.7. Right, 2.7. So there is a connected graded algebra of GK dimension 2.7. But even stronger, I mean, a lot of work already before this to construct algebras of GK, non-integer, GK dimensions. Then it's, for me, the surprising part is that this algebra can be prime. Prime already very strong condition, primitive and then just infinite. Just infinite means that any non-zero ideal is co-final dimension. All the classical, like classical cruel dimension is one. Is it one? A zero? One. So this is for all for any associative algebra, the first Of algebra, the first sentence. Then, let me repeat Agana's result again. If we have a connected graded domain, then the GK dimension cannot be between 2 and 3. So, if you add some extra hypotheses, you can improve the result. Right. Now for half algebra, remember H is actual hypothesis. So you can add your own hypothesis. So the hypothesis here is Half algebra. For Half algebra, then you cannot have non-integer size. If the Half algebra is kinetic gradient, then the G division is always integer. There's no Half algebra. What I'm saying. So if R is not integer, there's no half algebra GK dimension R. This means that every connected graded half algebra, any connected gradient algebra which has half algebra structure, then the GKD imaging is always integer. This is also quite a strong result. Just to compare the first line and the second line, first line said for First line said for any R, non-integer, you can always construct an algebra as the GK dimension R, which the algebra also is prime primitive, just influence. But for half algebra, you cannot do that. Then several people, friends, they asked if this is possible for alpha and half algebra. Half algebra removing this connected graded hypothesis. Now, the half is just some hypotheses, right? We can replace this hypothesis by another one, different one like this theory. I don't know if he's maybe this is already solved. It's hopeful. Yeah. He's solving it right now. Right now. Yeah, so maybe like after a few hours, this is a yeah, so this is a we don't know between two and three. Okay, so let me automate a few other results in this direction. One is that by Doguin Song and Demingo Sheng and Tai. They prove that a connected grade is half of algebra finite GK dimension. Here there's some other hypotheses I kind of omitted. Then H must be an iterative of all extension, meaning that as algebra in this form, I really like this result. I really like this result because you know how can you prove abstractly some algebraic iterating our extension? So this results that if you add enough hypotheses, just say half. Now you can prove that. Then the GK dimension, I mean as you see the GK dimension is a measurement for the size of the algebra. The size of the algebra. Then there's another invariant called the growth function. And adjacent, well, Ephim Zamunov gave a very nice paper about the growth function. You kind of characterize all the possible growth functions for algebra. So I don't know if if the this number nine is interesting or not, but how far you have maybe you already have answered. Maybe you already have an answer to developing entropy. So already in a smaller class, this is sort of lots of interesting questions, open questions in this direction. Okay. Right. So, continuing. So, continue the Half-algebra, but as I said, you can replace this by another hypothesis if you want. We can talk about some homological properties. And Brown-Goodel conjecture is the following. If H is alpha alpha in the theory half algebra, then they conjecture the injective dimension of the algebra as a left module or right module is finite. Finite. Very strong result if it's true. So obviously, this is related to homological algebra. And I didn't mention why this is important, but the consequence of this is, there are lots of consequences if this is true. So this is related to the ring theoretic properties of half-algebras and the structure of inker dimension of half-algebra. Dimensional half-alg. And so let me tell you some cases. This is true. If it's finite dimensional, this just means that H is for mediums. This is a really classical result. Then the PI case is true. Quantum group is true. Kinetic gradient case is also true. And basically this conjecture was... This conjecture was verified for all known classes of half-algebras, modular, some other, I say, unrelated conjectures in half-algebras. I don't know if Cambridge or Kenny Mars are on the audience. Yeah, he's here. Hopefully, this is true my statement. No complaint. If there's any errors, it's my error. Any errors? It's my error. Yeah, I mean, no errors expect to observe that not just on this slide, but on many slides, you're exercising a version of cancel culture by removing your own name from everybody. Okay, but thank you, thank you, Kenny. Just a a a couple of places. Not many. A couple of places. Very many. Very many. Thank you, Kenny. Right. So yeah, I think half algebra is really a fun topic. But remember, half is just But remember, coffee is just one hypothesis. You can replace this by other one. Very interesting topic. Okay, so maybe we should move on. Any questions? Okay. Now, the Brown Good conjecture can be made in a slightly stronger way. In a slightly stronger version. Remember the original one. Let me show you the original one. Here, it said injective dimension of the H as a left or right module as finite. Injecting is finite. Then you can ask actually if the half-algebra is Arteague Legornstein or Arsenal-Gornstein. Both of these are strong. Both of these are stronger than just finite injective image. And Godot K-Bar, they prove that for all the cases, we know these two conditionings are satisfied. So you can actually make a stronger conjecture. Now, this is the same idea. Remember the age. Remember that the age, the half year is just one age. We can replace one age by another age. Replace half by weak half or quarter half. We can ask the same question. Right? And then Rogowski and Dan Rogowski and Robert Wegg, they prove that the con the brown middle conjecture holds if you can you replace H by weak H or poly H. H by weak H or hard H. Suppose H is finely modulable but center. So basically one conjecture can generate seven, seven more different conjectures. Then there's also a version in terms of the tensor category. Yeah, you can make lots of conjectures. Wait, so where is this circle? I mean. I mean, starting from a tensor category, you can conjecture that the projection module has finite injective images, something like that. It's kind of similar to that. Okay. So, more conjectures. So here's a question mark. I just don't know which year I know who to contribute. But that's just called this I think of oxy conjecture. This is in the paper 2004, I believe. So that's the question is that if we have a finite tensor category, this is the finite category generated. This is the universe of this tensor category. So go back to the Hof algebra, it's equivalent to the above. It's equivalent to the above. And obviously, this relates to the testing category and the support variety theory like former spectrum and the homologic algebra, complexity in the reputation theory, lots of connections. And many people work on this. I just give you really a partial list of results. Of results. Probably only a list, like five percent of the, maybe less than that. The too many people describe you. Maybe Chris Negron will talk about some of his results, possibly. Maybe wrong about this. But he's giving a thought. But he's even at home. Yeah, wait today. Yeah, today he will talk about this. Yes, yes. Okay, so yeah, so if you have any questions, ask him. Also, there's several people here. Ne and Qing Ting and yeah, so if you question, ask them they're they're experts on this. Yeah, they're experts on this. Okay. So now I need to introduce another technical term. The first one was a GK damage. So you remember GK damaging, right? The second one is called the Arting Shutter Regularity, Gold Skin Condition. In the same way, if you know the definition and you know the definition, if you don't know, you can just read it. You will understand this quickly. But let me just tell you one of the line here. So A is connected, where is that? A is connected-graded algebra. And we have here we have final global dimension with final. Here we will find a global dimension, we find a GK dimension that is close to being the AS regular. There's some extra conditions here. We have a B and a C, these extra conditions, involving the X groups. But the main condition is that the D, they have to find that global dimension. The global dimension, the E, the final GK dimension. Now Dave Rogowski and Suziera said that if we only have D and E, we may not have B and a C. So it's not enough to have just a D and E. For altitude regular, we need a D E and that plus or B. And that positive B C. Is that right there? Well, I mean, we gave an Ethereum example, right? So. Oh, beyond Ethereum, it's easy. Right, yes, yes. So it's even better, you know, just using Ethereum. Okay. So we're going to talk about this algebra a lot for the rest of my talk. Rest of my talk. So the first example is just a commutative polynomial. And then we have a skewed polynomial, a quantized version of polynomial. Then Arjun Sharter studied the classification, then finished by Arjun Teter Vandenberg for the classification of global derivation or less than equal to three. equal to 3 if the algebra is generating degree 1. Then Derrick Stevenson, I should also add that Derrick Stevenson did the case if the algebra is not generating our work. Okay. And there are lots of algebras. So which algebra I mentioned? In the in the first half of my talk, the half algebras The half algebras of finite GK dimension, half algebra with which is connected graded, if we have a finite GK dimension, then automatically it's AS regular. So lots of other examples, connected hardware. Alright, so we have some idea, right? So for random beer, skill for anomaly, these are the SRA algorithms. Then I want to... Then I want to, this is still the introduction, I want to say the half algebra, how half algebra can act on the AS regular algebra. So yeah, so we need to assume A is the regular, then half algebra is funny dimension is very simple. Then the H actions interface for to start with. Then basically if we have an interface for phase for group action, there will be an interface for half algebra. Did I give all the some examples of half algebras? I think so. Group algebra, evolving algebra, must be named. Then in this setting, we can define so-called homological determinant, which is a map from how far to the trivial. Half-alge to the trivial module or the the field. Then we say trivial homologues determine if this is the co-unit. Hopefully this will be enough to state some of the conjecture. Oh, sorry, not yet. So then we can define so-called Alzheimer map from the smash product to the home. to the home algebra, sending A to the left multiplication by A, sending H by this, the H action. So in general, the theta is not injective or not surjective. I feel that I I need to explain this smash product, but I I don't have time. I don't have time. How to say, if we were a group action, it's a scoop of group out. Maybe that's one line explanation. So in general, it's not ejective without selecting. Then here is a conjecture. So it says that if H, X, R, A interface for a with trivial homological With trivial homological determinant, and then this map introduced its isomorphism. This was, I guess, probably first by K Chelsea in maybe before that 2017 paper, something. Then also made uh the conjugacy was made in the paper like Made in the paper back in 2018 that several people work on this. Still open. Maybe you know if it's, I think it's still. Yeah, it's open. Open. Still. Open question. Right, right. Um so this is obviously uh uh in the topic of non-computing theory. Non-cumbitive event theory, also non-cumbitive geometry that relates to the common colour representation theory of singularity. Then maybe let me remind you what is this SATA. Again, it is wrong direction. SEDA is from the smash product to this home. So okay. Okay, now why is it called the Alsenada isomorphism map? Because this originally was proved by Alsenada in 1962 for polynomial ring or for the local case, local regular case. Then in well I I listed like two thousand eight, maybe this is the wrong year, maybe per before that, Kennis, I don't know. Kennis and Chelsea, they prove that for global dimension 2, A is global dimension 2 case. This conjecture codes. So maybe this suggests that let's do 3 or 4. Lots of open questions. Then there's some special cases, like for dark algebra. Again, this is an in-competitive list. Um, several people are here. People are here. I don't know if Jason can see. So, if I made some errors, so please forgive me. But the big one is C. Maybe I should add one or two places somewhere. This is my friend. It's not me. This year, this is a new paper, I don't know if it's published or not. If A is PI, H is either a group algebra or the dual group, and there's a conjecture holes. So this is very encouraging because it's kind of a general statement for the PI. It's kind of encouraging for the For the results. I'm not sure if the papers accept it or not, but I like it. Okay, so this gave us some idea. The good thing is that many people here work on this, so I don't need to say more about this. You understand this, right? Oops. Oh. Oh, hello, Omar. I'm like a kind of interesting name. Oh, thank you, Tressie. So I have ten minutes left. Oh, uh, it's probably working then? No, that's not working. Click it back on this. I didn't get to click yeah, click back on the slide it will it's like lost focus sorry it's okay that this end here we go okay a view Okay. Thank you. So we can keep we continue there. All right. Wait. Yeah, so there's more classification problems related to the hop action. So for example, if we start with For example, if you start with a tough algebra, can you work out all AS regular algebras so that you can act on that? Right? Or we are giving AS regular algebra. Can you classify all of any dimensions of algebra? H can act on that. But these are kind of from two different aspects: fixed H or fixed A. So let's maybe move on. So this is another question related to the AS regular algebra. So let's start with A to be a PIAS regular algebra. Let OZA be the group of all automorphisms that fix the center. Fix the elements in the center. We fix the elements in the center. Okay. There are some basic properties where we can prove that here is three of them. One is that this group is always finite. Kind of interesting. A second, this other group divides the The rank of A over the center. Rank of A over center is always finite by a result of Toby Stafford. Then third property is that if A is generating degree 1, I suppose, then A is good polynomial ring under the setting in the PI setting. The PI setting, if and only if two conditions. First, the olden group is abelian, then the olden group. Oh, another typo. Sorry. I found more. Yeah, equal. This is equal. I saw that I fixed all the types, but I found several today. So this is equal. The second getting this will equal to that. So kind of reach way over. kind of reach where the Oden group reaches the maximum possible, then the algebra becomes a skewed polynomial. It's a kind of weird property. I mean how can you improve something in a skewed polynomial in general, right? Without making the generated relation. If it all doesn't reach the maximum, then you get screenplay. Alright, so then Alright, so then one open question is that is this always a bini fruit? I hope this is the open Jason. Alright. So maybe I should also mention that if A is done for algebra, this is always like B. There's some evidence. There's like one or two small evidence for this. Small evidence for this. But where did the name come from? Jason. You told us because it seems to be up in the air somewhere. That's one good reason. But yeah, maybe that's the reason. But if But if you think this is okay? I'll just comment. The only example we have of question 10 where it fails is when A is non-connected. For all connected algebra, as far as we can tell, it's equal. Right, so maybe this is true, even delete some of the diagnostics possibly. Possibly. Yeah, so if A is not connected, then there's some complimentary. Are you assuming it's graded? Yeah, and graded. Yeah. Locally finite. Some other conditions. So this is Arding's conjecture. This is a very famous conjecture. Many, many people work on this conjecture. And then many, many people would like to solve this conjecture. So let me kind of state this. K be algebraically closed field of characteristics zero and then every finite division algebra of change degree two. Division of Joe Chinese degree two is one of the following cases. Hopefully, I listed all I made a few mistakes in this talk. So, one is a PI case as finite over center. Then there's a Q rational division rings, the Q division and the scaling algebra and the wow skill field. Then there's a Q root division algebra. Division algebras, get attributed case corresponding to these rule surfaces, our extension type, then branch operate type. So my colleagues said this is a complete list. Oh, look, maybe you know more than I do about in this topic. It just topic from me. Still boom? Yeah. Yeah, so still, so many people work on this, but I feel people are still working on this. I don't... There are lots of very strong results, but towards this goal is quite still quite quite far off. Still quite quite far. Do you think this is true? Can you have Jason? Oh, I don't know. Jason and I were talking about this one. Yeah, Jason. Yes. I don't think it's true. You don't think it's true, no? I think it's true. Because we cannot want a country example. Right. Are the slides showing? Alright, good timing. So yeah, so you can, there's more open questions. Thank you very much. Any questions? Let me see your last slide. Let me see your last slide. Yeah, I like this. It takes me McGrath comes out here. Can you give a talk there? I forgot. Is this one still open? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, if you have any questions about the kind of narrative. You can ask a kangaroo. Yeah, and half-hour extensions, several people work on this. Handy, if you have any questions, you can ask Handy. Other questions, cancellation. Lots of questions. Many questions about today. Are there other questions? Cluding from online? Looking from online? So in your original list you had a bunch of offerad questions. I want to give you s some reason why you think those are interesting questions. Offerad, yeah. So I forgot what the... So there is a kind of GK imaging question for operator. Like how to construct opera using the first year algebra. Algebra are constructing well upright. Yeah. So in this direction, there's some questions about a finitely generated series that satisfies linear potential equation or something. Yes, yeah, right. Uh and this direction is um if I get through your upgrade, the GK upgrade is like something between one and two. That's in between one and two. Oh, I think because we proved this, yeah, we proved the gap theory, so I can remove the non-utissure for finally general. Any number bigger than two, yes. Even if you assume it's finitely generated or something? Finally, generated but pretty finite together. Any questions either from here or online? Okay, not. Back to you had a slide with the hop algebra, minor dimensional hop algebras that you're planning with any X's, I think it was. Please stop me, which said I it was way further back. Yeah, that number. Sorry, one one target. One turbo, one further, the next one? This one. No, it's the other way. Other way. Yeah, I just didn't catch the category in the second conjugate. Gotcha. Okay. Thanks. Any other questions, people online, too, if you have any questions? I don't know if you want to. I don't know if you want to breathe in the chat or raise your hand or not see anything, anyways. Well, let's thank James again. And we'll resume in eight minutes. Oh, yes, thank you.
