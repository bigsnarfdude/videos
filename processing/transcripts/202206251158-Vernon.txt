Four years ago, right, Charlotte? That wasn't that what the whole thing was, and here I am virtually there again. So most of you know that I've been a co-conspirator with the multi-taper analysis for a long time, going all the way back to papers even with Jeff, which is really only 40 years ago or so or more. So, and it all And it all was based on Dave Thompson's visit to UCSD and Scripps in 1983. So, but today I'm going to talk about, let me just post this thing up there so you can see, share, and then we go to there and we go to play. Can everybody see that? Okay, good. So, um, So this is based on work about some analysis of instrumentation, which was to start understanding for a deployment up in Alaska that we just finished, long-term deployment for US array. But this also led into some interesting directions as far as what the science is and what our understanding of kind of seismic noise processes are. So, my Processes are. So, my co-conspirators on this research have been Dave Thompson, who's obviously in Queens, and Lei Quinn, who was at USC, and now she's at China University of Geosciences. Basically, in the background, say we're motivated by the USARA Alaska deployment. We use Pinion Flat and PFO, Pinion Flat Observatory as a test bed. You're going to look at a lot of the spectrum coherences between. Coherences between noise and signals observed at this observatory. Look at some event data and then the impact of atmospheric and oceanic signals on these data and how they some of the implications and directions we might go in the future. So for those of you who are not card-carrying seismologists, the transportable array deployed some order 200 plus sensors. 100-plus sensors in Alaska and in western, northwestern Canada to make an observations and array of measurements for it was slated for about three years, but thanks to COVID, it got extended to about six years of actual deployment time because people were not allowed to go to the field to yank the instruments out of the ground. Now, one of the issues in deployment up here is that it's very challenging to get to the site. It's very challenging to get to the sites, and they're in very remote areas. So, that pretty much you could drive to about a few dozen of these sites, but most of them had to helicopter in. So, we had to completely renovate and redesign the deployment process for all these stations. So, we came up with a post-hole arrangement to put them all in, which was different than what we used. Them all in, which was different than what we use in the lower 48. So the first thing that we wanted to do is test all these instruments in a close environment using Pinion Flat Observatory to see how well characterized the signals were and if there was any potential problems we might do before we started deployment. We have since left that whole deployment in place as a seismic array for multiple other uses. So to give you an idea of what the So, to give you an idea of what the site is like, Pinion Flat sits here in Southern California. It's basically a one-kilometer aperture array. We have laser strain meters, which have resolution of one part and 10 to the 10th or something like that in place. But what we're concerned about is these symbols here that show the deployment of where we have type. Of where we have types of sensors or broadband sensors in place. The different symbol colors are whether solid or empty gives you two different types of broadband sensors, but they have effectively the same response. We're not going to go into that. The triangles just give you the, and the circles, triangles, and pentagles, they give you these list of where the sensors. The sensors are what rings are in. And then here's a picture of the laser strain meter, which is on site. Here's a picture of actually the seismic deployment, which we use. So we basically have a post hole, which is sitting over here in the shadow, hard to see, electronics, solar panel telemetry. And then also co-located in this square, we also had a ring laser gyro in place so we could compare rotation. So we could compare rotations as well as the strains using aerial strain and aerial rotations, but we're not gonna focus on that today. So this gives you another view of this. So there's the inner ring, which is about a 90 meter aperture, 65 meter minimum spacing. We have a 500 meter aperture ring, and then we had a seven or a one kilometer aperture spacing. Now the unit. Spacing. Now, you'll notice the second one isn't, the outer one is not centered right here on the seismic, on the seismic test facility, whereas these other two rings are. Well, this is just a property, and this is a matter of property ownership that UCSD didn't own the land up in here. So, and I didn't want to bootleg it for a permanent installment off the U.S. Forest Service land. They tend to frown upon things like that. So. So this is a one of the attributes of Pinion Flat Observatory is that it has a global seismic network station. So the global seismic network, we're doing a comparison of these post holes, this new deployment process, and compared to one of the quietest global seismic network stations out there. I mean, the Ida PFO station is clearly in the 90th. Is clearly in the 90th percentile and quality of when you look at noise characteristics. And so we're looking here on the left, we're looking at a year's worth of data. We're looking at the distribution on the vertical component of the spectrum from we're looking in seconds in these particular plots. And so you have what I consider, you know, the higher frequencies going to lower frequencies, you have the microseism peak here, the primary or secondary microseism peak, the primary and the microseism peak. Peak, the primary microseism peak, and then you drop down to the quiet part of the seismic spectrum. And we're going to be looking a lot in this attributes and looking in various views of this part of the spectrum. So we co-located these instruments at the same place. I'm going to say this is the aggregation of seven of the stations, all of the same sensor type. And you say you see the similar performance on the lone. See, there's similar performance on the low noise characteristics between the postal and the standard traditional STS-1 deployment at Pinion Flat. If you look at the, you have an improved, if you look at the horizontal components, though, you see there's actually our post hole, which is a much cheaper, more efficient method of deployment, is actually performs significantly better, you know, maybe 510 dB better than the standard. Better than the standard GSN STS-1 deployment. And I was actually pretty surprised at that because all these things, these postals only went in for about only went about two, three meters into the ground. And so there was not a big vault or anything associated with it. So starting to look at the from the spectral viewpoint, just looking at two of the sites, two of the inner ring sites. Two of the inner ring sites, BPH01 and O2, 65-meter separation. We're sampling at 200 samples a second. We're using 600-second windows and using 600-second offsets and 140 windows with 10 tapers and a time bandwidth product of six. So you can see that the low frequencies, now we flip back. So we're actually using in frequency, which is my preferred way of looking at it. So we're looking at the micro seismic peak, the secondary. Peak, the secondary, the primary, and then the low noise part of the spectrum at the high frequency section, it falls off even more. It's not at the 10 to 100 hertz band at 65 meter spacing. It's not surprising that there's some difference here. It's good to see that these instruments basically lie on top of each other for the rest of the spectrum. And when you look at the coherence between the two stations, you notice that you have this. Notice that you have this high frequency at the microseism peaks. You have very high coherence, drops off going at higher frequency, going away. But when Dave, Lay, and I started looking at this, I was completely stunned about this part of the spectrum, that there was no coherence from basically 0.1 hertz and down lower. And the reason why I'm stunned is that most of you who I'm stunned is that most of you who think about who deal with seismology wouldn't shouldn't be too surprised is that you look at the wavelengths of data of signals that come in these frequency bands. But when you're looking at a tenth of a second, usually the wavelengths are on the order of tens of kilometers or even more. And it's very hard for me to understand with 65 meter separation why these things are incoherent. Why these things are incoherent over things that have geophysical wavelengths, seismic wavelengths that are much, much larger than. Even if it was a kilometer, you would expect it to be the same. So something clearly, so either there's a instrumentation problem, which is one thing that needs to be examined, or we have a geophysical phenomenon which we need to understand. So something, this was the first clue that led us down a different First clue that led us down a different direction than just comparing instruments. So if you look at the comparison of the vertical component, which is H H Z and the black one, compared to the horizontal component, which is in the blue, we see very similar characteristics, but even a bigger gap in the lack of coherence. In the vertical, you have some level. The vertical, you have some level of coherence. It's not uniform, but it's not zero. But down here, you're fast approaching zero. So, and the horizontal components is actually worse. Looking at the difference in distances, we're looking at the vertical components and the horizontal components, but in this comparison, we're looking at this figure compares to 65-meter close separation. Meter, close separation, this is the first level. And then when we go out to look at the 870-meter distances, again, we see not surprisingly, the high frequencies drop off more rapidly than the low frequencies on the horizontals don't change, but on the vertical, you lose more coherence as you go to the longer distances. So part of this makes sense out on the high frequency side. The low frequency side still is not. The low frequency side still is not making a lot of sense from a geophysical perspective. So, one of the joys of looking at multi-tapers and doing all these different things, we use spectrograms. We use a thing called what we call a coheregram here, where we're looking at coherence as a function of time and looking at a function of frequency here and a function of time in this direction and color. function of time in this direction and color gives you the level of coherence and this is basically a one-day view this is the same one looking at this is the same we're going to take this cohirogram here and look at it across the vertical component and the horizontal component and here are the time series across the top for a day one day view you can look at the time the spectrograms across the bottom here across the bottom here and you can see the cohereogram which has a lot of structure in it over over a 24-hour period which is actually quite interesting why would that change a lot when you're looking at just basically noise so what are we missing so one of the attributes you can look in here i've plotted the raw unfiltered time series up on the top but if you actually dive into this thing there's this coherent signal at low and the low frequency from the 0.1 hertz to uh 0.1 hertz to 0.01 hertz. And it turns out there's a teleseismic signal in there. And so that would make sense. That occurs, and you see it both on the vertical and the horizontal components. Here, if you dive in, these signals turn out to be local earthquakes that are showing up. So we've got ourselves some nominal form of detector if we haven't sensors co-located together, then we can notice this type of thing. So you can, it does highlight the He does highlight the local earthquakes. And then we have here, we have, I wanted to, I think, did I do that? Okay, so one of the questions that came up is like, okay, why do we have these long, that hole in the spectrum? Is that really an instrumental problem or not? So what I've done here is plot three different earthquakes of different teleseismic events. Of different teleseismic events. So, events that occur thousands of kilometers away, they tend to accentuate the low frequency part of the spectrum. Each one of these plots has a vertical, as a time series plot across here for different coherences for the different events, different parts of the spectrum. So, the black is the whole time series, the blue is the surface wave. Is the surface wave? The green is, I believe, the pre no black is pre-event noise, green is the whole spectrum, red is the body waves, and blue is the surface waves. So that's the spectral content of each one of those segments. And when you plot the earthquake itself across the whole network, you find that there's uniform coherence, like I would hope there would be, all the way out to All the way out to a millihertz and up to about a hertz, where things start falling apart from the more local structure. You see that on the two outer earthquakes and two outer teleseisms, but less so something goes wrong here in the middle teleseism. But the clue, what you see right here, is because these are plotted on different amplitude scales for the spectrum. And if you actually look at the counts, it's easy. And if you actually look at the counts, it's easiest to see in the counts. Here you've got 300,000 counts peak to peak on the on this, on the first earthquake, 400,000 counts peak to peak on the on the right-hand event, and the middle one is about 60,000. So you have a much lower amplitude. So we're starting to mix this problem with the seismic noise as well as, which you can see more strongly here anyway, with the double seismic earthquake. With the teleseismic earthquakes, I think, but at least this is gives an indication that the sensors themselves are actually working properly and that we are coherent out there like we would expect. Looking some of the things that we continue doing out there, another thing that might be an artifact to investigate is the geological side of things. This in the background here is a Google Earth view of the whole region, the pinion flat. Region. The Pinan Flat PY array is on this flat area right here. One of the areas, those of you who know me, spent a lot of my career looking at the San Jose Fault Zone, which runs right here. And we've been running some linear arrays across the fault in five different places here, Buck Ridge, Ramona, Sagebrush Flats, Drywash, and Jackass Flats. And here's the number of sensors in the array. Here's the Ramona. Ray, here's the Ramona, here's sagebrush, here's dry wash, and here's jackass. And so we have similar station spacings in here to what we have in here. So we can do a comparison of what's going on inside the fault zone. And what's interesting to see in this one is like here you have the PY 65 meter spacing nominal, and that's the blue coherence across just using noise again. Jackass Flat is green. Flat is green, that's pretty good, but the high frequency rolls off much at about five hertz. And every single array outside of Pinion rolls off about five, well, actually, one, two, so three hertz out there. And what's really different is that each one of these things was sighted directly across the fault. You can see the line across here, which is the surface trace of the fault, the surface trace of the fault. So we're actually looking. Surface trace of the fault. So we're actually looking at the fault zone damage zone, and we can actually start looking at the structure, internal structure of the fault, which in ways that we could never look at before. So it's very clear that's what's going on out here. It turns out what happens on this side of it is actually a deployment thing. This signal here is that these are the best possible deployments of the post holes. These are surface broadband instruments, so they Surface broadband instruments, so they are less well coupled to the earth. And these are actually different type sensors or one hertz sensors, so they just lose the coherence because they don't have the response. And these are strong motion sensors, which really don't have the response in those areas. But you can start seeing lots of different artifacts in there. Looking at the median coherences, I mean, you see these things don't change a lot. These things don't change a lot as a function of time. We have a three-year median coherence, but we did notice earlier that there are temporal changes in these data. So, we want to look at some of those things. Taking this information, transforming it into the coherence view of it where you have time and year, you know, 2015, 2016, 2017, and across the bottom, a three-year span. We're looking at frequency going. We're looking at frequency going from millihertz up to a hertz on the vertical axis. We have the east-west component, north-south component, vertical component here. And then the colors give the degree of coherence. So what you notice is that the microseism band from basically 0.1 hertz up to a hertz is very coherent on all three components. The 40-second to 300-second band is very incoherent. And beyond 300 seconds, the horizontally or horizontal components are partially coherent, and beyond 300 seconds, the verticals are quite coherent. So this gives you some temporal sense on a long-term scale. So we're going to start looking at one of the ways that, I mean, Dave and some of you other people here, you know, go to higher order mathematics and do much more different ways. And do much more different ways. I usually attack it from a different direction and I put different types of census on to see if I can understand what other phenomena might be joining us. So, the critical thing here: this is what the Alaska deployment pattern is. We have a post hole here, two to three meters. The sensor coupled in with sand and inside the post hole to some external electronics. But we also put a meteorological sensor up here, and we have so we can. Sensor up here, and we have so we can start making pressure variations and looking at different types of sensors there. So, we have atmospheric pressure sensors that started in 2010 in the US array. They were originally put in to look at thunderstorms, storm fronts, derechos, and also observed tornadoes had significant impacts on the seismic data when we work in the lower 48. Thankfully, we don't have derechos and tornadoes at pinion, but we certainly have thunderstorms and storm fronts rolling. Thunderstorms and storm fronts rolling through in various times of the year. And here is the basically the spectra looking at from Pinion and okay, here's what the spectral characteristics are of the pressure sensor, of a microbarometer, plus the seismic sensors here. Looking at the coherence between stations, nearby stations, you see there is some coherence on the On the pressure sensors at very low frequencies, but not at higher frequencies. We see this: this is the characteristics of the vertical component on the broadband and the two horizontal components. So this is basically the same type of information we showed before. And if you look at actually the data itself, here's some examples of the waveforms that we're looking at across narrowband filter from 0.01 to 0.01. From 0.01 to 0.05 hertz in this band for station 01, station 03, same type thing. And then looking at from 0.05 to 1 hertz and 1 to 8 hertz gives you some sort of characteristics of the variability, some of the things we've seen in the spectra, some of these things we've seen in the coherence already. So looking at the coherence between the atmospheric pressure and the seismic noise, so here we have, this is a question. Here we have this is a question of okay. Now we have an atmospheric sensor right on top of the seismic sensors that's buried two meters into the ground. So we can see that there actually is some significant coherence up to about 0.1 hertz between the pressure sensor and the three components of the seismic thing. And it's two different stations, basically 100 meters apart. So similar characteristics. Looking at the Looking at the coherence between the barometers between six stations pairs, we see that at 90 meters is pretty coherent at the close ranges like we just saw before, but you get out to 800 meter range. It's less so. You do get some times when there's coherence and yet other times that they're not. But there is some characteristics of the structure here which are interesting. So at the low So at the low, then we start comparing the coherence between the pressure sensor and the seismic sensor. You see there's low coherence from one second to over a thousand seconds out here on the vertical. On the horizontals, you get more coherence in this 30 second to a thousand second, and it varies as a function of time of year. Suspiciously, winter, spring, winter, spring, it's a Spring, winter, spring, that's something that shows up. And so, taking this thing into a three-year thing, we're looking at this. Let's see what's the right way to say that. So, we're looking at this is the band which you get highest, 95% coherence between the various pairs of instruments and between the BHE components. And what you see is that that gets narrower. That gets narrower, that the lowest frequency of the coherent 95% coherence rises for parts of the year and falls in parts of the year. And the similar characteristic at the high end. So this band, this green band, varies as a function of time over the year. So we're going to look at just the low frequency coherence 95% bound, and you'll see that it changes a fair amount on a Changes a fair amount on a fairly consistent basis over a three-year period over the same window of time. Now, what we also notice in here, these are the two pairs at 65 meters, 300 meters, 700 meters, 800 meters, 850 meters. So this works across the whole array for all experiments. One of the things that we're going to bring in, you know, we've looked at We're going to bring in, you know, we looked at the pressure data right on the site. Another signal source that we have is the ocean nearby because Pinion Flat sits right up here. And we have this buoy out here, which we can measure temperature, wind, wave height type thing, and look at significant wave heights. So when you actually look at even in a one-day period, you can see that the signal in the cohereogram changes around, it's less coherent, less gets much more coherent at this second half of the day. This second half of the day, you look in the time series, you don't see anything that's truly obvious. You look in the spectrograms, you see this nice, interesting phenomenon of a dispersive waveform changing across the whole period of the day with the highest frequencies coming in at the microseism peak. But you also, when you figure this out and pull in the data from the wave buoy heights, this turns out where this corresponds to this and also this. And also, this lowering of the spectrogram correlates with the wave heights out at sea, which offshore from San Diego. So if you look at the seasonal temperature and the ocean swell, you can look at, okay, here's the coherence as a function of time, the bottom level, this blue thing here, this blue line here is basically this blown up. You see the temperature. Up. You see the temperature as measured on site as a function of average temperature on daily temperatures over the year. And you look at the wave heights, and you notice that in the points where these have these lower, more wider band of coherence, this thing dropping is when we have the higher wave heights in the winter months. And the low, higher, this thing where it goes higher and we have narrower band. And we have narrower banded coherences. We have low wave heights out in the nearby, near offshore region in Southern California. So it's an accident, it's a kind of an interesting, you know, these are very kind of diagnostic to where we're trying to go. I mean, there's some of there's a lot more work that needs to be done on this. And that's pretty much where I've gotten to so far. And so it was just kind of summarizing the postal was. Summarizing the postal deployment provides consistent high-quality data, which was a choice. I mean, something we wanted to find out. It's one of the probably one of the best seismic arrays in the world. That's above ground or on the surface. All the ray elements have the same orientation, have highly coherent ground noise in the microseism band. Earthquake signals do show high coherence across the much wider bandwidth, depending on the event and how much what the earthquake signal size is. Earthquake signal size is, signal to noise is. Outside the micro seismic band, the coherence of the ground noise drops off significantly as a function of distance. And the low frequency incoherence between the seismic sensors seems to be caused by a local atmospheric disturbance. I didn't go into all that for you. There's a lot more work that needs to be done. We need to put more sensors out there for that. And one more thing that's actually an opportunity out there is that at the start of COVID, they At the start of COVID, there were three broadband boreholes instruments, basically the same configuration that we're using on these postal ones at the service that are two meters down. We have now have three of them at 100 meters depth. And so the next step is to see how coherent the low frequencies are for those things, because I suspect if we're really seeing turbulence on the surface, that's Turbulence on the surface, that's going to average out. And we'll get much more, we'll be probably much closer to seeing real, true Earth ground noise at depth if we get the high coherence I would expect to see. So I'll leave it there and open it to questions.
