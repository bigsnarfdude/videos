Wonderful control. Thank you so much. So, and I'm also going to go three minutes over time, so I apologize in advance. So, first I want to. There was a question that Iber Bourbon asked us, and that is the motivation for what I want to talk about. And then I just want to be. And then I just want to give a framework that allows us to solve Bourbon's question and all bunch of other problems that I want to answer what? So where one's question forces me to take you. Take you a little bit out of your comfort zone. But I'm going to yesterday talk about toropics. So you'll see the birth of toropics. So I will talk about African cats and reactors. This is a very important class of multi-dimensional reactors. And they are And they were defined by generating some relations. And when you do that, you have no idea what the algebras look like. So I want to, so this was independently done by Katz and Moody. What these algebras look like. So you start with a semi-simple, finite dimensional complex realgebra. Of complexity algebra will fix a group of units if we have this ring extension, this kavo, with no set. And then what you do is you take gj to be, I will tell you what sigma is. So sigma here So sigma here is an outer morphist of G of order or period n. And then what you do is take GJ and you tensor with TJ divided by n. So this is a vector space over C. And then you add all these things. So this lives inside and it's very easy to see that this is a compressory algebra which is called the loop algebra and Berlin's question is the following. So The following. So I'm going to. So what he does is he uses the algebra over R, which is as a model finite project of finite type. And you make the assumption That set here is a non-zero complex number. So when you specialize T to a non-zero complex number, you see what happens here is you get G. So he assumes that this is actually G. So he has the algebra over R with this property, which is a property that the Which is a property that the loop algebra have. And the question is: is it true that implies that L prime is a loop function? Okay, so there are many ways to skin a cat, and so I'm going to show you. One of them. So we have something going for us, and it is the following. So that if you look at LG sigma, this is a key observation. This is a complex Lie algebra. It's not a Lie algebra over Rn. But if you multiply by T, what you're doing, you're replacing J plus J plus. j plus j plus a multiple of n. So it's actually a Li-algebra over R. And over R is very, very small. Actually, it's a free module of rank the dimensional G. So nothing can stop you from looking at this realge and what you get is this, which I'm rapidly going to Which I'm rapidly going to write like this. And now you are in the world that you guys feel comfortable. Because what you have is two objects over R that become isomorphic under a GALA extension. So this will give you Some element there. So, what we know is that the loop algebras are twisted forms of G-tensor variable. So, back in 2003, I proved that this is it, namely that all twisted forms of G-tensorf are G tensor v are the loop channels. So to answer, so I'll come back to that at the end of the talk. So if you trust me on that, then all we have to do is to show that L prime is a twisted form of G test R. Now you can do this in Silicon Valley. You can do this using linear algebra, but I'd rather do it using a lot of set. You can actually see it. So if you have something like this, so I'm now n is 2. So you have the twisted Calois action. So the Calois group sends T to the 1/2 to T to the minus 1. So when you act here, if J is even. Here, if j is even, then this is fixed. So this has to be in the zero eigenface. If, on the other hand, j is odd, the Galois group here will give you minus t. So this forces is to also give the value minus 1. So that you see by Galois descent that this algebra is nothing but the fixed points. So it is at twist here. Sorry. You said that you could in the past that all twisted forms for that time. You mean under that extension or you mean in general? No, in general. Yeah. But don't forget that here n is taken an automorphism for the n. There is no. But anyway, is for n. But anyway, it's for any so they do have anything speed diagonal type, but this is H1 and F. Okay. So So we're going to have a good scale finite presentation. X0 are going to be the close points. And anyways, there is no There is really, I mean, the paper is written, this R is not this R, I mean it will be at the end of the day. There is no, if you want to assume this and it makes things easier to write, there is no problem. So this is the framework. So let me discuss the theorem. Why this is a figure? So I'm going to assume that x is integral and Jacobson. I will tell you what Jacobson is when we just and I'm going to assume that G Q is smooth. is smooth. So this is an algebraic loop over the residual field. And this is for all Q in X naught, in the closed points. The first thing is that G P itself I'm using for all P. And this is for all A. Second thing is, so this, the collected component is defined in SGA. So this is a smooth. So this is actually, this is defined as a group functor, group functor of the group scheme G. But actually, it is. Actually, it is a group scheme and it's of relative dimension D and so this is one two and three it's so if if it happens that that at the close points That at the close points the fibers are connected, then actually G is molds with connected fibers. Notice that we're not saying without it that G is smooth. It's only the assumption is about this touching. So let me give you an outline of the fluid. Might not have true it. I'm sorry? You forget to see what Jacob said. I said I would say what Jacobson said during the proof. Yeah, sorry, sorry. Or outline of the proof. What does three say, really? I'm sorry? What does three say? Three say that if the fibers at the close points are connected, then G itself is smooth, is connected. The G itself is both connected by this. But let me give you an outline of the proof. So the idea is to take a U, you can take it to be which is open and dense, so this is Shiva Day general patterns. General flatness so that this is flat, and then the fibers have constant dimensions. So now if you take a q0, so a closed point of this guy, and let's say that it's my And let's say that it's my 10. Of course, this is flat. The fiber is smooth. This is Jacobson. So this Q actually is a closed point, but you can see it independently using the unit section. So this is just GQ, which is smooth. So this implies that F is. That F is smooth at Q0, but this is Jacobson. So this is smooth everywhere. So Jacobson means that X0 is not only dense, is very dense. For this, we only use that as dense. Okay, so what were you Ah, yes. So now we use semi-continuity. So let F be the generic point. So in this case, it's the fraction field of F. And now we use Chevrolet's semi-continuity. And first of all, noted that F. First of all, noted that F is in U. So GF is smooth of dimension D. So, how do you get this? Well, Chevalier tells you that the points, so take the points. points, so take the dimension of this, the points where the dimension goes up is a closed set. Jacobson means that if you have a closed set and you look at Z intersection X0 and you look at the closure, you get Z. In particular, because the set that we're talking about is not empty, X naught intersects this. X0 intersects this. So there is a point of X naught there. So, but the dimension of those points is D, by your sanction. So your sandwich between the two. So the dimension of this is D. So this guy is D dimension. And now you use the little omega 1, which is the big omega. So this is the gene that represents the LGBT. This is the finite presentation, and you can prove a version of semi-continuity upper semiconductor for the Lie algebra. You use it to be this, but this is smooth, this is smooth, so you have the dimension here is this, the dimension here is this. Here is D, the dimension here is D. So this group and the real algebra have the same dimension, so we use that to conclude that the opposite. Okay, so that's one. And now two is the big gun. This is a huge result. This is a huge result. I'm not going to say anything really about it. And three, so the idea is the following. We're not going to use it, but it's a nice result. So let me just tell you what it is. So you take E n. Such that GP has n-connected components. Then what is proved in LGA3 is, so you see, Jacobson means that you're really hitting closed sets. So this, as you can imagine, So this, as you can imagine, has a consequence when you look at relatively close sets. So these sets are constructible. And a property of Jacobson says that if you have a constructible set, you have that. But you see, by assumption, this interception is empty. So the closure is empty, that means that En is empty for n algebra 2. For n algebra 2 is 2 yesterday. So there is everything, everything, every fiber has a connected okay now we go to screen. So, remember, what we want to do is we want to show that such an is we want to show that such an L prime is a twisted form, p tensor R. So what we do is now we assume that X is a characteristic 0. In this case that the ring R has a copy of Q. Let's take G, split Speak a semi-simple adjoint take L to be the dialogue of T and now assume that That you are given an early algebra that, as a module, is projective of finite type. And what is our health is saying R. Remember, we started with X. But not this algorithm. But again, you could take a sheaf of OX algebras, and so everything is and then you assume that when you look at the fiber This is a twisted form of LQ. So what happens in this particular case is, first of all, all the residue fields are the complex numbers. And you don't even, I mean, this isomorphism actually is just saying that G is isomorphic to G. There's nothing going on there. There's nothing going on. N L prime is a twisted form or L. Now, of course, this L is of this one. I mean Okay, so this one. I mean, this is a split. So the trick is to look, so how do you, so if we do this quartet, so how do you modulate the thing about all the twisted forms that are what is? So the trick is to look at this group. So, this is so on S points, what you do is look at that S Lie algebra and you look at the comorphism of it as the Lie algebra over S. So. So when you look at HQ, well, wearing characteristic zero, so this is smooth. But this is at least a form of sorry, I should say of I should say of but anyways leaving that aside because of this and the theorem so all these groups are smooth and because of the twisted form they all have the same dimension namely the dimension of g0 so from this you get that h0 Get that H0 is a smooth blue skin. What happens when you look at the fibers, at the close points? Excuse me, I don't have hearing the assumption Jacobson. Well, without Jacobson, I cannot prove this. Yeah, but I mean this duration is about Jacobson. Yes, yes, I mean these are the same assumptions. These are the same assumptions plus characteristic zero. Sorry, sorry. That's my mistake. I should have clarified that. So these fibers are the automorphism. So the connected component of that. But that is just the algoint group. I mean, there's a very simple diagram, the adjoint board and the output gas. So this tells you that the fibers at Q, of this smooth group, are reductive. So HJ3 tells you that in a neighborhood of Q is reductive. But this is J constant, so it's dense. So H0 is reductive. The type of a reductive group is locally constant. Is locally constant. Our scheme is connected, so the type is constant. At the close fibers, you have semi-simple adjoint. So this is a semi-simple adjoint group scheme over R. And then And then what you do is, so I want to now call H0 G prime. So what is the Lie algebra of this guy? Well, he's the Lie algebra of Of H0, I mean, if this doesn't, this is L prime. And this is well known, this is the derivations of L prime. But this is really good because G prime being reductive tells me that. Being reductive tells you that this is a projective module of finite value and is represented by that guy, the dual eigen. So that tells you that this is projective of finite time. And then you have the adjoint representation. This is also projective of finite type. So we want to show that it's an isomorphism. So we can pass to the local grain, and then when you go to the residue field, you have the fact that every derivation of a semi-symmetrical dialogue is inner. So on the fiber, this is an isomorphism. So it is an isomorphism. So L prime is the same as this guy, which is this guy. is this guy, G prime is a twisted form of G. So the realge of G prime is a twisted form of the realge of G. So L prime is a twisted form of the realge of G. Good. And as I said, I was going to go three minutes over. I'm going to capitalize on that. So, when you want to look at forms of Gthens for R. So you have that experience. So you have that exact sequence. So these are the symmetries of the cox of the dating diagram. This is clear. And so then you pass the homology. Really should be odd G tends for R. Yes, remember. Yes. Okay. Okay, so this is, of course, this is pretty, this is injection, but the fact is that this actually is a bijection. So there are two ways of seeing that. One is I prove a, sorry, it's a version of SALS conjecture one. So, sorry, now R is this. Sorry, now R is this guy. We're applying now, we're trying to get to what all forms are of this shape. It's a valuation of self-conjecture one. It's not too hard to prove. This is a paper that I did in 2005. And it says that if you have any redactive Brook scheme over R, H1 concepts. So that will give you this. So, that will give you this. With Bololia, Chelnusov, and Fujier, we also have a stronger result for affine curves. But you have to use that G semi-simple, which of course would work in this case because that is semi-simple. But anyways, you have this bijection. So, we're down to understanding what this is. But this is perfect. So these are just the homomorphisms from the algebraic fundamental group into the underlying algebra group of this constant group. Modular contrast. What is this group? What is this group? Well, this very just z hat is all the limit of all these extensions. So, cosycle is completely determined by where you send the progenerate of this group. And when you pull it back here and you find out what is the twisted form that Find out what is the twisted form that corresponds in that co-cycle. Namely, you know, you show G tensor, that simply connected cover, and you look at the fixed points, the factors of finite level, you get exactly the new touch. So that is the proof that all twisted forms of G tensor i are precisely the new touch. That's all. Thanks so much. Questions, please? For your theorem, is the thing at stake, some kind of vanishing results on topology? Because if let's say two year algebra are isomorphic modes maximum ideal, we'd like to leave the isomorphic mode at square. That's how Yeah, what that square, that's an obstruction which vanishes because the arrow is just zero. We can lift and so forth. Yeah, but it's but I mean yes, but there is no vanishing in here. I mean at this point, I don't know anything about the twisted forms of L for an arbitrary R. In this particular case, I know exactly. I know exactly what the twisted forms look like. And that was so this L prime that Bourbon gave, okay, is asking, is it true that an algebra with those properties is a loop algebra? But this is an algebra with the property that at all maximal ideals you get a twisted form of G. In fact, you get G. So it fits in. Get G. So it fits into this framework. Because of this result, all we have to do is to show that L' is a twisted form of the R. And this proves that it is. But there is no vanishing of H1 here at all. I mean, all that this says is that this will give you a class of H1R out of this object. The machine I was referring to is the derivation. The final referring to is the derivation being inner. The impression is a lot touching, it solves the problem of lifting isomorphism or you know, m square, m cube, and so on. Yes, yes, that is true, yes, yeah. Sorry, maybe I can answer your question. You know the structure of the outer automorphism. Can you say more about what kind of loop algebra these are? They are exactly this. So you take. So you take any diagram of the morphism. That's your sigma. Yes. Yeah, sorry. So in particular, if it's trivial, then this is just. No, not only that. If it is inner. Yeah. Even though this may look very different. So by the way, I started with these guys. And this is nothing but guy. And this guy is the guy that we talked about. So this is an early object that is quotesplicked. Algebra that is quasi-split. The Carton is a twisted form of SL3. The Carton subalgebra is free of rank 1, and the root system is of type BC1. Questions? Can you give an example of a link which is not Jefferson? You know, once you're in Jacobson, it's difficult to get out of Jacobson. You have one maximum idea of that. Okay, so let us end this page. No more questions, let us end the speaker here. And we'll start fully internal scale.
