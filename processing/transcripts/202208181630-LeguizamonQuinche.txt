Okay, so we continue with the last talk for today, which is by Elizabeth Legislamon. And he will talk about some ability properties and solutions of second-order differential equations with complex potentials. Thank you, Monica. So thank you. This is a work which I realized with the supervision and contribution of Trunk and Minkel Maya, who is present. And let me start with some motivation. So let me recall the first action on the quantum mechanics. This is. That is, the observed bubble is is the observed bubbles of a quantum system are described by possibly embodied self-adjoint operators okay and a natural question is why so one reason is because the self-again operators have real spectra and okay maybe another more physical reason is because you know the schoinger equation comes from an evolution equation so An evolution equation. So you can associate with a lot of work an unitary semi-group and semi-group. And this group with these conditions will be unitary. And I'm not sure about all details, but I understand that it makes that the particles in the system doesn't disappear. So in 1998, Bendera In 1998, Bendera and Betza, they found a specific case of potentials, which with numerical computations, they realized that these kind of potentials have real spectra. And in particular, they I know that we're No, that worries. In particular, they work on this potential on a complex contour, gamma. Okay, so let me draw this contour in something like that. I hope that you can see you in Zoom. Imagine one curve, something like that, and reflects with respect to the imaginary X, something like that. Something like that. Okay, maybe my drawer doesn't help, but it's a pot that this one is the same or this size. So with this condition, I mean, defining this potential and this gamma, they find the result about the spectrum and they find that they define The different main condition which make this possible. That is these two actions, the party, the pt, where p is the party and t is the time variable. And these actions led us to define the on a differential expression L a pt symmetry. So a differential expression differential expression L is called Differential expression L is called PT symmetry or PT symmetric if it commutes with these two body actions. So recall that it works in this way. So now there is an operator result on a batch made by Trunk and Levin, and they work on the same potential. And they work on the equation of aging value. So they define the batch, something like that. Let me draw again. We have a batch with angle. Where is the learner? Yeah. With angle, phi. Okay? No. If we do the substitution, okay, first know that we have an That we have a complex variable here. So, if we do this substitution, we will obtain two stand-able complex problems, something like that. Maybe the exponential is not in the right side. I mean, I think that it looks better in the other side in order to see a more common strong reveal problem. But we have difficult solutions. This is about the question, sorry. So, you know, that I mean, sorry, for a real problem, we have a classification, a bio classification, that is limit point, limit circle for the real case. But we are not in the real case. And you know that depending on this classification, we can find a set of general realizations of the symmetric operator association. Realizations of the symmetric operator associated. So, in the complex case, or in this case, I mean, we don't have the symmetry or the conditions, but we still have a classification of the figures in these seams. And the next, we have a more recent precedent that is made by Brown, McCormack, Evans, and Plum. And they found that we have three cases. Found that we have three cases and it's something really similar. And okay, and Trunker Levin found the following that if this angle that I draw here, it doesn't belong to these angles, well known as distock badges. Then we will be in the limit point case one. point case one and the limit point i mean raphael said what is the limit point a limit circle case note that this is a definition i mean it depends of the interval but given that we have enough continuity for the potential we are just focused and thanks to the symmetry of the of gamma we can reduce our problem just at the behavior of infinity so i can say So, I can say, slowly speaking, that we have for the equation. So, they found that. And in the other case, I mean, if we are in the stock batch or is one of these stock batches, we will be in the limit circle case, that is all solution or in L2. Now, a natural question is what happens within other potentials? So, for answer this question, I will use a result of second-order differential equation, an asymptotic result. So, first of all, let me define the problem. So, I will define Es and P functions, complex functions, such that the argument of the division and the product are different. The division and the product are different of p and of course we need the p be different of zero and this is the equation. Please take in account maybe it's better if I if I wrote something like that yeah yep equal to is yeah that is the equation yeah perfect. Yeah, perfect. And maybe it's better if I stay here. So, this is the equation. Note, please, that I'm focusing only on one of the x's by the symmetry. And let me define a solution. It's a function, a locally absolutely continuous function such that satisfy this equation and such that produ with p and its derivative. It's again locally absolute. It's again locally absolutely continuous. Now I define the complex square n root and is okay, just take the principal branch of the complete root and we can define a solution as a function and everything works well. And of course these both functions, the product and the division, are continuous and differentiable. Division are continuous and differentiable, and more. So, let me announce the theorem. So, with help of finding a suitable system, I mean changing this equation by a suitable system, and using Banach fixed point argument, we can find a fundamental system g minus and g y. G minus and G Y minus and V plus and the solution we will have this asymptotic behavior. Okay, I know it's awful and it's annoying to see that just read this annoying, but I don't but please note that we have minus here in the exponential and a plus or nothing here in the other exponentials and to And something to note here is that in terms of summability, this y plus will dominate the other solution. We will see in the next results. Now, our results until now, we're still working on that, is the summability properties of y minus and y plus. So the first is as I said before, this is almost the This is almost the y plus solution. And note that this, the result that all solutions are in L2 if and only if this function are in L2 is almost equivalent that say that the y plus solution dominates the other solution. Or to me is a way to say it. Odd Bird is say that the This mobility depends on the of y plus. So now focusing on the of the potential, slowly speaking. If s is bonded, we will be in the limit point case. And if in addition, the real part of square root of s is integrable. So the other solution will not belong to L2. Will not belong to L2. It might be interesting to find a bile function between both functions. After if the potential explodes and we have this relation between them, so we will be in the limit point case. Now, if again the potential explodes and we have this limit condition, note please that always we need Is that always we need that in some way the real parts dominate the imaginary parts? Then in this case, this is we will be in this limit circle case. And you can see that I have more criteria for limit point than limit circle, but I'm pretty sure that have limit point is always better that have limit circle. Have limit circle, in my shallow opinion. Now, and then the final result is a geometric point of view: is if we have this angle, this sector, and the potential is out of this sector, we will be in the limit circle case. And that is all. Thank you so much. So, thank you for your talk. Other questions or comments? Anything in the chat? Okay, so then. So then thanks again to Edison.
