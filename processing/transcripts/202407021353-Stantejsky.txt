I'm going to talk about the synthetic limits of the Landau Design model for liquid crystals surrounding inclusion. Thank you very much. Thank you, Jacobo. Thanks also to the organizers for the kind invitation. It's my first time here at Banff, and so far I enjoy the conference very much. Also, thanks to the ex-organizer at this point. Okay, so what I'm presenting today is a joint work with Francois Louge and Anton Chambol from France. From France. So the work started while I was still at École Policy in Palezo, and we finished while I was at McMaster, where I still am, for another two months. So I'm glad to all the speakers who were there before me that you already explained what Lander Gen model is and all that, so I can save a little bit of time there. So I'm really gonna just introduce the necessary notions and set up the notation that we'll need. But I'm not gonna go too much into detail. Need. I'm not going to go too much into detail what the Lando DeGen model is and why we use it. Okay, so I'm divided my talk into five parts. The first one is just the setup of the problem and the model. So we're looking at a very particular situation with the liquid crystals that we're interested in. So we look at a particle, an occlusion, embedded into an ematic liquid crystal. So the particle we're going to call E, and it's of a certain size. And it's of a certain size or not. And we also apply some external magnetic field in V direction. It's assumed to be homogeneous throughout the sample. And what you observe, we saw some videos on Monday already about that, depending on the size of the particle and the strength of the field, you observe a little sattering defect around that particle. Or, there was the video, now I only got the images. Video, now I only got the images, I'm sorry. The stuttering can close up to a point defect and follow the diagonal configuration. Okay, so below you see some pictures of the directive field. So what you can see from there is at the boundary here of the particle, we have normal anchoring. So we're going to assume a strong digital condition, our director being normal. And at infinity, our director wants to align with. Our director wants to align with the external field. So, in our case, in eth direction. So, you see that a little mismatch between boundary condition and alignment at infinity. So, this is what's going to drive our analysis. And what we're really interested in is this transition between the two different types of singularities. Disclaimer, I only do static, so no dynamics involved here. So, essentially, we want to find a model where the A model where, depending on those parameters, we'll find this as a minimizing configuration for energy functional or this configuration. Okay? Good. So, one of the general ones I said. We're gonna not work with the direct field n, but we're still gonna use it for illustrative purposes. Instead, we're gonna work with Q tensors. The space of Q tensors I denote by C0, so the space of symmetric traceless 3x3 matrices. We're working 3D here. We're working 3D here. And then the Lander-Dejain energy that we've seen in the previous talk. We have an elastic term, one constant approximation, simplest case. We have the classical fourth-order bug potential, and we add a term to take into account the magnetic field. All of this energy is posed at the exterior of the particle, so R3 without the inclusion E. And most important properties of the potential, like we could appreciate the analysis for a slightly more general setup. What we really need is f is non negative and it is zero. It's minimal if and only if q is lineaxial, so this form where n is some unit back. So if you look at all the three terms of the energy separately, What would the energy prefer to do? So, the gradient, of course, wants to have as much constancy as possible, little variations. So, gradient Q squared panelizes these variations, and it wants Q to be constant. F, as I just mentioned, wants Q to be uniaxial, so of the form S dar, N tensor N minus the third identity. And the magnetic field wants Q to somehow be parallel to H. Like for a Q tensor, it's not that obvious what that means for a product. That's obvious what that means for a quadratical, it's easier. So, if we are in the uniaxial setting and remember there was that n tends to n, then parallel to h, remember h was in the 3 direction, just means that n should be plus or negative e3. So if we posed a q that is constant equal to this q tensor, we're equal to infinity, all three terms would be happy, energy would be zero, and the analysis would be over. That, as I mentioned on the previous slide, As I mentioned on the previous slide, we do have those boundary conditions. So impose a QB, which is nu tensor nu, so corresponding to a director that is along the normal, along this boundary. And this leads to the frustrated system. And we expect indeed to transition somewhere between the QB close to the particle surface and the Q infinity in the far field. Okay, questions so far? So far. Although feel free to drop me at any time if something is unclear or you want me to elaborate more. Okay, so in the energy there were two things that I didn't explain, didn't know what you realized, sin and eta. So those are two parameters that come from the non-dimensionalization of the energy. So I got rid of all the other constants like from magnetic field or from the elastic constant because they're all assumed to be constant. So I only focused on the So, I only focus on the parameters that will vary. And the two parameters that will vary is the part of the radius and the strength of the moment. So, the xi is a dimensionless parameter that roughly behaves like an inverse radius, and the eta behaves like our Norton's H to the inverse. Good. Now, we're not the first ones who have looked at this situation that has problem. Had this problem. So there is way too much literature to acknowledge everybody. So I decided to just put two articles that are really exactly the situation that we studied. So they're due to Stan Elmer, Irvan Sorg, and I Lemi. And in the first article of them, they studied in the absence of a magnetic field, the limit when xi tends to infinity, and what they found there was a seven-ring effect, and the limit when xi tends to zero, in which case they're. Tends to zero, in which case they obtain a dipole contribution. Two years later, in the next audio club, they studied again the regime when side tends to zero, but this time with magnetic field, and in all those cases they obtained saturn ring results. Now the obvious question is, what happens at this point here? Like along all this, we had saturn rings, and if we approach it from this side, we get a dipole. So something interesting must be happening in this point, depending on from which direction we... On from which direction we approach the point 0, 0. And that's exactly the setting in which Francois, Artenal, and me placed ourselves. So we're looking what happens if H, the magnetic field strength, scales like psi log psi. Let's say log psi can't worry from the previous analysis from ABL. So yeah, this is the interesting case. And in terms of eta. And in terms of eta and psi, you can say we want that eta, if you divide this by h, eta times log psi behaves roughly like an order one quantity, and this order one quantity we call beta. So later we will see if you vary beta from zero to infinity, we're going to get this transition between segendarine and time. Okay, so this is roughly the setting. Yeah, let's start with the simplest case. Let's start with the simplest case, the sphere. So that's the one that I showed you from the experiments. So the result we obtained in this spherical case is the following. So we consider as a promise eta log psi tends to beta. Beta is all the one, so somewhere between zero and infinity, so some fixed constant. When we look at the limit eta and psi to zero. So remember, xi was an inverse radius, so we're looking at large particles here. And eta. And eta also goes to zero with this fixed relation. So it means we're looking at weak communicated fields. So this is a very particular regime. We consider the particle E, which is just the unit ball, unit sphere, of the least scaling that we can assume from that. And since our whole problem has a symmetry, we can assume rotational equivariance to simplify our life. But don't worry, in the third part, I'm going to tell you how to do it without it. Okay, so let's. Okay, so under those assumptions, we have the following point theorem. We have a convergence result in the spirit of gamma convergence. So our energy multiplied by eta converges to some limit energy in the gamma convergence sense. So the limit energy is disposed for f. F is a subset of the boundary, so in this case. And I mean there are a lot of constants that you can all ignore. The important thing here is you integrate. More. The important thing here is you integrate some density, 1 minus cosine theta, over the set F, and a different density, 1 plus cosine theta, over the complement of F. And whenever you switch between F and the complement of F, so you walk across the boundary, you have to pay a price. This price is given by this blue third term. So this is the total variation of the characteristic function of f. But if you want, you can just see it as the length of the boundary if the boundary is regular. Length of the boundary if the boundary is regular enough. And there's also the beta appearing that we see here from our dissection. So that's where the beta involves, and you're going to see the beta is the weight that makes this parameter term, this total variation term, either expensive or very cheap. So that's where the transition is going to happen. S star is a constant coming from F, C star is a constant coming from G. This is not important. And as I said, we have to have a constant. And as I said, it's in the spirit of gamma convergence, so we have the classical gamma-lin-inf, gamma-lin-sub inequality, as you would expect. What is convergence in the line? So, convergent variational sense, typically there are three ingredients. Do you have some sort of compactness? So, if you have a sequence Q8 oxide that is bounded with energy, then there is a sub-sequence which converges to the limbed object. To the limit object in a certain sense. Exactly. It's just the gamma convergence here. I mean, I was slightly. I didn't put gamma convergence because here we have, we're going with Q tensors, here we're working with F. So we're kind of switching spaces, so it's a bit non-standard gamma convergence. But I think in the original article when you're talking to these democraconvergence, you also switched spaces. So I think one could call it democonvergence. But it was a bit jackal. I understand. Any other question? Question? Okay, good. So, this is the first result that I want to present. Let's give you an idea of proof. So, we're in a 3D setting, we have that symmetry, so let's reduce it to just a slice and maybe 2D. So, this is essentially the instructive picture. It's a 3D, it's a slice in 2D. This is my particle, my sphere. And then And then I have to tell you what is f, how is it f related to the q. So, what you can do is, whenever f is small, remember f was analyzing being 4 from being the axial. So, when f is small, that means we can define a director field in an approximate sense. So we can define this n, which is a lifting essentially from q. And now n carries an orientation. And now we can define the relative orientation. The relative orientation of n with respect to v. Okay, so whenever we are oriented like ν, and let's fix plus v3 at infinity as reference orientation, then we put this into f, and whenever there is a negative 1 here, we put it in the component of f. Okay, so those are the proxies for f and the component. So those are the only two choices because we imposed that boundary condition of being new, tensor, new. That boundary condition of the new tensor new, so n can only be plus or minus n. Okay, so this is the proxy for f whenever f is small. And whenever f is large, so in other words, q is far, one can show that there must exist a topological degree around this. So in this picture here, we have to find f, there is the complement. So we switch from f to the complement. And this has to happen with a region where f is large. With a reach where f is large. So if you go around here, you see that you have a one-half degree. So this costs some energy. There are several results in this. We used the result to Giacomo. But I mean, the whole thing started with S1 valued maps in the age and then later generalized by David Chiron and Giacomo. So this is what happens whenever F is large. When F is small and this reddish F this small in this reddish region here. What you can do is you can look at a ray originating from the surface of the sphere going all the way to infinity. And you look at the transition of n between plus or minus nu to plus e3. Okay, so we can look at this one-dimensional transition and calculate the energy that it costs. That has been done in ABL, the second article that I mentioned earlier. And this is what exactly what gives you your surface energy that I announced in the team. That are announced in the team. So, those are the two crucial ingredients. You have to define the right objects, then you estimate the line energy, the defect energy here, and then you have that radius repo. Keep that in mind. We're going to come back to that in the general case in like 15 minutes. Questions? Okay, once you have that energy, of course you want to know what are the minimizers of the You want to know what are the minimizers of the limit energy. We want to make sure that only a subterranean or a dipole effect can occur and not some non-physical solutions. So, what you can show indeed is that if you minimize the energy for a perfect beta, you either end up with f being a half-sphere, which we interpret as a saddle ring, or f is a trivial. Or because of symmetry, f could also be a whole sphere. This is the same thing. So, why do we interpret f being the half? Why do we interpret F being the half-sphere as Saturn drain? Well, if you look at the energetic cost that we're having, these energy densities that I put for F, for example, they are optimal on the upper half sphere, and the component of F is optimal on the lower half sphere. So this is the optimal configuration for F, and we're paying the equator, so the length of the equator, which represents the Saturn. So the degree that we saw in the previous. The degree that we saw in the previous slide, all those energy costs are concentrated around the equator, as you would expect for a submarine. Exactly. This is favored for a small beta because the submarine doesn't force anything, and the optimal orientation for the surface energy is optimized by upper hemisphere or lower hemisphere. On the other hand, if beta becomes very large, then you want to avoid paying the perimeter at any cost. So, what you do is you So, what you do is you do the non-optimal energy density everywhere, for example, here on the upper half sphere. But this is still better because beta might be very, very large. So it really all depends on whether beta is big or small. Now you're going to tell me why can't there be any seven ring at intermediary position? Why can't the sedentring be over here? And for that, we did. And for that, we did a very nice little graph. So, this graph shows you the energy of our configuration, and on the x-axis, we have plotted an angle, theta d, under which you could place a defect. So, pi over 2 means the equator, 0 and pi are the two poles. And now you see for beta equal to 0, the global minimum, the only minimum is at the equator, this is the certain ring. instead of the saturn ring. If you increase beta, for example making it less than equal to one, you see that the dipole as well as the saturn ring, they're both local minima, the saturn ring being the global minimum. And with this whole analysis we're also able to compute explicitly the values for which dipole and saturn ring have equal energy. This is this first red curve here. And if you keep increasing beta, at some point the saturn ring uh loses its minimality, it becomes uh becomes unstable. It becomes unstable, and then the dipole is the only critical critical point, the global minimum. Okay, and here you can clearly see there is no local minimum for any value of beta except the pi over 2 or at 0. But there are no other Saturn drinks at a different angle, theta d, other than pi over 2. Okay, so this is kind of reflected by what we saw on Monday in the video. When the centering closes up, it doesn't stop somewhere in between. Closes up, it doesn't stop somewhere in between, it just continues to close all the way until it reaches this type of contiguation. I wrote compare with Sorg, so we were the first one actually to discover this. Holger Schark in the 90s, he did some numerical investigation and computations using the Aussie and Frank model. And this is uh a screenshot from one of his articles. Uh it's a numerical result, but if you look at the right side of my of our diagram, Side of our diagram, you'll see that it matches pretty well. The advantage is now that we have it for our limit model explicitly, we can give you the equation of those dashed curves in elementary functions. But yeah, sometimes this result is not new. Now, we covered this view. But of course, the practitioners here know, you can put other things. Practitioners here know you can put other things into liquid crystal than a sphere. So, we would like to know what happens in the non-spherical case. Before I tell you why this is much, much harder, let me change the point of view slightly and reformulate my limited energy. So, the limit energy that I gave you is very natural from the existing literature, and also we'll mention it later for a talk tomorrow. But for the general case, it is The general case is there is an advantage in reformating the energy. So, up here, this is the energy as I gave it to you, and now this is the reformulated energy. So, what did I do? Well, one can realize, I integrate 1 minus cosine, 1 plus cosine over f or the component of f. So, I integrate something no matter where m is here. So, what I did is I just took the minimum between those two, which is 1 minus absolute value of cosine, and I integrated over the whole. Absolute value of cosine, and I integrate it over the whole of the sphere. So, this is kind of the minimal cost that I always have to pay that. And then, depending on whether I do a good turn, for example, from the upper hemisphere to plus E3 and the lower hemisphere to negative E3, or the other way around, I have to pay an extra cost. And this is this kind of an extra cost. So, note that I have to add two times the after value, of course, and that's why it is a four. 4. And just to make the notation a little bit nicer, I replaced this total variation notation really by the H1, like the H1 measure of the boundary, in case F has a regular enough boundary. So if you do that Richard relation, you realize that this first term now does not depend on your configuration anymore. It's independent of F. So this is just a constant, it only depends on your manifold. So we're going to later see there will be one constant. C, there will be one constant, you can have manifolds popping up in the energy. The second term, as I said, accounts for the energetic cost if you do the third you would not like to do, but you have to. And yeah, the third term just measures the length of a simulation. Okay, with this, I can tell you the difficulties. So the first obvious problem is if you're not having a sphere, if nothing symmetric anymore, you cannot use a covariance, you cannot make the 2D problem. You cannot make a 2D problem. You really have to make a 3D proof. And this is quite difficult. The second point, which is related to the third one, is if we lose convexity of these. So we could make an intermediate step of just looking at convex particles. This would be much simpler. But if you lose convexity, you cannot do that argument anymore, that you start from the surface and go all the way to infinity and then use some soft arguments as an ABL. No, because the convexity of the normal. No, because of the convexity, of the non-convexity, you now have to make it on a finite length scale. And therefore, you have to replace those weaker arguments by quantitative arguments. You have to introduce lots of epsilons, lots of approximations to make this work. And also non-convexity leads to the fact that the energy might no longer be concentrated on the boundary of your particle. So before we could phrase our energy in terms of this set F, which was a subset of the boundary. Of the boundary. In the general case, this can no longer be expected. If you look back at this energy, there was a singular line. We wanted to measure the length of the singular line. If you now think about non-convex particles, it might be better for the line to detach from the surface and straighten itself. That's going to reduce this cost compared to the other ones. So, energy might no longer concentrate on the boundary, and we'll see some examples towards the end. Okay, all of this leads to the fact that the whole analysis is much more. Leads to the fact that the whole analysis is much more complicated, the energy is also more complicated, the statement is also more complicated. You have to use some geometric measure theory, lots of regularization procedures, deformation theorems. I tried to spare you through all that. So to keep it simple and accessible, but nonetheless there's going to be some technicalities that I have to show you. Okay. So the idea of proof, in some sense, is very similar to To the previous setting, we again look at the set where f is large and the set where g is large. So the set where f is large, remember, that just means q is far from n. And then we can look at the complement set. So if q is close to n, or we can even say for simplicity q is an element of n. And then in this set, when is g large? g is large, whatever the director is far from being plus or minus d three. Far from being plus or minus e3. So for a unit vector, being far from plus or minus e3 means that n3 is equal to 0. Okay, so we're going to look at those two sets whenever q is far from n and whenever nth v is equal to 0. Okay, so what do we do? We go into our q-tensor space, five dimensions, and we look at the set where n phi is equal to 0. So we make a decomposition of our Q-tensor in the eigenbase. In the eigenbasis, we look at the dominating eigenvector, we set the third component to zero, and we look what that gives. This is one condition in five dimensions. So you end up with a quadimension one object. Then you take the pre-image, pre-image preserves core dimensions. So you end up with an object that we call T, which is quadimension one in R3. So in other words, it's something like a surface. Okay, so for those of you who are not familiar with GMT, just really think of the smooth surface. Really, think of a smooth surface, a manifold, something like this. Okay? Now, what does it mean for Q to be far from N? There's a thing called negative uniaxials. So those are the ones, like I showed you what a uniaxial is. You know, if you put a negative sign in front, those are the negative uniaxials. Yeah, this is a codimension two object. So if we take the pre-image, it turns out to be a line. Like this, we end up with a surface and a line. And a line. Now, if you have a surface and a line, and you think a little bit of geometry, you can wonder: hey, is there some relation between those two? And this is a good choice of a notion Q4 for man, because there is such a relation if you make the choice. The relation is that the boundary of this set in the Q-tensor space is precisely given by this set. So, again, the boundary operator commutes with green images. So, we'd like to say that the boundary of t is given by s. However, there's one-side problem. We have a boundary on our domain. One-side problem, we have a boundary on our domain, our three. So, this can also have a boundary at the boundary of the domain. Remember, the boundary of the domain, we get the condition that n must be equal to mu. So, if n3 is equal to 0, that means that mu3 is equal to 0. So, the boundary of t is given by s plus this set. So, actually, defining the objects is the hardest part, but it's a difficult task, and I deliberately. Difficult task, and I deliberately wrote a prox sign here because you cannot just take the pre-image, you have to make some modifications to make all of this work. But this is part of the details, so I want to scary this time. Okay, to make the relation with what we've seen before, let's go back to the spherical case. I mean, this should also work. So, in the spherical case, the set mu3 equals 0 is just given by the equator. Okay, so this yellow dot here in the slides. The set where q is negative uniaxial. The set where Q is negative uniaxial, for example, could be this point here. And then the set T would be this red line. I mean, think about it in 3D, so it's really an annular region, connecting S to new 3 equal to 0. Okay, so this is the relation to the previous image I showed you. And once you have defined those objects in the right way, we want our estimates. So, what you can do is you can So, what you can do is you can estimate the energetic cost very similar to previously. We refer here to a result by Giacomo and Jan Menica Orlandi in 2020. So, we didn't have to do much about S. 4T, again would like to do the 1D auxiliary problem from ABL, but as I mentioned, we have to do it on a finite scale. What we do, we place ourselves at the good point of our surface. We do a blow-up procedure to obtain something that makes something flat. We obtain something flat, and then we make the transition on a finite scale. And after some little modifications, the idea works out. So once you have quantified the cost of the line S and the surface T, you obtain some bounds of the size, of the length of the surface of those objects. And in GMT, this is enough to obtain compactness in some sense. So we can pass to some limiting objects for which we then formulate our energy. Formulate our energy. So, what does the energy look like? The assumptions we are still in the same asymptotic regime, eta log psi equals to beta. Now we have an arbitrary particle. The boundary needs to be regular. Like we need a normal, we need some regular normal, but I think C21 was enough, so nothing too fancy. We have this set, mu to be equal to zero, that we also require to be regular to be able to do some duplicate arguments. Arguments. But again, nothing too wild. Generically, this is always true. And those assumptions we obtained published this year in CBPD. Again, a variational convergence of the energy, same rescaling, to this limit energy. Now let me spend a few minutes on explaining this limit energy to you, because it looks a bit messy for the first time. So we can formulate the whole energy. So we can formulate the whole energies solely in terms of T. So T is the limit of our T at Xi that I defined on the previous slide. Here you see a constant, Cm. That's the constant that I mentioned in the two steps. Now here, this is the term that we previously called integral of cosine theta, up to theta. Okay, so this is this term. Now that we don't really have the correspondence with spherical coordinates, we decided to not call it cosine theta anymore, it's just the absolute value of mu. Theta anymore, which is the absolute value of mu3. And this gets integrated over the set where t attaches to n. So t is a surface that can be in the inside of, in the interior of omega, or it could be at the boundary. And we kind of separate those two bits. Whenever it is on the surface, we take this as our density. And if you want, if you're in the theory of omega, you take the density 1. By the way, this is the new term. This is the term that has not been present previously. Term that has not been present previously, and this is solely due to the fact that our particles are not convex. If you have a convex particle, this term is not there, you can ignore it. And finally, the length of the singular line. So remember, the singular line was S. S was equal to boundary of t plus gamma. We can just replace s by del t plus gamma. Again, there is the beta. Nothing much has changed. No. Anybody has any questions so far? Anybody has any questions so far? I expected a question. Actually, you already know the slide before. What does it mean if you take a manifold and you add another manifold? So what we mean by this is it's a bit hidden in the GMT that we're doing. So our objects are not really manifolds. We see them as flat chains that take values in the fundamental group of n. Now that's a horrible N. Now that's a horrible thing to say, I know. So, what does it really mean? N was this uniaxial set. So, it's hitheromorphic to the real protective plane, RP2. So, what's the fundamental group of RP2? It's just Z mod2. So, in other words, 0 or 1. So, this is really only a flat chain that can take the value 1, which means we're in that set on the manifold if you want, or 0, we're not. zero will not. So now this addition means if you are on the boundary of T and not on gamma, you have one plus zero, which is one. Or you could be in gamma but not on the boundary. zero plus one is gamma one. But if you're on the boundary and on gamma, you have one plus one, which is zero. So if we were in a very classical setting, you could just write this metric difference for this object. Object. But yeah, we cannot. Okay, so this is a bit of a subtlety here. This addition, which by the way, was already here. This was also understood in the same way of Z2 value flexions. I don't put the gamma dimension, gamma dimension soup there anymore, but I rather want to say a little bit about tea. So we wanted to understand this transition between We wanted to understand this transition between seven ring and dipole, so we kind of need the representation for point defects and for line defects. And I also want to make the relation between the T, in which my second limit energy is written, and the F that we used for the first. Okay? So remember, what was F? F we defined as the set where our director is aligned with the output norm plus one. With the output normal, plus one. And the complement, but it was negative one. So you can see it as the set where n, if you start from the output normal, turns to plus e3. And the complement, if you start from also the output normal, it turns to negative e3. T was defined as the set where n3 is equal to zero. So typically, this is the case whenever your n3 makes a sign change. So when you pass from n3 positive to n3 negative. So, when you pass from n3 positive to n3 negative or vice versa. What you can do is you can look at the set f and say, well, I want to start from n 3, like new 3, for example, positive, but I want to go to plus e3. So I don't want to make a sign change. I want to keep that sign. Okay? So you can write it as new 3 positive intersected with m without t. You don't make a sign change. On the other hand, you could also start from new 3 being negative, but since you want to turn to plus e3, you want to make a sign change. Plus E3, you want to make a sign change. So you look at T restricted to M. Okay, so the F can be written as the union of those two sets, and you can express T on the boundary and F using each other. That's the relation between F and T, for example, for the sphere. Now, what about the singularities? So the line singularity is quite straightforward. Again, we have this argument for vegetarian degree. So the line singularity corresponds. Degree, so the line singularity corresponds to the line s. This is quite natural. However, now the t is somehow must correspond to point defense. How does a surface correspond to points? So the way I imagine this is the following. So, first of all, we pass to some limit. We take psi eta to zero. So, passing to the limit naturally you lose some information. And this is what happens here as well. We lose some bit of information where our point effect is located. Our point effect is located. So, if you look at the example here on the left, I drew you a director field again for the sphere. In yellow, you have the gamma, the dipole effect, the point effect is over there. And if you now look at the set where the director field is horizontal, I drew that red line through it. So, you realize that the point effect sits on that surface. So, in some sense, the T tells you, okay, somewhere on this red thingy. On this red thingy, there must be my point effect. I don't know exactly where, if I only have information about T, but if there is a point effect, it must sit on somewhere. Okay, so that's the relation between T and the point significant massive. Okay. So once you have that limit energy, naturally we want to ask ourselves the same question. Is it in the spherical case? In the spherical case, what do optimal configurations look like? So, the first thing, if you see such energy, is of course you write down the optimality conditions. So, if you take gamma and m everything to be smooth to avoid problems, you can apply pretty much the theory of minimal surfaces. So, thanks, Mike, for telling us. So, you can show that minimizes of T are indeed regular, C infinity in interior. This comes from This comes from the fact that T has zero mean curvature, as we saw for minimal surfaces. The boundary of T has a constant curvature, which is inversely proportional to beta. And if you think about the T, I said there could be a portion on the particle surface, and there could be a free portion in the in the interior of omega. So there might be some curve or some location where T detaches from the particle. Detaches from the particle. And at those locations, we have something that resembles Young's law. We can give you the angle under which the surface must detach. And the last thing I want to note here is whenever your particle is convex, what you can do is you can project the whole thing onto the manifold. This is decreasing your energy, and therefore this term wouldn't be there. So for minimizers and the around the convex particle, And around the convex particle, this term never contributes. So, whenever you want to see this term, you really have to work with a non-convex particle. But a lot of technical details, a lot of formulas. So, from now, no more formulas. Only pictures. Okay, so minimizing that energy is quite complicated. So, analytically, finding the minimizers is very, very difficult. So, what we decided to do instead. Very difficult. So, what we decided to do instead is we did some numerics. Okay? So, the first example we did for numerics to validate our algorithm was we're looking at the sphere. So, in the sphere, you already know what the minimizes are. Those are exactly the ones that we find. Either we have the set and ring, so blue will always stand for setting rings in the following. Or the T covers half of the C remember T was the reading where we do the unfavorable turn. Where we do the unfavorable turn. So here we do the favorable turn, and in the bottom we do make the unfavorable turn. There is no blue, no line, we don't pay any total variation. Okay, so in the sphere, our analytic result matches the numerical result, which is nice. But of course, we're not interested in the sphere because we know what happens. So we want to see some non-convex particles, don't we? So we went to go and see the PNET. Now the PNET is non-convex. So we're expecting to see uh this uh this additional term. This additional term. However, if you look at those two configurations, like the magnetic field is always vertical, you see that there are three saturn rings forming precisely at the locations where gamma is located. For small beta and for large beta, you end up with a point effect here and no lines here. If you turn the P nut, again the field is vertical, you get one saddle ring or a dipole, very similar to the spherical case. To the spirited case, and as far as we can see, there is no detaching from this line happening. Might be due to a bad choice of our radii of the particles, but it's not we got. Of course, there's no reason for the peanut to be parallel or orthogonal to the external field, right? We could also give it an angle. So, here we give it an angle, pi over 6. And now you see that the gamma is no longer parallel circles. Parallel circles, but they can be some other structures. For beta small, you get what you would expect. Your singular lines are exactly covering gamma. For large beta, you get also what you would expect. No lines at all. Everything is covered. But there are also some intermediary configurations. So for relatively large beta, those two lines get joined by a little bit of surface T, but you keep one ring defect. And if you One ring defect. And if you tune very finely your parameters, what you also see is that those three rings join together, form one large ring. And this comes at the cost of doing some unfavorable turns in those little regions in red over there. So far, I haven't seen any experiments finding those situations. So, if somebody knows some references or has done some experiments or wants to do some experiments, please let me know. But also, in this situation, But also in this situation, we don't find the T that is detaching from the surface. So, what we did instead afterwards, we were like, okay, we have to fabricate some particle shape where we do see it. And so we came up with a passant. So essentially, we glued together a half torus, some cylindrical parts, and some spherical caps, and smoothed it out to have direct regularity. Now the gamma is. Now, the gamma is this curve. Also, the minimizer for beta small, for beta large, this is the minimizer. But if you make the cylindrical parts long enough, at some point he's going to prefer to make this curve shorter, what he did here, and fill up the gap with a little bit of T. And now this T really is in the interior of the domain, it's not on the boundary. So in this particular case, it's flat, so also zero mean curvature. Your mean curvature. And you can also see that this thing here, you can't see that well, but it's supposed to have constant curvature. What you can see, if you vary beta a little bit around this point, you can see that this curve really moves outward or inward, changing its curvature, as you would expect from the optimality conditions. So I'm not claiming that we numerically verified all the optimality conditions, but we also didn't find any of the control distributions. Possibly plausible. Post to the plausible. Okay, so this was for Le Croissant, and finally we saw this T detaching in the interior of omega. Of course, we didn't make any assumption about the topology of our particles. So there's no reason to only take things that are diffeomorphic to the sphere. So just to show you, you can also do, for example, a donut torus shape, or also double tori. And depending on the radii, for example, what you find here, there's a point effect somewhere in the center, surrounded by like. Surrounded by a Saturn ring. Here you have a Saturn ring at the upper bed and a point effect, probably somewhere. So we can also handle non-trivial topologies. Yeah? Those are the pictures. Sorry. Shouldn't the charge be zero? They're alternate, they're opposite charging enough. So this should be a negative one-half around here, and the center should be a minus one. Around here, and the center should be a minus one half? Wouldn't it be possible? I mean. No, it should be a negative one half and a negative one, I think. If you draw the field, the directive field. If you look at look at it from the side, if this is your torus, this is your magnetic field, and you would. Field and you would have a field like this. This would be your ring defect around. And here in the center, you do something like this. So this is negative one point defect and also negative one half line defects around. If all we can discuss uh but I think this is uh this is fine. But I think this is. I'm saying something that's important. You have homeontropic alignment, right? Yes. So the charge, the director charge sitting on the torus is zero. Because if you integrate the Gauss map, or the director map, the pullback of the Gauss map from the torus, if you integrate, it integrates to zero, right? Opposed to the sphere where it integrates to one. Sphere where I rate still one. On the theory to one, I agree. But on all the experience that I saw, also, people put tori in liquid crystals, they always got two-point defects or like a ring. So this is really consistent with what we see. So I'm not sure this argument is that the defects are required. They're energetically hit. They're not required at all. Sure, because the component of the torrents is not cool. It's not a non-trigger in itself. I'm just saying. Sorry, maybe. Yeah, maybe we can discuss it. No problem. Okay, so anyways, I'm almost at the end. I just want to give a brief outlook on projects that we're currently working on or that I would like to work on. So, first of all, we did homeotropic anchoring. So, a natural question is: what happens if you have other anchoring conditions? So, for example, we're considering a plana, generally. We're considering a planner general anchoring, called tangential anchoring here. And I'm not going to say much more, but we're going to have a talk tomorrow evening by Keen, who's going to talk about precisely that, what you can expect there. Another interesting question, what happens if you replace the strong digitally condition by weak anchoring, by the surface energy? It's a bit more realistic from a physical point of view. Another point, like we put a magnetic field, because this is the most reasonable to assume to be. Most reasonable to assume to be constant throughout the whole sample. If you had an electric field instead, you would need to be a bit careful about the coupling and you would need to solve like a coupled system of PEs. Also, we saw that there were some experiences, like some experiments using flow fields that also produce sediment rings. So, it would be interesting to see if this can somehow be included into such a model. But, of course, the most interesting thing for me is what happens if you. For me, is what happens if you increase the number of particles. So, we handled one particle, but of course, if you think about colloids, one particle is not very good. So, we already saw pictures about knots and links that can be formed. I just included some more pictures here. You can get really pretty much all knots or links you can imagine. What we focused so far on is the setting on two particles. So, look at the interaction between two particles and try to find Two particles and try to find those different configurations that are in between. But again, we don't have anything yet to do present. But yeah, we work on it. Okay, and with that, thank you very much. Thank you very much for this. Very much talk. Are there any questions? Yes, sorry. I'm just great talking. I'm wondering for these T-surfaces, are you seeing T surfaces? Are you guaranteed one point defract per surface? Can you determine where it goes? No, actually, it's an interesting question. So if you look, for example, at this example, we know from the experiments that there must be one point effect located somewhere over there. So this surface somehow must be related to the point effect, while this one is not. And if I had to conjecture something, I would say, well, this one here is simply. I would say, well, this one here is simply connected, while this one is not. Maybe it has to do something with the topology of the bits of T, whether it carries a point charge or not. But no conjecture, I don't know. And I'm wondering for your proof about the Saturn rings and the effects for this spherically symmetric case. Does the proof really rely on this as a mutual symmetry? Would you miss out on any minimizers that kind of break rotational symmetry? Rotational symmetry? Um so the way we did the proof, it's really using the uh the equivariance. So yes, we will miss out. On the other hand, the more general result also applies to the scale. So then we didn't miss out anything. It was great to see how your results connect to Ogleworth by Start. One thing that he does in detail is talking about the distance between the defect core and the end of the colloidal particle. So have you looked at that quantitatively in your model? Quantitatively in your model? In my model, it's not really possible to do that. The thing is, we have this boundary layer, the transition between QP and Q infinity takes place. But if you take Q eta inside to zero, all this collapses onto the surface. So for the sphere, all defects will, all our objects will be located on the surface. You can't tell the distance. Okay, so really there's a limiting result. Yes, yes, sir. So in some sense, as I said, you lose the information where exactly the point is located. You lose the information where exactly the point is located, anyways. On the button, you also lose the information about the distance. Probably with a higher order model, you could say something about that. Just a curiosity, I wonder whether you can say anything systematically when you go from a shape such as non-convex shape such as convex hole. So, what you can do is you can So, what you can do is you like I described this projection that you can do for minimizers. So, if you have a non-convex particle, I think you can always project onto its convex hull, which is decreasing the energy. So, everything, all the T and the S will be concentrated in the convex hull of the particle. That I think is true. But I don't think I can say anything more systematically than that. Like, it's somewhere in there, but for example, for the peanut, I can't tell you why it's not detaching. It must be really the radii or. It must be like really the radii or not well chosen. I guess if I chose different peanut, then it would detach. But yeah, I can't tell when it's on the surface, when it's in the convex hull. But minimizer shouldn't be outside of the convex hull. Sorry, can you go to the peanut with the three chariots? I'm not sure. Yeah, the one on the left. So you're asking, you're asking, so you take that peanut and you make it fatter in the middle until it's complete. Fatter in the middle until it's convex. Exactly, you would put the signature on the left hand. And then the ring in the middle and the ring on the two of the rings would come together, right? Because they're deep there. What I'm asking, whether there's any systematic. I mean when you pull it out, not about the convex half, but you replace the particle by the new. You convexify the shape. Okay. Well, in that sense, what the problem is. Well, in that sense, the problem is that you end up with a region here which is like cylindrical. And this is slightly degenerate. This is not what we can do with our theorem. Because it's really flat. So we can handle it for certain orientations, but in this orientation we could not. Because there, the ring doesn't have any preferred location. This is exactly what we need, the degeneracy condition of gamma for that you cannot have, that gamma for this is a line, it cannot be a surface. But in this setting, if you were to convect. But in this setting, if you were to convexify this peanut in this orientation, your gamma would be a surface. It would be precisely this surface where you convexify it. This cannot be handled by the theorem. But if you turb it slightly, make it a little bit more than tonight, then it would be again a manageable. I suppose in the interactive break, we perhaps should postpone any further discussion to the break. And we resume my free.
