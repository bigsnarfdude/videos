Okay, so today I'm going to talk about some works related to scalar curvature using the virtual flow. So most of them are joint work with TEM, some of them, some of the web curve is not. But anyway, the main work is also with TEM. Okay, so let me start with some motivation why the following question is interesting. Let me start with. It's interesting. Let me start with some very classical film in scalar curvature, which is related to the rigidity. So, the oh, I should also be mentioned. This is also a work by Shen Yao. So, which says that any reminder metric on Taurus are automatically flat. Uh so the method of Gomova and Northen are using the speed method, while Cheney and Yao are using immediate surface. I forgot to put sorry. I forgot to put sorry. And then there's another one which is also interesting in the sense of the modal space comparing with the sphere, which says that if we stuck, yes, yes. Sorry, a lot of time. I did it yesterday. I'm in jet less, sorry. And then the CAKs is saying that if you They're saying that if you're going to assume the sphere and then the scalar curve is bounded below by the sphere, and it means one Lipton's map from sphere, so from the manifold sphere, then the map is automatically of isometry or unless it's trivial. So you can also phrase it in some other way, like I mean, like the first talk, they also Top, they also simplify it by assuming the FTVI sort of identity, and then you can focus on the sphere or focus on metric on the sphere. But in this way, it's more flexible than we can see how rigid the sphere is. So the basic question is to ask: okay, what if the object are not smooth? But to my Okay, but to my understanding, the question by Gomorrah is basically a rough question of Gomorrah, but the ultimate goal of this question is to study the competence of manifold with a scalar curvature low line, which is far out of reach because you don't know anything about what to do. Like, you don't know what the topology you should be using, you don't know which convergence, you don't have a big sense of scalatology, etc. You don't have anything. Unlike the L C D geometry, everything has Much everything that's pretty much well known now. Okay, but so we so the question I raise here is a simplification of what I said a lot. In a sense, I fixed the topology. I fixed the underlines based on sphere or torus or just fix the M I study here, etc. I fix all the objects which makes the question much, much easier. The question is much much easier because if you recall the LCD geometry or which are the most space, the metaphor are basically a bunch of metric space. I mean, you can't focus too much on the smooth metrics. You have to sacrifice the geometry so that you make sense of the complex, etc. Anyway, so that is what I basically said. So, and then for the next question, like the RCD, you need to make sense of the curvature law of one. Need to make sense of the curvature law one for the singular object. So, which makes the question key here. We want to define this notion of scalar curvature from below for multiple objects. Okay, so the question, so the question, which is also related to the Gromov is by also by J, which says that if G is a difficult metric. Magic on Taurus. Okay, and then the way he faces is different. If there's a singularity such that G is actually smooth away from N. Okay, on the smooth part, I can consider the rigidity statement like this, because everything is smooth outside the clinicality set. Is moved outside the clinical article set, then if S is of high equal dimension, can we conclude G is a flag? Okay, so it's a alternative question which is also motivated by mod. I mean, I mean, not exactly, but it's related. Said it, but it's related. It's another question. So the reason why this setting is interesting because in the previous setting, everything is too open. Nothing can be said. But in this setting, I know precisely we have some singularity. And I want to know whether the digital statement of a torus or sphere or whatever can be carried over even with the present of the single art. Make sense? Okay, makes sense. Okay, and then the the reason why one more reason why this setting is also interesting is because it's related to Positive Mass film with singularity. If you okay if you are big fans of Possibus film, you just replace the Taurus line as a total graphite manifold with some black hole singularity stuff, then you ask the same question. They are more or less neutral, I mean not neutral, more or less parallelity. Okay, so so that also related to Master. Related to positive masculine with uh kind of con okay so uh let me uh rephrase the question in a different way. Now that's uh not being too aggressive to ambiguous and focus on continuous fetching, okay, which seems to be the first basic task force longitudinal but worth studying. Okay, so I'm using this definition. Okay, so I'm using this definition. So, by saying that scalar curvature on the fixed manifold is of scalar curvature valuable below, if I can find an approximation which such that the approximation is in C0 topology while the scalar curvature of the approximation is the same. Okay, so this talks kind of natural. And then because we fixed the underlying space, we can we are we are able to, I mean, we can also rephrase it by replacing the ball button by some continuous function, etc. New sponsor except which makes the question localizing. Okay, but I only focus on uniform law bounds for the sake of competitiveness. Everything I said is localized and moving to some extent. Okay, but the question is, okay, I see this natural in the sense of continuous metric, but how natural is this and how natural we compare to the questions we raise, the positive mass reference problem, etc. Okay, and then also one of the main important criteria for this. Important criteria for this to be natural is if we impose the question on the torus, can we have rigidity? Okay, if we don't have rigidity or comparison geometry related to the scalar curvature, the smooth case and you're basically doing something minimum scale. Okay, so the first evidence on this setting is given by Umoth and alternative tool given by Barber says that, okay, in a smooth case, you can carry over this set. Can carry over this set, this information, passing the data. Basically, it said that the definition in that approximation scheme is exactly the same with the smooth category. So, even better now is the scale because we are interested only in a smooth pane, so we don't have to impose a small one there. So, everything just carries over to the name of the. So everything just carries off under the name. Even though your conversion is weak. Actually, it's localizable and just be lazy. Okay, so the proof of GoMOF is to reformulate the scalar coverage one of them below using non-existence of some code, which is related to the dihedral rigidity. You can, if scalar coverage is positive, then you. If scalar coverage is positive, then you can't find any local cube with a diagram angle less than the Nuclear one, etc. And then using the criterion by the Samaritan. And okay. And then the richer bomb is by which movement, which seems to be more flexible in some sense to me. Because it is more PDMI, at least I know how to do estim estimate. I don't know how to do estimate for both definition. For both definition. Okay, so let me uh try to uh give you a fair quick uh overview on which flow. So by which flow smooth, I actually mean which different flow because uh which we flow is uh the intrinsic, uh is diffeomorphic invariant. So it's it's more like if you're interested in intrinsic problem, you use which we saw if you are interested in extrinsic problem because we fix the underlying spaces so you should use something fixing the gauge which Bohr insigns in the so-called chin fix. Coins to the so-called G-dipsal, which is basically adding the d-dilative of some materials which correspond to the uh different morphism. As you can see, I am fixing some of the backbone stuff here, which is called G2. Okay, it's the ethomorphic to the standard retrieval flow. And why is this useful? Because the retrief flow is the best second variation of metric, which increases your scalar node. If you're focusing on Approach. If you're focusing on conformal, if you go back to the classical work of Nao Xuan Yao, you can see that they try to improve the scale approach using conformal method on the first eigenvalues of conformal La Passia. And then you can see that, okay, if you are using that variation of scalar curvature as the variation of matching, okay, then you make your problem difficult to I mean, you you make your life easier. You make a life easier to study the scalar curvature, but the hard part becomes the existing temperature flow. But pretending the existing armature flow is a standard way to improve the scalar curvature because the influence rate of scalar curvature is more increasing. But my son principle is it's a good time. So it makes you wonder, okay, scalar curvature model will be I mean sensitive to the switching flow. Is sensitive to the switching program. That's fine. Okay. So the main works, the main result of Pharma relies on the following field of Park and M. There are some generalizations by FunCat in the general setting. I put it here. The way I phrase it may be slightly different depending on who you are. I studied the paper on Mao at the very beginning, so I basically thought. At the very beginning, so I basically follow his style. But anyway, so the setting is like this. It's also generalizable to compute long-compact metric with certain bandwidth geometries, but I focus on the compared case for lenience. So if you're interested in continuous metric, which is epsilon close to some dead one, because it's continuous metric, I can always find something which is close to u plus move. Okay, then I can always deform the metric. I can always deform the metric using the G tutor along the matrix data flow such that if you are starting with continuous metric, then the flow will be reflecting the continuity here. And more than that, because of the volatility, the flow will be recognizing your matching in the sense of this one. So I put a small one here, which is well known to experts, although sometimes no one Model sometimes no one this time, the big small one here basically is measuring the threatness in some sense because you're so close to a continuous metric when you blow up the manifolds, you are C0 close to Euclid. And then when you blow it up at infinity, get back to Euclid space. Okay, but this is only C0, so you need some time for the flow to visualize what you're doing, which is the over here. So by Euclid space here, I mean smoke object. Because when you go up, you can't distinguish smoke metric and Euclid metric. The key point of their result is the uniqueness of this class of construction. So if you have a solution which is moved away from zero, as you can see, this moved away from zero. Okay, as you can see, this is moved away from zero unique. So the data solution will be unique within this class. It's very doing more than the application. And in particular, if you are given a smooth metric, smooth initial data, but at the same time you construct some smoothing. You construct some which is smooth away from zero but approximating your matching. But approximating your metric in the C0 topology, then this solution will be exactly the same with the classical solution. Okay, so if you are because smooth metrics still have got new metrics. Okay, so this is a very important point in the method. So let me just give you a quick outline how the robust theorem can be moved between VirgiPlow by Richifub. So, okay, because GI are continuously possible. Are continuously approximating some effect matching which is smooth. And in this case, you can fix the GQ time to be the targeting the limited metric, but or actually in general, you can just fix some reference comparing. So uh epsilon, the ep epsilon here is uh universal, only depending on that. Actually, it comes from the stability of the you take operator, when you linearize the When you linearize the flow. Okay, so you flow each approximation by the widget flow. Then the scalar curvature is flowed by its reserve, so that means. And then at the same time, we have regularity of the flow, so I can pass the approximate which is closed with the data, right? But of course, this is only true for positive time, but the scalar curvature is still preserved. Everything's good. Preserved, Facebook. But now, because of the uniqueness, I know the construct of matrix law in this way is exactly the same with the classic co-solution. So that means the classic co-solution have a scalar curvature low one for positive time, but I know it's smooth up to zero, so I can pass T to zero and this. So then you can see how flexible the met the the the the method is. The the flexibility just comes from stability of components. It just comes from stability of a P. Once you have some kind of, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They only relies on the exist time only relies on the GQ time because they're so close to each other. So everything is just one sign. It's like the stability of our Einstein matching in some sense, but matching more sizing. Or sizing. Okay, so you can see how flexible the method is. So Juan and myself observe this flexibility and replace the lower bound approximation by some kind of integral convergence. So at the very beginning, I thought it's so stupid, this integral convergence. It's not very interesting at this point. Okay, for me, At this point, ah, okay. For me, it's good to do something when I learn something. I okay, I have some observation. But after I did this, I realized it's actually related to possible masterscrew by Meal in some sense. Because if you take a look on Meiel's construction, it's basically saying that, okay, given the manifold with corner, with the assumption of mean curvature, we can construct the approximation of the metric in some sense, but you can't expect to. But you can't expect too much. You can't expect because you have toner, you have some singularity. You can't expect convergence. You can't expect that approximation with the scalar version or one is too much. But you can expect some kind of interpolable error to be so, which is the key part of Mail's instruction. Although Mails are using the conformal method to recover the positive scalar curvature metric or negative scalar curvature metric, but in this case, you can see that I can refer to. You can see that I can replicate the argument by using the first solution by the integration. So then I can get the same thing. So, in other words, that means in the definition, I take at the very beginning, although I'm using a false solution of scalar code to produce the node, but actually I can replace it by scalar code to produce the node in the interface, which is critical here because if you are from the PD point of view, the critical power is the NR, which is that. Power is the end up, which is best you can expect and best you can expect and more computation and for in the LP set is almost the best. Although you can talk about them more in tight sense. Okay, as I've said, this is related to positive massive thing alarm. And this is um one of the questions. I raise a third decay. I have big channel raised at the K. Okay, so now I'm going back to uh this question and ask how to relate two concepts together. Okay, so the question is to ask under what conditions of singularity, I still have some okay, still have some like like for dimension one case by now we have some we need some condition on the pin curvature across the traces, right? For dimension one cases, and then if the single value is for the And then, if the single diamonds quadimension 2 is related to the diagnostic, I think, okay, from my point of view, the reason why the quadimension 2 cases kind of unclear in general, but if you focus on the phases, then it's like and then I think the main observation by Sharon is to ask: okay, what if the single art? Okay, what if the single art is of hyacinth? By hyacin dimension, I don't mean the angle of faces. I mean, I don't mean the vertex of the triangle. I only mean some kind of isolated singularity. If we have some isolated singularity, which is a very high glucon, then they are supposed to have some restriction on course rigidity or positive mass. You have many things, constraints. things constrained from this co-dimension, high co-dimensions are. Of course, when Shayla asked the question, we even believe this continuous metric is not developed. It's sufficient to consider the Lipschitz metric, the area. Okay, so if I put it in a coherent setting, if I put it in my perspective, it's equivalent to almost. Is equivalent to almost equivalent, not to say equivalent, to ask: do we have scalago development below in this scenario? I mean, in the setting of the sense of a possibility, can we say that, okay, under what condition we have a percentage mean like this to define the scalar probability of R? Okay. If it does, then because of the argument, just I just sketch it's equivalent to say that I can find the richest approximation. Which is approximating, which approximate the G in the CCO topology. And because everything is smooth now, then the standard torus rigidity will automatically feel flatness of the floor. In particular, if you take a closer look on all the arguments, because you have some linear determines, then the conclusion you can draw is the metric G UKR, continuous metric. UK, continuous metric you interested in, is actually a full bed of flat metric away from some singular, away from a singular in UK. So, and then the far is the distance by soft or more if you are. You can get more information on the bar. So, in basically that said, after changing the smooth structure, the management will be standard type metric. Mention it phase in this. Okay. Okay. So the first result that I want to mention today is the confirmation of shining condition in continuous category. We say that yes, if the co-dimension is really bigger than two, then everything is invisible. If if the singularity is of high co-dimension, it's really larger than two thousand. Depending on how you define it. But Defining, but if you are interested in manifolding just for WPA or more, then the singularity is invisible. But the segmentification is that you need the continuous, you need to assume the battery is continuous, of course, the signal. Then the scale curves for negative sense of the approximation. So, in particular, you can find the uh if most available perception. Are we not saying this actually the matching is of a third matching across the same so the same result as I have said this motivated is based by strength for introspection they prove it okay I okay I spot this paper after that I'm in red so I that's why I work on this okay they are Charlie and They are um Charley and Stovman and Littius, they they they answer this question in three dimensions under the biliptuous concept. So in their case, because the dimension is uh is three and because the ambient space of uh three dimensions, so they only consider the isolated thing, and then their method for uh space on minimal surface. They they make use of uh classification of minimal surface in two dimensions, which is like Dimension, which is like most equated in their works. But in our works, I mean, which also works for monosymbli concept in variable. But I mean, of course, we have to replace the scalar coverage and all of our same stuff, right? So what you know we can use it to study um laws both. Yeah, maybe a quick form metric. Yeah, maybe from matching. Uh yeah, but yeah. Okay, so let me just say something about the tool here. The basic idea is the message principle works here. Takes me a while. So the excess statement is saying that okay, if the rigid interflow is about enough in the scaling band. Small enough in the scaling bare membrane, then if the code, if the singularity is of high co-dimension, then the scalar dimension load mine will be exactly like the smooth. Except now you fill up the singularity. Signal is gone. In fact, the the method also works for generic function, uh, as long as the punch and satisfy something which something like a scalar function can care. And you can carry over the argument. It's based on a top, I would say, a top maximum principle argument. You need to localize some error and some and patch them up. I mean, you need to localize the maximum principle at the same time, you patch up the error at the same time. So so that's why I said the also works for Yamami or Posin Yamami languages, but not for the positive Yamami. But not for the positive monthly. But as we see, as we know from our homework geometry, the positive monthly in very many cases. I don't know if it's limited. But for the negative part, it's true. Okay, so because what we are doing is basically smooth things. The same method for also folks, if we put it in the asymptotic style setting, was in massive setting. Setting was a master setting. So basically, it's just basically setting this which you saw is everything, but at the same time, I can designalize the singularity, singularity for dimension system. So TM and I did the case when the image is contiguous and then with tension and then we also consider some type of things which is related to. things which is native of high code of high uh sorry smaller code dimension but higher order recommend but anyway it's not high so in a smooth case the ADM ask is called excuse me sorry sorry let me go back to the previous slide please so this is the proposition that you used to prove your condiment tree result isn't it yeah sorry can you read it again because I couldn't follow oh sorry so the So in the classical case, we don't need anything. One, two, three, just automatically. And the classical case say that scalar dojo panel from the low. Once the widget flow, because the widget flow is kind of a changing, right? So so the scalar doji change a little bit. But this is a sharp one. If you compare with the Einstein macro hyperbolic metric, this is the sharpest things here. Yeah, Things you can get. You can just bear in mind the richer flow is sensitive to the scalar goggle information. So if you are working on Einstein management, everything is sharp. Maybe this is the sharp formulation. If you are focused on one ground, you are now then say that, okay, if we have singularity, then of course you don't expect everything to be true, and you can't apply Maximum principle for free. But if the rich flow is not smooth, but Richard flow is not smooth, but it's almost Euclidian in the sense of the scaling invariant coefficient. The delta here is measuring how flat the metric is, how fast the slope is set. Because when you scale by time, you are expanding your time to blow off the manuals. But if you are at the very beginning, you are a metric. At the very beginning you are a metric top, then of course you can't do anything. But when time scale everything is flat, I'm sorry, everything is on top. But if you are asymptotically metric, you hidden metric and you scale up, everything just becomes flat. So this the delta ES is measuring this phenomenon. Thank you for sharing the game. Okay, so all right. So the positive mass here. The positive master and the positive master case can carry over directly and some more fine control. And then in the non-smooth case, the ADM mass is not preserved, but it's actually long increasing faster than the smooth. It's a work of material and sanctity. In fact, they improve they improve the male and also. So Mel and also improves the vigilante. Actually, the co-dimensional one singularity is easier from the vigil model on top of the male construction because we have a lot of regularity of the virtual. The reason why this is difficult for high code dimension, but we care for regularity of the because we don't have much information of the vectorization. F thing is getting very mixed impression. Everything is getting very makes the question difficult. And I want to mention very quickly some later work, which I did with Jensen. So as I've said, the CCO, CCO information is basically saying that asymptotically, the metric is like the Euphen space. When you expand it, when you pull up, when it feels like your PDF space in the CCO setting. Okay, but because motivated by conjecture, try to. By showing the conjecture and try to this for other regularity for the L infinity metric, but weaker regularity, not weaker, not different, just different regularity. So I'm considering the W1N, which you can see that, okay, the basic model I want to do well is the metric code. This is the metric I want to do well. So, as metric code, no matter how you scale, you can't have New Kendallian tendency spaces, right? You just get something called. But if you impose W1N, then this part would rule out because it's not scaling this because W1N is scaling invariant, but it's scaling a variant in the first one. You will rule out the complexity. So basically, it said that if you are starting with some metric with slightly higher regularity, then you don't have many value, we have something like the CC metric which I think okay. So everything is the same except I just replace CCO by definitely one thing. Just replace CCO by everyone in almost almost. Okay, so I said that no one is measuring the products, but in everyone in a sense, not a single sense. It can't make sense of this thing. Okay, so then everything in the previous slide also carried over without any parser because it remains almost the same. Now the towers rigidity also holds, the boss and master and its corner also holds. Color also forms as long as the signal is high continuation. Okay, so yeah, but from the PD point of view, I don't know how to push it. I don't know how to push the W1 end because it's almost one of the best things regular that you can consider in general. In general. In general, I'm doing something in general, but specifically. Something in general but specific and apply this fancy apply this to Taurus setting for positive. They are not, I mean, the missing part is the torus does not play any role in the regulatory field. That's why I can't miss it. Okay, but anyway. Okay. So in the last ten or fifteen minutes I wanted to talk about a sphere, which is similar but different. Is steep or different. Okay, so what about the profosum? So basically, I said that the rigidity of sphere holes, if you are if you have speed, darmachine, if you have aerial or increasing scalar curve chain information, that's all. Okay, everything is here. So as you can see, spin is a topological information, something related to which flow. Richard flow, of course, is a which is space that are nothing space. Area, something mysterious. Exteriors and scalar curvature, perfect scalar culture use for matrix for guy, like me, I like it. Okay, but area is a best sub, okay, like the like the motivation and can we remove the regularity? Is the regularity making some difference? Geometry, of course, uh in order to make sense of area or scalability, you can you need to. You can, you need to differentiate and check, consider the eigenvalue, etc. So, and scalar curvature differentiate. Okay, so more precisely, but at the same time, the scalar curvature, I can replace it by the notion I just introduced, the approximation scheme. Okay, but because, okay, for area, it's rather difficult. If you wish, you can still define it by. If you wish, you can still define it by uh by the Lipschitz field, but let's consider Lipschitz uh the distance case. The distance can be defined by also some this Lipschitz map, no need differentiation period there. Then he asks, okay, if the map is a distant non-increasing continuous map with non-zero degree, is under the assumption speed scalar curvature, can we still have a nice moment? have a ice mark or watching yeah yeah so the the first part is uh concerning map with a weaker vector and then more generally you can consider matching also with a weaker vector okay okay well okay i i i know this question of more after i studied okay actually i came and i are motivated by this question which based by she This question which raised by she when she finished a new bubble paper and sent it to him and I and I okay maybe I can throw it that is why I mean I mean because I'm a full guy I thought everything I tried to for everything and try to get something okay so so he asked the following question which is also discussed by her he says that okay if g is a metric on the hemisphere uh satisfying the the both conditions scalar merging pattern from the null link emergent functions from the sphere Null, make average funnel from the sphere because of null, and then the metrics function from the sphere. And then we conclude there are some predicted C of C. We know without this metric lower bound, we can't conclude anything because of the NENO contentious contact number. But with this, everything is different, more vigilant. So, why is it related to the singular setting that for both ways? Because if you take the double length, If you take the doubling, because your hand is here, you can just take the doubling and then glue them together, identify the boundaries, then scalar curvature is still bound from below. It seems lower bound because of the mean curvature information. It's actually in the distributional sense if you are using Danny's interpretation of scalar curvature. And then in particular, it implies our sense. And of course, the doubling will preserve the lower bound. The double line will preserve the normal metric, right? Because everything is the same. Okay, so this is a singular metric with the it's a singular version of a Laplace theorem. So if the singular version of Laplacian works, then we automatically have which is great when you finish everything. We have a bigger sound and one line tools. Okay, and more generally, if you are interested in cap, then you just replace it by. Then you just replace it by the same argument, but you need some information of the value. In particular, in this case, we need a percentage of metric, but in order to make sure the catching doing is metric. Right? Okay. So the main result is the confirmation of combo transition. We say that, okay, if M. We say that, okay, if M is a closed V manifold with fixed underlying space, G is a continuous metric with the same scalar film to normal in the weak sense that I use. Suppose F is a mapping, which is a distant or increasing map, such that the degree is long-zero, then the F is a distant isol. So that means the geometry is not related to the map. So the same result is also proved by CCD, uh, Hankey and uh Thomas. Hanky and uh Thomas, where they prove uh slightly different statement. I mean, yeah, their our statement is different for them, uh, depending on who you are, depending on which field you are, knows the comparison of the strain. Okay, so they their method is based on reproving by the debug operator developing the singular theory on the debug approach. Oops, while that one is five, like my title of docs. Yep, I did a smoothing. Okay, but the question is why you can do this. Why the smoothing is sensitive to this setup? So the scalar coverage is perfect. The scalar coverage is basically sharp for pitchfork. It's best I mean, FFT, I mean, because uh VGF is basically defined by Picture flow is basically defined by taking the variation of the scalability and using it to definitely define the information. But why the distance is weak? Because the following important observation. So, I put it in a smooth case because the singular case just makes it more complicated, but nothing's near. Okay, so the smooth case say that, okay, if we are, let's say the G is smooth, let's say the Smooth, let's say the F is also smooth, very smooth, except I care about the sharp constant. Then, if we have a metric, smooth metric, G and the map, I don't fix it. I should evolve it by the homolema flow. So, GT is the flow on the M, but H T is the standard shrinking sphere, because I'm comparing everything to the sphere. And I just flow it by a standard picture. And then I just flow it by a standard which source of the sh here. Then I take gt and xt and at the same time because everything is a good it's just the API well control now everything is the existence field of gt and xt are just well known, right? Then I take the map between them and flow it by the amount of value. And then if initially the distance is not increasing, so in the tensorial sense, that means the f-star fix is smaller. Sense that means the F star is smaller than G's Paul noise. And this is seven of the retreat, another harmonic map before couple. So if you are familiar with the harmonic map PFL, you need some information on between geometry because the harmonic map PFL is basically like the heat equation. You need Vichy information to play the bottom line, right? But if you're familiar with the Victory Flow, then Victory Flow, one of the very critical features can display. Feature is can explode the bottom of the life much easier. But of course, you're shifting the bottom to your existent fit, which makes the surgery very comfortable. But if you only focus on the short-time behavior, then there's no cost from here. Okay, so basically, just that the distance law increasing is under the general case, when f case when F is not smooth and Lipschitz map because it's distant on increasing Lipschitz map by definition and I just apostomate by smooth button except okay using the method of winning because in a comparison geometry like the distance function is not smoother on on the whole manifold right if you have beyond the interjective radius everything is false but some there's some time small smooth There are some times for smooth of course for for the PD message perspective, it's not a big task. But if you're interested in something else, like just a function to construct some density film, put some density film or some kind of style in manifold stuff. Then you need some smoothness on the exhaust function. Then the green moves apostation scheme basically said that all the Basically, it says that all the functions like this have this move file which preserves the test servers like passing information. And then in this case, we just replace it by the map, which almost the same expression because the manager is complete. It's cheap and easy. Then we can, because I can approximate IFI, then I just want the topology mapping for to get to get the approximation. The the main point is if The main point is in the homolemic key flow, this estimate, of course, this estimate is interesting when talking about the La Bush and the CM. But in the harmonomy flow theory, it gives you the gradient estimate of the flow. You can push trap it automatically. Once you have the gradient estimate, you can push trap it to higher order without any trouble like any pressure. The harmonic flow the factor of regular Only flow, the threshold of regularity is C1. Of course, in the general case, you can't get anything for free, but in this case, I can get it for free. In the general case, you need to do propoli analysis because you don't have to top a free or you take care of the target handle. But in our case, I don't care. It's so nice. It's a sharp, it's actually one. So I can get rid of one and then pass it in and then and then to attain which attainer you need some data in the CCL form. Some data in the CCO or CCO involves that. In particular, okay, to sum up the smoothing part, say that I can construct the harmonic mapping slope. I mean, the way I approximate I can approximate my smooth one, which converge back to the initial data. Okay. For that they did be such that the pictures Such that the victorious constant is still one, same as the initial one. This is just a regular normator, okay. So, and then but the place is smooth, so f is a distant isolation for most. In particular, if you let t go to zero, that means the f is an isom, small f is an isomer. And then, everything I said has nothing to do with the spin just then do it small. Spin just can do it for a few things. I mean, as long as you have a slow like this, but in use of data like this, I can go okay. Okay, the reason why this is interesting also is because the book's not uh the smooth is not related to the spin geometry, so it's it's also related to the next the general question that I point out here. So now keep in mind the smooth lane has nothing to do with the The smoothing has nothing to do with the spin geometry. Keep this in mind. Even if you don't care for smooth stuff, the smoothing is still one of the bad parts you can use. Okay, so this is related to the following question, which is the La Bros film without the speed. Actually, I think this is one of the big problems with scalar measurement capability. Because the La Bruce film, there are some proof using the bigger bubble. There are some proof using the bigger bubble in 3D, but not in high-dimensional, you don't have any method to do it. So that's why the speed muscle is very crucial. But in three dimension, you have three types of massive like us. You have movable like Robota Shi, you have speed geometry, uh it's automatically spin so everything's good. You have a lot of left but behind dimension. You're in trouble, you don't have anything. You're in trouble, you don't have any friends except the spin, so you need to assume the spin. Okay, but if you believe the contrast is if you believe the film, the sphere is so rigid, then the spin should be automatic, right? Because at the end, the f is isometry. That means the value is CM, which is mean automatically, so you don't believe the speed is a usual assumption if you don't. Okay. So, this is a question. What about the speed? Question about the speed. Okay, but okay, if you keep this in mind and using our method, then it saves the point. It's the problem with the speed is actually Q for the positive part. If you are able to pull out the map such that the sphere curve is strictly bigger than the sphere, then you are done. Just like uh the s the force rigidity is put by minimal surface. Because minimal surface can't see the rigidity at the very beginning, right? The rigidity at the very beginning. The spinable surface can be only used to rule out the positive state in the power surface. You rule out the rigid power and then you play the game of a normal change and then say that, okay, if you don't have positive state of knowledge, then the mechanism is optimized. Play it again, which is how much it is. Now, because of our method, I can do the same things. Now, if you are not nine is nine, Now, if you are not 90 straight, then the switch is most moving to say that, okay, then scale curvature will be switched a little bit more while preserving the distance not increasing. Or you can do it another way, one like distance decreasing. The distance decreases here or increasing, it becomes distant increasing. Things like that, depending on what you want to fix. That means the initial rejectity condition, which is kind of Is uh kind of uh simplified. If it's iron style, it is a lot of iron style. Because the iron stanking is so trivial, that's fixed. You can apply uh heat flow, conversion geometry, or mid-goverth flow, and then you can draw a conversion for eye-sign case. So that's why uh yep, that's why the the the question becomes simpler, and that is what's done recently by C C D One and C CD1 and C in four dimensions. They rely on the fact that 3D is a spin-down so that they can somehow make use of our method to say to go back to the question in this form so that they can use the new work on the signal by and also by 3D question. By five by 3D results. Because 3D, you have a lot of results on Speedy, you don't have a lot of yourself, so draw control. So let me stop here and thank you for their questions, please at the beginning of your slides. I just want to know: do you need to assume? So, do you need to assume metric G near the singularity side of the infinite? Maybe. No, look, the conjecture only assumes high co-dimension, and by ellipsis. Billipsis is that means a G. Oh, I haven't put it in. The G is a part of below and above. It's not G it's also oh yeah, yeah, I see. Yeah, it's one from below above. So I I think I don't have a put in there. I think I don't have a so only L is only L. So that means a G, okay, the simplest is you have spontaneity, but across the point, the metric is a measurable section of the tensor, which is spun from below and above. So it's a uniform uniform unique. That's why you can that's why the That's why the minimal surface method is possibly useful. Does your argument still work for optimally manifold? I mean, not only the torus. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but we need to call the multi. But the L infinity, I mean, intuitively, you don't expect the same. Intuitively, you don't expect the same smoothing happens because every infinity in the B model that you need to grow is like this. The tomb is not continuous with some kind of asymptotically, you still have commands. So, but the rich flows would make if you want to do the same things like I mean yeah this one. If so, the cone angle, if you have some cone angle, you don't expect the second one because the second one basically. Because the second one basically measures because basically say that the co-engine is small. If the coengu is small, then I mean if the Lipschitz constant is small, then well you can do it. Thank you. Are there more questions and comments? Could you come back, please, to one of the slides where you mentioned the regulatory On the regular the W1N regularity of the metric okay, like this. Okay, I was just wondering if it's true that if in this case you have a distributional lower bound on the scalar curvature if the n is based by p, then you have okay and okay, and if it's the case and you do have the distribution lower bound on this kind of pervert. Distribution lower bound on this kind of pervert. I mean, you can define it, but you don't have. I don't know if they're equivalent. I mean, you can still define Danny's. Actually, if you take a look on Danny's paper, if you define it, you only need L infinity and W12, I think. Okay, but the question was: in this case, the rich flow does it give you itself. Yeah. In fact, if you take a look on his paper, he said that. Paper, he said that okay, to define it, you don't need too much to get reasonable rigidity, you need more IC. Okay, yeah, so this was the thing, and then I got another one that should be no, this was about that technical proposition Virginia asked something about before, the one with the three DCs, okay? Then you said that with similar techniques you got the PMT or animated. To the PMT theory and make the next slide, right? Okay, I was just wondering if in order to prove this, you have to check that the three conditions there hold. Yes. Okay, so this was the point. So in this case, you can check that you have a rich flow satisfying the assumptions. These three assumptions here. Yes. Okay. More or less, yeah. But except you need to take care of the AOI infrastructure. So they are not the difficulties. Okay. Okay. Thank you. In fact, okay, let me just one other. In fact, okay, let me just point out another live instead. Okay, the witch it detects flow smoothing has nothing to do with the competitors. As long as you have a geometry in which you are comparing, it's automatic geometry. Yeah, as long as it's good, then it's fine. Because AF is automatically good, which means it's good. I mean, infinity is the bad part, but at infinity, if it's AF, then it's almost like you clear it. You don't care too much. You don't you don't care if you watch can you have something? No, it's so please just curiosity. Um is there some relationship you could comment about the URL result and the dorm screen construction that we saw yesterday. Maybe maybe in one Maybe maybe in one so so what would happen when someone you've got to take it to the limit. So when when you something to stop at some point that you're trying to okay, that is another question. It's another big topic. But when Kaishu talks about it, we it's a long story. It's an entirely different setting for us. You can't use the same setting to discuss it because the draw string is Then, because the draw string is L infinity, it's an L infinity construction. I mean, you can do it in an L infinity way. I mean, the of course I kind of shoot the you can do it in a crazy way, you lost everything, it's the L infinity loss. Go to zero anyways. If you use this perspective, you can't use the field here. But when naturally the lead is not easy, and when we talk about this, we have the pretty false moving on this sensing. From distance, but based on the entropy perspective, we, in that construction, and I haven't checked the three-dimensional case, but in four-dimension, we can prove that the entropy is small, arbitrary. In the sense that, so in this case, there are some comparisons. So, okay, so you can see that there is a RT. Okay. It's related, but okay, so the O one here is small, small, it's saying invariant. So this one is discretion, but anyway, just pretend it's increasing. So this small one, small one, say that the initial data is close to the opinion state as much as possible. Which based on this fact, we call it simple. But in the draw string setting, you don't expect the same things, but Things, but the vitriol flow can see the entropy, or alternatively, we can use the isometric constant. If the isometric constant is so close to Euclidean, the vitriol flow can feel it and smooth it instantaneously, which have the same constant here. Actually, it's 01, I mean not 01, depending on how small the edge is. So, in the four-dimensional setting, in the draw string, it's four-dimensional settings. One that reaches draw string will disappear. Because it's still enough interface structure. In a crazy case, you can get something like at the very beginning, you have some like the test C cap metric, like some crazy stuff. But once you want the red hold of the metadata, we get the penis rate. I'm not sure if I'm answering it, but there's something crazy. Depending on the main problem is you don't have this one. You don't have this one. You have something. So I guess do you have something else? We just do the PDP conference stuff. Thank you. Other questions? Bernier proof will use the two-dimensional free assumption, but we also think it could be true with this. You can build the most important outputs and the same. Yeah, it's true. Actually, the proof works whenever the mean cost key upper dimension is basically strict. As long as it's two plus epsilon, it's mean cost key upper dimension. I forgot the name, mean cost C is something dimension. There's so many dimensions so many dimensions that people call it, but I think the mean cost key upper dimension. Strictly less than, strictly bigger than three signs. Thank you. Okay. More questions or comments? Okay. If not, let's thank Guan Chun again. Let's go for lunch and we start again at two here.
