Today I'll talk about some recent results on mass inequalities and the talk a bit on my recent works. And I think the topic is a little bit focused, so I'll present the talk in a slightly detailed way. So the arrangement is as follows. Is as follows. Okay, in the first part, I will introduce what is a syntax effect manifold and I will review previous known mass inequalities. Then I will talk about recent developments mainly motivated by the Luversian conformal geometry, where we need to generalize the mass inequality for a more general class of manifolds. Of manifolds, and then there, I mentioned a conjecture, so-called the mass system inequality, which will maybe be clear later. Yes. And in the final part, I will introduce some progress on the mass system. So speaking with the first part, actually, a symphonically flat manifold is motivated by general relativity. Relativity and roughly speaking, we have the following intuition. Okay, if there is no substance in our space, then our space should be isometric to the flat space, namely the linear space. If there is a substance, then it will cause it bending. In geometric language, it will cause curvature, but the effect just decays as distance increase. So this just gives the Just gives the model how space is introduced flat because, okay, the effect decays so around infinity, the space should approach the Euclidean space. And this is just the definition of what's in total fat manifold. The strict definition is as following. A complete remaining manifold with dimension no less than three is. Dimension no less than three is called asymptotically flat if it satisfies the following conditions. Okay, the first one for topology, we uh there is a compact set K such that the complement of K consists of only finitely many ends and each end is diffimorphic to R minus a ball. So on each end we already have the Euclidean coordinates, then we can express. Then we can express the metric to metric components, and we require the metric components as approach delta ij in the order mu up to the second derivative. And here we apply the decay order mu strictly greater than minus over two. And the third one for the curvature, we need to apply the scalar curvature to be integrable. To be integrable and on a sympathetically flat manifold, there are several geometric qualities can be researched. The most important one is from physical consideration. And this is called ADMS. And let's E be a simple degree of flat end. There we can define. Okay, no, I mean their definition of ADM mass is given by a flux integral of some vector period across the infinite sphere. Here, infinite sphere means you take larger and larger coordinate sphere, and then you compute the flux, and then you take the limits. Since there is a limit process, so okay, why? So, okay, why this is well defined? And here I just mentioned, since the scale culture has very nice divergence structure, if you compute the vector field in the ground, if you compute this divergence, and you can write it as a scalar culture plus high order terms. And from here, you know why we needed to write a scalar code. Why we needed to require the scalar curve to be integral, and then we also put some requirements on the default mu. It's just to guarantee the ADM method we are defined. And the several examples, the first trivial example is the Euclidean space. In this case, it only has one end and the metric component j. So all the derivative vanishes. All the derivatives vanish, so you can compute directly the editing mass is there. And the next slightly non-trivial example is the Schmashutt manifold. The underlying space is M minus the region, and the metric is given by this conformal form. And it has two ends. One corresponds to the original, one corresponds to the infinity. correspond to the infinity and both ends you can compute like the 80 masses to m and although this is not directly seen from the expression the schwa should manifold has a evolution yes you can just imagine it as the catenoid if you are familiar with the minimum surface and and the fixed set of Fixed set of the evolution is the only area minimizing capacity surface in it. Yeah, so this is about the structured manifold. And related to the mass system conjecture, I'll introduce another geometric quantity called a separation system. And the separation system The separation system is just defined to be the area infimum of separations. So, what is the separation? Once you give an and E, the separation of E is illustrated in these two pictures. Namely, okay, we just the separation of E is just a separating hypersurface. Just separates the end E from other parts. And we require E to be the only end separated. So there are two cases. If there is only one end, you can take an arbitrary separating surface, just as in the first picture. If you have multiple ends, then, okay, in the second picture, the blue one is the middle ball separation. Middle bowl separation while the red one is not since the red one not only separating the end e and it's only separating an extra end on the right hand side. Yeah, so okay, the separation set of as I mentioned before is defined to be the area in the model of the separation of E. Okay, also let us look to example the Euclidean space. Example of the Euclidean space, since it only has one end, then by definition, the separation system is zero because you can take an arbitrary small geodesic sphere, then it's only separating, the only one handy. For structured manifold, since it has two ends, if we look at where ends, then you'll find that the separation is exactly the area of the. The area of the unique area minimizing hypersurface namely the fixed state of the evolution. Yeah, so this will be used later. Before we go to mass state inequality, we will review some previous non-mass inequality. Okay, the first one is for the Riemannian polymer. Okay, since the The theorem without spin condition was proved by minimal surface methods, so there will be some regularity issue. So here I introduce the notion n star to denote the dimension where the generic regularity for area minimizing hypersurface in geometric merit theory falls. And now we know n star can be taken to be any integer no greater than 10. So I mean once I use the notion n star, it means n star is an integer gradient. Okay, now the remaining quality mass theorem can be stated as follows. As follows. This is if m n star g is a symptomically flat manifold, of course, of course, it doesn't need to be complete. If it has non-negative scalar curves, then for each NE, the ADMS should be non-negative. And if the ADMS vanishes for some NE, then the manifold is still, yeah. The manifold itself should be isometric to the Euclidean space. And the theorem in three dimensions was first proved by Shung Yao. They use minimal surface method. And later, Britain used a spin method with an additional spin software. And since all three dimensional manifold are spin, so we can see within the We can see we can give an alternative proof in the three dimensions. Yes, and later, Xiong developed the non-compact dimension decent arguments. So he can generalize the dimension to be, okay, no greater than 10. And these are all non-compact methods. And in 1999, I can look at I could look and find a competition argument. If an asymptotic manifold has negative mass, then you can generate circuit formula metric and do some clothing, then you can construct some partial scalar curvature metric on T on connected some uniform and Taurus connects some with some manifold and yes. And yes, this is the competitive fishing method. And based on the competitive fishing method, I think Xungyao in 2017, they play the can handle the Riemannian product in all dimensions. This is the history about Riemannia product mass. And the next one is the Riemannian apparent inequality. And currently, we know this theorem let M G be a completely manifold with compacting a boundary and only when N E. The NE is asymptotically flat. F Mg has non-negative curvature and the boundary is minimal and automatically. And automated mining. Automated mining means if you take another hypersurface which encloses the region with the boundary, the hypersurface should have larger area. So if we have these conditions, then we know the ADM mass of the NE has a partial or boundary, which bounded below by some constant involving. Some constant involving the area of the inlet boundary. And the equality force is found only if the manifold is isometric to the half-school manifold. I am mentioning this at the yeah. Let me first answer this, okay. How to this okay? Um, I believe it is true, but uh, in current uh uh research, I think we don't know because uh uh you prove this you need to use the flow method and you at each time you need to find an air-minimized hypothesis. So you need to deal with infinitely many possible signals. Many possible having minimum hypersurface. So, this is not. I don't know whether this can be handled by generic regularity. I think for this remaining personal equality, currently there is no speed method. I think there are There are a similar type inequality, but not this accurate one. So here are some related works. Quisk and AMA use inverse mean curvature flow. They handle the three-dimensional case, but they need a further substance. They need the boundary to be connected and some homology vanishing condition. And then at the brain. And then at the brain, he develops a conformal flow for asymptotic flat manifolds. And then he can use the Gauss Bond formula. He can prove the three-dimensional case. And later, Danny finds, okay, the use of Gauss Bonus formula is not necessary. So Brian Lee just develops the conformal follow to the dimension of relationship. The dimension of interaction. And yeah, I also mentioned recently there are some non-linear potential methods to prove the Riemannia inequality. Yeah, in three-dimensional case with some traditional assumption. Oh, I want to comment this for a symposium that manifold. For a symptom flat manifold, right? Although it will have, may have multiple ends, since all ends is a symptom flat, you can find a separating area minimizing surface to separate one asymptotic flat end. Then you can apply the Riemannian paralysis body. So in this sense, Riemannia parasitic body is a quantitative version of Riemannia body actually. So I mean, for So I mean for the classical symptoms that manifolds, you know, Riemannian pairs in part and then Riemannian party matters are unified, and this is a more quality. And we'll see, okay, this is not the case if we consider more general class of simple. Yeah, so so now I'll uh So now I'll introduce the motivation to generalize previous mass inequalities. Another motivation comes from the conformal geometry when we consider the reversion for locally conformal flat manifolds. Yes. Yes, let me just first introduce the history for the reverse theorem. History for the Liverpool theorem for locally conformed flat manifolds. And it says FMG is a complete locally conformable flat manifold with non-negative scale curvature, and it has a development map from M to Sn then five needs to be injected, and that means it has to be embedded. Oh, yes, for all of this theorem, okay, that's a very big. For all this theorem, okay, at the very beginning, Shunya developed a method. They introduced a conformal invariant. Yeah, I want to give the accurate definition. I just generated by D. Okay, at that time, they already know if the invariant is strictly less than a minus two squared over n, when n is no less than five, then it's true. And in dimension three and four, additionally, you know, the scalar curvature has an upper point, it is also true. And as another approach, they also reduce the various theorem to some generalized positive math. I will introduce in the next slide. And at that time, they can prove that actually the invariant must be okay. Must be okay, not greater than over two. So you can compute when n is no less than seven, then you can use the one to conclude the reverse theorem. While okay, in lower dimension, it's it was unsolved. So it remains. So it's really best to prove a generalized remote probative method in the dimension and no greater than six. And then I will introduce what is the generalized Riemann policy method. The general generalized remote party considers more general class of asymptotic fat manifolds. And in the paper, later Ugo Yao, they call it a symptomic fat manifold. For this symptomatic fact manifold with objects. But more accurate name should be a completely Riemannian manifold with a distinguished particular platinum. Yes, namely, okay, we have a complete Riemannian manifold and we only focus on it when which is a sympathetic flat. This is natural. If you think the statement of the Riemannian political master, every time we are just focusing on where a symptomatic effect manifolds are generalized to this general setting, it is natural to ask whether your manual polymath theorem also holds. And the generalized computer metaphor mastering state has fallen if okay, it's almost the okay, the same statement. I will repeat that and related works for related works, okay. And later, they prove a density theorem, which is uh Which is a deformation method to deform general asymptotic effects manifold to asymptotical Schwash without affecting much on the mass. Anyway, they prove a density theorem just to reduce the general asymptotically flat case to the asymptotic washio case. And for me, I just okay. I just okay do the sorry the type of I do the low type of compactification I just reduce the generalized last case to the next okay generalized Kiros conjecture which is raised by Lilu Boyang's paper as another poetry to the Liberal system and then for generalized Kiros conjecture there is also some work to actually prove uh yes Uh, yes, verify this conjecture up to dimension, okay? And uh, and uh, you must be in case one and john they they prove the generalizing aptimation, okay. Uh, from the time you can see, although the original plan is to handle the Liberation by Riemannic positive mass or generalized Riemannian positive mass theorem, but the second approach was The second approach was the competition early. So, okay, you can forget about what I say just now. Just remember that now our object becomes completely manifold with a distinguished sympathetic fat editing. And in this case, something Something bad happens. Remember, I said that for classical symptomic flat manifolds, Riemannian polymath and the Riemannian pairs in equalities are compatible. But in a symptomically flat manifold without train case, this is not. And if we can find And if we can find some concrete example, okay, here I just present you the extreme RM space. It is given by R3 minus the origin equipped with the matrix. Okay, in this form. This is very similar to the structural manifold, except the power is replaced by two. And in this case, you will find this manifold with two ends. One is a symptom. Two ends. One is asymptotically flat, and another is asymptotically cylindrical. So if you look at slice, the slice just shrinks start from the asymptotic fact and all the way to the sequential end. So there is actually a mean convective correlation on this. So you cannot find a separating. Find a separating minimum surface to reduce this case to the classical Riemannian proximity quality. Yeah, so this is my motivation, namely the generalized Riemannian positive maximum seems not compatible with the classic Riemannian parsing equality. So I want I want I want to unify these two things. So this is the motivation to the mass system inequality. And the idea is like this, although the minimum surface we cannot see in this manifold, but recall in remaining pairs of inequality, we only use the area of that minimum surface. And that area actually can That area actually can be approximate by the area of this separating surface. You just take the area infimum of the separating surface, then you can see that area. So this gives you the mass system inequality conjecture. It says F M G E is an asymptotical flat manifold with a distinguished With a distinguished symptom flat and E, and it has a non-negative state of H. Then we have this Paris inequality, Paris type inequality. The difference here is the area of the inner boundary is replaced by the separation system. And we can also hope the following rigidity results, namely when the equality holds, there are two case. There are two case. In the case when the separation system is zero, then empty is the Euclidean space. If the separation system is positive, then there should be some separating sphere such that on one side of the sphere, okay, the manifold is the half-schmatch. Yeah. Yeah. So some comments. Comments roughly speaking, okay, this indeed unifies the generalized Riemannian positive mass and Riemannian Paulson equality. Okay, in the Riemannian Paulson equality, you just need to do a doubling. If you have an automated dividing inner boundary, then after doing the doubling, you compute the separation system. It's exactly the area of the original inner boundary. Know inner boundary. So yeah. Yeah. So so so so so I mean I I mean I mean conjecture I can conjecture the more the general case. But to the proof that uh like Like the inverse mean curve should follow me that they may have technical subjects. Okay, this is just my conjecture. And this may be related to the stability problem. I mean, as mentioned in Sven's talk, he said when we consider the stability problem for remanufacturing. Stability problem for remaining quality master. We may have regions without any control, so we need to cut them out and consider the convergence of the remaining part. And here, this conjecture just says this is not only happens when you consider stability problem. Even in the rigidity problem, you need to cut some part of where you have. Part of we understood you have the control of the remaining part, so this is the point, and some progress on this conjecture and then yeah, I hope I'll say my two works, the first one is deal with the separation system equals to zero case. And the second one is deal with the Deal with the positive separation system case, but okay, in very special case. Yes, I just prove some conjecture in some very special case to give some evidence. Okay. Yeah, so namely for R3 minus the origin. Minus the origin. I can verify the separation super conjecture. This is it. I'll go into the details. And okay, the brew is divided into parts. One is for the inequality and another is for the rigidity. For the equality, For the equality, we use approximation scheme of real bubbles. And the starting point is the ADM of FalkiMass inequality. Remember, I just say, okay, Fisk and El Men, they developed weak investment culture flow to prove parents' inequality. And actually, in their case, they don't need the The inner boundary to be minimal. They can allow the inner boundary to be not to be minimal. So I just state the general result here. This is in three dimensions, Mg is a completely manifold with compact unit boundary and a unique end E, which is a symptomically flat. Which is a symptomic flat. Fm has non-negative scalar curvature and satisfies the homology vanish condition. And the boundary is connected and automatic, then we have the following inequality. And a slight difference here is something, yes, sometimes involving the mean curvature appears. So when the mean curvature is zero, that happens. Not going to happen. So it's back to the remaining pair of single. Yeah. For me, okay, the strategy is also the following. Although we may not find a minimal surface, namely h equals to zero. H equals to zero surface. We can find h equals to small constant surface. Then we apply the ADM M mass, ADM Hawking mass inequality. And if we can guarantee the mean coefficient to be arbitrarily small, then we prove the inequality. So the plan is to find a, you know, for every small positive content, so we find Small positive content we find a three-ball containing the region, then we consider m okay. We call m is r3 minus the region. So I just consider r3 minus omega epsilon. And for this manifold, I apply the ADMAS inequality. And as I mentioned before, if you want to handle the turn involving scalar curvature, you need to guarantee two things. First, you need to obtain a First, you need to obtain a uniform upper bound of partial omega epsilon, and the second, you need to guarantee the mean curvature. It's equal to epsilon. Okay. Yeah, so I introduced the Mu Barb method. And Mu Barbara method usually considers remaining a band. Here, we just focus on the region bounded by. On the region bounded by partial negative and partial positive. And yes, this is called a Riemannian band because it has a top partial negative and it has a bottom partial positive. And we also need a smooth function on this Riemannian band. With these things, we can consider the following function. Okay, take any separation. Take any separation, separating hypersurface, which bound a region omega with partial positive, then we can consider functional given by the area of sigma plus the integral of h in the region omega. And the existence theory just needs some, you know, barrier conditions. We need We need if we take h positive h negative to be the mean curvature of the boundary of this band with respect to outer unit normal, then the barrier condition rates on partial positive we need the h is less than h positive and on partial negative we need the h is greater than minus h negative. And in our case, okay, right hand. In our case, right-hand side is asymptotically flat. So partial-positive is mean convex. So if you want to guarantee the barrier condition there, you can take it to be a small party constant around the partial positive. While on partial negative, this is the arbitrary end. So we don't really have don't really had have any control on the mink of h minus so we needed to allow h to blow up blow up to positive infinity so this is roughly this set of the mu bubble problem okay in our use we set the party boundary to be some large coordinate sphere which is mean convex and And the partial negative will be some blow-up set of some function which will even below. Okay. The function h, the prescribing function h will be some modal function composed with a distance function. The modal function looks like this. It's in this. In this form, and the picture looks okay. It's degrees from part infinity and approach epsilon. Yes, and here I introduce another parameter, bit. When beta is larger than the whole graph will shift into the left. So, uh, you see, okay, um, party boundary, okay, the prescribed function h will close to epsilon since epsilon is take to smaller than h positive. So, when we take a beta large enough, we can always carry the barrier condition of positive positive and positive negative. Negative, yes, since it's blow up, it's also the various function. So we have the existence of mu bubble, but the problem is like this, because actually this function h will be the prescribed mean curvature of that hypersurface. And our goal is to guarantee the hypersurface to have very small mean curvature. But here, when we guarantee the existence of the mean curvature, The existence of the mu bubble, we need a lot of prescribing counting to blow up. So, why in this case, the mu bubble will have small mean curvature? This is the question. So, we'll explain why. This is there are two parts. The first part infrastructs the polity of the separation system. Namely, by By direct functional comparison, you can know the volume of the region bonded by the mu-bubble and partial positive will have upper bound. This upper bound is just given by the area of biopositive. So the separate system means, okay, the slides always have positive area bound. Quality of area bound. So, you know, at least there is a point on the bubble which should be close to part of. Yeah, so this is the distance estimates. Oh, yeah. Here we also needed to use the edge. The function edge actually has a positive lower bound epsilon. Yes. Yeah, so you have distance control, then next you need to have diameter control. So this is. control so this is uh uh due to our construction of the prescribed function h actually we we prescribe some positivity on when we construct the the function h and this will go into the analysis of the segment variation finally we'll see uh for the uh mu bubble we actually uh the the first eigenvalue of minus map The 30 eigenvalue of minus la plus plus Gaussian curve transit lower bond, and this will cause two things. The first thing is the mu bubble is actually sphere, and the second thing its diameter actually founded from above. Yeah. So, with these two things, we know the mu bubble will always contain a fixed In a fixed neighborhood of the partial positive, no matter how large the constant beta is chosen to be. So in this case, we can let a bit tend to infinity, beta tend to infinity, namely the prescribed function, okay, always shifting to the left. And finally, the prescribing function will be constant function epsilon. So finally, So finally, when we let the beta tend to infinity, we actually find a constant minker surface. And this is our desired separation surface. And from the construction, you just compare the functional, you'll see it has uniform area bound A0. A0 is just Zero is just the area of partial positive. And the interval has constant curvature, and it is embedded to sphere. And in R3, embedded two sphere always bound for, so we know outside the topology is R3 minus four. This is also satisfies the homology vanishing condition. So we have like the Hawking, yes, Hawking ADM mass inequality and. ADMS inequality and the proximation program is done. But something is cheating here because we may have the mu bubble to have multiple components. So there is some component picking arguments involved. Actually, one thing I can say, in our set of mu bubble, there is only components enclosing the origin. The original as a second picture. Okay, I won't bother you on more attention on this point. So, let's have to go next. Go next. Okay, the second part is the rigidity. And in this case, we have to find the separation sphere. And when we look back at the distance estimate and the diameter estimate, you'll find when epsilon tends to zero, the distance. The distance bond or the diameter bond will blow up. So, you have the following intuition. When epsilon tends to zero, then your bubble may be shifted to the arbitrary end on the left-hand side. So, you may not have any limit. It just has the previous example, right? Previous kind example. In this case, you can find approximation mu bubble, and you let the mean curve tend to zero, then it goes to the infinity on the left-hand side. So we must realize how the equality of this inequality came to play. And the point is that when Is that when we have the equality of this inequality, actually we will have improved area upper bond for new bubbles. Recall, in previous arguments, we have the area estimates. Okay, we know the area of the approximating mu bubble is bounded by A0. Bounded by A0. A0 is just the area of partial quality. But when we have this inequality, then we can compute that, okay, the area of the approximating mu bubble will not greater than the separation system plus some epsilon squared 10. And this is the key to. The key to do the following argument. Okay, the poetry is very important. Okay, here we just have improved area estimate. And I say from improved area estimate, we actually will have improved volume estimate. Here, volume estimate means the following. Okay, recall that, okay, when we construct approximation, we will. We construct the approximation mu bubble sigma episode. We only use the mean convexity or partial positive and the positive separation system. So if we still use partial positive as a boundary to solve your bubble, then we don't really have nice volume control in jump the region. So our strategy is take a sigma epsilon to be the new boundary. Epsilon to be the new boundary to solve the new bubble. And then we know the decrease from the area of sigma epsilon to the area of sigma epsilon prime is less than c times epsilon square. And then you can compute, okay, the volume of omega epsilon and epsilon prime closed by sigma epsilon and sigma epsilon prime. sigma epsilon and the sigma epsilon prime should be should know greater than c epsilon square over some epsilon prime where epsilon prime is the prescribed mean curvature of the new approximation new bubble and here okay this guarantees us to choose a nice way to decrease the prescribing coach namely we can take epsilon prime We can take epsilon prime to be some to be epsilon to the power gamma, where gamma is some fixed constant between one and two. So namely, okay, okay, sorry, sorry. From sigma epsilon, we solve approximation sigma epsilon gamma to the power gamma. And from sigma epsilon to the power gamma, then we can continue to solve approximation. To solve approximation, we of Bible sigma epsilon to the power gamma squared, and then you can estimate the total jumped volume. Then you find it will have a positive upper bond, it will have an upper bond. And as before, then we know every approximation mu bubble will actually have one point. At least have one point, like a lying fixed neighborhood, like a lying fixed composite. Then, at least we know the approximation won't shift to infinity. Yeah, in this case, we can take the limits. And the problem is the limits may be not compact. And in this case, we just use the compactness creating. Use the company's critium from Gramov-Lawson's work. It says if sigma is a stable minimum surface through manifold with non-negative scale capture, then sigma is not compact if federal only if the area of sigma is infinite. And recall, for approximate mu bubble, we always have a uniform area of a bound. So the limit also will have finite area. So this means the limit must be compact. Compact. Okay, when it's compact, then we indeed find the desired minimum surface for the area just a separation system, and it's a just optical case. So this is just some approximation way to find a minimal surface in some critical case. Critical case. So, okay, this is the proof. So, okay, this is the pro. Maybe a little bit technical. That's all.
