All right, so our first talk tonight is by Melissa Lee from the University of Auckland, and she will speak about bases for primitive permutation groups and applications. Go ahead, Melissa. Great, thank you very much. And I'd also like to thank the organizers for inviting me to give this talk. Yes, so today I'll be talking about bases for primitive permutation groups and applications. And for some of you who have seen this For some of you who have seen this talk a few times, I'm looking at you, Jack, and you, Michael. Um, sort of the first half of this talk may be stuff that you've seen before, but hopefully, towards the end, I'll be talking about stuff that I've been doing more recently and hopefully have something new for you. Okay, so let's get started. So here's the setup. I've got G being a permutation group on a set omega. Now, a base for G is a subset of omega. For G is a subset of omega such that only the identity permutation fixes every element of B. So the pointwise stabilizer of B in G is true. Now, bases come in all shapes and sizes. So for example, since I'm supposing that G is a permutation group on omega and therefore is faithful, you could take omega to be a base for G. But for a variety of reasons, including some practical considerations, we're usually interested in the size of the smallest base. interested in the size of the smaller space for g on omega, which we call the base size and we denote by this b of g here. Let's see a couple of examples. Well firstly if g is a symmetric group sn acting naturally on n points then the base size is equal to n minus 1 and the reason for that is that if you had a base of size n minus 2 or at most n minus 2 size at most n minus 2 then you would have two elements outside of Have two elements outside of your supposed base that can be swapped by a transposition. Okay, and that violates the definition of a base. Sort of on the other extreme here, if you have any finite group G acting on itself by right multiplication, then the base size here is equal to one because the action is regular. And this is sort of our first relatively trivial example of a regular orbit. So that is an orbit of a group that's the size of the group. And we'll see these popping up. Group, and we will see these popping up quite a bit throughout the talk. Before I go on, I should tell you that in this talk, I will assume that all of my groups have finite order as well. So let's see an easy lower bound for the base size of a group. So if G is acting on a set of size n, then the base size is bounded below by log of the size of g over log of the degree of the action. Let's see a quick proof of this. See a quick proof of this. Well, since the point-wise stabilizer of a base is trivial, that means that the action of every element of your group is determined by how it acts on a base. Because if I had two separate distinct elements that acted in the same way on a base, then I could compose one with the other's inverse and get something non-trivial that acts trivially on the base. So because of this observation, we can actually place an upper bound on the Bound on the size of our group. In particular, it has to be at most the number of base images of a base for G. And in particular, this argument holds for a base of the smallest size, this B of G here. And of course, if we take log of both sides and rearrange, we get the desired result. So why do people study these things? Well, they were first formally defined by Charles Sims in the early 1970s in the context of computational groups. In the context of computational group theory. Okay, so if you think about how you might store a permutation group into a computer, a very naive way to do it would be to tell the computer explicitly how each permutation acts on the set omega. But bases allow us to store elements much more efficiently by instead just requiring the number of bits of information that's the size of a known base rather than the size of the set that you're acting on. Of the set that you're acting on. Sort of a bit more detail here. If you have a base B1 up to BK for my group G, then you can define this stabilizer chain here. So I start at G, and each of these GIs, I'm just fixing a further base point. Now, if I take a set of right coset representatives for each of the quotient groups in this stabilizer chain, Groups in this stabilizer chain, then it turns out that every group element can be written uniquely as a product of these right coset representatives. Okay, and so especially if you can kind of predetermine or you can find a fast way of determining these coset representatives, then this gives you really quite an efficient way of writing these permutations and also allows for efficient computation of orbits and stabilizers and membership. Stabilizers and membership testing, and so on. Okay. So, even though bases were first formally defined in the 70s, they've actually been studied since the 19th century. So, a classical result by Boca says that if you've got a primitive permutation group, so that's a permutation group that acts transitively and doesn't preserve any non-trivial partition of your set, then as long as this group doesn't contain As long as this group doesn't contain the alternating group on n elements, then the base size is at most n on 2. There were various improvements to Boca's result. In particular, almost 100 years later, Babai showed that a sufficient upper bound here, instead of n on 2, we can have 4 root n log n. So these are interesting in themselves, but they also have another application, namely, if we recall from the proof of our little lemma, Recall from the proof of our little lemma that the size of a group is bounded above by the number of images of a base, then actually Babai's result tells us that if you have a primitive permutation group of degree n, not contained in the alternating group, then its size is bounded above by this expression in the degree. Okay, and this was an early application for bases, even though they weren't called bases as such. Okay, so then you might be thinking, okay. So then you might be thinking, okay, well, this sounds pretty good. Let's find some small bases of my favorite permutation group. And Boja showed in 1992 that if you just use a greedy algorithm, then you can find a base for a permutation group of size big of the base size log2, log2n. Okay, and considering this is a greedy algorithm, this is pretty good. But unfortunately, he showed that you can't sort of make a more refined algorithm. Sort of make a more refined algorithm to find a base of the smallest size. And in fact, the problem of finding a base of the smallest size for an arbitrary permutation group is NP-complete. So it's unlikely that anyone is going to find a polynomial time algorithm to do this anytime soon. In fact, it's much worse than that because Pieber actually showed in 1993 that there exists a universal constant C such that almost all subgroups of Sn. Almost all subgroups of Sn have their base size bounded below by this C times N. Okay, and by almost all subgroups here, I mean a proportion tending to one as n tends to infinity. Okay, so I said that we're interested in this base size, which is the size of the smallest base for a group, and also because of these computational applications, we're interested in groups with small bases. But Piev's results show. But Piever's result shows us that in general, we can't find any good upper bounds, and by good, I mean non-linear upper bounds for the base size in the degree that hold for arbitrary permutation groups G. Okay, so instead what we do is we restrict our focus to certain classes of groups. And one class of groups that have a lot of interest in the literature are the primitive groups. Okay, so I had this. So, I had this definition of a primitive group before, but here it is written on the slide. So, a group is primitive if it's transitive, and the only partitions preserved by G are the partition consisting of everything, and then the partition that's just all the singletons. So if we look at an example of a non-primitive group here, I've got C3 read CK. So, what this group is doing is it's permuting the sort of bubbles. Sort of bubbles in each of these blocks in a cyclic fashion, and then I can also permute the blocks cyclically as well. Now, it's pretty straightforward to show that the base size is equal to k here, because in order to take care of all of the C3s, you would need to fix at least one bubble in each block. But after you've done that, you can no longer cyclically permute the blocks, so actually your stabilizer is trivial. So the base size is equal to k here. Base size is equal to k here. And if we compare this to the ratio of logs that we had in our little lemma at the beginning, we see that field, this is definitely a lower bound for the base size. But I can't really, for example, put a scalar in front of this expression and get an upper bound for the base size that would work for all k. Okay. Okay, well, let's see an example of a primitive group. Example of a primitive group. So, here I'm going to take the group SK, the symmetric group, acting on pairs of elements from one up to k. Now, before I tell you what the base size is here, I'm going to write k as this sort of quotient remainder type expression, 3s plus t. Now, you can check that this set B here, consisting of these pairs, forms a base for G. For G. Okay, and if you count up the number of elements in B, you can see that it's going to be at most two-thirds k plus one. So, in particular, the base size is going to be at most two-thirds k plus one. And actually, Halassi showed in 2012 that if you've got k at least four, then the true base size is this ceiling of 2k minus 2 on 3. Okay, now I'm going to compare this to the ratio of logs that we've been talking about. That we've been talking about. And here we can see that this is roughly k of 2. So, fuf, as we would expect from our easy lower bound, this does in fact form a lower bound for the base size. But now we have this interesting property that we can find a constant c. So maybe we could take c to be roughly four-thirds, and this would give an upper bound for the base size as well. Okay, so of course, we can't talk about the primitive groups. Can't talk about the primitive groups without talking about the Onan-Scott theorem. So, the Onan-Scott theorem classifies the finite primitive permutation groups into one of the following five classes. So we've got almost simple, product type, twisted wreath type, diagonal type, and affine type groups. And for the majority of my talk, I will be interested in working on affine type groups. So, what do we have here? Well, we've got a V Well, we've got a V being a d-dimensional vector space over FQ. And in all instances of my vector spaces, unless I tell you otherwise, I will always suppose that they're finite dimensional and also over a finite field. Now, we of course know that V acts on itself by translations and G or V acts on V by linear transformations. And so we can define the general affine group to be the semi-direct product of these two groups here. Now it turns out Now, it turns out that if you take a subgroup of the general affine group that contains all of the translations, then this acts primitively on the vector space V if and only if the point stabilizer G0 acts irreducibly on V. And this is sort of the bit that comes from the linear transformations G or V here. Okay, and so these are the primitive groups of affine type. So I believe, yes, we'll see some examples here. We'll see some examples here. So, if I take g to be the whole of the general affine group just acting on v, then the base size here is the dimension v plus one because I need to fix a vector in order to get rid of the translations. And then I'm left with glv acting on v and it's pretty easy to see that there you need a spanning set to have a base and of course the size of the smaller spanning set is Size of the smaller spanning set is the size of a basis, which is the dimension of v. Okay, so that gives us the dimension of v plus one here. Slightly less easy to see is that if you have the symplectic group sp2k of q acting on its natural module, then the base size here is equal to 2k. So again, I need a basis. And if we compare this to the ratio of logs that we've been discussing, we see that this is. We've been discussing, we see that this is roughly k. So again, we've got a lower bound, and again, we've got this nice property that we can multiply by a scalar, probably roughly two, and we get an up bound for the base size as well. And that's sort of the flavor of quite a prominent conjecture in the area called Peter's conjecture, which says that if you have a primitive permutation group of degree n, then there exists an absolute constant. Then there exists an absolute constant C such that the base size is bounded above by C times this ratio of logs. Okay. Well, I won't keep you in suspense. Over the past few years, Piece conjecture has been solved. Oh, just before that, we see that from the previous symplectic example, we would need this coefficient here to be at least two. So Pippa's conjecture was solved by Duyan Palasi-Morotti in 2016. Antalasi-Morotti in 2016, and they showed that you can put a multiplicative constant of 45 here, and they also require this additive constant of C. Okay. And this built on the work of a lot of authors making incremental progress over the years between Pieber making this conjecture and their theorem. And this was pretty swiftly improved by Halassi Liebeck. Improved by Halassi, Liebeck, and Moroti in 2019, who showed that actually you can reduce this multiplicative constant from 45 down to 2. And they determined that you can take the additive constant here to be 24. Now, the authors note that this multiplicative constant of 2 is optimal, and they actually use this example, the symplectic group that I had before, but they do note that this 24 could be improved upon with a lot more work. Lot more work. Okay, so I had during the first half of my PhD, I had a part in proving an auxiliary result for this second theorem here. So I just want to talk briefly about that. So one of the major cases in improving the upper bounds for the base size for groups of affine type was the case where the point stabilizer was Stabilizer is an almost quasi-simple group. So, what the heck is that? Well, first of all, a group is said to be quasi-simple if it's perfect, so it's equal to its commutator subgroup. And if when you mod out by the center of the group, then you get a non-abelian finite simple group. On the other hand, a group is said to be almost quasi-simple if it has a unique self-centralizing quasi-simple normal subgroup, which we denote by this E of. Group, which we denote by this E of H. This is the layer of the group. And also, when you mod out by the center, you get an almost simple group. Okay. Radio. So what did we prove here? Well, my supervisor, Martin Liebeck and I showed that if you have almost quite a simple group acting irreducibly on a vector space, and here you need, recall you need irreducible. Need, recall, you need irreducibility for the affine group to be primitive. So, if you have these conditions, then either you're in one of these two special situations where the module is really quite small. So the natural module for classical groups or the fully deleted permutation module for alternating groups, or the base size is at most six. Okay, and a considerable amount of work went into proving this base size at most six. This base size at most six thing, but by and large, it worked. Most of the work went into taking care of some very specific families of groups that just didn't instantly fall away when we applied the sort of the sort of crudest method of proof we could think of. Okay, so it seemed to us that actually for most groups, most of these almost quasi-simple groups, that the base size was much lower than six. Okay, and in some cases, Six okay, and in some cases, maybe most of the cases, the base size is actually equal to one. So, for the second half of my PhD, my aim was to find the true values of the base sizes of these almost quite a simple groups. Right. So, how can we go about this? How can we classify the primitive groups with small bases? Okay. Okay, well, if you have a primitive group that has a base size equal to one, so there's a regular orbit, then since point stabilizers are maximal in primitive groups, then you would need your group to be isomorphic to a cyclic group of order P. Okay, so really the smallest interesting base size for primitive groups is two, and Jan Sachs proposed a program where we should try to classify all of the primitive groups with base size. Of the primitive groups with base size equal to two. Now, there are a few known results here. So, for diagonal and twisted reed-type groups, Joanna Fawcett showed in her PhD thesis that there's a partial classification of groups with base size equal to two. And she can very specifically describe the groups where either the base size is not known, where she gives, and she gives an upper bound for the base size. And there are also some. Size. And there are also some cases where the base size is strictly greater than two. Okay. For almost simple groups, there is a complete classification when the soccer of the group is sporadic or alternating, and we have some partial answers for groups of Li type. And then for the affine type groups, again, there's this focus on the case where the point stabilizer is almost quite as simple. Stabilizer is almost quite as simple, and there's a complete classification here where the soccle of H module at center is sporadic or alternating, and also when the soccle is a group of Lie type that has order co-prime to the size of your vector space. And actually, recently, through my work that I'm about to tell you about, we found that there was an omitted case in this paper that was recently resolved by That was recently resolved by Frank Lubeck. Okay, so his name should be there as well. And so, if we go through the classification of finite simple groups, then we see that the case that's left open for us to contribute to is the case where you've got an almost quite a simple group of lead type, and where the order of that group is not co-prime to the order of the vector space. Okay. All right. All right, so that's the sort of class of groups that we're looking at. How do we actually go about finding out what the true base size is? Well, recall this easy lower bound from the beginning of my talk. We know that the base size has got to be at least log of the size of group, the group over log of the size of the vector space. And I'm going to call this value c. And I guess really I want c to be an integer, so maybe I want to take the ceiling of this ratio of logs. Of this ratio of logs. So I'm going to do my best to show that the base size of H is actually equal to C. Of course, it might not be equal to C, but anecdotally, we find that most of the time it is. So what technique do we use? Well, we're going to define the fixed point space of an element of H, which is going to be exactly what it sounds like. It's just going to be the one eigenspace of my little g here. And then what I'm going to do is say, okay, I want to prove that the base size of H is at most C. Okay, and then I know that from this limit that it's going to be at least C, so it has to be equal to C. And the way that I do that is I define this other vector space, which is just going to be C copies of V. And when I act by an element of my group H, all this is going to do is act coordinate-wise. So I'll get V1. act coordinate wise. So I'll get v1g, v2g, and so on. Okay, so then saying that the base size is at most c is equivalent to saying that there exists a vector in w with trivial stabilizer in h. Okay, because if I could find a base of size c, then I could just put that base in each of the coordinates here, each of the c coordinates, and then the only element of my group H that would fixed That would fix that vector would have to be the trivial permutation. Okay. But finding such a vector is actually really hard. So we instead kind of think about it the other way. So using a proof by contradiction. So if H has no regular orbit on W, okay, then that means that every element of W has to lie in the fixed point space for some non-trivial. point space for some non-trivial element of H. Okay, so we suppose that our method of proof is going to be supposing that H has no regular orbit on this W, which is C copies of V, and then saying what we can deduce about these fixed point spaces and showing that we can't possibly have that. Okay, so this is sort of an equation form of what I had on the last slide. So if there's no regular orbit of If there's no regular orbit of h on w, then I can write w as the union of all these fixed point spaces here. Now, what you'll notice is that if I have a matrix, an element of my group, then the dimension of the fixed point space of such an element is going to be less than or equal to the dimension for any power of that element. Okay, because if I fix the space with my element g. Space with my element g, then I'm also going to fix it with any power of the element g. But then I also could, if I power up my element g, I could also fix some extra things once I apply g a few times. Okay, and moreover, these dimensions will be equal if g has prime order. Okay, um, all right, so that tells us that surely we have some overlaps here in our fixed point spaces, so that means that the So that means that the size of W must be strictly less than the sum of all the sizes of these fixed point spaces. Okay, and so again, since I have this property here, I only need to sum over the elements of prime order, because I can always take an element of composite order and power it up to something of prime order. Okay, and it's also pretty easy to see that the size of the fixed point space. The size of the fixed point space of a little g in w is just going to be the size of the fixed point space in v to the c, okay, because the fixed point space in w is just going to be like the coordinate-wise fixed point spaces there. Okay, um, so these almost quasi-simple groups we know a lot about. Okay, in particular, the property that when you mod out by the center, you get an almost simple group means that we know a lot about the contribution class. That we know a lot about the contribution class structure and so on. And so, really, the crux of our method of proof relies on knowing good upper bounds for the size of this fixed point space. Okay. Also, so from here, in order to find good upper bounds for the size of a fixed point space here, we have to look a lot at the representation theory for these almost quasi-simple groups. And this divides very naturally into And this divides very naturally into sort of defining characteristic and cross-characteristic representations. So here in cross-characteristic, we've got a group of lead type. So it's got a dimension n and over a vector space, sorry, over a finite field of order q. And I'm acting on a vector space over a field of size r where this r and this q are co-prime. This Q are co-prime. Okay, so that's what gives us the cross-characteristic. Now, not much is, I mean, there is a lot known, but the irreducible representations of almost quasi-simple groups and cross-characteristic are not known in general. So indeed, like for large groups, so I'm talking groups of dimension greater than, say, like six or seven, we only sometimes know the dimension and or construction of the. The dimension and/or construction of the smallest representations of these groups. Okay, um, so, but fortunately for us, when we analyze these groups and these representations, we can find some crude upper bounds on the dimension of the fixed point space using some seemingly unrelated results about generation of almost simple groups by conjugates. Okay, and this gives us some somewhat crude upper bounds on the dimension of. Crude upper bounds on the dimension of the fixed point space, it might be like, oh, you know, the dimension of the fixed point space is at most three-quarters the dimension of the vector space, or something like that. So, in reality, they're often much lower, but these crude upper bounds give us the tools to actually eliminate most of the groups representations and end up with a small list left to check. And from here, many of the groups are small enough to look at the Brower character tables. Our character tables for these groups and deduce the dimensions of the eigenspaces. And failing that, we also sometimes can construct these groups in gap or magma to find these fixed point spaces. And very occasionally, we encounter groups where this technique doesn't work at all. And so we have to use some actual like enumeration of orbits and so on. And for this, we relied on some work by Muller and O'Brien. Work by Moller and O'Brien. So, using all of these techniques, we were able to take care of all of the representations and groups and cross-characteristic. Okay, so here's the result now. This is one of the main results from my PhD thesis. So again, we've got this almost quasi-simple group, and we've got this quasi-simple group sitting underneath this E of H. Okay, and here, of course, like I said, we're acting in cross-controlled. Course, like I said, we're acting in cross-characteristic. Then we determine that either H has a regular orbit on V, so base size one, or H and V is one of a finite list of pairs for which we know the base size. Okay, so I completely classified all of the groups and all of the representations and what their base sizes are. Okay, and so of course, if we go back to the problem of trying to find all of the primitive groups with base size two, then all of these Then all of these groups with regular orbits, the corresponding affine type groups, have base size two, and for all of these, they don't. Okay, so here's the finite list of pairs where there's no regular orbit. Okay, so there's really quite a lot of them. And of course, I'm not expecting you to read all of this. But I guess what I want you to take away from this is we do actually know the base side. Actually, know the base sizes of all these groups explicitly. And there are also some back-of-the-envelope things that we can take away. Namely, if the dimension of your vector space is greater than 24, or the size of the vector space is strictly greater than 31 to the 8, then H has a regular orbit on V. Now, if you've heard this talk before and you're very eagle-eyed, you might see that this 31 is 1 You might see that this 31 is different to the 27 that I had in a previous iteration, and again, this arises from the work of Lubeck in filling that hole that was left in the paper of Kohler and Parlings. Also, an interesting observation that we can make is that the base size, oh, I've got a G there where I should have a H. Anyway, the base size is basically at most this ratio of logs plus two. Okay, so this ratio of logs here. Okay, so this ratio of logs here actually gives a pretty good approximation of the base size in most situations. And also, overall, we find that the base size is at most five. And I think actually there are only one or two groups where the base size is actually equal to five. Okay, so that's the cross-characteristic representations where the field of the group and the vector space have different characteristics. What about representations in defining characteristic where these In defining characteristic, were these characteristics of the group and the vector space of the same. Well, here, this turned out to be a lot more tricky, partly because the dimensions of the representations kind of lead to infinite families where it's very hard to do anything at all. So, here I've got a result that holds for the case where when you mod out by the fitting subgroup or the The fitting subgroup or the center here, you have PSLNQ. Okay, so this specific situation. And here we deduce that either H has a regular orbit on V, V is a natural module for this quasi-simple group sitting underneath, or H and V belong to one of a finite list of infinite families where the base size, again, is at most five. At most five. Okay, so in Martin and I's sort of original theorem from the first half of my PhD, we had an upper bound of six, but it seems like the best we can do is potentially five, okay, as an upper bound. Okie-dokie. And as with the cross-characteristic case, we do have a corollary, a back-of-the-envelope corollary of this work, which is that if n is at least 7 and log base q of the size of log base q of the size of v is greater than this n squared plus n. And here we've got log base q because you could have representations over extension fields or subfields. Anyway, if these hold, then h has a regular orbit on v. Okay right so that sort of finishes off the stuff that I did during my doctorate. Now I want to talk a bit about some more recent work. So, I want to talk about these saxophraphs. So, these were defined by Bernesse and Judici in 2020. So, given a permutation group with base size 2, the saxo graph for that group has vertices being the set that you're acting on. So, the elements of omega here. And I'm going to have an edge between a pair of vertices if they form a base for g. Okay. Okay, let's see an example, a simple example. So suppose I've got the dihedral group D8 acting on the square. Then you can see that the pair 1, 2 forms a base for G because once I fix 1 and 2, I can't rotate it or reflect the square anymore. While if I fix 1 and 3, that's not a base, okay? Because I can still reflect through the axis between 1 and 3. Through the axis between one and three. So if I draw the Saxville graph for this group, I'm going to have one, two, three, and four as my vertices. And it turns out that the Saxle graph for D8 is actually the square. Okay, so one and two form a base, one and three don't, and so on. Okay, right. And another thing that you'll notice is that the diameter of this saxograph is true. So of course it doesn't. Of this saxo graph is two. So, of course, the diameter is the maximum length of all the minimal paths between any two vertices. So, here one and three are at maximum distance, and there's a path of length two here. All right. So, Bernes and Judici in their paper prove a lot of nice properties about these saxoprafts. So, they show that if you have a transitive permutation group with base size two, then the saxophone graphs are graphs. Base size two. Then the Saxle graph is connected if G is primitive. Okay. And they also showed that the valency of each vertex, so the number of edges coming out of each vertex, is going to be the number, basically the number of vectors. Well, maybe not the number of vectors if you're working in an arbitrary primitive group. But anyway, the number of regular orbits of the point stabilizer times the order of the point. Times the order of the point stabilizer. Okay. And so this will come in handy for us in just a moment. They also prove that G acts transitively on the vertices of the saxo graph. And in fact, I believe that G actually is a subgroup of the automorphism group of this graph. Okay, and also in their paper, they do. And also, in their paper, they do some analysis of the Saxle graphs of some different families of groups that are known to have base size 2. And through their work on primitive groups, they come up with the following interesting conjecture. So the conjecture is the following. If you have a finite primitive permutation group at base size 2, then every pair of vertices in the Saxo graph of G have to have a common neighbor. Okay, now on the last slide, I talked about On the last slide, I talked about the saxograph for the dihedral group having diameter 2. So that meant that there existed a path between any two vertices, any two non-adjacent vertices of length two. But here this is a bit stronger because we also require adjacent vertices to have a common neighbor together. Okay. And in fact, this conjecture has been proved in a few cases. So by Bernice and Judici's paper, we know that this. As a paper, we know that this conjecture is true for primitive groups of degree less than 4096, sufficiently large groups of diagonal twisted wreath type, and also for some alternating and sporadic simple groups. And then Bernesse and Huang this year in their pre-print print showed that the conjecture is also true for almost simple groups where you've got a soccle PSL2Q. PSL2Q, and also if you have an almost simple group with soluble point stabilizer. Okay, so yeah, our contribution, so this part of my talk is joint work with my colleague Tomas Propiel. Our work was on groups of affine type, because this is sort of my comfort zone. And we find the following interesting lemma, which is that the common neighbor conjecture. That the common neighbor conjecture is true for a primitive affine type group, which we write in this way, vh, if and only if, this is quite strong, we can write each vector of the vector space as a sum of exactly two vectors that lie in regular orbits under the action of the point stabilizer H. Okay, yeah, so this condition allowed us to go quite a long way. Allowed us to go quite a long way. All right, so what have we proved? Well, we've proved that if you have a primitive affine type group with this almost quite a simple point stabilizer, and if this point stabilizer, when you mod out by the center, you get a sporadic almost simple group, then either the Saxle graph satisfies the common neighbor conjecture. So for every two vertical neighbor conjecture so for every two vertices in the saxville graph um i can find some another vertex that's collinear not collinear adjacent to each of them or i've got one of nine pairs where the size of the vector space is greater than two to the 44 okay um how do we go about proving such a thing well actually the the techniques that i used in my phd to find regular orbits or find the base Regular orbits or find the base size of groups came in very handy. So, by like tweaking it a little bit, I found a sufficient condition for satisfying the common neighbor conjecture. So, again, we use the same techniques like constructing these groups in gap or magma or looking at the character tables in order to find details of the eigenspaces. But then, of course, there are a few groups left over. left over. So first I'll show you the groups that, so this should be an E of G here, the groups that are left over. Okay, so these are groups where sometimes we don't even know whether there's a regular orbit in the first place. So we don't even know whether the Saxle graph is even a relevant concept. Okay, so for the groups that we have left that we have to deal with computationally, we must show one of the following two sufficient conditions. Following two sufficient conditions. So, firstly, that the group acts regularly on half of the vectors in the vector space. Okay, now there has been a lot of work on finding just regular orbits, as I mentioned. And in fact, for the sporadic groups, the task of even finding a single orbit where my group G acts regularly seems very, very hard. Like for some groups, they had to bring out all of the machines. Had to bring out all of the machinery that exists in orbit enumeration techniques in order to show that there was just one orbit where the group acts regularly. So this seems kind of maybe impossible for the groups that we have left, but there might be some hope for the second condition. So if we can show that every vector in the vector space can be written as the sum of exactly two vectors lying in a regular orbit, then we're done. Okay, so in some of the cases, So, in some of the cases that we have been able to knock off, what we've actually done is found maybe one regular orbit or not even a whole regular orbit, just knowing that like a small set of vectors do lie in a regular orbit. And it turns out that actually you can construct every vector by just taking sums of collections of two vectors lying in this set. Okay, so I think that's our sort of most hopeful suggestion of how to. Most hopeful suggestion of how to finish this off, but for now these remain unsolved. Okay, so finally, I want to talk about another application of this work on bases and regular orbits, and that's to extremely primitive groups. So if you have a primitive permutation group, then we say that it's extremely primitive if the point stabilizer, G alpha, acts primitively on the rest of the things. On the rest of the things in the set. Okay, so you can see why it has that name. Now, Mann, Pregerin's Sherish showed in 2007 that if you have a primitive group that's extremely primitive, then G has to be either of affine type or it has to be almost simple. Okay. And further, these almost simple. These almost simple, extremely primitive groups have been classified. Actually, fairly recently, the classification was finished off. So, if you've got an almost simple group with point stabilizer H, then the group is extremely primitive if and only if this sockle and intersection with the point stabilizer belongs to one of five infinite families, where it's one of 21 further examples. Where it's one of 21 further examples. Okay, so there aren't actually that many examples of extremely primitive groups out there. And I've actually included the table from their paper for you to have a quick look. So we've got a couple of infinite families here where the soccle is an alternating group or L2Q, or we've got an infinite family of symplectic groups here. Okay, and then we have all of these other examples. Of these other examples. So that's the almost simple groups. How about the groups of affine type? Well, Mann, Pregnan, Scherer show in their paper that if you have an extremely primitive group of affine type, then either you know that the point stabilizer and the dimension of the vector space and P is one of a known list of examples, or the vector space is over F2. Over F2 and H is almost simple. Okay, so this is really restrictive. They also show that if you assume Wall's conjecture, so recall that Wall's conjecture says that for a finite group, the number of maximal subgroups of that group has to be at most the size of that group. Okay, it's known not to be true in general, but there's still hope for almost simple groups. For almost simple groups. So, if we assume Woohole's conjecture for almost simple groups, then actually this part two here reduces to a list, a relatively small list of possible groups, possible extremely primitive groups. And recently, really just recently, Bernes and Thomas showed that none of the groups that are in this list. The groups that are in this list are extremely primitive. Okay, so the problem is that, okay, Burness and Thomas have shown that none of these groups were extremely primitive, but we still need this assumption on Wall's conjecture, that Wall's conjecture is true. So, in recent work, Tim Burnes and I have managed to get around this. So, part of the proof uses the following observation that if you have Observation: That if you have a group of affine type, okay, with an almost simple point stabilizer, and that almost simple group has a regular orbit on V, then G is not extremely primitive, okay? Because if the group has a regular orbit, that means that there's a trivial point stabilizer, and if the group were to be primitive, then that trivial point stabilizer would have to be maximal, which is just not true. Be maximal, which is just not true. Okay, and so, um, with quite a bit of work and using this observation quite a lot, we managed to show that there are no further extremely primitive groups, so that the original list that was come up with by Mann, Prager, and Sherish was complete, and there are no further examples. Alrighty, I think I'll stop there. Thank you very much. All right, thank you very much, Melissa. Virtual. Melissa, virtual clapping of the hands. Yes, of course. Right, do we have any questions or comments? Just speak up or put your question or comment into the chat. Perhaps I'll, that was a nice talk, Lisa. Thank you. Your little lemma about the common neighbour conjecture of affine groups, I've been trying to prove it in my head, but I can't. How does that? But I can't. How does that see that? Okay, it's actually not that hard to prove. The key is to observe that the affine group is a subgroup of the automorphism group of the Saxon graph, right? And so you can translate like everything back to zero, essentially. And you know that all the neighbors of zero are regular orbit representations. Regular orbit representatives. Okay, so that should give you the extra tool you need to finish off the. Okay, right. Yeah. And perhaps just to clarify, you kept talking about V was written. So in that lemma, that statement seems to suggest that maybe V could be written in several different ways. So a few things. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah. I wasn't sure if you were meaning unique for just. Unique for just yeah definitely not unique all right any further questions or comments Melissa I had one question I was wondering so we're looking at you're primarily looking at primitive groups here Primitive groups here. Where does all of this go if you were to relax that to say quasi-primitive or semi-primitive groups? Does it all fall apart and base sizes can be large again? That I'm not sure about, actually. I must admit to having sort of a one-track mind looking at just the primitive groups, but I think maybe a little bit of work has been done on these, but I'm not sure off the top of my head. All right. All right, thank you. Anyone else? If not, then David can stop the recording.
