Yeah, I made the title slightly shorter, but it's the same sort of topic. So I will be speaking about what happens with follow algebra when one does something with exact category defining S construction, defining this follow algebra. So recall that we can start from the E exact division. Equation thing is here that I usually work with two components. This produces an S construction of E Malthaus based S construction this guy to sigma and then as we saw in So in Regio's talk we know that we can associate with this something linearized. Say when we go from these guys to vector spaces or to something vector space of finite field, we can construct whole algebra of E. A priori we can start from inner two single space and go something like this. Something like this. And what I will discuss about is: well, we go from E to H of E without thinking about two single things. We can do something with original exact category, see what happens here, and this we can understand in some sense. And I guess my question to the audience would be: what does this upgrade to the virtual? Develop S construction of two single space stuff. First comment is that normally if you start from exactly 50 category, this S construction does remember in high categorical conformation, but the algebra, in the sense that structure constants in the algebra, remember only homotopy category. So we could think of or is homotopy category. We have to think of or is how much we get spread. There is a notion of well there is a term of what is the homotopy Kegger is affinity Keith Grand that's called X-Gangulated for some weird reasons. And what is an exact category? Well, let's think of at one categorical level it is additive category. But then you'll have to leave out the intermediate step of the S construction, right? If you do the homotopy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So let's assume that we live in one categorical world form at the moment. I am not anthropologist. So start with an additive category and E is in fact an extra structure on the category. E E is a class of this admissible, in some reasonable sense, short exact sequences, which feature in X2 of S2 of E. List of admissible protein sequences or also called translations. And there are some axioms that these guys have to satisfy, like push-out of admissible monic has to be exist and be admissible monic, etc. You know all these axioms if you work with high categorical stuff of this S-construction. So we have in fact a pair of A and B, and what can we do? And what can we do with this, guys? Well, if we allow ourselves to be sort of not necessarily exact, but this extra angulated thing, then there is a little bit more freedom. But in general, we can take extension closed subcase square. This is something sort of trivial. You just take part of your category and take all such that if two outer terms of short exec sequence belong to it, then the middle guy also does. You can take localization add or with respect to With respect to a thick subcategory. Think of Verdia quotients, so CR quotients, even categories and you can change the class E. The class E. So this is sometimes called relative exact structure or substructure. And of course, localization is a special class of exact functor, so one can also think of exact functor and if everything is in Everything is uh enhanced in a searchable way, like the G enhanced, and one can take some tensor products, etc. But maybe I will stop here. And one can ask oneself, well, assume that we have any category plus this structure, and we take whole algebra and we perform one of the operations, what happens? Or maybe. Or maybe assume that we have a category which appears as an image of localization or as some extension closed up category, some relative structure. Can we get whole algebra of this guy from what we had before? And so let me so for answer for one is well let us Well, it is a sub-algebra. Sub-algebra. And it's sort of a clear thing. So I will go to answer to three first. It's a bit easier to describe. So answer to three would be let degeneration. Here is what I mean by this. So if we have an exact category, meaning that we have A E and we take A, E prime E prime as a subtraction, we say that it's smaller, meaning that we have less conflations. Conflations. Um theorem. So as it is, it's for exact ordinary categories, but it can be formulated for exact infinity categories as well. Schoenpank and myself. So, under certain conditions very restrictive in one direction and non-restrictive in another, um there exists a function on isoclasses of objects N A. Of objects NA to I don't know, say z greater or equal than zero, one can take reals as well, which sort of degree function, which gives a filtration filtration on H of Edge of the Regional. I just said associated grid. And so every for every W nice enough. Really, for every W which does define reasonable filtration, associated grade there is a filtration filtration say F W and associated grade that is on HF. So should I stage of the So let me say again what happens here. We take a vector space so we take the vector space h of h of e of e prime and the vector space The vector space basis. Well, it was denoted, I think, A, I don't know A is an isoquette of our underlying phase group and multiplication remembers x1. Remembers x1 in a reasonable sense. So it remembers our choice of conflations. And what happens if we do when we go from h of v to h of a prime, we keep track of less of conflations. Less of x1 is sub bifunctor in this relative structure. This relative structure. And so we have the same vector space, but the result is such a gradient of certain filtration. And filtration can be formulated in nice terms in terms of additive precision on our category. And it is flat, meaning that associated gradient is isomorphic to isomorphic. The grade that is isomorphic to original guys vector space. And well, what is the motivation to do all of this? Well, this is a generalization. So, special case. I don't think I understand the difference between one and two. One says that W filters H of E so that the associated gradient of H of E. So that the society created the region. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I should write here so we fixed subtraction and we can get a filtration and under certain conditions every sorry, this is statements more. Sorry, this happens more often than this. But one direction is that every filtration is a whole association gradient of every filtration of this term, this form is whole algebra of relative structure. And the other way around is like every... If you are given exact structure, there is a filtration. So these are two quantities direction. Maybe I missed some quantum, but. Can you give us a very brief idea of what the conditions look like? This idea of what the conditions look like? So all of this is we have home and X1 finite as in Metostalk and so we worked over for categories of finite fields but it can be replaced by something else. Replaced by something else needed. And for this thing, we use that the case AOP to abide groups has finite lengths. And this is a very restrictive condition, of course. For example, do does A prime typically have fewer objects than E? No. Well, I mean, depends on what do you think of this? So y with exact structure, you can associate certain subcategory here, in this category, so just functor category, I would call it, and taken a relative strategy corresponding to taken such sub-category. So there are a few objects here, but if you think of original casing around, objects are the same. Special case, it was example, I think, I believe it was example 3 or maybe sub-example 3 from Matisse's talk is that we have a category of well, I will drive more. Well, I would write mod KQ, meaning representations of a quiver, but not derived categories or stable Fincy categories, here store just abelian category. And with this, so let's say we have Q, we can associate this abelian case and we can associate with this all of them. And on the other side, we can define this GQ or NQ, and I would repeat the notation, so I think it was U square root plus or GQ. And there is so there is an embedding in these directions, it's an isomorphism in Dinkin case, meaning AD Dinkin diagram. The diagram, summarization of it. And these guys, which are halves of quantum groups, there is a version of Point Karen-Cox theorem. And basically saying that H mod KQ split is a flat degeneration. Is a flat generation of age mode at the end is quantum PPWC so what what happens So, what happens here is that we take this abelian category, and there are two extreme exact structures on this guy. One is we take all short exact sequences that we have. This is abelian one, this is largest possible, and another is we take only direct sums or only split exact sequences if you wish. And Pangari-Bergov's theorem is for classical limit of this guy. classical limit of uh this guy where you specialize to just universal enveloping algebra of corresponding Lie algebra uh and von Karibergov the theorem says that this guy is actually can be understood as the formation of polynomial algebra okay so this is a special case and that was a sort of motivation so I wanted to understand what happens So I wanted to understand what happens with exact structures. My co-author works on degenerations of quantum groups and some Turkic degenerations and tropical flag varieties and all of this has meaning for tropical flag varieties and some maximal cones in this guise and some relation to Gropnov's theory. So the functions that we have here we call models and notion comes from Grobnov theory because sort of From Grogner's theory because sort of non-commutative Groven stuff. But this is a flat degeneration as linear objects, not as associative objects. Or is there some algebraic structure that's respected by this filtration? It's linear. Oh wait, it's not a filtered algebra? No. I mean, otherwise the socially crate it won't be matter. Oh, it's a filtered algebra. Maybe my misunderstood question, but It's an algebra filtration. I see. If this is what you asked. Yeah, I think I'm confused because quotients of algebra aren't algebras. Okay, no, no. Here we take algebra filtration and we take associated gradient. It's still an algebra. There, in some sense, the sense the algebra is graded itself by something and we take the function just tells us that we take we make something with this grading group or grading monoid which is growing quonoid of a grading monoid. It's associated grading in the category of algebras. No, I want to. I'm very confusing. Sub-algebras don't tend to be ideals, so but let's talk later. I'm missing a bunch of things. But but but I mean but w but but we have a greater thing we put we associate a degree living somewhere to any monomial basis or some any homogeneous element and then we keep track only we have AB sum of blah blah blah and we keep track only of the parts degrees is good enough. Okay. What is What is the function W of PB? So here it is, so in this finite Linux condition, which is satisfied here for Lincoln types, it's sum of dimensions home blank x for x indicable. Well, indecomposable non-injective, but it doesn't mean you can. Injective, but it doesn't matter. You can take all the object the filtration. Oh, you can take home from X blank. Also gives you the same result. Can I ask a question? Yeah. Fine into billion groups could be A, or is there something? Sorry? Your category A could be finite abelian groups? I would expect so. And then you forget the short exact sequences and you get state structure? Yeah. I mean, w w at least in one direction the statement surely should hold. Okay. So there is not much time for me to speak about localizations. Let me be quick. Yeah. Yeah, b before going to localization, just a quick comment is that, I mean, what I mean, what happens in S construction is probably something natural because we take, well, we take some part of X2 and then we take some part of upper and upper upper guys. And one, indeed, it gives you some, we know that this figuration, this degree functions gives This degree functions give an u to signal space, but I never try to work out like what is this operation on two signal spaces, how functoral is this, and what's the meaning. But maybe there is some meaning. That's my contribution to this code-fair service. Not sure there is anything related to statical spaces, but maybe there is. And also, if you think of this. If and also if you think of this double categorical approach, then you take sub-category of the category of monomorphisms, sub-category of the category of ethnomorphism, which have to still be compatible in some natural way. And things work out. But I do believe that the result has to be to signal. It's not just on the level of linear, guys, but not worked out. And polocalizations. And for localizations, let me start with a motivation. And then maybe I have two minutes to say sort of the result. So there was this theorem due to Ringland Green, which appears in the sub-example 3. Namely that, let me repeat it here, is that H mod KQ, there is invading in this direction, like this. Like this, and there was some long-standing problem how so it's sort of easy to get a little bit artificially. I would write just Borel part view. So, this is I would rewrite this Nipperton part. And this can be relative to something. Baltic to something extended Monteq. If I are very careful, there is some twist involved, but let's not go there. And there was a long-standing question, can one get entire one group as something? And the idea was it was observed that it should be related to That it should be related. It should probably be depending on the derived case degree of this guy, so it should be derived invariant. And there are two purposes of this thing, so it's probably something like two periodic derived casegraph. But the issue is that two periodic derived case degrees triangulated and it was a long standing thing to define properly following rules of tangulated casegiras. Also, it is periodic. Periodic, so some natural construction of defining polar soft turn grades basically do not work. And also, there is some part here which is comes which is not just nearputs and part in one copy of this catalog or nearputz and part of another copy of this case girl. There is more, there is cartan. And one can here the idea to attach cartan piece to this guy is a bit artificial. Bit artificial, but here there is a one can do it at Oak, but one can also realize something like whole algebra extended of D, let's just take a space right D2 of mod dq. So there is a way to get this extension thing from realizing Realizing this guy is an image of localization of something. So one can do a localization of some exact or Frabinos or some abelian category with some model structure. Or one can come up with a version where you take Radier quotient of the angulated categories, maybe with some enhancements are needed. But the point is that to get this To get this one way, at least one way to get this measurement you take find A in B this is thick, so A is thick in B, meaning it satisfies two out of three property closed and there is some. Close and direct summons and something else that they have to probably say. And the ocean is this deep true. And instead of trying to define whole algebra of the quotient, one can somehow keep track of these guys and use in particular something coming from A in the picture. In the picture. And what comes from A will correspond precisely to Cartan. So, right here, that under some conditions, so let's say, so one special case corresponding precisely to these guys is due to Bridgeland. There are something that I did in my thesis. There are works of Lou, and Works of lu et al for some Gernish din dimension one categories, whatever it means. And the private communication from France which uses Verdier quotations instead of X categories, but it still fits into this text and fintech categorical setting that one can define. One can define there is also the browser from this for each A and B satisfying some finiteness conditions, whatever they are, and uh it is roughly whole algebra, so it's uh flat deformations. flat deformations over twisted group algebra of it's not precisely case zero of a but it's some coefficient of this group a and I have no time to give any more details about Time to give any more details about this. But the point is that somehow I think the main idea of this stuff is that, to repeat myself, is that instead of doing localization on the level of case groups, one can do localization on the level of algebras. So perhaps it makes sense to ask if it's possible, if it makes sense, I think it makes sense from high algebraic theory, and maybe also. Maybe also, it seems that also from the point of whole algebra to consider some stuff related to localization of these two single spaces in general and under linearization, keeping track only of something like k0, so sorry, pi one, if you wish, of this relational space. So all of the whole algebra constructions in this theorem I didn't the last thing I mean if you if you have exact factor in any reasonable sense and you know that it induces equivalence of the quotients and it's factorial on the level of k0, then you have a factor and if Then you have a factor, and if it's isomorphism of k0, then it's isomorphism up to twist. Twist usually comes from some Euler forms. There are factors between these instructions. So between what's in the first row, there are definitely factors, and I need to think for a second about the last factor. Okay. So is there anything interesting that happens if this localization sequence defines like a semi-competitive position on P, or maybe it has a Googling functor? I yeah, I would be interested to think about that. Maybe in this case there is a way to keep track of more than Qk0, which would be interesting, but as of now, this construction is very isometric. So it's not that their junction is used at any point. But I would expect if if there is semi-orthogonal composi decomposition, then maybe one can, I don't know, glue in some sense something like hologram of the middle guy from source and target, but let's discuss it later on. I had one comment about this PBW example. Probably know like one way to realize these decompositions is by choosing very stability conditions. Stability conditions? Say just in the like AN case. Because one way to realize these decompositions is by choosing stability conditions. So these are these like categorified quantum dilogram ideas. And so there this PBW theorem is basically the Harder-Nair-Simmon filtration. Yeah, it's slightly different approach, I would say, but yeah. Well, I just, that the Harder-Nair-Simmon thing is something that you could already look at. Simmon thing is something that you could already look at at the S construction running, but because it gives you some kind of filtration of your category, usual conditions, holms only in one direction, and so on. Because it's necessarily a direct message, right? It doesn't necessarily direct message. Everything here inside was a beauty on the lower right, but stability conditions if you want to change it. I mean, you can just look at the old-fashioned stability condition on Stability Commission on King's Stability, yeah. Anyway, and I'm not saying it would apply in this general setting for all exact categories, but for these examples where you can study them concretely. I'm not saying that what I said is the ultimate approach to Pix double theorem, but then no, that's a interesting comment. I guess. Interesting comment. I guess I indulge myself in giving another comment somewhat related to this. Is that if we start from exact infinity category or maybe even forgot about all the enhancement stuff and start from tangulated category, then sometimes you can define all algebra, which is usually called the rational algebra. Even though it keeps track of non-direct information, I would say. And there is a filtration coming from every regional stability condition on this category, which is mass function, defines such a degeneration. And I have not studied at all such degenerations, but I wonder if this might be somewhat related to what you just said. I think mine is the keen version of that. The king version of that in particular? Yeah, we should discuss it. I can speak right now. So, just a reminder: if you're looking at the paper schedule, then
