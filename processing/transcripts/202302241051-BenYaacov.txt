32 you said? I think that's 32. Yeah, so thanks for the organizers. So what's that we came here? I mean, last time I was here, there was only maybe one or that's. So thank you very much. So I want to speak about this old project globalism value fields and some aspects. And some aspects of it. So, the general project is joint work with Bozzovsky. And my goal is to get to a point where I speak of some recent progress which was obtained also with Tarimba de Pasito. I guess I had to make some choice of either aiming directly to this nice result without explaining what it's good for or explaining what it's good for and see how long that takes. And I think it's still better to actually remind you, those who have just slightly forgotten, what globally valid fields are about. So, okay let's start with the definition that With a definition that nobody even bothered to mention. So, if k is a field, so evaluation, everybody knows this so well, but let me just write it down for a second. So, it's evaluation, it's a function, okay, it's v from k to some additive group. additive group, add infinity, what not, and it satisfies vx y equals vx plus y vx plus y. Sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's greater than the minimum. So I'm going to use this infix notation for minimum and okay. And okay, vx is 0 if I sorry is infinite if I if x is 0. You know the message. You can correct it if I'm wrong. So now think maybe you have so that's usually people speak about the field with A valuation. Now think you have a family of valuations. So I don't know, maybe consider a family of valuations called V, so let's index it in some space. Space, and let's say it's a measure space. So it has a measure. Let's say this measure is global, so global measure is a measure such that for all x in k, okay, so if x is zero, that's. If x is 0, that's going to be infinite, so that's not good, so let's omit 0. I can take the integral of the valuations of x, d mu of omega. So first of all, it's measurable. Second, it's integrable, and third, the integral is always zero. So examples of this are abundant in In geometry and friends and arithmetic, say, what does a mega crypto omega? What? What is crypto omega? I mean, something. Something? Something. It was called global measure. Yeah, let's call it global measure. Globalizing measure. Maybe would you call it globalizing measure? I don't care. So, standard examples. If I take If I take some small field kt, so my large field is small field with kt, so I have for every irreducible polynomial in t, I have a p-adic valuation. And there is another valuation that's not a p-adic valuation for an irreducible polynomial. That's the just look at the degree. Okay, degree is not a valuation, minus the degree. Degree is not evaluation. Minus the degree is evaluation. Sometimes we call it devaluation at infinity. Let's give this measure one. Let's give this measure degree of p. This is an example. So omega is all irreducible polynomials and this infinity one. Another example: Q. So what are the variations? Q. So, what are the valuations on Q? Okay, here you have all the VPs. Ah, you don't have an infinity, so the reason I wrote this is because I wanted to correct it. Let's allow a small error term there. Well, now you can put minus log of the absolute value called this V infinity, and do the same. infinity and do the same thing so here mu is one here mu is log p so just minus this one and and again it's easy to check that this is an example plus all algebraic extensions so if you take a finite algebraic extension there is just a unique so you extend the valuation that definitely valuation and there is a unique way to split the measure such as this works and so and And so at the limit, so these are actual sums, but at the limit, you get to the. Okay, this is the canonical example. These are standard examples. So this is a very set-theoretic definition. I have a value. I mean, the moment I speak of a measured space, it's set-theoretic. It's very not model-theoretic. So let me just mention, so actually, there are several. So actually, there are several ways of presenting this as a more model-theoretic object. So, let me start with one of them. So, let us replace, let us consider the function, put all the evaluations together and create a single function. Together and create a single function that goes from k times to l1 of omega in the obvious way. Okay, right? Vx of omega is v omega of x. So now what do we have? This thing, well, obviously, this, I will take real valued functions. So this thing is a Ballach space, so it's like 0 plus multiplication by 0. Multiplication by scalars, etc. Okay, Banach space is, we know it's a Banach space, but because I take only real-valued functions, I can also take the point-wise minimum, point-wise maximum. These are also going to be integrable functions. So I have assumed gamma is contained in reals. Oh, oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, today all the music. Yes, today all the mutations are re-valued. Sorry. Well, all the mutations are re-valued except for this one. Because this one is A L1 of omega value evaluation. It satisfies all these axioms. Obviously value is. The integral is. The integral without the absolute value is zero. Yes, the integral of the absolute value of is usually not zero. Why do we have the integral of the absolute value? No, these are integrable functions. So part of the hypothesis about a globalizing measure is that the integral of the absolute value is finite. It's part of the hypothesis. Ah, okay. This is part of that. Yeah, of a global if I write integral of a non if I write the integral of a non otherwise structure. Okay, and the point is that this actually let's actually call this gamma. And now I get this structure k. get this structure k times k gamma and v. So k is a field, gamma is this object, I'm going to say in a second what it is, and v is this thing, and it satisfies all these equalities. So what is this gamma? So if I say it's L1 of omega, I haven't improved anything. But you can just say this is about, so gamma, this thing, gamma. Gamma is an L1 lattice. So, what's an L1 lattice? Okay, there are sets of axials, but forget about them. It's a Banach space equipped with a compatible lattice order, such that it is isomorphic necessarily to something that's of the form L1 of some omega. You can reconstruct N omega, not necessarily the same one, but you include the integral. Integral? You include integral with the signature. It's already there. Integral, so if alpha, if alpha is in gamma, then the integral of alpha, and I'm not writing dmu because I no longer have a measure, I don't have anything, is equal to the norm of alpha max zero plus the norm of alpha. Sorry. So, all the information is in this Banach lattice structure. You have the normal in there. I have the Banach lattice structure. I don't have omega, but I have a Banach space structure and the lattice order. I mean, the lattice operation. And actually use the lattice operation there to define the lattice. So this is a field equipped with a lattice. A field equipped with a lattice valuation that is global in the sense now, okay, so now I add this, let's incorporate this, so now I have this guy, and I assume, okay, suppose the hypothesis is that for all x in k times, the norm of v of x max theorem is equal to the norm of v of x. And you can go backwards exactly because any damocratis is of this form. That's just saying et equal is 0. That's just saying the equal 0. That is saying that the equal is 0. It's a nice way to present things. I want another one, which actually surprised me by its simplicity at first. Surprised me by its simplicity at first. It's really a very nice way of saying things without gamma. So, well, once you have, I mean, really, a global valuation is really what you need in order to be able to define some kind of theory of height. For example, if you want to define projective height, so if I have, for example, if I don't know, x is in k to the n, I can. Is in k to the n. I can define the projective height of x as I take integral of v of x1, mean v of xn. Okay, that's going to be negative, so let's take it. Okay, that's a projective half. I mean, that's, and if you multiply it by a scalar, it's going to not change because the integral of the scalar, the integral of evaluation of a single scalar is. Of the single scalar is so it's actually a property of the projective point. And so, what are the properties of this function? So, okay, well, so H is gravitation invariant. To additive. So if I take h of x tensor y, by which I mean just take all the pairwise products of x, i times y j, that's just the sum. Monotone, so h, if I take h of x, it's always going to H of x, it's always going to be less than the height of h of x together with anything. You have possibility of manipulating things a bit. So if you have x plus y, it's always going to be less than h of x, comma y, I guess that's what I wanted. Yes. Wanted, yes. Um I guess you want to add sorry, and I want to add a small possibility of error here if you want to also allow for Archimedean evaluations. And then, okay, and some stupid things like H11 is 0 and H or any singleton. Easy. So these are all the most obvious properties. Like the most obvious properties of a projective height function, you can define the projective height function from this structure. And the funny thing is that you can also go back. If you have k equipped with a family, well, I mean, these are going to have an n-ary predicate for, I mean, an n-ary function for each n. And if you have k with such a family of functions, satisfying these axioms, you can actually. Why is x of singleton equal to zero, for example? For example, oh, it's like obvious thing, right? Yes, it is this. This is just the fact that the integral, so integral of V of X equals zero. Oh, which is because the H, the height of a single dot is just this, equals zero. And then together with this, you see that it's only a property of the projective point. Okay, and so how do you go from this And so how do you go from this backwards? I mean it's it's it's actually quite uh it's actually quite nice. Uh basically you take the multiplicative group of your field, you look at the generated, you basically generate a lattice ordered group and then the height just defines a positive function or all that and okay. And okay, you can go for the visible. Okay, it's really in some sense, it's the obvious thing you would do, and you'd end up getting an L1 lattice. K times, okay, let's take it additively. Now you take the lower. Take the lower cent that is generated by this. So these are all the formal minima of points in K. Then, okay, that's going to be an additive tiny. It's unreadable. This is unreadable? Yeah, totally. Oh, Lord. Okay, so you take you general. You generate a lower semi-lattice. That's a bit smaller. Generate a lower semi-lattice from this. So this is formal minimum of guys in K star. So that's going to be still an additive monoid. And then, so it's something with. So it's something with plus and minimum. And then you take the generated, so it's an additive, well you take the generated additive group. So now you have something with plus, minus, minimum, maximum. And then, well, tensorize it with Q to make a divisible group. And now H just gives you a normal. Just gives you a no on this thing, takes a completion. It's exactly this line. How you recover the valuation V? Oh, V is it's already there. So V of X is just so what's the context at the beginning when you start? I start with my field. I start with any field. Yes. Field. I start with any field. Yes. Okay. It's got a multiplicative group, only think of it as an additive group. Okay, for fun. Okay, generate, take the lowest level lattice generated by it. It's still an additive monoid. Okay? So, complete it to an actual abelian group. Complete it to an indivisible group. Okay, you still, if you take any guy in the multiplicative group of K, it belongs here, so it finds its way all the way. So it finds its way all the way here. And now we just check that this hypothesis tells you that H basically allows you to define a norm on this guy. And you take the completion and you get that guy. And the valuation is just the map that sends X to this guy in traveling. So it's surprisingly simple. Okay, it's surprisingly simple. You need to check all the details. I'm not going to do it. You need to check all the details. I'm not going to do it now, but it's all there. You have to quotient out by something. Well, I mean, there are lots of... Well, here you quotient out by cancellation, and when I say completion with respect to a norm, I also implicitly mean that you mod out by the kernel of the. Mode out by the kernel of the norm because it's actually semi-normal. But yeah, that's yeah. There are some steps where you have to mode out by certain things, but it's always the obvious thing to mod out by. Okay, so now we get to a situation where what we have is a structure which consists of the more familiar setting. Okay, so we have a Okay, so we have a set together with some functions in field operations, maybe lattice operations if you have the two-sorted version, and we have real-valued what I call predicates. Some people might not be happy. So it really looks like a logical structure, only rather than Boolean-valued predicates, we have real-valued predicates. Valued predicates, we have real-valued predicates, so it fits in continuous logic. Only they're usually in continuous logic. For those who are familiar, going to tell me, wait a minute, but usually they're supposed to be bounded and they're not. So right. So it's in unbounded continuous logic. I'm not going to go into the details of that. It works. It can be reduced to standard bounded continuous logic. There is no problem. It's just, it allows us to do it. So these are structures. In unbounded continuous logic. Okay, so now we can start thinking about, now they're actually logical structure, we can start thinking about the theory. So GVF, in either presentation, GVF, so the theory, you can axiomatize all the properties I stated, you can axiomatize, I mean, this is fairly obvious, you should be able to axiomatize the other presentation. The other presentation, you need to know something about L1 lattices, but it's very easy to. So GVF is axiomatizable. So it's an elementary class. And it's an inductive class. So this is where we were. So this is where we were with UDI problem over 10 years ago. And from this point onward, things started going very, very slowly. So obvious questions when you, it's surprising how slowly and how difficult. I mean, this globality constraint is at the same time extremely strong and extremely confusing. So obvious question. So you have an inductive class. So, you have an inductive class, so it means that we have easy models. Okay, question one: characterize Isimonus. Okay, the best I can say is which table do you want with the one with the one with the turbulent. That's bad. No, there are. Okay, once you start getting close to being ECs, they're completely biotechnical. So it's the same fact. It doesn't matter. So you want to characterize EC models? We don't know. We do have some fairly conjectu fairly I mean, okay, I'm recently more conf more convinced that this should work, but conjecturally But conjecturally, the full ones. I'm really not going to enter into what that means. I made the mistake of trying to explain that to somebody over lunch or dinner, and I think we both regretted it. But we do have two examples. So if you take take KT, the algebraic closure, so easy C. What is K? So this is this function field of a curve. You take any field K, you do the construction, the KT example I gave earlier, you take all its algebra, okay, there is a unique GVS structure on its algebraic closure, and it is EC. And more And more recently, Udi students whose name I wrote down, I'm not sure I'd be able to. Exactly. What is it? Shakhnievich. Shakhnevich. Okay, so Q out. Sorry. I'm already running out of time. Second question, which gets us closer to the present conference, is what about stability? Well, look. Well, look, we don't even know. I mean, okay, we do know that this class does not have the amalgamation property. So even if it has a model companion, this model companion is not going to have quantifier elimination. And we really don't understand quantifiers very well yet. So let's, you know what? Let's be modest. Quantify freestyle. I'm going easy on myself. Uh okay, so here's where there was some recent progress. But for a very long time we were stuck on... Okay, so how would you show that it has quantified free stability? Okay, for example, if you can show that there is a unique coair, well, that's good. Okay, so let's try to prove that let's try to show, okay, let's consider. So let's take K. Let's say that it's EC, doesn't matter. I mean, you can actually take everything. I mean, if you actually take everything, actually full would be enough. I mean, okay, full should be the same as EC. Okay, EC, and I have two extensions. So L is KA and M is K D. And let's assume that what that L is coerc-independent, quantifier-free coerc. quantifier free co-air, but I'm going to omit the quantifier free. Everything I do is quantify free. So quantify free co-air of m over k. Let's assume this. Can you describe the compositum of L and M as a globally valid field? Okay, it's K, A, B. Okay, but what is the GVF structure on it? Yes, I want to show that there is a unique one, so I mean I need to describe. I want to show that there is a unique one, so I need to describe it. Okay, okay, all right. One way to show that it's a unique one is to describe it. So, first of all, so let's take first step one. Okay, so step one would be, let's consider just the valuation, well, not group, but valuation like this. So, if you have this, then this implies that the gamma of L is independent. Gamma of L is independent from the gamma of M over the gamma of L. Now, wait, this, so first of all, it would be UQF, but the theory of L1 lattices is has quantifier elimination and is stable. So it actually tells you that these things are independent. So stability, so there is a paper by Bernstein, Hanson, and myself where we discuss. And myself, where we describe explicitly independence in such artisticness. So, let me tell you what is the thing. Okay, so let's say that this is, so this is L1 of omega of k, this is L1 of omega of L, and this is omega L. Okay, so what does it mean? We have omega of K here. Okay, so the omega of K is some space. Wait, it's a little bit too much space. What is omega of K? What does omega of L over? First of all, we need to understand extensions of these lattice. So, an extension of the lattice is actually a projection of a measure-preserving projection of the measure space. So, think this is measure preserving. So, think that over each point here, you actually have a probability space. Each fiber is a probability space. Each fiber is a probability of things. It's not exactly that, it's a good enough intuition. Oh, but it's not only that, you can actually also add things outside the support. So this is omega of m. It looks like this. Okay, and omega of m should look like this. And now the free amalgam, so omega of L M, so sorry, so so okay, so the free amalgam of Okay, so the free ML gamma of gamma L and gamma N is L1 of the thing where you take, here you take fiber product and you just take the new. So you take this plus the fiber product plus this thing. And this gives you a numerous space here, fiber product over each point you take, the product of two probability spaces is a probability space, independent. It's nice. Okay, so you get. Okay, so you get let's call it omega. Okay, this is I want this to be omega L. It's actually not true what I just wrote, but we'll see in a second. So now say I have some omega in this guy, so some omega here. Okay, so this means I have, it gives me a valuation on M and evaluation on L that are compatible with, that have a common restriction to evaluation on A. Okay, so I have Okay, so I have L, let's call it, let's just call it V L. Let's just write L V omega, and I have M V omega. And now these guys actually by can now build the sequence, a moly sequence of M's, and now that you give you a moly sequence of this guy that's consistent with this guy. So these guys are also independent of a K. Again, I'm writing: if you consider valued fields with value group fixed real numbers, then this is again a stable theory. You can also do it with stable, with state of token up to the value group, etc. But okay, I prefer it this way. So this is actual independence in the stable theory of valued fields in the reals. Field in the wheels. And so that means that we have LM and VW is just a temporal product. So you can explicitly describe the theory of field equipped with real-valued in the real domain. The reals are fixed. The reals are not a sort. And not a sort, it's the real, so it's in continuous logic. It's basically the valuation is a predicate. Okay. So I have a description, and something similar happens here and here. So I have a complete description of the measure space, and I have a complete description of the valuation on the composite at each point. Great! I have a complete description then. Well, no, because I still need the integral to be. I still need the integral to be zero, and it's usually not going to be zero. Absolutely no need for it to be zero. What is going to happen is that this integral is always going to be negative, and now we need to add something. I mean, the only valuations you can add are valuations that are trivial. I mean, I covered all the valuations that are not trivial on L. I covered all the valuations that are non-trivial on M, but the Non-trivial on M, but there may be valuations that are trivial on L, trivial on M, but non-trivial on the composite. If so, trivial on L and M, but not on L. Because they are trivial on L and M, they're going to be positive on the tensor product of L and M, so really on points that are in the tensor product, you have to have here the integral. You have to have here the integral has to be negative, and you can show. I mean, basically, the proof that you have amalgamation over full gvx is exactly, you show that these things are going to be negative, and therefore you can complete it something that's exactly zero and then pass to the fraction field, and that's the component. Okay. Anyway, over in here you assume that it's already amalgamated, so you know they're going to have some of these valuations, and these are the ones that give you trouble. That gives you trouble. So, what? Do you know how many you need? How many you want? Yes, lots. I'm going to describe them. I'm going to give some partial description of these valuations, and you're going to see that there can be many, many, many. Okay. So let's now omega be here. So. So now omega is in the wheelspace. So V omega is, so V omega is trivial. On L, it's trivial on M, which means that if you look at the residue map, so so this means that, okay, so this means two things, first of all, that O omega. That O omega is going to be to contain L tensor M. And second, that the residue map is going to be injective. So the residue map from O omega to, well, O omega over M omega conjunctive on L and M. So basically this thing is going to So basically this thing is going to be equal to k A prime B prime, where A prime B prime is a specialized, A prime is the same as A, B prime is the same as B, but together they are a specialization of A B. Specialization. And now there is, I mean, obviously, it has to be a proper specialization, otherwise you didn't divide by anything as the valuation, it's treated the validation. By anything, at the valuation, it is trivial. Valuation is non-trivial, which means that you must have introduced some algebraic relation between A prime and B prime that don't exist between A and B. A and B are completely algebraically freely amalgamated. A and B are the two generators of L and M respectively. I took the tensor product, so I took the algebraic tensor product, so A and B are algebraically independent over K. And once you take And once you take the residue map, you get A prime and B prime that are no longer algebraically independent. So it's a specialization. So one way of thinking of it is saying that if I have W, let's say V is a locus of A, U is the locus of B over K, of course, and W is the locus of A prime. So it's the same as the locus. So it's the same as the locus of A prime, because here it was injective, same for B. But the locus of A prime, B prime, is going to be a proper sub-variety of UOV times U. And now there is a stupid question. What is the co-dimension of this variety? But what is V and U? This is the just the the variety. The correct locks. The locks. Yeah. Okay. So it's going to be a sub for. I think the question is: what, how many? Okay, so an exact way of formulating how many new algebraic relations you introduce between A prime, B prime is asking, what is the co-dimension of this variety? What is the co-dimension of that? So, well, it's going to be at least one because otherwise evaluation is trivial and you just don't see it. At least one. At least two times. Otherwise, nothing happened. You said it's proper. Well, but it's proper because if it's not proper, then just it's it's a trivial valuation and you don't have trivial valuations because you just don't see them. Okay, so here's the problem. What happens if it's two? If it's two, you're two. If it's two, you are screwed. Why? Well, two ways of saying why. First is because you can always do it with score dimension one. So if you can also do it with score dimension two, you don't have uniqueness. One because Because it can be always. Because this is a wishful thinking. Yes, of course. Almost the magic is wishful thinking that the sample becomes, well, less wishful and more. Yes. Yes, it's wishful thinking. So. So if I have also something with two, I can also do it with one. Also, do it with one. Non-uniqueness. Okay. So maybe let's justify the fact very, very quickly that this is neostability and say that another problem is that if you can do it with two, then in fact, not only are you not stable, you're not even NIP. Sorry, yes. Oh, not NIP. Sorry. Sorry, yes. Oh, not me. Sorry. We have IP. So, second, so now assume that you have, let's produce lots of copies. So let's produce L0, that's K A0 and L1, lots of free copies. You can amalgamate, take a moly sequence in this, take a moly song by moly, I mean coherent sequence, whatever. M0 is K of B0, and again, M1, and so on. And you can amalgamate all of them. So each pair has. Amalgamate all of them. So each pair has the same type as L and L. So now, so it's actually strong when I said you can always be done with coding one. Even now, I can take this and for any pair L i L J, M J, I can take this coding two valuation straight to the trash and replace it with other valuations of code dimension one. And I can do it where I want and not do it where I want. Where I want, and not do it where I don't want. So I get IB. Okay, so I don't know if some people are going to be able to do it. So, I don't know if some people remember, I was walking at the Cition Reponcaré way back when, and asking people, can you find a polynomial that does something? And it was exactly because of this. So, how would you show, you want to show that this cannot happen. So, how would you show it? Well, one way to say it is: look, so question. So, here, if I have, I have lots of, so I have all logs. I have lots of, so I have all lots of LIs, so I have lots of Vi's. And here I have lots of NJs, so I have lots of UJs. And I have lots of, so for each Vi times UJ, I have the corresponding copy of W, copy W of Ij. It's of codimension too. And now the question is very simple. Can I find polynomials? Let's call them P. Let's call them P indexed by n. Okay, so it's x1 to xn y1 to 1n that vanish vanish on wij for all ij less than n. But the total degree in all the variables simultaneously of pn is little o. Is little O of n squared. If I can do this, what's going to happen? Okay, I'm slightly cheating, but it's still essentially the same question. There is a reduction step. What's going to happen is that take this polynomial for n sufficiently big, then you are going to have, so basically you control the, then evaluate if some, if, yes. So consider P of Pn of A1 to AN, B1 to BN. You have poles. What are the poles of this thing? So the poles are controlled by the degree. The zeros, well, you have at least as many zeros as all these All these vanishing, so basically n, at least n square. Well, star is a constant, but constant is fixed. And so for n large enough, this is little of n squared, this is n squared, you're going to have more zeros than poles, so the integral is going to be strictly positive. Okay, and that gets you. So that's the thing. If you can find such a sequence of polynomials, then you won't. The new one. We asked quite a few people. I mean, still, if somebody now tells me that this exists somewhere in the literature, I'm surprised that we haven't found it. But okay, to cut a long story short, we asked around. At some point, Karima Di Pesito from Jerusalem solved a special case, actually a very special case, where V and U are the two space, and W is just a diagonal. And then it didn't look like it should be generalizable, and then it was generalized by some tricks that I'm not going to have the time to speak about, but the answer is basically. So, at the proceed to sorry, why should I say this? So, okay, so you're a sickle. Yes, it should be published. Well, should the preprint should be ready soon, but I guess I have stopped here. Thank you. So, do we have much? So, what is the conclusion of all that? That we need to see. So the so okay. So the conclusion is okay, no, the conclusion goes a bit further than that. So the conclusion is that this really annoying obstruction that we can exclude. So we know that if you have a free amalgam, say cover amalgam or quantified free non-voking amalgam or whatever, then on the unknown part, you only have codimension one. That's the first, that's the theorem. Odi goes a bit further and said that this is enough to actually prove quantify free stability. Okay, you can easily prove the uniqueness of amalgamation if at least one of the two fields is a purely transcendental extension. So it's time to reason that the general case should hold. Udi has an argument. I'm okay. I'm. No, no, I mean, it's just, I'm not. I mean, it's just I I I'm not a geometry, I'm sorry, I mean I'm okay. One once you get into uh heights on the Albanese variety, my my brain starts to shut shutter now. But in principle, this should actually tell you that you do have quantified free stability in this class. Other questions? I have questions. Like is it original theory? Theory of global value fields. Now you spoke about existentially closed models, the abstract settings. And then is the function V surjective then? It cannot be surjective because it only goes to things of integral zero. Oh, I see. Wait, but it is true. Okay, but it's as good as you said. So basically, in an EC model, its image is going to be dense. Its image is going to be dense in the kernel of the integral, and I mean, that's something you can say. And it's basically the first axiom you write for that side.
