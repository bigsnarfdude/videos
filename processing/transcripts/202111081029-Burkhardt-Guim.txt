I guess I should look at the cameras. Okay. Okay, so I'm going to start with this theorem of Gromov. Theorem. Okay, so this is a Gromov 2014. Okay, and it says the following. Let M be a smooth manifold manifold. And kappa from m to r, a continuous function. And suppose we are in the following situation. So we have a sequence gi, these are Riemannian metrics that converge uniformly to some limiting metric g, so this gives us i goes to infinity. i goes to infinity. Okay, so these are just C2 Riemannian metrics. And then we're going to assume that somehow we happen to know that the limit is also a C2 Riemannian metric. Okay, so this is C2. And then we are going to suppose that each metric in the sequence satisfies some point-wise lower scalar curvature bound. So what I mean is that the scalar curvature of gi at x is bounded below by kappa of x for all i. Okay, and so then the Okay, and so then the conclusion is that then the limit satisfies the same point-wise lower scalar curvature bound. So then the scalar curvature of G is also bounded below by kappa. Okay, so this is somehow like rather surprising. You know, we only have uniform convergence here, so we wouldn't really expect to be able to say anything about the curvature of the limit, just given uniform convergence. And yet somehow these pointwise lower scalar curvature bounds are preserved under uniform convergence. Curvature bounds are preserved under uniform convergence. So, this is kind of an interesting fact, and so if you wanted to prove this, you could proceed in one of two ways. I'm not used to giving talk talks, so I'm gonna try to space this out. Okay, so let's see how this works. Okay, so the first way, this is the original method to do to Gromov. So, this is Gromov 2014. And so basically, what Gromov does is that he notices that if you have a pointwise lower scalar curvature bound, there's a way that you can actually think about this as a sort of C0 property. And then, you know, if you can think about this as a C0 property, then this C0 property is going to be preserved under uniform convergence. And so this is sort of how you prove it. Okay, and so let me write that down. So one way you could say this is that he creates a sort of generalized notion. A sort of generalized notion of what it means to have a lower scalar curvature bound that only depends on C0 quantities. Okay, so I'll say create a generalized notion of scalar curvature bounded below by kappa. Okay, that depends only on C0 quantities, so it makes sense for C0 metrics. Makes sense for C0 metrics. Okay, and then I guess sort of unsurprisingly, because it depends on C0 quantities, it's stable under C0 convergence. And then of course, you know, as expected, it agrees with the usual definition. It agrees with the usual definition if you have a C0 metric, which happens to be C2. Okay, so I will say agrees with the usual notion for C2 metrics. Okay, and so if you had a sort of generalized C0 definition like this, then the way in which you could prove this theorem is as follows. Theorem is as follows. So my GI satisfies some lower scalar curvature bound in the classical sense, and so then obviously they also satisfy the lower bound in this sort of generalized C0 sense, but this C0 definition is stable under uniform convergence, so we know that the limit is going to satisfy this sort of C0 definition, but then we know that the limit is also C2, or that's our assumption, and so it's going to satisfy the classical lower scalar convergent bound. Okay, so that is how, you know, obviously it's like very non-trivial to figure out what this generalized notion is. Trivial to figure out what this generalized notion is, but given such a generalized notion, that's how you would do the proof. Okay, so I'm not going to talk very much about Gromov's like C0 definition in the course of this talk, but maybe I will just say this has to do with the non-existence of certain types of polyhedra. Okay, so I'll just write a polyhedra. Okay, so that is one way in which you could prove this theorem. And the other way that you could prove this theorem, this is due to Bamler. This is due to Bambler, and this is to use the Ricci flow. So method two. This is due to Bandler. In 2016, okay, and so this method is to use the Ricci flow. I don't know, it's probably not necessary for this audience, but maybe let me just remind you what is the Ricci flow. So the Ricci flow is an evolution equation. So, the Ricci flow is an evolution equation for Riemannian metrics on a manifold. It's this evolution equation. So, dg dt is equal to negative 2 Ricci. Okay, and then you can prescribe some initial data. And the reason that you might guess that Ricci flow is relevant to this theorem is that Ricci flow has this nice property that uniform lower scalar curvature bounds are preserved. Uniform lower scalar curvature bounds are preserved under Vici flow. Okay, so what I mean is that if my initial data, g0, satisfies some uniform lower scalar curvature bound, okay, so here kappa naught is a constant, and then for all positive times for which the flow is defined, each time size of the flow will satisfy the same uniform lower scalar curvature bound. So then the scalar curvature of the flow is also bound. Is also bounded below by kappa. Okay. And so then if you wanted to use Ricci flow to prove this theorem, okay, I'm going to say a lot of lies, but maybe this will give you sort of a sense of what's going on. You could proceed in the following way. So I have my gi, which are converging uniformly to some limiting metric g. And then what I could do is I could run the flow starting from flow starting from the GI's and I could run the flow starting from G and then somehow the flow will turn the uniform convergence of the initial data into locally smooth convergence for positive t. Okay, so something like this. And so, okay, at least if we wanted to show this theorem in the case where kappa is a constant, then we could do the following. Is a constant, then we could do the following. Well, I know that my Gi satisfies this lower scalar curvature bound, and I know that, at least if we're in the uniform case, the flow is going to preserve the lower scalar curvature bound. So Gi satisfy some uniform lower scalar curvature bound, so the Gi of T also satisfy that uniform lower scalar curvature bound. And then by smooth convergence, the limiting G of T also satisfy that uniform lower scalar curvature bound. And then by letting T goes to zero, we find that the limit satisfies the lower scalar curvature. We find that the limit satisfies the lower scalar curvature bound. Now, obviously, you know, this argument that I just said only works if you have a uniform lower scalar curvature bound because this fact is only true for constants, kappa. Now, this is not a constant, it's some kind of continuous function. But if you want to prove the full version of this statement using Rigiflo, you need to somehow figure out some way of localizing this argument, which is quite non-trivial, but this is what Baylor does. I think, let me erase this. I don't need it. Okay, so what we have done is we've, you know, talked about how to show this theorem in two different ways. So one way is to use Ruiji flow, and another way is to use this sort of generalized C0 formulation of what it means to have a lower scalar curvature bound. And a priori, these two methods don't have very much to do with one another. But this leads us to ask this very natural question, which is whether there is some kind of underlying Which is whether there is some kind of underlying connection between the techniques that are used in both. Okay, and so here's sort of a motivating question. Question. Can grow mobs polyhedral definition. Definition of a lower scalar curvature bound be reformulated in terms of Ricci flow. Okay, so this. Okay, so this is sort of our motivating question. I don't know the answer to this question. I'm not going to really talk about this question for the purposes of this talk, but what I will do instead is talk about sort of maybe like a nice first step towards answering this question, which is to sort of come up with some C0 definition of a lower scalar curvature bound using the Ricci flow and kind of check that it behaves appropriately. Okay, and so our goal for today will be to develop To develop develop a reasonable point-wise, point-wise notion of a lower scalar curvature bound for C0 metrics. Using the VT flow. Okay, so that is our goal. All right, okay, so any such reasonable goal is going to satisfy certain properties, and so maybe I will just write down what I want my definition. What I want my definition, my generalized definition, to satisfy. So I'll say want. Okay, so first of all, if I have two metrics that agree to greater than second order around some point, you know, in the smooth case, this means that their scalar curvatures at that point will be equal. And so, but then sort of, I'll write this down more precisely, but agreeing to greater than second order is actually like a C0 condition. And so somehow, if I have two C0 metrics that agree to greater than second, C0 metrics that agree to greater than second order around some point, and one of them satisfies some kind of generalized lower scalar curvature bound, then I would like the other one to as well. Okay, and so what I mean is if g prime and g prime prime, oops, I can't decide what to call the other one, g prime prime are C0 metrics such that we have something like this. Okay, so we can, we're comparing. Okay, so we can, we're comparing them like with respect to some fixed smooth background, let's say. If this, so if g prime minus g prime prime is bounded above by some polynomial of degree greater than 2 in the distance to some central point, like for all x near x dot, then g prime satisfies some general prime satisfies some generalized lower scalar curvature bound if and only if the same is true for G prime prime. Okay, and so the way to see why we would sort of expect this to be true is in the smooth case, we can look at the Taylor expansions of both of these metrics around the point x naught. And if this condition holds, then it tells you that the zero, first, and second order terms in those Zero, first, and second order terms in those Taylor expansions are all equal. And in particular, the zero, first, and second order derivatives of these two at the point x0 are all equal, so their scalar curvatures should be equal. Okay, so somehow this is a C0 condition, but in the smooth case, it tells us that the scalar curvatures are equal. And so we would expect that some version of this is preserved for this C0 definition. Okay, and then the second thing that we would like to be true is, well, we have this sort of nice classical property of lower scalar curvature bounds. Property of lower scalar curvature bounds under Ricci flow, which is that uniform lower scalar curvature bounds are preserved by the Ricci flow. And so we would like some version of that to still be true for our C0 definition. All right, so if G is a C0 metric, okay, and now I need to be a little bit big. Let's say on a closed manifold. Oh geez. Closed manifold. Manifold and I have some Ricci flow starting from G. Okay, so I owe you an explanation for what this means. So starting from G. Let's see, and how did I want to say that? Let's see, and how did I want to say this? And oh, okay, I wrote this in sort of a bad order. And G satisfies a uniform lower scalar curvature bound in the generalized sense, then I would expect that all time slices of this G tilde T, this Rui G flow, would also satisfy the same uniform lower scalar curvature bound. Okay, so and this is some constant. Okay, so sorry, yeah, I wrote this down in a slightly complicated way, but all I am saying is that, you know, one property that I want my C0 definition to satisfy is if I have some C0 metric which satisfies a uniform lower scalar curvature bound in this generalized sense, and I can take a Ricci flow starting from I can take a Ricci flow starting from that metric in some reasonable way, then I would like that Ricci flow to preserve the uniform lower scalar curvature bounds. Okay, and so, and yes, I need to explain to you what it means to have a Ricci flow starting from C0 initial data. And then, of course, I want my generalized C0 definition to agree with the normal definition of a lower scalar curvature bound if I have a C0 metric which happens to be C2. Okay, so it agrees. With a classical notion for C2 metrics. Sorry, this is a little squishy. Okay. Okay, so I want my generalized definition to satisfy three properties. I, first of all, want it to be stable under a greater than second order perturbation of the metric. Than second-order perturbation of the metric. I want uniform lower scalar curvature bounds to be preserved under Ricci flow in some sense. And then I also want it to agree with the usual notion. And so as I said, you know, what I'm trying to do is create this sort of C0, like generalized notion of what it means to have a lower scalar curvature bound using the Ricci flow. And what I now need to do is explain to you what it means to have a Ricci flow starting from some initial data, which is C0. Okay? Now, in the classical setting, In a classical setting, oh, sorry, maybe I should just henceforth, okay, let me just write it here. Henceforth, I'll take M to be closed. Closed is not actually essential for most of the things that I'll do, but it simplifies some things. Okay, so let's say M is closed. So, as I was saying, what I need to do now is explain what I mean by having a Richie flow starting from C0 initial data. And in the classical setting, And you know, in the classical setting, this would just mean that you have something that satisfies the Ricci flow equation and it converges uniformly to the initial data as t goes to zero, and also all of its derivatives, or locally uniformly, depending on the setting, and all of its derivatives also converge to the derivatives of the initial data. Now, obviously, if we have a C0 initial metric, this last piece doesn't make sense because it's not going to have derivatives. But I could at least hope that I could find a Ricci flow that converges uniformly to the initial data as t goes to zero. To zero. Now, the next thing that I'm going to write down actually says that maybe you don't even quite have that, but you will at least be able to find a Rigi flow that converges uniformly to the initial data as t goes to zero, modulo pushed forward by a family of diffeomorphisms. Okay, so I'll write that here. So lemma, this is the lemma that tells you in what sense there exists a Ricci flow starting from Z0 initial data. Okay, and so this lemma is not, you know, I'll explain a little bit later how you prove this, but this builds off of a lot of work that has already been fairly well studied. So let M be closed. M be closed G a C zero metric on M. Okay, then there exists a time-dependent smooth family of measurements. Smooth family of metrics. I'll call them g tilde t. These are going to be defined on some positive time interval. So t is bigger than 0. Okay, and there exists, this is the sort of confusing part, a continuous surjection. surjection, which I call chi, such that the following two things are true. So first of all, this smooth family of metrics is a Ricci flow in the sense that it satisfies the Ricci flow equation. Okay, so I'll say Solves the Rucci flow equation. And also, there exists a family of diffeomorphisms that approximate chi, and after I push forward this Ruchi flow by that family of diffeomorphisms, I will get a family that converges uniformly to the initial data. Okay, so let me write this. So there exists. So, there exists a smooth family of diffeomorphisms defined on the same positive time interval, t go from m to m such that, okay, let me try to fit it in now. Okay, let me try to fit it in down here. So the chi t converge uniformly. If I write down here, can people see? Is that okay? Okay. So the chi t converge uniformly to chi as t goes to zero. And also, the push forward of the Ricci flow converges uniformly to g zero. This goes to zero as t goes to zero. As t goes to zero. Okay. So what is a regularizing Ricci flow? It is a pair, one of which, one of the things in the pair is, you know, a family of smooth metrics that satisfies the Ricci flow equation. And then the second thing in the pair is this surjection, which has the property that it can be approximated by some diffeomorphisms such that after I push forward the Ricci flow by those diffeomorphisms, I get something which converges uniformly to the initial data. All right, so people who studied the Ricci flow probably will recognize this as the Ricci to Turk flow. Recognizes as the Ricci de Turk flow. Okay, so really what this is saying is that the Ricci to Turk flow converges uniformly to G. So I'll talk a little bit more about the Ricci to Turk flow later. Okay, I think okay let me erase this. I'm gonna just make a couple of remarks about this definition because it is a little bit involved. Okay, so first of all, we say, okay, this is not a remark, this is a definition, we say that the pair, which is the Ricci flow and this continuous rejection, is a regularizing Ricci flow for G. Okay, and the reason I use the word regularizing is that this Ruigi flow is smooth even though the initial data is not smooth. All right, so okay. Another thing I wanted to mention is that you could potentially have multiple regularizing Ruigi flows for a piece of C0 initial data. Piece of C0 initial data, but if that is the case, then they will both be isometric via a smooth isometry. Okay, so how do I want to say this? So if tilde GT prime chi prime is another regularizing region flow for G. Then there exists a smooth A smooth diffeomorphism smooth such that the pullback of one of your regularizing reaching flows by alpha is equal to the other one. To the other one. And also, we need to figure out: you know, a regularizing Ricci flow is a Ricci flow together with this continuous rejection. And so, what does alpha do to the surjections? It has the property that, oh, I didn't write it down. Okay, I think possibly I have the order of this backwards, but it's something like this. Okay, so we maybe don't have true uniqueness, but we have uniqueness up to smooth isometry. And then I also. And then I also, okay, I wanted to talk a little about these diffeomorphisms, and you can always choose them so that they're relatively nicely behaved. So we can always choose them so that they perturb points like square root of t. So these are just some facts about the regularizing Ricci flow. About the regularizing Ricci flow. Okay, I'll do that last night next. Right, so now you know, now I've told you what it means to have a Ricci flow starting from C0 initial data. It means you have a regularizing Ricci flow like this. And so I can sort of return to my goal of creating this generalized notion of what it means to have a lower scalar curvature bound for C0 metrics using the regularizing Ricci flow. And so the idea basically is if I want to know whether my C0 metric, which is my Whether my C0 metric, which is my initial data, satisfies some lower scalar curvature bound at a point. What I can do is I can run the regularizing Ricci flow and then check whether that flow satisfies a similar lower scalar curvature bound sort of near the point that I'm interested in. Okay, so let me make this precise. Where do I want to write this? Okay. So can I ask you actually those different morphisms? Do you get them by solving some harmonic matrix equation or something like that? Right, yeah, exactly. Yeah, I'll talk a little bit more about this later. Okay, so here is my definition, my C0 definition of what it means to have a pointwise lower scalar curvature bound for a C0 metric. Scalar curvature bound for a C0 metric. Okay, definition. Okay, let M be closed. GA C0 metric. C0 metric on M. All right. For beta between 0 and 1 half, 1 half, sorry, we say that G has scalar curvature bounded below by kappa at some point x, if the following is true. Okay, so scalar curvature bounded below. Founded below. All right. If there exists a regularizing Ricci flow for G, and there exists some Y in the same way. Some y in the pre-image of x under chi. Okay, so remember that chi was a surjection, so there could be multiple points in the pre-image. Such that the following is true. Okay, this in femum, this is not so important. But what we're going to do is take the lim inf as t goes to zero, and we're going to look at the scalar curvature of certain time slices of the flow. And then rather than just looking And then rather than just looking around a particular point at this scalar curvature, what I'm actually going to do is look in some small time-dependent neighborhood of that point. Okay, and so specifically, I will look in a ball of radius at like t to the beta. Okay, so okay, and so if this quantity L. Okay, and so if this quantity, I'll break this down a little bit, but if this quantity is greater than or equal to kappa, then I say that that means that my initial data has scalar curvature at x bounded below by kappa. Okay, so you know, let's try to process this a little bit. This infimum of overall constants, this is this constant of the radius. And this is just here for scaling purposes, so this is not important. You can ignore this if you want. And so really what we are doing is we are looking at the limb inf as t goes to zero of the scalar curvature. Of the scalar curvature of the flow in this ball. So, this is a ball around this point y, a radius slightly larger than one half. Okay, beta is less than a half, sorry, not slightly larger than a half, slightly larger than square root of t, right? Because t is going to be very small, this is smaller than a half, and so this thing is going to be larger than square root of t. Okay, right, so we are looking in this neighborhood of y to see whether for small positive times it looks Whether for small positive times, it looks as though the scalar curvature is bounded below almost by kappa. Now, the reason I'm looking at this point y in the pre-image of x under chi, rather than just looking at the point x, has to do with the fact that the regularizing Ricci flow itself does not converge uniformly to g. It only converges uniformly to g after being pushed forward by these diffeomorphisms. Okay, and so the reason that I look at this y in the pre-image of x under chi is to sort of account for that twist by the family of diffeomorphisms. A few morphisms. Now, this definition depends on a few choices. First of all, as I mentioned before, you may have non-unique regularizing Ricci flows for your metric. And also, this is a surjection, but it might not be an injection. So you could potentially have multiple points y in the pre-image of x under chi. Okay, so this definition depends on a choice of regularizing Ricci flow, and it also depends on a choice of points y, or at least a priori it depends. Um, or at least a priori it depends on those things. But actually, you know, it doesn't actually depend on those things. Because if this definition holds for, you know, any two of those choices, then it will hold for all other choices. Okay, and so I will say definition is independent of the regularizing Ricci flow, I guess I should say, of choice of Choice of and a choice of Y. Okay, so this is the definition that I have come up with. This is my C0 definition that uses the Ricci flow to talk about what it means to have a lower scalar curvature bound. Okay. And so, as I mentioned before, what I want to do now is show that this definition kind of behaves in the way. Show that this definition kind of behaves in the way that you would expect. So, I want to show that this definition is stable under greater than second-order perturbation of the metric. I want to show that, you know, if you have a uniform lower bound in this sort of C0 sense, then those uniform lower bounds are going to be preserved under the Ricci flow. And so here, what I mean is preserved under the regularizing Ricci flow. And then, of course, I want to show that this definition agrees with the classical notion for C2 metrics. Now, towards this last item, Last item, if you have a C2 metric, you can just take the regularizing Ricci flow to be the usual Ricci flow, and this is just going to turn into like a normal limit. And so it's actually pretty easy to check that in the classical setting, this definition agrees with the usual definition. Okay, so this last item is not so hard. So really, the things that we want to check are these first two items. The stability of this definition under greater than second order perturbation of the metric and the preservation of uniform lower scalar curvature balance. Richard Mouse. Okay. And so, let's see, how do I? I think what I want to do now, yes, what I want to do now is tell you two theorems that basically say that those first two items are true for this definition. Okay. What do I want to erase? Excuse me, uh could I ask a question for a second? Hold on. Um so uh what about is there some hope of relaxing this from a CZO metric to a metric which is L infinity close to smooth? Yes, I think so because you can still find a retreated turquoise for such metrics. Yeah, my concern in that situation though is that I'm not sure. That situation, though, is that I'm not sure. So, in that case, I think their Reachy to Turk flow would converge uniformly to the initial data, like almost everywhere or something. And so, then I don't know, you know, for those points where it doesn't converge uniformly, I'm not sure if it would tell you something meaningful. Yeah, I don't know what would happen. Let me erase this too. Alright, so the first thing I want to tell you is some theorem that says basically that for this definition, this first item is true. Okay, so theorem Let M be closed. G prime and G prime prime are two C0 metrics on N that agree to greater than second order around some point. Okay, so I will say. Some point. Okay, so I will say such that g prime prime of x minus g prime prime of x is bounded by this polynomial and the distance to x0 for all x near x0. Okay, and so then the conclusion is that then there exists regularized Then there exist regularizing Rucci flows for both. So let me call them g tilde t prime chi prime and g tilde prime prime chi prime prime such that for some values of theta less than one half, so for beta specifically in this interval, In this interval, if c is greater than zero and t is sufficiently small, depending on c, we have the following. Okay, and so what I'm going to write down now is basically that their scalar curvatures remain close. And sorry, the scalar curvatures of the families of metrics that uniformly approximate. Families of metrics that uniformly approximate the initial C0 metrics. Okay? And so specifically, the supremum around x0 of a ball of radius t to the beta of the difference in scalar curvatures. And now here, rather than the scalar curvatures of the regularizing Rucci flows, I'm going to put the push forwards of the regular rising Ricci flows. Okay, so this difference in scalar curvatures is bounded by ct to the omega for some omega greater than zero. So in particular, this right-hand side goes to zero as t goes to zero, so the left-hand side goes to zero as t goes to zero. Okay, sorry, I should have said earlier. Okay, sorry, I should have said earlier, you know, that these, I guess I've mentioned it, but these objects satisfy a nice evolution equation. As I was saying, these are the Vicci deterc flows, and so sometimes it's actually just preferable to work with these rather than the regularizing Breeci flows. Okay, so what this says is that if I have two C0 metrics that agree to greater than second order, and I take their regularizing British flows, I push them forward by the appropriate family of diffeomorphisms, then the scalar curvatures in a ball of radius slightly larger than square. ball of radius slightly larger than square root of t are going to stay close, you know, close by something that goes to zero as t goes to zero. Okay, and so you know this looks a little bit complicated, but if you sort of untangle this definition and you recall some of these facts that I just erased about the regularizing Ricci flow, you will, you know, it follows pretty quickly from this theorem that this first item is true. Okay. Okay, so I'll just check that off. That off. And so now what remains is to determine whether this second item is true, so whether uniform lower scalar curvature buttons are preserved under the regularizing Ricci flow. And so now I'm going to write down a theorem that says that that is the case. Oh, sorry. Before I do that, let me just make a remark, which is that the way I've stated this theorem, I have two C0 metrics on the same manifold, but actually you can prove a version of this theorem if you have two C0 metrics on different manifolds, and you can just find, you know, like. Manifolds, and you can just find a coordinate patch for both such that the two metrics agree to greater than second order around the origin in those coordinates. Okay, so this is truly a local statement. It doesn't depend on the topology of M. Okay, so I'll just say like, also works in a coordinate chart. Okay, um, right, so what I want to do now is write down a theorem that tells us that yes, this second item is indeed true. Uniform lower scalar curvature bounds are preserved under the regularizing Ricci flow. Okay, and yeah, the theorem says precisely that. Theorem. How did I write it? So let M be closed. So let M be closed. G, a C zero metric on M. Okay, suppose there exists some beta between zero and one half. Half such that the scalar curvature of G is bounded below by some constant kappa naught in the beta weak sense everywhere. Sorry, I need your chalk. In the beta weak sense everywhere. Okay. If tilde Gt, I'm going to suppress the chi for, you know, because it doesn't matter for this. If tilde gt is a regularizing Ricci flow for G, then the scalar curvature of any time slice of this regular rising Ricci flow. Of this regular rising Riji flow will also be bounded below by a half of naught for all t greater than zero. But when I say for all t greater than zero, I just mean for all t greater than zero for which the flow is defined. Certainly the flow will not necessarily exist for all time. Okay. Okay, so this theorem just says that the second item is true. Uniform lower scalar curvature bounds are indeed preserved by the regular rising Ricci flow. Okay. Now, one thing that follows from this theorem. That follows from this theorem is that if you have a C0 metric which satisfies a uniform lower scalar curvature bound in the beta-weak sense, then it automatically admits a uniform approximation by smooth metrics which satisfy the same lower scalar curvature bound in the classical sense. And the reason for that is that, okay, I have my metric G that satisfies a uniform lower scalar curvature bound. This theorem tells me that any regular rising Ricci flow for G is going to satisfy the same uniform lower scalar curvature bound in the classic. Uniform lower scalar curvature bound in the classical sense, and then after I push forward this regularizing Rigi flow by the appropriate family of diffeomorphisms, I will find a smooth family of metrics that all satisfy this uniform lower scalar curvature bound in the classical sense and converge uniformly to g as t goes to zero. Okay, so to summarize, any C0 metric which satisfies a uniform lower scalar curvature bound in the beta-week sense admits a uniform approximation by smooth metrics that Uniform approximation by smooth metrics that satisfy the same uniform lower scalar curvature bound in the classical sense. And in particular, G will then automatically satisfy Gromov's polyhedron definition, because Gromov's polyhedron definition applies to all smooth metrics with lower scalar curvature bounds, and it is closed under uniform convergence. Okay, so corollary. Of course, this doesn't really get to the mechanics of why those definitions are related. But anyway, corollary: in the case of uniform lower bounds. The beta-weak definition implies that Hermose polyhedron definition holds. You know, of course this is in the case of uniform lower bounds. Really, the point of doing all this work was to figure out a pointwise lower bound, and so somehow in that case, I actually don't know anything. But I thought this was kind of interesting. Okay. So, so far, I've told you. No other questions? Okay. So far, I've told you, you know, how I've told you or how I decided to define a lower scalar curvature bound for C0 metrics using the Ricci flow. And I told you some sort of things that I wanted to be true and some theorems that show that these things are indeed true. And I guess hopefully pretty soon I will tell you a little bit about how to prove some of these theorems. But before I do that, I just wanted to mention one application of thinking about scalar curvature in terms of Ricci flow. Okay, and so. terms of Reachie flow. Okay and so let me where should I write? I'll write here. So let me just mention one theorem so the theorem So the theorem be a C0 metric on a closed manifold M. Which admits a uniform approximation admits C0 approximation by C0 metrics by C0 metrics GI G i such that for some beta Gi has scalar curvature bounded below by kappa I in the beta weak sense. Oops, weak sense. And suppose also that these kappa i, so this is some uniform lower bound, these kappa i converge to some limiting number. All right, and so I'll say that the kappa i converge to some kappa. Okay, so these are numbers, this is a number, this is a number. And so then the conclusion, I'll draw a picture so that this is less confusing, then the conclusion is that g has scalar curvature bounded below by kappa. Curvature bounded below by kappa in the beta weak sense. Okay, so then G has scalar curvature bounded below by kappa in the beta weak sense. Okay, so sorry, this is sort of complicated way to say this, but all I mean is that if I have a sequence of metrics, Gi that converge uniformly to some limiting metric, G, and then the scalar curvature of these gi is found in the low. Gi is founded below by some sequence of numbers, and then the kappa i converge to some limiting number, then the limiting metric will have scalar curvature bounded below by the limiting number. Okay, so then, you know, in the beta weak sense. Okay, so the point of this is that the kappa i are not required to be uniform with respect to i. They can shift as long as they converge. They can shift as long as they converge. Okay, and so the reason I am mentioning this is because it allows us to answer this question of gromov. Let's see, where should I write? Write here. Oops, okay. Let me go fast. So the question is, is due to grow mom? So let G be a zero Riemannian metric on a closed manifold, which admits, so okay, on a uniform approximation By a sequence of smooth metrics which have almost non-negative scalar curvature, okay? By smooth gi with beta curvature of the gi bounded below by some minus epsilon i, where this goes to zero as i goes to infinity. And the question is, does m emit a smooth metric of non-negative scalar curvature? Of non-negative scalar curvature. Okay, can I fit this? Let's see. Does N admit a smooth metric metric of non-negative scalar curvature. Okay, and we can see from this theorem that the answer to this is certainly going to be yes. Answer to this is certainly going to be yes, okay, because by this theorem, the limiting metric G is going to have non-negative scalar curvature in the beta-weak sense. So any regularizing Ricci flow for G is going to give you a whole family of smooth metrics that have non-negative scalar curvature. Moreover, after I push forward that family of the regularizing Ricci flow by the appropriate family of diffeomorphisms, I will find a smooth family of metrics that all have non-negative scalar curvature and converge uniformly to G. And converge uniformly to G. Okay, so the answer to this question is yes. Moreover, G admits a uniform approximation by smooth metrics of not negative scalar curvature. Okay, so, ooh, I don't, okay, so I'll just say corollary, yes. Yes. Okay. Um, okay, I'm running a little bit short on time and so I don't know, is it okay if I say like two more things and then Say like two more things, and then let's see. So, I wanted to mention a little bit about how to prove both of these results. Okay, and so towards the first one, what we are going to do is we're first going to sort of think about how one constructs a Richie flow for C0 initial data, or really for any initial data. And so, what we typically do is we first solve a related Is we first solve a related equation called the Ricci-Tut-Turk flow. The reason we like the Ricci de Turk flow is that it is strongly parabolic, so you have a good chance of having a smooth short-time solution. And so, the existence of a Ricci-ta-Turk flow for C-0 initial data is fairly well studied. I think the first person to work on this was Miles Simon, and then Cochin Lamb also worked on this. And then I sort of tried to apply the method of Cochin Lamb to some other, you know, some other metrics. And so what I want to talk about is this method of Cochin-Lamb. Talk about is this method of Cochin Lam proving that there exists a Ricci-Deturk flow for C-zero initial data. And the reason I want to mention that is that they show, oh, when was this? I think this is 2011. In the course of doing this, they prove some estimate that says if your initial data starts out very close in C0 to some smooth background metric, then over time the solution to the Reachy to Turk flow is going to stay close. You know, close, basically in C0 to the same background metric. Okay, so they show something like: here's my retin deterred flow, and okay, they have this appropriate norm x, which involves an L infinity component, and their result says that if my initial metric is close to g in c0, then it will remain close, sorry, if it's close to bar g in c0, then it will remain close to bar g in this x-norm. The reason this is sort of relevant. The reason this is sort of relevant for us is because we want to show if we have two C0 metrics that agree to greater than second order, then they're going to stay close in the sense that their scalar curvatures stay close. And so to somehow, you know, I don't know, like use their method to show that type of statement, what we can do is we can put some kind of weight onto the C0 norm, and this weight is going to reflect the fact that I have two metrics that initially agree to greater than sine. Metrics that initially agree to greater than second order. Okay? And then I can sort of hope that I can, you know, prove weighted versions of these estimates and have some conclusion that says, okay, well, if that is the case, then the Regina turf flows are going to stay close, you know, and somehow this closeness should be reflected by an appropriate weight. Okay, and so. Okay. Okay, and so I'm going to choose my weight so that the fact that these two metrics initially agree to greater than second order around some point causes this right-hand side to be finite. And then, you know, somehow like doing this argument of Cochin Lamb and considering the weights appropriately, I can prove this weighted estimate that tells us that basically it will be true that over time the two Reachy deterglows will continue to remain. The two Richie deterc flows will continue to remain close almost to second order. And then, once you have proved this weighted estimate, it's actually pretty easy to show that the scalar curvatures are close. Okay, so that is kind of how you prove this first one, is by trying to do these arguments of Ka and Lambda with some weights. And then towards the second one, I will just mention this very quickly, what we do is we use the fact that under the Ricci flow, the scalar curvature is a super solution to the heat equation. And so if we want to come up with some lower bound on the scalar curvature, Some lower bound on the scalar curvature, what we can do is estimate the scalar curvature at an earlier time. Sorry, what we can do is we can estimate the scalar curvature from below by integrating the scalar curvature at an earlier time against a heat kernel. And so the fact that there is beta is required to be strictly less than one half in this definition is because outside of a ball of radius larger than square root of t, the heat kernel will decay exponentially. Okay, and so the presence of this beta has Presence of this beta has to do with some exponential heat kernel estimates. Okay, so I've gone a little bit over, so I think that's enough. Okay, thanks so much. Okay, before the questions I would just like to remind you that there's the group photo right afterwards, so for people on Zoom that means turn on the camera and stick out and and for us there will be some in person photo. First, there will be some in-person photo outside. Okay. So, are there questions for Paolo? Maybe faster people on Zoom if they have questions. I've got a question. Thank you. Go ahead, Chita. I'll take your answer, please. Jim, you want to talk? Go ahead first. Oh, I'm sorry. I had to be too. Go ahead, Barb. Sorry. Okay, then I'll ask my question. Yeah, thanks very much for your interesting talk. So in this lemma you had, so you use the existence theory to get a solution to Ricci-to-Turk flow, and then you use the ODE theory to go over to the Ricci flow. So I guess you're taking, so you fix a time bigger than zero, take that as your identity, and then go. Take that as your identity and then go backwards in time, right? Yes. So your chais, I think you call them, you said they were surjective and there was some other property of them. Oh, they're continuous, but that's it. Yeah, I see. Yeah, I see. Yeah, I don't know if that's the optimal result, but. Okay, so I just wanted to check out that I understood that correctly. So Tabiya Slam and myself have just actually brought out a new paper where we show that this chai is actually a homeomorphism. So that may be interesting. Interesting point for you. You may be able to use that, I'm not sure. But I just wanted to check and I understood that correctly. And also, I just wanted to say something about Bruce Kleiner's comment. I mean, that's, of course, the big question is how irregular can you start with the metrics and still do this nice results you've got or related results, right? And yeah, so at the moment, Tobias Lam and I looked at L infinity metrics which are in W22, so they're not continuous. In W22, so they're not continuous in some of them. We managed to show scalar curvature bounds from below are preserved, if you assume that. But, of course, how far you can go is, I think, a really interesting question. So I'll be interested to see if you or other people can get some results also in that area. Yeah, thank you. That's very interesting. Yeah, thanks. I had a quick question if I had a quick question if this sort sort of thing could be also applied to be curvature flow if you have if your surfaces are always C01. Band could you do the same kind of construction for some kind of regularized mean curvature flow? Well, I don't know anything about mean curvature flow. Anything about mean curvature flow. So maybe there's some other folks here who would know better. I don't, yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, okay, so Gromov has some C0 version of mean convexity that does not involve mean curvature flow, but like maybe it could be reformulated in that way. No, but yeah, I don't know. I don't want to make guesses. Thank you very much. Thank you. Very nice, John. Thank you. But uh so do you expect this notion to be uh equivalent to to Gromo's notion? It seems like the beta there might make it a bit stronger. Yeah, I don't know. I actually also sort of suspect that it's always possible to replace beta with one half. But I don't know if that's possible. Anyway, yeah, so. Yeah, I don't know. But I. I don't know. But I. Can you say one implies the other or something like that? So, in the uniform case, this one is stronger. But then, yeah, I also don't know, you know, in the non-uniform case, things get a little bit messy. Like with the beta also, could you have a situation in which you have a metric where there are like lower bounds with different values of beta like running around on the manifold? I don't know. And so, yeah, in general, I'm not sure, but I mean, the beta is a little bit. I'm not sure, but I agree the beta is a little bit odd. Okay, any further questions? Okay, if not, let's thank Paula again for the excellent talk. I can't answer, but I please switch on the camera for the photo. Okay, right. Let me go look at it. I will take a screenshot of the virtual participants. Participants? Yes, exactly. Good. Great. Okay. There's a few. I'll just wait. I'll give a couple more seconds. Turn on your cameras if you can. We're not. Is it 8 minutes? Okay. Oh, okay. We'll get your best smile on the count of three here. Best smile on the count of three here. Sorry, just one second. Bringing it up. Okay, on the count of three, your best smile. One, two, three. Cheese, everybody. Okay, and I'll do it again for the other group. A count of three, your best smile. One, two, three, cheese. Excellent. Okay, thanks, everybody. Come upstairs right away and take a real photo. So, Robert, I think when there is a rich enough, that when there are comments, it can say who would speak more. Yeah, you could speak, but I can say, yeah, so that's my question. Oh, I see, okay, yeah. So first, with this beta, I also wanted to ask you, so is it a feature of t. But do you like, so like, is it just, I mean, it seems natural to me, a little bit of all radius squared root t and you go to the singular time because it's like a parabolic neighborhood and you just Talk that it's like a parabolic neighborhood that's based on. Okay, but there's just no hope of this kind of decay, you say, in the parallel. Yeah, this last proof that I talked about very quickly, like the proof will not work, or it requires the exponential to see if you could offer all of whatever queries you're using. There's probably, well, I don't know if there is, but you know, it would be nice if there's some way, like, I'm sure there are other groups that don't apply at this point. So the goal would be like that same expression that you have, but except instead of taking square, you could take square root of t, and then that would be a very nice definition. Okay. Okay, it's a great start. And then my second question was, so I have a colleague who did, like, wanted to do Ricci flow on manifolds with boundaries. And I think he starts with C alpha metric because he can double a manifold and get a Lipschitz metric on it. Do you can show uniqueness and things in the same sense here? And things in the same sense here, but is it also true for CC0 that you're sort of multiplying? Oh, we're still recording.
