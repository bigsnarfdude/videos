So our speaker is Professor Jun Chengwei from University of British Columbia. He will speak on only the most syntax solutions of Ankan equations on surfaces. Okay, thank you. And good morning, good afternoon, and good evening for the people in the participants and And first of all, I want to thank the old matters for the Eroshi and Enomia and Peter for the kindly invitation and Luca for the kindly invitation to bang. And it's very nice to come back again during the pandemic. So today I'm going to talk about some recent joint work with Yong Liu and Frank Paka, boundaries for the Argonauts. Bounded motion that's for the other count. So the motion, the other count is a well-known equation. It's minus Laplace U equals U minus VQ. So this is a well-known bistable non-linearity. And it's called bistable because the energy functional this energy function. This energy function one minus u square square has a two global minimum which is equal depth. So this is called a double world potential. Now most of the results are true for any double world potential but as we're going to say today some double world potential are better than this one. I'm going to introduce water One, I'm going to introduce what are the better double work potentials. And so, just to say that this double work potential appears in many interfacial phenomena in variety diffusion system is a basic non-linearity for varying diffusion system. Okay, so I start with the so-called architecture. Uh, the so-called uh Hutchinson-Tanigara theory, and then I will introduce the Chordish mountainitis methods result. So, let me start with the classical Hutchinson Tanekara theory. So, we consider the useful version of Anacan and it's well known that this has a deeper connection with the minimum surface theorem, for example, gamma convergence. If I have a local. If I have a local minimizer, the interface no cell compared to a minimum half surface. And for bounded morse index and bounded energy solution, the Hutchinson and Tanegara theory has their quantization theory. Okay, so let me introduce next. So Hutchinson Tanegara in 2000 profit the following results. So So let's consider a sequence of an equation, solution of the Anen-Kahn equation with a bounded energy. With a bounded energy. And then they prove that the loser or the loser, the Newton had, the Neptune loser can be very complicated. But you can associate, you can define, you can define You can define kind of generalized mean curves. And so, and what they prove is that this limit, lunar set, the limit of this lunar set is a stationary firefight. That's the general nicely mean capture equals zero. And and also at each point, uh the density is is is an integer. Is an integer. It's a multiple integer. So you cannot never have a fractional integer. And if you prove, if you give more assumptions, if you assume for some stable solutions, then Tanigaro and Wicker Masker prove that this will be a stable variable and the coordination M minus 7. So it's M minus 7 Seven spreader. And in particular, in two dimensions, then the viral vault is a smooth geodesics, away from isolating points. Okay, so this is a so today I will only learn the consider dimension tool. So this is a Tanagarov result applied. Tanagara result applied. Okay, so what you have is a station with a firefault, right? And you have points and okay, and they may intersect and they may do lots of strange things and you may have multiple you have you may have multiple multiple You may have multiple interface. So, in general, stationary wireframe can be very complicated, even on surface. Okay, so you can have like triple junctions. You can have, this can be, you can also have causal. Geodes is just a cross. And you can have this is a quadruple crossing. Causal control. And each one is a geodesis by Panika. Each one is a geodesis. But you can have cross and you can have triple junction, you have quadruple junction. All this kind of situation. And you can also have multiplicity. So issue of this geodesic can be multiple because the Haashokana cell recess is multiple. Okay, so this so this is a general theory and this theory works for any double work potentially and it can't for any double work potentially so I'm going to introduce another theory recent theory by Chonish and Mantel Rudes and they proved that if you take a special signboard If you take a special sign order, double what potential. For this sign order, so this is a special double. For the sine order, then the divided cell will be much simpler. And the fire voltage will be just a stationary integral for one fire vault. And each one, so it just becomes a geodesic net. Your basis and that okay, and with a possible multiplicity, okay, with a possible multiplicity. So, so if we go back to the picture here, so the shortage and modernity services, this cannot happen. So, for example, you will never have triple junction because the geodesics just cross each other. Okay, so this cannot happen. Only this will happen. The geodesic will cross each other and you become a geodesic net. So for example, this can never happen because these two don't cross, okay? And this one cross. And this cannot happen. But this can happen. You can have three geodesics. You can have three geodeses and you can cross. So, if you use this use the sign button, this is much better. So, now the picture is, you have a few geodesics and they cross each other. Okay? The geodesics may cross each other. So, this is one possibility. Now, another possibility is the geodes. Another possibility is the geodetics, they may have multiplicity. Because you can have initial multiplicity. So these are the two possibilities by Chodition and the Montanes theorem. So this will be much simple. So if you start with the sine button, and then the divide in variable will be much simple. The Nibetian variable will be much simpler. Now, I'm going to explain why we use sine volume. Why sign volume is much better, much better on the remote. So basically, you have two situations. One is geodesic net. So geodesic cross each other. And another one is geodesic, they will collapse. So you may have multiplicity. So these are the So, these are the two possibilities that may happen for the unconference. So, what I want to discuss today is are this really happening? Do we have construction of these solutions? And what about the most index of these solutions? So, if we use a multiplicity one, do you have that? Ah, do you do this? This is very simple. Okay, you have almost one-to-one correspondence. Most index of the uncount correspond to so corresponding to the index, right? The index of this geodesis. So you have a one-to-one corresponding multiplication one. So another possibility is the geodesic lab. So two multiples. Jodislet. So, two multiples of one and they cross each other. Okay? So, what happened? So, first, do we have this situation? And what happened to the crossing? What happened to the bot syndrome? How to define a boss syndrome? We will have a crossing. And another possibility is multiplicity. So, this geodesicity is just collapse. Collabs. And so the question is: Is this possible? Okay. Do we get a how do we construct a multiplicity two interface? And finally, these two can combine. Okay, you can have a multiplicity and a cross, and this will be more complicated. So today I will concentrate on these two situations. And we want to have a theory how to construct such solutions, how to compute the Solutions, how to compute the MOS index for these two types. Okay, so let's first look at the first case, the cross, the geodes that cross each other. So, what happened with the cross? What is the mechanism? What happened with the cross? So, with the cross, the second case is collapsing. So, then So let me first look at the crossing. So let us zoom in this cross. Zoom in this crossing and see what happened to the uncanny equation. So if we zoom in this crossing, this is the limit. But before the limit, this is what happened. So actually these two notice sets, they don't intersect. And they And they become this like a hyperbolic shape. And so we zoom in. What you are really going to see when you block, we zoom in, you are going to see a four-ended solution. You're going to see a four-ended solution for the unacquainted. Now, if you have three projections, if you have these three geodeses, now we zoom in, you're going to see six. Foom in, you're going to see six entity solutions. Okay, so we need to understand the multiple entity solutions for the annex. Okay, now, so by the result of Wang and myself, we know that final boss index is equivalent to finite n. So we can just consider the finite index. So we can just consider the final model syndrome. So the set of 2N solutions called M2N. And the question is, do we have a complete classification of these solutions? And in general, this is quite difficult. This is, if you take an account, if you just take this Anaconda, and there are many papers like With the gray and classic new and Pakan, Grey, and Neil, and myself, only for A equals 2, the starting one. And still we don't have a complete classification, even for A equals 2. But recently, with Jung Leo, we found that for sine border, if you take sine border instead of u minus uq, if you take a sine border, If you take a sign button, we have a complete classification of multiple engine solutions. So using the fact that final ball center implies final end and also integrable system theory, we can explicitly write down all solutions of multiple ended solutions to the sign one. And they are all expressed. They are all explicit. For example, the four-and-the-set of solution. The four-and-dead solution, this is the four-and-a-solution. This is explicit. Now, the multiple-and-death solution, you have to introduce some notation and then you can also write the two ended solutions. You can just use the article. This is an algebraic representation. And as a result, we can prove that the two-n solution is two-n smooth connection manifold and each of the two-n solutions non-degenerate. And we can compare the mass effects. So, in particular, one important corner of our classification. Of our classification is that the two end solutions, you have a two-end solution, about these two ends, they can have this relation, balance and condition. And this is important. So with this balance and condition, Chordish and Mantanitis proved that you must have a geodes. The geodes just cross. You cannot have two geodes with angles are different. Different. So that's use this property to prove that this is geodesic net zero. So okay. So now maybe first discuss the JSON net. So using four anti-solutions, we can construct solutions on the surface. And so this is the first construction. First construction. So you have geodesal net, and if we assume some non-degeneracy, okay, this you have to have the right non-degeneracy. And then we can construct solutions on the geodesic net for the side-border equation. And we can also compute the most index of our solution. And the most index of our solution is the index is Index is the number of causing points, the number of causing points plus the index of each geodetic. The index of geodesis. So we have a complete classification of the geodesy lattice function. We have the construction of the most index of the non-degeneracy. And now, so what is So what is interesting about this MOS index computer, so this was index actually was conjectured in the Chardasia Mantonitis paper, but we gave a rigorous proof. So what interest is that our classification of sign actually also gave us the eigenfunctions, the Japan field were also crossed. And this is, so you don't have a So, you don't have a separate jackal field. Because if you have two, let's say you have two geodetics at the cross. And so, on each of the piece, you have some jackal field. This four piece you have jacket field, but the jackal field, there was a cross. Field, they also cross. So that's why you get the index of the fourth geodesics. You don't get an index of the piecewise geodesics. And the proof of this is quite complicated. So let me just go to the the next case is multiplicity two. I said this is a very interesting phenomenon and with uh respect to a dynamic system. Respect to a dynamic system. So, the second case is a high multiplicity. Multiplicity 2. So, what happened to multiplicity 2? So, if I have two geodeses and they collapse, the child The geodesic graph. So in the limit, you don't see anything. In the limit, it's just become one geodesis. So two times the geodesis. But before the limit, how do we take a limit? What happened to the before the limit? So if we take a two geodesis and you look at the place where they are the closest point, okay? Okay, and and you plug near this point and what you're going to see is a total system. And so you're going to see a so-called Japovia Total system. And the interaction between interface, this has been deduced before by the Before by the pedal by classic grandson, myself and the young. And in that paper, we deduce this, the interaction interface. But we have a construction of a multiplicative solution. But this multiplicative has an infinite remote syndax. So this is not what we want. So we want to have a bounded remote syndrome. Okay, so I measure. So, a major consequence of the existence of multiple interface with the bounded was index is the existence of bounce and jackal field. And this is a necessary condition. So, let me introduce what is a bounce and jacket field. So, you will take the Japan field, we take the Japan operator, and we have a Bounce and Japan field. And we have a bouncing jumper field. If let me just show the picture. So, if you have this key point on the geodesics, under each of this key points, you have a chakras field. But these two chakra fields, they were just bound to the other. So they have this relation. All the heights are the same. All the heights are the same, and at the junction point, the slope, epsilon value of the slope will be the same. Okay, so this is called a bouncing jacket field. This is a so this, for example, this is a sixth Bouncing Jacqueline field. So each of the segment is satisfies the Jacobi, the Jacobi equation, is a Jacobi field. And the height are the same, but then each one is like a jump. Each one you jump to the next one, and you jump back. So first result, this worked with my student year, that if you have a multi-plincer tool solution, then you must have a bouncing Japan field. So unless the condition for multi-plincent tool For multiplicity 2 is a bouncing jacket field. So, this is a necessary condition. And we also have a sufficient condition. So, if you have a bouncing Japan field with n minimum bounce with index k and then you have a multiplicative true solution and whose most index will be m plus k. k is the K is the original, the index of the geodesis, and is the number of bouncing jacket field, bouncing point. So these two resources, multiple solution, we have a complete classification multiplicative tool. Multiple, necessary condition is a Bouncing-Japan field. Sufficient condition is also a Bouncing-Japan field plus some non-degenerate condition. And then you have complete classification. Computer classification of what of the MOS index. So now the question is then the question, do we have the existence of a Bungson-Japan field? How do we prove the existence of a Bungson-Japan field? And we show that if the Gauss capture is not enough, if we have this condition, This condition, this condition holds, then you have a bouncing Japan field with n bouncing point. And this is optimal. So on S2, you found that this condition is optimal. So on S2, this will be 1, and this condition will be optimal. So how to prove this? We prove this by use of vibration method. This by using vibration method with on each of the piece, you solve the jacket field, and then finally, then you have a reduced problem on the location, and then you look at the local maximum and local minimum over this point, and you get a function jack of field. And this button jack field has a boss index. And how do we define the boss index? This is how we define the non-degeneracy of a button. Degeneracy of a bunch of jacket field, and with the non-degeneracy, we can also define the motion text. Okay, so let me just sum up what I did today is we discussed the firefight, one firefault, and we discussed the most difficult case, the two cases, the intersection, the causing and the multiplicity. And for the causing, we have a complete classification of the Classification of the MOSINDX, and for the Mode Principal tool, we have almost a complete classification of the solution, including Bouncing Japan field and the MOSINEX. And there are many, many open problems, like higher multiplicity, like a multiplicity three or four. We're still working, but there are many, many interesting problems. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Any questions? Any questions? Yeah. Comments? Regarding the crossing case. So when you blow up, you get these N and ended solutions in R and N. And you classify those. I'm kind of curious about the nodes of those. Do the nodes end up converging to straight lines when you're in a RN? In other words, does the curvature of the geodesic? So d in other words does the curvature of the GDS expansion in the limit when you do this pull up? No, there's nothing to do about the curvature. Um in the D V you're gonna see straight lines. Yeah, so it's very good. Yeah, yeah. In the D V you're gonna see straight lines. Yeah. But these straight lines, the angles must be the same. They must arrange in the same order. You cannot be arbitrary angles. That's because of our classification. Yeah. To this extent it can't cross a part. This geodesic standard can't cross a perpetrator. They cannot cross arms. They must be a geodesic net. And this is because the exactly the uh this theorem that we approved with uh with you nu. Yeah, so they must cross. You cannot have this. You cannot, they must cross 180 degree. Yeah. Other questions? Actually, I have another question. So for the So, for the existence of solutions in the whole RN, R2 said, you have more possibilities, but the blow-up is just more spatial, you have more restrictive. That's a very good question. And the thing is that we assume the boundary was index. And so that means you have boundary energy. And so must be fine the n. Now, for sign-board and theoretical solutions, you can have many, many other solutions, but these are. Many other solutions, but these are not the solutions we want the bounty words in the solution. But suppose we have this completion, boundary was bounded, yeah, yeah. We must use the bounty boss index. The follow-up solution and the general existence solution. That's a proof in the shortage of handy. Yeah, yeah, there's a proof. Another question for the coach condition. Uh curvature condition. Yeah. So do you you assume that the surface is uh has a fixed volume or area? No, nothing. No, no. No, we don't assume anything. If you're scaling it no, no, we don't assume this. Any surface. But are you scanning it? The curvature? Then you have the dimension n compared to the curvature. Or does n greater than the capture? N is the number of a bouncing job per bouncing point. Oh, okay. So it's not a diverse value. N is not a dimension. It is the Bouncing Japori port. Bouncing port. Very good. I prefer if you know more, I understand Kevin's again. How do I?
