Today I will talk about my recent work with my PhD student Xi Yan Shen and Professor Wang Feng. The topic is about extend finite element must be for non-conforming and virtual. For non-conforming and which animal must this outline four parts. First, I will talk about some background. This is a typical example for elliptical interface problems. I just offer Uh just all for you uh no there are many applications uh for this problem I just uh skip it the difficult of solving interface problems because there's no recognized results in 1998 Professor Tsumitza and Professor Su Min Tai and Sujun given without four input interface problems, they prove that the solution you is belong to this space just piecewise H1 piecewise H2 later in 2002, President Jim Huang and Zhu Jin give And the two gene give explicit explicit for the analogy. They give the dependence on the discontinuous coefficients. And five years later, also Professor Jing Wai and Zhu Jin gave four very confused problems. Confusions problems give results for solving interface problems. There are two kinds of methods. The first is feature method. Feature method, there are some advantages. And there are also some disadvantages. Especially for complete and also. And also for height meshing, there is a very difficult to give fitted meshes. So another kind of method, there are some workers about fitted method. The piny worker is Bob Scott in 1970s. 70s. And there are also another several other works. Professor Jing Tousu. This is his bachelor thesis. Also, some other guides give some workers. Another kind of mesh for solving influence problems is unfitted master. There are also some. There are also some advantages. They are easy to generate meshes. Just our computer topic structure masks. There's no need to rematch. But there are also some disadvantages. Just many of our standard finite animal algorithms are not workers. Not workers. There are uh two kinds of uh masks for solving uh the unfitted master. Uh one of efficient method is uh IFEM. This master uh the pine worker is here. So in lighting light and I I propose the I proposed finite animal method for one dimension problem. Later on, in 2003, he gives a reduction about two dimension masters. Until 2015, Professor Nintor and some guys to give a completed theoretical analysis. They are added some partial parity terms in their discrete forms. And in 2013, Professor Goodsman and their guys to do some work. What the high contrast In writing lighting lines, Professor Benich proposed another master. This master is considered to enrich the finite element space in the near correct areas. Correct areas. The final XFGM, this names, the first proposed in these papers and appear in this guide, the PhD CC. 2002, Husband Cup proposed based on nature semester. on Nietzsche's master proposed and fitted master and two years later they applied this method to elastic problems. Later, also Professor Benicho proved this two kinds of methods is equivalent and 2016. 16 for stroke in the phrase equations and some other guys to prove the typical result for she one final pairs they are proved the infamous simple commission is uniform respect to Respect to the interface position. And two years later, they are proved this result for a kind of finite element appears here. And then later on, some other guys do other workers. Richard, uh Recently, Professor Xi Jiupin and Huzbong proposed another so-called cut finite element master based on a direct extent master. About two years ago, Professor Daviga proposed another new final dynamic called Fuch. called Fuch finite element master. This master has some features. They use polygon meshes just like this picture and they use local space to define their basis functions and so they can prove some physical properties. Properties. Because their discrete space is bigger than the UU finite animal master, so they can have a better approximation property. For what you edit manmaster, there are some assumptions just like this 4000 eightings. Eatings, Professor Perella revised the suit submissions. So they can use small edges in their discriminatorization meshes. Now, I introduce the which element master space. which element master space. This method different in every element in each element K we in the bound of K is belong to this space. This space is a piecewise continuum. But in the work K there is is Laplace V is equal Is Laplace V is equal to zero harmonic here? This is a loose virtual element master. The degree can use the can we use the values of point at the vertex PR. UU we cannot write the functions in the which the functions in the which animal must explicit so for computational we use the projecting pi this is the can computer here we note this this is identity but because ug is cannot express the so Explicit so we state this these terms by sk code stabilization terms here so we can propose the discrete approximation problems find u h such that this is valid here. Here, VH is who uh disclaim. Discrete space. Rewrite the terms also revise just like this because VH is a character computation. So we replace the VH by VH theta just like this. For long conforming, we use the range on each edge. On each edges, just like this. For when k equals to one, they are use the L2 projection here for k big or equal to two, use this projection. In 2000, lighting lightings In this paper, there from engineer's perspective to verify that the which element is stronger than finite element must since which element must propose, there are many workers here. In the same years, Same years, they are proposed for also linear inastitude problems, also for plate banding problems. Later on, they are also applied this method to stock equations and also propose a non-conforming voice admin master. And this recently, there are many workers about for Worked about for stocks equation about diverging the free animal method. You know, for stocks equation, double gene free is very important. There are another work for at least tropical case, Professor Chen Dong and other other guys. Other uh other guys. This is also about uh uh W the Fresh work. Yeah, another work about the Vucci Element Master is uh about uh about uh for uh free step uh stabilization. You know, uh for which element master we uh should uh apply the uh Applied stabilization terms on the currentization forms. But these papers, they started some work about David Free. They are also very interesting. There are also two kinds of master for Fujianism master. Fuji animal master to solve in the first problem the food is a fitted mesh just like final animal here. The azure is also about unfitted meshes just like here we my student and Jenny Ni and Professor Jenny. Professor Jinini and other guys also do some work about unfitted for interface problems. Now I talk about my recent work. We combine XFGM with VGM to solve interface problems. The described times I just like described like this. For a global approximation space is defined like this. There are two regions, omega h1 and omega. H1 and omega H2 here, define the two space here. And we define the VHI just confined on omega i. And we get this virtual extended animal master here. For non-conforming X V gem, non-conforming which element space defined each k is just like this. On each ages of elements, we make this assumption here. And we get the local VHTLAS base. VHTLA space. We just like final animas for non-conforming, we add this demand here for some continuous weak continuous here. And we get the global space. Now we propose this created by media forms. Discrete by native forms. This is a conforming X VM, different from conforming X V X X F. This terms is different here, AI here. This stabilized terms is just like X F this term gamma is also just like Gamma is also just like before. The level of our conforming VGM is this term. This term is different from conforming X VM here. For conforming X VM from worker, this term is not this is a conforming X vision for non-conforming X. For non-conforming X vision, we must revise these terms. Just split two terms, AI cut and AI long cut here. Also, we also revised the stabilizer terms just like this. So we can use we can. We can use the we can use small edges in our master. This term is just like conforming X with them. This also like just like before. This terms is new. We should put some Some L2 projection on edges here. In contrast to the non-conforming XFGM, our idea is to add these terms to the discrete binary forms. This is new. So we can obtain our approximation problem. approximation problem just like this here. The right terms also modified. We use the idea proposed by Professor Chenong in these papers. So we introduced some notations here. Here and some some much dependent normal scale, then we can prove that these two terms, these two norms are equivalent. And we can prove the others of the problems and get the interpolation errors. Finally, we can we my our main results just like here. Man results just like here. This we use the lost old VGM. So this is optimal. In the four parts, we show some examples here. The first example, the interface is a line. It's just like this. This is exactly solutions here. Solutions here. So for the coin features, just like alpha one equal to 10 power three respect to one. And we can change these two coefficients. We get this result. This is this result is Is with our theoretical knowledge here. Also, we present here about the interpolation errors. This is H1 lambda, is H1, and this is the L2 normal. This is two odds. If we increase Increase the contrast here, we can also see the same results here. The second example is the interface is a slow flag interface. This is the exact solutions here. Also, we can receive the large The set results here. If we increase the contrast of the coefficients, the results are all the same just like before. The third example is about hot interface, just like this. And this is the exact solutions here. Here we Here, we put a point near near here. We select internal edges and added verticals at its one over 20 operations to create short edges, which can ensure that our method contains at least one short point. has at least one shot point. And we can show our method can work for short ages. This large picture, just like this. This is the vertical. We added a large vertical near here. This is not here. This is 25. This is 35. This is very, very near. So So this meshes contains short agents here. So we also get the same results here. This is a picture about our convergence orders. For this is H2. This is H2. This is H1. The last example is for moving interface. If we choose our interface from 0.1 to one power minus just like this. This is the exact solution. uh exact solution we also we also can uh the errors usually remain uh almost the same so uh our method can work for moving uh straight uh interfaces that's all thank you
