Josua Jordan and Jeff Streets on Archive this year. And I would like to start with some motivation talking about the Keller Richie flow. So we heard a beautiful review about this by Jansong on Monday, but let me recall a few things, which I will need. So we start with a complex manifold, and then recall that a Riemannian metric on M is scalar if it is Hermitian, meaning that the almost couple structure is orthogonal. Structure is orthogonal, and furthermore, the almost complex structure is annihilated by the Lebesgue connection. And recall that because I'm assuming that j is integrable, then nabla j equals zero is equivalent to omega, the Keller form, to be close, or omega is defined as follows, just by contracting g with the homoscope structure. And I'm going to call omega to be a Keller form. And now how And now a one parameter family of Keller metrics omega t. I'm going to all the time switch between the metric and the Keller form, as useful. So a one parameter family of Keller metrics omega t is a solution to Keller-Ricci flow if this evolution equation is satisfied. So the variation with respect to time of the Keller form has to be minus the Ricci form of the Kelemetric. So here recall that the Ricci form of a kalimetric is defined by constructing the Ricci tensor with J. Constructing the rich tensor with J. So this is a two-form, actually it's a one-one form, and in coordinates it can be calculated as i d bar d of log of the determinant of the metric. For the people who know about complex geometry, this can be also calculated as the curvature of the induced metric on the anti-fernical band. Okay, so it's not difficult to see from this equation just by contracting with J that Just by contracting with J that if we have a flow line for the Keller Ricci flow, then immediately we have a flow line for the Ricci flow. So I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to drop factors of two through my talk. Some notation. Okay, so the basic theorem by Hamilton and Kao is that this is a well-posed problem. So if I fix an initial charimetric on a compact complex manifold, which amidst kerometrics, then Skeletrics, then the flow goes for some small time. And then the first long-time existence and global convergence result was proved by Kao. So Kao proved, as Sean recalled on Monday, Cow proved a much more general result, but here I'm going to specify to the case of a vanishing first in class, so the case of Calabia life. So if you have a compact L manifold with vanishing first in class, which is going to be my definition of of Calabia, May definition of Canabia. Then, for any initial Keller metric omega naught, the Keller recipient exists for all time and converges smoothly to a limit metric, which is also Keller and satisfies this nice condition. So, on the one hand, is Keller-Ricci flat? The Ricci form is zero, so in particular, the Ricci tensor is zero. And furthermore, the Keller class of the solution is still the same. So, recall that the Keller implies that the Keller form is Keller implies that the Keller form is closed, so it defines a well-defined homology class in a second homology. And actually, just by looking at this equation, the evolution of the Klayer class is proportional to the first in class. See, since we are assuming that the first in class is zero, then we get disagreements of the chunk classes. Okay? So this provides an alternative proof of Jaos' theorem at the time. But of course, part of the proof relies on some of the techniques that Jao used to prove in the celebration. Jar used to prove the celebrated theoretical conjecture. In particular, part of the proof of this stands for or uses the reduction of the Hellerig flow to a scalar PD, to a scalar parabolic equation. Okay, so the main question I want to address in this talk is whether we can extend this picture to non-Keller Caravia manifolds. And Carabiao for me is going to mean a compact, complex manifold with... A compact, complex manifold with vanishing first in class in the second commodity. Okay, so probably you don't have non-Kelecari vanish in the top of your head, so let me give you some examples to play. Okay, so for instance, by the classification of compact-complex surfaces, any compact-complex surface with odd-betty number is non-cal. Let me give you a more concrete example. Just take the hoff surface, which is Hoff surface, which is a quotient of C2 minus the origin by a radial set action acting as follows. So here N is an element in Z and this is the action. So C2 minus the origin is like R4 minus the origin. So this is S3 cross positive R and N compactify in the regular direction. So I end up in a manifold which is S3 cross S1. And this therefore has second metinum, first betinum equals to 1, and therefore it's known Keller. And therefore, it's non-Keller, and we can also see that this is non-Keller because the second Methane number is zero. And therefore, there is no possible Keller classes in this manner. Another example in higher dimensions is this one. This is actually a particular example of a very general class of non-Kero compact complex manifolds, but let me just be specific here. So we take M to be the product of SU2 cross SU2 with J. With J a left invariant integral conference structure. And then SU2 is isomorphic to S3, so this is isomorphic to the product of three spheres, and hence the second betting number equals to zero. So we have a threefold, a compact, complex threefold, with second betting number zero, and therefore it cannot be Ketter. Okay, so in order to address this very general question, Street Santiago, Street Saint Jen introduced a notion of geometric flow for a suitable type of Hermitian metrics called Curry close metrics. So let me first go through the definition of Puri close. So we have a complex manifold and then we have a remaining metric which is... we say that the remaining metric is pretty close if it is Hermitian. Sorry? If it is Hermitian and furthermore, And furthermore, the corresponding Hermitian form, which is calculated in the same way as in the Kerr case, satisfies that dd bar of omega equals to zero. So instead of asking for d omega equals to zero, we weaken this condition by imposing dd bar omega equals to zero. So a few remarks about this type of metrics is that, well, this pretty close condition is a linear integrability condition which replaces the Keller condition, so it's weaker than the Keller condition. Is weaker than Nuclear condition. How abundant are these symmetrics? Well, at least we know that by a theorem of Bodo shown that any compact complex surface admits pretty close metrics. So in the case of compact, complex surface, any compact complex surface admits pretty close metrics. And there are also examples in higher dimensions via different constructions. And another important thing to bear in mind is that locally, because of this condition and applying the D-Parpo que lemma, Applying the deep dilemma, puriclos metrics emit a potential which is not a function, but a one-zero form. So any puriclos metric can be written locally as d bar of alpha plus delta alpha conjugate or alpha one zero form. And this makes an important difference with Keller geometry. So if suppose that you want to study a problem for canonical metrics which are pretty close, then you are not going to be able to reduce your curvature conditions to a feed. Curvature conditions to a PDE for a function. You have to deal with PDEs for one cell phone, which are more difficult. So this puts an additional more difficulty in the terminals related to previous class metrics than Keller. And let me give you a super explicit example. So take M to be the hoff surface, as before, and just take this metric. This is just the flat metric quotient by by the by the square of it or the distance to the origin. The square of it or the distance to the origin. And it's not difficult to see if any coordinates that this is 3D bar closed. This is actually called the Boothweight metric. And okay, let me not comment on that. Okay, so motivated by this problem of constructing canonical metrics in compact non-kelet manifolds, Stritz Antian in twenty ten proposed the following flow of uh of uh of uh purely closed metrics. So Of a purely closed metric. So the variation of omega is going to be del of d star, so this is the adjoint of the del operator with respect to the metric, this is the Borayan metric of omega minus d bar d star omega minus i d bar del log of the determinant. So you may recognize this term here. This is just the term which appears in Kell Ricci flow. Okay? So this is the the Chern Ricci form of the Hermitian basically. A few comments on this. A few comments on this. The most basic one is that this is a well-posed problem, locally in time in the same way as the Keller Richard flow is. This was proved by Strisantien using the fact that the metric is pretty close. And for any Keller initial data, this reduces to Keller-Rig flow data because you have unique. If the initial metric is Keller, then all these torums are going to trap and you're just going to evolve by the Keller region. And also, it's not difficult to see. And also, it's not difficult to see from this equation here that it preserves the purely closed conditions. If you start with that, I mean in principle, you could run this for any Hermitian metric if you are lucky. But if you start with purely closed, then this theorem of TN ensured you that you have existence and uniqueness for a short time. And furthermore, if you look at this equation, so this is deforming omega by del of something, d bar of something, and del del bar of something. So if you take del del bar, it's zero. It's zero. Okay, so it's going to preserve the protocol. It's going to preserve it. Okay. So why is this flow interesting? Well, let's try to write it in terms of the Riemannian metric. Actually, what you get is not a flow for the metric, but a couple flow for the metric and the torsion of the Hermitian flow and one other quantity called the default. So given a solution to particular flow, Given a solution to periodical flow, I consider the corresponding remaining metric, and I consider two quantities which are canonically associated to any Hermitian metric. One is the torsion, which is minus dc of omega t. So dc is i to the power minus 10. And the other one is the lee for which is this one from here. Which is this one form here, which is calculated using this star of the formation form, then composing with J and put it on. Okay, so of course H and theta are zero in a Kele manifold, but here you have this further ingredients which play about. And what Stritz Anti-Amproved in 2012 is that you have a solution of tuberculosis flow, then the metric, the torsion, and the leaf form satisfy this coupled system. This coupled system of evolution equations. So, on the one hand, the derivative or the time derivative of the metric is minus the Ricci plus this tensor, which is a quantitative tensor that you pick up out of the torsion. So, this is H G N G L and then. L I H A M K I H N L yeah and then the evolution of the this is just the lead derivative of G with respect to the dual of the of the of the leaf form and then the evolution of the torsion is given essentially up to shifting by by this lead derivative by the lap This linear by the Laplacian metric itself. These equations are very interesting, as I will tell you in a minute, they appear in mathematical physics and they go under the name of generalized Richie flow. And this is actually a detour version because you have this iterative round. So if you pull back the flow line by the one parameter group of diffeomorphisms generated by the dual of the reform, then you end up with a flow which is just this first. Flow, which is just this first component, you drop the derivative terms, and this flow goes under the name of general free flow. So, this was, as I mentioned, a version of this appears in mathematical physics literature, and to my knowledge, this has been, this was first studied from the geometric energies point of view in this paper by Jeff Streets in Journal of Geometry and Physics in 2009. This flow has some beautiful properties, it's a natural extension of the This is a natural extension of the Ricci flow. And if you want to know more about it, you can go to this book that we published recently, Jeff Anna, in the Elements, which contains a very nice introduction to the topic. Okay, so I mentioned that this is related to mathematical physics. It actually is when you formally take this dual of the Lee form to be gradient. So if the dual of the Lee form is gradient, then actually Then actually, this is a flow which is known to a string theory. It's the renonormalization group flow in type 2 string theory, which has to do with the quantization of a two-dimensional sigma. Okay, so far so good. We have this interesting different point of view on the Kerriclos flow. Let me even tell you a different point of view more related to Hermitian geometry. So recall that the Keller Vichy. So recall that the Keller-Ricci flow is written as this equation multiplacing this quantity which I didn't explain yet, just by the Ricci-Fore, of the Keller. So we wonder if the prudical flow can be written in the same terms. And now we are going to use a connection which is not a Library connection, but a connection with torsion. So if we take the Bismuth connection of a pre-close formation metric given by this, so this, recall that the Bismuth connection is a metric connection. Is a metric connection which furthermore annihilates the owners and restructure, so it is unitary or formation, and has totally skew symmetric torsion DC on. Then taking this connection, we can write alternatively the pretty closed flow as the following. So the variation of FOMI with respect to time is minus the 1,1 component of the V-smooth rigid flow. And just to be completely explicit and not go into details of complex geometry, rho b is given by this. is given by this formula where EI is an orthonormal basis and R nabula B is just the curvature of this connection. So what I'm saying is that one can write protein flow in an analog form to the Keller-Ricci flow, but replacing the Levitic beta connection by this connection with torsion, which is Bissum connection. And some remark which it's at this point may not make much sense but May not make much sense, but it's going to be very important for the analysis and for the applications. Is that instead of considering this flow just for free, one can couple the flow with an evolution equation for a 2-zero form, just considering the 2-zero bit of the Bismuth Ritzy form. So instead of considering just this, which is the original particular flow, one can introduce a one-parameter family of two zero forms and consider this evolution equation. So that the metric, the harmonic, The metric, the Hermitian 4, evolves by the 1 part of the Bismarck Pritchie 4. And now you evolve this beta by minus the 2, 0 part of the 4. Okay, so I didn't tell you what this, but let me tell you now. This, essentially, this 2, 0 component has this explicit formula in terms of the torsion and the leaf form. So it is minus 1 half of d star of the torsion plus 1 half of d of the leaf form minus 1 half of the contraction of the torsion with the Of the torsion with the two-handed value form. So you get a couple system of Wolverson equations for the metric and this beta. Okay. So now that we are a bit familiar with prediculous flow, let me give you three questions that we are going to address. So the first one is a bit nice for reasons I would like to explain it. So this question is literally taking Literally taking Cow's term and replacing every single word in his term by the ingredients that we have now. So my question is, if MJ is compact, complex, we banishing first chain class, does the pretty close flow admit global existence and convergence to a pretty close metric with vanishing bismuth 3C4 for arbitrary initial pretty close metric. So here, if I take the original If I take the original pricel flow, the only thing that will vanish in the limit in this static point of the flow would be the one one component, but I'm considering this coupled flow. Okay, so the answer to this question, to this naive question, is no. Okay, and this starts, this makes an important difference between the situation for Keller-Freeflow and this equation for curriculum flow. And let me explain you why. So this is due to a result by streets. Are results by streets, but there are two results involved. Let me mention just the 2021 one. The one from 2018 is a classification of pre-closed solitons, which actually shows that there are some compact complex surfaces we've only seen first in class, which do not admit solutions to this equation. And the second one is more related to geometric flows. What he considers is a compact, complex surface, which is a T2 vibration of Vibration over a Riemann surface sigma with genus V2. He starts the predicrost flow with T2 with an T2 invariant measure. So this is a T2 principal vibration. This is holomorphic and T2 alts, holomorphically. So he starts with omega 0 being T2 invariant. And he shows that the that the fibers we have this uh human surface in the base of hyatinus, I have these stories in the in the fibers. Of these stores in the fibers. And he shows that as t goes to infinity, the original T2 invariant metric converges in Haromo-Hafstor's topology yes to the base. It collapses to the base. Which is very different. Let me emphasize that these manifolds can be taken to have first in class hypothesis. So we cannot expect the naive question. Expect the naive question to hold. So let's be a bit brutal. So suppose that you don't know anything about Keller-Ricci flow. So if you don't know anything about Keller-Ricy flow, you better try to understand it on a flat manifold, on a Turf. So the analog of a flat manifold in the case of non-Keller geometry is considering a complex manifold with a flat Bismuth connection. Okay? Connection. Okay? So suppose that we have a compact complex manifold with vanity first in class which carries a bismuth flat purity closometry. So the connection with totalistic symmetric torsion B C omega is flat. Okay? So recall, probably you don't have bismuth you female. But nabla b t equal to nabla minus a half of z minus one of these of what may happen. Okay. So suppose that this connection natural Suppose that this connection associated to the Hermitian form is to the Harmitian metric is flat. Then the question is: does the pretty close flow admin global convergence to a bismuth flat pretty close metric? Which is what happens for clever flow in the case of Torah. And to illustrate the little we know about this question, let me be more Let me be more specific. So in a conference entitled Geometry and Physics in 2017 in Montreal, someone asked to Jeff a question and he says that even in the case of a half surface with this metric, the Bullpy metric, which actually is bismuth flat, we don't know whether the predictor flow has global existential convergence to the natural To the natural background, metric to the model. Actually, the global resistance of convergence to bootwide metric was proved recently by Jeff Sris, again assuming that the initial data is T2 invariant. So the hub surface has a structure similar to this, but the base is a P1, it's a two-sphere. And he proves that if you pick up a T2 invariant Invariant initial data, then pre-close flow has long-term existence and convergence to the buffer metric above the scaling. But the question with a breach-to background remaining running over. Okay, so now let me go to the main results, which are in the line of trying to make progress in these three equations. So the first result in our paper gives paper gives the first result in our paper gives an obstruction to the existence of pre-closed metrics with vanishing basin 3C4. In particular, it gives an explanation of why this situation originally studied by Jeff does not converge to a puritos nature with any bismuth. So the criterion is very simple. So suppose you have a holomorphic mass So suppose you have a holomorphic map between compact complex manifolds, nj to z. Suppose that z is scalar and has first in class negative. If df is rejective at one point, then mj does not amit a pre-close metric with vanishing bismuth 3g4. Okay? This in particular applies to this situation. So just applying by this criterion, we know that the limit cannot go to bismuth 3g4 and goes to zero. 3G4 equals to 0. Because this is higher genus, the first in class is negative and this is a Friedman surface, so it's scalar. And this is a surface. But actually, it was unknown whether this situation occurs in higher dimensions, and with this cladium we can find an example. So the example is as follows. So take Z to be a degree 5 hypersurface in P3 and then take MJ to be a holomorphic principle T to vanilla over Z. Called T2 bundle over Z. Okay, so similar to this situation, but the fiber now is a dignified hypersurface. This T2 bundle is essentially determined by the first chain classes of the two circle bundles. So I'm going to take the two first chain classes to be one just to be the first chain class at the base and the other one in some parameter, some some class alpha, which has to be in the second integral segochromology to determine a the first in class of elemental and has to be of type one one in order to and has to be of type 11 in order to the bundle to be defined uh to be holomorphic. Then uh with these uh assumptions one can prove that the first in class of this T2 bundle is zero and actually it's non-Keller for suitable choice of alpha. Yes, this banishing of the first in class has to do with the description of the homology of m in terms of the cohomology of the base. And the cohomology of m is essentially the quotient of the homology and the base by the two generators of the transmission. And actually one can And actually one can suitably choose alpha so that mj is predictable. So this gives an example of a three-fold, compact three-fold, with binds in first in class carrying a predictive symmetry and which does not carry a solution to this equation. Okay? Okay, so the second term is an extension of this result by Jeff, which I mentioned, which is, we prove long-time existence of the flow. Prove long-time existence of the flow for arbitrary initial data. So you have a compact complex non-colored surface with a Codera dimension non-negative. I will explain a little bit what this is. Then give it any pretty close symmetry coming. I know the pretty close flow exists for all time, for this initial data. So with arbitrary initial data, we have a long-time existence of the flow. And actually, the expected behavior in the case of the compact and polysoffries that Jeff studied is precisely what he proved. Precisely what he proved that the Lomo-Hausov converge to the base. The codiral dimension is a quantity, it's an invariant associated to complex manifolds, which has to do with the dimension of the space of sections, holomorphic sections of the Carnikovan law. Let me leave it like that. So, in the specific case, for example, that k equals to 1, this gives you a precise description of the topology. So, for k equals to 1, So for k equals to 1, mj is a definite cover, a t2 bundle over a hierogeneous space. So exactly as in here. Okay? So theorem 1.1 applies, meaning the previous, oh sorry, this is theorem A applies. So it means that we know already that we cannot have this module reaching form equals zero in the limit, but still we have a long time exist. Okay? Okay. Okay. So the third theorem I wanted to mention is this thing which partially solves uh the question about these mood flat manifolds. At least it reduces the long time existence and convergence for arbitrary initial pretty close metric to a cobological condition for the topo combology. So the statement is as follows. So take MJ to be a complex manifold with vanishing first name class, which carries With vanishing first-time class, which carries a V-smooth flat pretty close metric. Then, given any arbitrary pre-closed metric satisfying this condition in the double commodity, so the class of the torsion equals to the class of the torsion of the flash metric in one double commodity, then the periodical flow with this initial condition exists for all time and converges to a bismuth flat period metric. A period may be different from the from the background. May be different from the background. And therefore, it reduces question two purely to a comological condition. So let me recall, because I guess some of you are not 100% familiar with the vocal origin. So the vocal origin, I mean the article is group of M. So it's calculated taking the D-bar operator going from two, one forms to to two comma two fourths mod the image of the pie bar operator going from two zero fourth to two comma fourths okay so in particular if we have that the d d bar of omega flat is zero and d d bar of omega is zero, if I take del of omega, this is d bar twice, right? This is debar close, right? And therefore, it defines a well-defined class in this in this card. And let me comment on this condition. Because even in simple cases where this homology group is one-dimensional, sometimes it's hard to. Sometimes it's hard to check that this condition holds. Because, in order to let me say that you have fixed one omega flag, which is background, okay? And you want to prove that for some omega naught, this condition is satisfied. I mean, it is good if these two classes lie in the same real line inside the tobocco origin. Because then you can rescale omega naught and prove long-time existential convergence. But this is a complex vector space. So if they are not in the same real line, So if they are not in the same real line, if they are not in the same rate, then you are not able to prove this long-time existence and convergence. However, there is an improvement of this, which I'm not going to tell you, but let me mention it by words, because there is still, in complex non-kelet geometry, there is still another group that one can consider, which is related to this picture. And this is the And this is the 11MP homology of the manuscript. So the 11MP homology is calculated as kernel of the DD par operator for 1,1 forms to 2, 2 forms mod the image of the pastel bar from one, 0 plus 0, 1. Okay? So notice in particular, because this is modeled on the current of the D-Bar operator and model of some coefficient, that any purely closed metric, which is dd-bar closed, defines an amplicomology flash. So for our initial omega node, this defines our one-emplicomology flash. Good. So if Good. So if we manage to, I mean, and this is now a complex group, but because if it is type 1, 1, it has a natural real structure on it. And actually, any class, any api-class of a pre-process metric is automatically real. So if this group is one-dimensional, then it is automatic that this holds. And this is what we apply in order that In order to solve question three. So, suppose that you are in the case of a HOP surface. This HOP surface, let me forget about primary and data. But if you have a HOP surface, then this 1, 1 empty homology is one-dimensional. The previous criterion holds, and then you can prove that given any very close metric, the pre-close flow exists up to infinity and converges to a multiple of this burden. To a multiple of this metric, solving this question by GF in 2017. Okay, so this is this ends the summary of the results, and now I would like to tell you a little bit about the proof. So I had to choose one of the terms, and since this is a conference about geometric flows, I chose term C. Okay, so are there any questions about what it is? Okay. So if not, let's go for 0 and C. So recall that 0 and C uh is the long time existence and convergence in the case of Bismuth flat manifolds. So what do we do to prove the theorem? So because we are in this non-Kerr world and we can reduce the particular flow to a scalar PD, we need to A PD, we need to involve some technology, okay? Which has to do with holomorphic vector bundles. So, given a 2,1,4 in my complex manifold, which is debar closed, then we can construct a holomorphic vector bundle, which is as follows. So, this is the holomorphic cotangent bundle as a smooth bundle, plus the holomorphic, this is the holomorphic tangent bundle, plus the holomorphic cotangent bundle as smooth bundles, and the holomorphic. And the holomorphic structure that they put here is not the canonical one. It has a twisted operator. So if one, this debar operator tells me which are the sections of the bundle which are holomorphic. So this operator, this loop operator, is calculated using the two standard operators in the tangent 1, 0 and the cotangent 1, 0 and twisting it by this 2.4. And the fact that these are And the fact that these are, the fact that these are, that the two, the two one formula tau is divar closed, tells me that this squares to zero. Okay? So what is, if you are not familiar with this stuff, just let me recall that, if you want to know what is a holomorphic section of this bundle, what you need to do is to heat it with this operator, and if it is zero, then the section is holomorphic. So if tau is zero, then holomorphic sections are the useful ones, as holomorphic vector fits plus holomorphic ones zero. When says holomorphic electrophilics plus holomorphic wasler forms, but this is a twisted electro operator, which defines this holomorphic extension. And now, given a Hormitian form on my complex manifold and beta a 2-0 form, then you define a Hermitian metric on this q tau given by this explicit formula. So you pick up your Hermitian metric, you pick up your 2,04 and calculate this metric. It's not completely... And calculate this metric. It's not completely obvious that this is a metric, but actually, it's not so difficult because you can see this formation metric as being pushed forward by a diagonal metric on just time diplomatic time. Okay, so we have recalled that these two data, omega and beta, are the data that we use to run the pre-close flow. Okay, so the first thing is this uh Is this beautiful result, which is an idea by Jeff and Jos, which tells me that pre-close flow for a Hermitian metric at a two-zero form is the same as the Hermitian Enstein flow for this big metric, G. And this is the flow I will explain in a minute, but this is the flow that Donaldson uses in his proof of the Donaldson exchange, because there is just one further cutting here. So for G. So for G, the Hermitian metric as before, denote by FG the churn curvature. We have it where in a holomorphic vector bundle, so any Hermitian metric has an anxiety churn curvature. And define an endomorphism of this Q given by this. So you trace Fg with the Hermitian form and divide by the body. Then suppose now that the omega Suppose now that omega naught and beta naught satisfy this equation here, which has to do with the homological condition which I impose, this agreeing with the homology class of the torsion of the initial data for the pre-close flow. So suppose that this holds, then if we have a one parameter family of pre-close flow uh solving the pre-close flow with this initial condition, then this is just the the flow. Then this is just the flow, then Gt satisfies this equation. Okay? So the variation of the Hermitian metric, of the big Hermitian metric, is proportional to minus this H t, which is sometimes people call this the second Ricci 4. Okay, and as I said, this is essentially the evolution equation considered by by by Donaldson for the solution of the Donaldson Gap theorem to prescribe a Hermitian symmetry. To prescribe a Hermitian symmetry on a holomorphic vector bundle which is polystable, with a caveat, which is that notice that here we are using omega to both produce the Hermitian metric on the bundle, Q, and also to wedge to produce the endomorphism. So this has, in the typical picture for Hermitian AC metrics, this S endomorphism is respect to some background metra. And here this is coupled with the metric that you use for defining the big G itself. Big G itself. Okay, so now with this machinery in hand, oh yeah, let me make one remark, which is that this is just the same proposition, which I mentioned before, but just to explain this condition, the existence of this two-zero form, which we need to produce this alternative formula for the particular flow, is precisely equivalent to the agreement of these two things in the Doboch homology. Things in the Double Commology. Okay, so this is why this appears in the statement of our theorem. And how do you prove this? Well, the proof is a beautiful piece of geometry. It uses some identity due to Bismuth, which essentially is the following. So what you do, recall that our Qt Our q tau is of the form tangent plus tangent 102 of and then if you use the metric, my information metric is of type 11, so I can use the metric to identify this guy with a complexified tangent model. So I regard the metric as a map from tangent of m tensor C into q talf. into q tau just by taking um a vector field the one zero component of the vector field I leave it the same and then the zero one component I dualize it with the metric and because this is of type one one this is a one zero four and now you can ask we have this churn we have the Hermitian metric on Q and you can ask what is the churn curvature or the churn connection of this Or the chair connection of this big G, if we push it to the complexified tangent value. And actually, the answer is very simple. So if you do, let me call this sine G. So if you do sine G of, if you pull back to here the term connection of the PG, actually this is a very simple connection. This is the Debussy beta connection plus a half of G minus of G C F form. This is essentially, this is like Debison connection. Essentially, this is like the visible connection, but with a different sign here. Okay, the visual connection has a minus, and this has a plus. And now you use a natural formula which relates the curvature of this connection with the curvature for the visual connection. Essentially, you have that, if you call this namela minus, R R nambla minus i j k l equals R nabla fish mod K F I j So to calculate the Bismuth-Ricci form we take traces in the Aij indices for the Bismuth connection and to calculate this uh second uh second richiform we take uh uh We take traces in these two first indices, okay? And these are exchanges. And this is why this second Ricci form is exchanged with the second Richard form is a change with the Russian Ricci form, and this holds. Okay, this is the idea of the proof. Okay, so let me now go for the analysis. So what can you do with this? What you can do is to actually get To actually get a nice equality which relates the heat operator applied to the trace of the Berlin big metric with the background metric in terms of minus the norm squared of the difference of the two churn connections plus some junk. But it's not so bad because this is the second richie form of the background connection with respect to the moving uh Hermitian form. Hermitian form. Okay, so suppose that you have a pretty close flow line satisfying this initial condition, which is what enables us to match the two formulas between the Ricci form and the second Ricci form. The mission Ricci form and second Ritchie form. Then for any background probation match with G tilde on Q tau, one has this thing. So the heat operator applied to the trace of GT with respect to G tilde, the background, is minus this norm squared plus this. Actually, the way you derive this is very. Actually the way to derive this is very simple. Let me not go into details, but it's just an application of a Swarz lemma to the identity endomorphism in Qta. So what I mean is the following. So if you have a holomorphic vector bundle, let me call it E, and V is a holomorphic section of this holomorphic vector bundle, and H is a Hermitian metric in the holomorphic vector bundle, then you have that the turn Laplacian applied to the normal square of this section is the normal square of the turn connection. is the normal square of the of the turn connection by to b minus the second richiform and then you construct with the with the with a formation metric okay so essentially you apply this formula to the identity and because you have an endomorphism you need to put two metrics one in q tau and one in q tau too so for one of the metrics you choose the moving metric and for the other one you choose the background metric and you get this okay so what can we do with this now Okay, so what can we do with this now? Suppose now that we have a B-smooth flat pretty close metric on MJ and take this tau defining the hollow order of the pandemic to be del of omega f. And let omega naught to be a pretty close formation metric such that this condition is satisfied. Then if we take the background metric to be the one corresponding to the bismuth flat metric, The flat to the bismuth flat metric and beta equals to zero, the corresponding pretty close flow line satisfies the following. So the heat operator applied to trace of GT with respect to G tilde is more or less, and actually is minus the norm squared of the difference of the two term connections. And actually, because of this specific choice and our explicit formula for the big metric G, this quantity contains This quantity contains pretty much all the information about the original metric. So this quantity can be present explicitly as the trace of the flat metric with respect to Gt plus the trace of Gt with respect to the flat metric plus the norm square of beta with respect to the metric. And now by an argument in a previous paper by Jordan and Stritz in Advances in Mathematics, we also can get that the That the heat operator applied to this normal score of the difference of the two chain connections is actually also a smaller repotential. So now, by the maximum principle, you automatically get a C1 estimate, a uniform C1 estimate for the moving metric. So there exists C bigger than 0 says that this holds. So the G T, the moving metric, is Metric is bounded by the background metric, and also the difference of the two churn connections is also uniformly bounded. And okay, this is abstract, but actually, because of this specific formula, you can write this in terms of the classical data. So actually, this implies that the actual Riemannian matrix G t is bounded by the is bounded by by the by the is bounded from above and below by the by the background metric and actually the difference of the two levita connections now of the of the of the moving metric and the background metric is also uniform in map so now bootest rubbing uh gives you a uniform s infinity estimate and this implies long-time existence uh and subsequential convergence uh of the flow to some uh limit metric which is smooth. A limit metric which is smooth. And in order to prove that actual convergence, one does as follows. So, as before, one can prove that there exists some big constant A such that this holds. So, the heat operator applied to T the difference, the normal square of the difference of the Lebesgue of the churn connections of G T and G tilde, minus this big constant A times the trace of the of one of the moving mates with respect to G tilde is with respect to g tilde is actually negative and then you get this this bound. So the supremum of the normal square of the difference of the two term connections is actually bounded by A divided by T times the supremum of this trace. But actually we proved already that this is uniformly bounded, so this implies that this needs to go to zero. So what this means is that the metric at infinity corresponding to this infinity metric is actually Chern-Ricci flat. This infinity metric is actually Chern Ricci flat because this was Chern Ricci flat by the Wismut's identity. So recall that my omega f being Bismuth flat implies that by this identity by Bismuth that the G tilde is channel-recipher and converged. So this being Chan Richie flat implies that this is chern Richie flat and this implies that this is piecemultified. And then to And then to conclude, you just replace the argument you know that this metric in the infinity exists, you just replace in the argument the GT Labacometric by the G infinity and conclude the convergence. Okay, so this is why I had to say my things I've been early. So thanks for your time. Thank you. Thank you very much. Other questions for Mario? I fast some questions from the online audience. So I was going to ask something, if that's okay. Sure. So this beta, is this a V field, or what is this beta, this thing which? What is this beta, this thing that you add in? Yeah, hi Jason. This is the two-zero component of a B-field. So the B-field you will get it by taking the real part of this pitager. This is some holistic. But it plays a role of a B-field. But I mean, the picture is a bit different from the usual picture for general geometry, because we are dealing with holomorphic kubernetes instead of real kubernetes. Real quote. So it's a bit slightly more weird. Does this answer your question? Yes, yes, yes, it does. The other question I had was about this renormalization group flow. Is that really the renormalization group flow? Is that sort of like the truncated version of the block? Yeah, yeah, of course. So in the actual physical Actual physical picture, this flow does not appear as such. It's more complicated. Actually, what happens in the physics picture when you are trying to quantize a sigma model is that you get an infinite number of corrections to this thing, which are labeled by a parameter called alpha plan. So this is like the first, the order one component of the Roman resistant group flow. Yeah. And then there are some arguments which are pretty much heuristic, which tells you that if you control this thing, then you will control the full flow. But this mathematically is just not known. Okay, thank you very much. Good. Other questions for Mario? Good. If not, let's thank the speaker again. Good. I can see some of you at the hike and the rest tomorrow again. And then Carnegie.
