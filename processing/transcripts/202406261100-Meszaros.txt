Uh, thank you for the organizers for their kind invitation. I'm extremely pleased to be here. Um, and uh, I am planning to discuss about the trajectory that I have been on in the past five years or so. Um, ever since I left UCLA, I was a postdoc there with Wife Gangbo, and then I met Zhang Feng and Chen Chen. This is when we started to collaborate on this kind of projects, and up until today, I am interested in this. Today, I am interested in this. A disclaimer is that I have promised too many things in the abstract, and a posterior I have realized that I will not be able to squeeze so many things in it. So, I will just give a glimpse of what I have been doing and what we have been doing. What are the results? I'm not sure if there's a okay. So, by today, everybody is quite familiar with the theory of mid-field games. So, this was initiated by two. So, this was initiated by two groups, one of them involving me, one who is in the audience. And I am not discussing too much about these now. So, but just to fix the notation, I will be working in the space RDS, the state space. Typically, there will be a Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian associated to each other via the Lujan transformation. So, the second one. Transformation. So the second variable is the placeholder for the generalized momentum variable, and x denotes position, and Î¼ denotes the measure of the agents. So these functions are defined also on the space operating measures with finite second moment. And you have a finite cost, which I denote by G. And we have two different kinds of noise intensities. Beta will be idiosyncratic, and beta zero will be. Veta zero will be a common noise. And you have an initial time, a final time, and an initial agent population. And the idea is that we would like to understand Minfield-Giam-Nash equilibria. And Minfield-Giam-Nash equilibrium in this context is that the flow of measures will be a mean field-GMASH equilibrium if a typical agent uses this as a prediction, solves this optimal control problem. And so, I will be defining the notion in the next slide. So, solve this optimal control problem, where you have two independent Brownian motions on Rd corresponding to individual and common noise. And we say that we are landing on a Nash equilibrium if the Optima process has the conditional law, which is precisely the prediction. So, this is our setting. This is our setting. And if there is common noise in the problem, then this flow of measures will be stochastic. Otherwise, it is a deterministic flow. Okay, and the main objective is to try to understand how to find MIFID games. And there are several approaches to take in this direction. And if somebody is more PDE-oriented, then you can write down the mythic. You can write down the mean film system. So, this is the mean film system, which is a coupled system between the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. Again, if there is common noise, you have that this system is a stoastic system of PDs. If there is no common noise, then this will be deterministic. And equivalently, we can definitely write down the corresponding FBSD systems and try to solve those, which will be eventually mean. Which will give eventually mean filter. So, this is somehow the background. And the master equation, because I am interested in the master equation, will be essentially an equation set on the state space, which is R D and the space of probability measures. And this V function encapsulates somehow the sensitivity of the value. Sensitivity of the value function from the previous system with respect to the initial method. So if you look at the dependence of u at little t0 with respect to this mu little t0, and you try to pair through the initial time and the initial measure, you end up with an equation which looks like this. So essentially, what is going on that the previous system of PDEs can be seen as Of PDEs can be seen as a system of characteristics for this equation. So, this is an equation which is more of a transport equation rather than a Hamilton-Jacobi equation, because you will have this kind of normal term over here, which is somehow telling you this is a transport equation because you have an optimal velocity field, and then u is transported along that. So, it is Of that. So, it is the right perspective to look at this equation as a transport equation, despite the fact that it has non-linearities and despite the fact that it has a second order to. So I think that these kind of derivatives have been defined before. So by partial mu, I denote the Masterstein derivative, and by this partial mu, mu, I denote the second-order Laserstein derivative. So it is important to notice that if the Important to notice that if the common noise is present, then this equation is generally second order on the space of probability measures. If there is no common noise, then this will be a first-order equation. Okay, and the main objective is that study this PD on the space of priority measures. This was proposed by Pierre Louis Lioux, and one of the main applications of this master equation is that classical solutions can be used as tools to obtain quantitative rates. To obtain quantitative rates of convergence for the n-player game when n tends to infinity. So, for notations, I'm recording here that you have this Wasserstein derivative. It is very important, in my opinion, to give credit down to Georgi Gi Savare, who have been developing this kind of card clues on the Wasserstein space way before we have started to work on different games. And you can really define intrinsically. Can really define intrinsically this kind of objects. And of course, this has been revisited by Pedro Lios and in Carmena de la Rue's book. This is called El Delti, but they are essentially objects which are going to. Okay. So our objective is to derive global Verposlas theory. Global, I mean that you do not want to have I mean that you do not want to have any restriction on the time horizon, on the measures that you can plug into the acquisition or on the data. And this is very much in contrast with the weak solutions that have been discussed a lot in the last two days, because we are aiming to have classical solutions. So then there is no ambiguity which kind of notion we use. So we would like to have a solution which is defined pointwise everywhere. Area. And all those objects that we write down, they are quantum. Okay, so there is a huge literature which is growing up until now on this kind of results. And most of the results on global time results were in the context of so-called separable Hamiltonians. So these separable Hamiltonians are exactly somehow philosophical in the context of the first talk that you have. That you have, so for instance, if you do not have separability structure, you can forget about potential gaps. And these models, if you have non-additive separability between the momentum and the measure variable, these two, these arise very naturally in economical applications like the Ayagavi model and these kind of models which have been revisited by Lucas and Mohl and co-authors, and also in congestion games. Also, in congestion games. So, meaning that if agents would need to slow down if the density around them is increasing, then these are giving you a natural class of Hamiltonians, which are low-served. Okay, so, and if it is possible, we would like to, so this is the second part of my talk, we would like to also get rid of the non-degenerate idiosyncratic noise. So, we would want to understand the theory which doesn't rely on paramolic. Doesn't rely on parabolic regularization. And this is where the displacement autoid CT will play crucial. Okay. So the first existence and uniqueness and stability results, the Earth's results on the master equation were obtained by two groups, essentially. So this was the first paper by Shasaniu, Kishan, and Dula Ri. So this appeared on the article in 2014 and there was a And there was a huge reference process, apparently, and the paper was definitely hard to digest when they have uploaded it on the archive. And so this uses probabilistic techniques, FBSDs, and with individual noise, but no common noise. And the subsequent work, which is even longer, so this became 250 pages book of Cardalia Guedolar Las Timon's, which Elastinios, which is set on the torus and uses purely PD techniques, the kind of thing that I have explained that you are taking this kind of perturbation analysis. And the crucial assumption is the separability and the Las Neos monotonicity. And the displacement monotonicity setting, this is the the kind of research that we have been pursuing, will turn out to be able to work in non separable setting. Work in non-separable setting. And this is a condition that we can formulate like this. So, this is a monotonic condition along optimal displacements. Sorry, not necessarily optimal displacements for the final condition. And this actually appeared, this standard of monotonicity appeared in these earlier works of Adija, and then they appear also in Carmel Nadula and even in the paper of Chasani, Kishonandula. And neutrician. Okay, okay, so there is a huge difference between Last Fluence and displacement monotonicity. And the easiest K example to try to understand this, it is precisely in the potential setting. So if you have the final condition which is derived from a potential, which is just the function defined on probability measures, then Las Vegas monotonicity actually is flat, it is equivalent to flat convexity. It is equivalent to flat convexity of G. That means that we are taking interpolations between property measures, which are non-convex combinations. And this placement monotonicity is related to this place-time convexity of G, which is in the sense of Magnetic optimal transportation, which actually takes into account the geometry. So, the last relationsity philosophically is related to flat geometry when you embed the space of relative measures into the space of measures, and there is. Measures and the displacement monotonicity is taking into account the positive curvature of the massage space. Okay, and I am mentioning a paper of one of my PhD students recently who revisited this kind of questions recently. And this kind of rewrite things in the second order case were provided by Chen Chen yesterday. So here we see very clearly also that there is a difference between the two of them. That there is a difference between the two of them because, in the displaced Lamoloto setting, you have partial x-x derivative for g. And it is very, very important to connect to the talk of Erhan and your talk also yesterday, that displacement convexity is very much incorporating the full Baserschlein Hessian. So, this is if you are in a potential setting, you are displaced monotony, and only if you have like the classic. Have like the classical characterization via secondary. Okay. And I will be using this notation for this because I'm not using the hash because they are not necessarily derived from a potential. Okay, and I am stating right away one of our main results, which I have obtained with Wilfred Gang, World Chanchecheng, General Feng Zhang 2022. So this is our main result. So if you have So, if you have non-degenerate idiosyncratic noise, you have a finite condition which is this Western monotone, you have a Hamiltonian which is not necessarily separable, and it is this Western monotone that I have to define. What is that? So, I owe you the definition. And you have sufficient singularity on the data, then you have global in-time verposness for the mass language. Okay, and I would like to sketch the philosophy behind the proof. And the philosophy goes as follows. Philosophy goes as follows. So, since this can be seen as a transport equation on the Wasserstein space, you have essentially a method of characteristics. That means that for short enough time, characteristics do not cross and you will have a classical solution. So, this is step zero, and this has been studied intensely in the book of Carl Mona and Dularie. So, if we have step zero, we have short-time existence. Okay, so now the heart of the analysis is the so-called propagation of monotoisine. Propagation of monotois. And this is philosophically very much in the same spirit as for Berger's equation. If you have a monotone initial condition, then that will be propagating and that the Berger's equation will be classically there for any time. And this is the heart of the matter, that if we have a final condition, which is displacement monotone, a priori in time, this will be propagated as long as the Hamiltonian satisfies. As the Hamiltonian satisfies the sufficient conditions, which is displacemental automatic. Okay, so and for that, what we did, we just took this kind of Hessian-like expression and tried to differentiate that at time with respect to time. And we used that the master equation has a classical function for short time. Okay, so now this when monotonicity, if you have monotonicity, this would imply W2 Lipschitz condition. To Lipschitz condition both on v and partial x of v. And the Lipschitz constant is depending only on the data and on these nodes. And here we bound this norm of partial x x v using parabolic regularization. And for that, we were using that these guys are bound. Okay, so now how we go forward. So actually W W2 will not be enough to go from local time to global time. So, we will need to obtain W1 Lipschitz estimates on these kind of objects. And this can be done using a trick that Chenchev and John developed in an earlier paper. So, using precise representation formulas via RBSDs and taking differentiation. And then, at the end of the day, what we do, we solve the mass recognition for short. We solve the master equation for short time. It turns out that the short time horizon is depending only on the w one, which is constant of the value function, which we can control by the previous steps. And then you just patch solutions together and you obtain the global entire solution. Okay, so this is the proof. And this is the definition of the Hamiltonian-to-be-displacement monotone. And this is a little bit of an ugly expression. Little bit of an ugly expression, but this is precisely what pops up if you try to do the computation. So, if you have a separable Hamiltonian, then it turns out that this is totally equivalent to, so if you had this condition of separability that H was equal to H0 minus F, then this condition is precisely equivalent for F being displaceable monotone and H0 being convex in the P1. And H0 being convex in the pyramid. So, this is the condition which lets you propagate the displacement monotonicity, and this is what we call the displacement monotonic condition for non-septorable hydrogen. Okay, so this was a beautiful story that we were extremely happy about, and this really compensates the Chasalier Christian de Larue and Madelia de Larimbascalio's results. And we wanted to ask further questions in this kind of To ask further questions in this kind of direction, and this is the second part that I would want to squeeze in the next six minutes or so. So, the first question which arises is that can we remove non-degenerate idiosyncratic noise? So, to take beta, for instance, to be zero, and can we use this kind of philosophy in potentially different kinds of contexts? And there was like suggestions already, I had a paper. Suggestions already. I had a paper with Lietric Ganbo before on totally deterministic problems, which were potential, and we were able to show in this paper that the master equation has globally time solution. So there was really a hope. And I would like to point to two key facts. So if you remember, it was crucial that we had bounds on partial XXV because this is what was also contributing to the W2 Lipschitz constant. To the W2 Lipschitz constant. So, the question is: can we somehow obtain this kind of partial x-axis bounce on V not using parabolic regularity? And the answer is yes, because it turns out that displacement monotonicity implies that the value function is convex, is convex in the x variable. So that means that you have one-sided hash bound. And via optimal control, classical optimal control techniques, we always be able to. We always be able to have a semi-concavity estimates. So, via displacement monotonicity alone, you will have uniform balance and partial axis. So, this is very interesting. So, that means that we can remove the non-degenerate eosyentropic noise. And then the question is that can we find maybe a more friendly, user-friendly condition on the Hamiltonian, which would let you to propagate the displacement monotonicity? And the answer is. Automicity and the answer is yes, that there exists a first-order condition that we can write like this. So, this is somehow telling you that you have to have like a precise convex concave structure on the Hamiltonian, which is weighted with respect to translocation plans. And we can show that this condition is enough to propagate the displacement monotonicity. And if I keep in the second order displacement monotonicity, So that will imply this one. But this will be enough. Okay, so this is a result that we have obtained with Mohit Bansill, who is a PhD student at UCLA at Chen Cheng Wu. And so if H and the G are displacement monotone in the using the first order definition, you can take the beta in beta zero to be arbitrary. You do not really care. You will have verticalness because the only essential part was to. The only essential part was to propagate the monotonicity and to control the Lipschitz constant. And the rest follows from the same kind of computation. It is important to notice that for this kind of approach, when you have totally degenerate idiosyncratic noise, you have to change a little bit the perspective and you have to work with the Pontiagin system. So I think that I wrote somewhere here. So yes, so in the first work that we had with Check. With Chenchen, we have to engine, we were using this kind of point. I mean, we were using this FBLP system, which is here why it is representing the value function along the optimal flow. And if you remove the non-degenerate ideosyncratic noise, you have to use this kind of construction system. And this kind of condition, the displacement auto enshrining condition has very good links with this kind of With this kind of monotoensific condition, which appeared, so I have realized this way later in this paper of Tang and Wu, which studies fully coupled FBSD systems. So if you look at their monotonicity condition, that is very much similar to the displacement monotonic condition on H, of course, there is no mean fiddle like that. But it is the same kind of spirit that we can use this FPS. Okay, and further results, of course. Okay, and further results, of course, that this opened the door to many other investigations. A very nice result is the result of Chen Chen and Zhang Feng, which is this one, which is actually studying Minfield games of control. So in more general mean field interaction settings, you can show that you can triple bit the displacement monotonicity, and that generalizes quite nicely. Another very nice application. Very nice application, and I wanted to mention also this work of Joe Jackson and Ludovic, who is in the audience. The displacement monotony technique applies also to more general models where you control even the volatility, and they were using this kind of assumptions to actually show the convergence result for local Look Nash equilibria, and so on and so forth. And so on and so forth. And I would like to, I think, finish because I do not have time for the long-time behavior with this result. So, as a further consequence with Mohit Bansfield, we started to investigate so-called canonical transformations on the Wasserstein space. So, canonical transformations are transformations on Hamiltonian systems, which are invariant under the Hamilton's equations. And the question is: can we recover some sort of monotonicity by Cover some sort of monotonicity by using this kind of transformations? The answer is yes. So, if you take this transformation, which is just finite-dimensional, applied to the mean-field game, it turns out that you can recover some hidden monotonicity which is of displacement monotone type that you didn't see at the level of the original problem. And here, this is just alpha, it is just a constant, and you can check that this is a transformation which is leaving Habitos equations. Leaving Habitos equations or the FBSD system in variable. And we can formulate this result. So it turns out that this has a regularization effect. And it turns out that even if our original master equation was not there posed, we can modify the Hamiltonian. And this is coming from the transformation. And it turns out that this new Hamiltonian and the original final condition will be globally vapor. Globally verposed if alpha is sufficiently large. And in particular, this alpha is depending only on the second derivatives of H and G, but it is not dependent on time. And of course, we can ask the question that do we have stabilization effect in long time? And this is an ongoing work that I am absolutely having no time to discuss about. So here, the idea is that people have been studying this kind of This kind of long-time behavior for near-field greens in the case of the last Leon's monotone setting, and we have a series of papers. If you take the intersection, probably Cardalani and Porgata or Cardaliani using the intersection. So they were interested in this kind of turnpike property and the stationary states and exponential convergence towards this kind of stationary states. It turns out that this. States, it turns out that displacement monotonicity will serve again as a sufficient flow for this kind of results. And this is an ongoing work that I am aiming to finish soon with Marco Chirant from Padua. Here, one disclaimer is that in all these results, they are using PD techniques essentially, and you have to have that the stationary PD has a solution, which in the displacement monotone case it is a little bit more complicated because the displacement is not a very important. Complicated because the displacement monotonicity is more like a trajectory-based. So you usually have to write down FBSD systems to see displacement monotonicity in action. And you cannot just multiply by measures and so on as in this model. So the idea has to be totally different from the ones which are in the literature. And this is what we are pursuing with Marko Chirant. And I see that my time is up. Thank you very much for your attention. Questions of explanation of the pool. So yeah, so there was that from W2 to W1. Yes. So that's necessary why they can't. Yes, because that is a very good question. So this is not necessarily because the This is necessarily because the short time result that you can read from Carmona and Dulatu in the book, the time horizon depends on W1 if it's constant. And this is somehow meaningful because you have to have full bounds on derivatives. So if you would want to write that, I don't know, this function is W two Lipschitz, you would want to have bounds on this in L2 with respect to mu. Respect to mu, right? And being W morning, she means that you have actually L-infinity bounds, like uniform limits, controlled L-infinity bounds. And the time horizons are really depending on those kind of objects. So that is a very good question. That if you are able to produce a theory which doesn't involve W1 Lipschitz estimates on the time horizon, then you should be able to avoid that step. Good. Thank you. Yeah, I have a. I have a general question like does any do you do you know any cross-value result for the mid-build systems under this condition yeah yeah so so of course if you are able to solve the master equation you automatically have a result on the MiFibium system because the MiFibium system it is the the characteristics yes so in particular what you are saying is that I have the master function and you are you are evaluating it along the Evaluating it along the optimal flow of measures, and I call this U of Tx. And then this U and this rho we solve the equivalent system. And this is vice versa. So if I am able to have the sensitivity analysis on the system, this is the method of characteristics. So if you have their uniqueness, such characteristics should not cross because I would want to define this like this, right? So this is the definition. This is by definition. Yeah. So as you can see. Yeah, so regularity is not a problem. Regularity, I mean, so you have to assume enough regularity to be able to justify all the computations, but it is not a problem. So you have the corresponding result for the Mequithium system as well. Okay, just second. I guess question. Yeah, in a dynamic games, sometimes we can control the company. If it's a weak company, then you do not need the very Very strong conditions on the dynamics of course, you give the existence. So, is there something similar? That is a very simple question. You can control the company, the company's relatively weak. That is a very good question. The short answer is that I don't know. And the longer answer is that you really need to have like a classic coupling, in my understanding, in order to be able to define. Understanding in order to be able to define this kind of options. So, probably this would lead to some weaker notions of solutions to the master equation. I mean, the agents play together through the apalene and the cost cap, but the company is kind of weak. Okay. Yeah, I don't know. Any more questions? Yeah, let's uh scientists speak again.
