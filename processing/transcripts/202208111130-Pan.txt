So, it is a pleasure to introduce Jia Ying Pan, and he's going to talk about some examples of open manifolds with positive Richie curvature. Okay, thanks for having me here. So, this is a joint work with School Hungry. So, in a nutshell, so let me just summarize what's happening here. So, we want to address a So, we want to address a question. It's for open manifolds. Here, open means it's complete and non-compact. So, what are the differences between non-active sectional curvature or non-active reaching curvature? Or you say a positive sectional curvature and a positive reaching curvature? Surely, sectional curvature is a much stronger condition. But other than saying, okay, the curvatures are different, right? Well, what can we say they're different? Well, what can we say their difference in, for example, their topological structure or geometrical structure? Now, there are many examples addressing this problem. For example, we have constructions by Shaoyang, by Pellman, by Mangu, etc. So these examples usually says under certain, even under certain conditions, like for example, Euclidean volume growth. Medium volume growth, you may have infinite second BT number or higher beta, sorry, infinite higher BT number. So this regards higher homotopy groups in some sense. Now, for this talk, we're going to first look at Nobel example and some related constructions. So these examples, they concern more on the fundamental group level. Level. Now, the example is in 9080. So it's a remaining metric with positive reach curvature on RK cross-circle. So here K is at least 3. Now, in comparison, if you have positive sectional curvature on a manifold, then actually M is diffeomorphic to Rn. And well, there are strong. And well, there are stronger results like the Sol conjecture. So if you have non-negative sectional curvature and positive sectional curvature at a single point, then the manifold will be diffeomorphic to R. So rich curvature will be very different because now it has a non-trivial fundamental group. Now there's another related construction by Guofang Wei in 90%. Construction by Guo Fenwei in 1988. So that's Rk cross n. So here, I'll talk a little bit more details later. So here, this n is a so-called new manifold, and the k is a large integer. This also admits a Riemannian metric with positive Ricci curvature. So here, as a new manifold, this capital N has a fundamental group as a torsion-free new polymer group. And this is also different from sectional curvature case because even you assume non-active sectional curvature, the fundamental group must be virtually abidian. So this means you can find a subgroup A inside pi 1m. So this A is abidian and the finite index. So this means virtual abiding. While for While for a new manifold, its fundamental group does not contain any abelian subgroups with final index. Okay, so these are the past construction. I'll talk a little bit more later. So the menu results in this talk is basically some new observations, not really new examples, because these examples are a lot. Because these examples are like older examples. These are 9080 and 9088. These are older than me. So, what we're going to do is we look at the universal covering of these constructions. And unsurprisingly, these universal coverings, they give negative answers to some long-standing open problems. So, one regards the so-called Bootsman function at a point, whether it's Point whether it's always proper under the non-active reach condition. The other one regards the reach limit space. Is it true that a host of dimension of the singular set cannot exceed that of the regular set? So both problems are true if you replace rich by section curvature. And the universal covering actually gives negative answers to. Gives negative answers to both problems. Surely you need to tweak the functions a little bit. It's not one function deals all of them. Okay, so let me say a few more words on the past construction. So this is Namla's example later generalized by Badri. So Namla. So the last example is this n is a circle actually. So here we start with a closely manifold capital N with non-active reaching curvature. And we construct this so-called doubly warped product on RK close n. So you think of this RK as a warped product, say it's from zero to infinity, then warp sphere, k minus one dimensional sphere. One-dimensional sphere. So the W walk product looks like this. And to make sure it's a smooth manifold in the first place, you require some conditions like this f as odd function, this h is even, and f has derivative zero, a deriv equals to one as zero, and h0 is positive, etc. But anyway, so under some reasonable conditions, you can get a Are reasonable conditions you can get a smooth remaining metric. And what Nobanal did is it says you can pick suitable implicit FR. So it's implicit. It's actually the solution to some differential equation. And also HR is related to F and a large K, this large K depends on like this capital N. This capital N. If the N has a larger dimension, you'll have a larger K there as well. So then you can pick these suitable things to get positive retrieval ratio. All right. So in their construction, okay, this is a picture. So this is a picture in the case that this end is a circle. So this is at R equals to zero. So these arrows point to the R positive direction. Direction. Now, these spheres correspond to the sphere walking here, and so the size of these spheres at distance r basically corresponds to what's the value of this FR is. And the size of these circles basically says, okay, what's the value of HR? So here, H is a decreasing function. Decreasing function, it can decrease to zero or it can decrease to some positive constants. Both are allowed. Let me also say a few words on Guofon's construction. So this is, you know, we start with a simply connected new bottle group. For example, you can say this untilde is the Hashenberg 3 group. Three group, so it's upper triangular and ABC as real numbers, and then you take gamma as a lattice inside. So you take the same thing now, ABC as integers. This will be a subgroup inside N tilde. It's a lattice inside N tilde, but it's not normal. So it's quotient. So that's. Quotient, so that's so-called a new manifold. And yeah, one thing is that this gamma does not have any abelian subgroup of finite index. It's torsion-free, so-called torsion-free new pattern. So this new manifold, it does not admit a matrix of non-negative Richie. So that's the difference between Gofan's construction and Nebanos. And the NOS construction previously, because here you require non-active RECHI on this. And this one does not admit non-active Reachy curvature. But it does admit, this is actually well known, this is so-called almost flat. It requires a family of metrics so that its sectional curvature can be arbitrarily close to zero. So this R is a parameter here. As R goes to infinity, so this sectional curvature. Infinity, so this sectional curvature will be very close to zero in two side bounds. And so, Guofangwe constructed also this looks like a doubly wall product, but it's not really that because here this NR is not a uniform scale. So, because this almost a flat metric on GR is. Flat metrics on GR is like on the different steps of this new pollen thing. So you first define this metric on Tilda, right? So different steps of the new pollen groups, they grow in a different way, the metrics. So here is you, instead of say you using this H square R G. R G N. Now we replace this by this GR, which is inhomogeneous scanning. So this is like a homogeneous scanning. You scale always at the same rate at a fixed R. So it's not like this. And it actually has positive reach coverage of 1k is sufficiently large. And also, it has the same. It has the similar feature as in the Mus construction that you have this decaying of the circle. Now, here is you have this decaying of this new manifold along R. It actually decays a rate of, say, R to the negative alpha for some positive alpha. And then the fundamental group is the same as this gamma, which is not virtually a B. So, any questions at this moment? And so, in Gofan's construction, she also got this explicit expression of f and h. So, here are some cases you're walking a circle, let's say, for simplicity. Circle, let's say for simplicity. So, walking a circle is the easiest, right? Now, we can have this H with polynomial decay, and all you can modify this one to get H with logarithm decay. So both are allowed. And later on, we'll see the difference between these two decays, actually. And by the way, so it's also allowed that this age decays to. That this age decays to a positive constant. This is in Lebanon's original work. Okay, so now we move on to the new observations. And the first one is about the Bossman function. So let me first record that. So we start with an open Riemannian manifold. Then for any open Riemannian manifold, you can always find arrays in it. Always find arrays in it. So let's say we have a unit speed rate C. So unit speed rate means you have C from zero to infinity to M. That is an isometric embedding. In other words, you have this the distance between CT1 and CT2 is just the absolute value of T1 minus. Absolute value of t1 minus t2. And on open metaphors, you can always find these rays. And once you have a ray, you can associate this so-called Boostman function associated to a ray. So that's like, so let me draw a picture. So it's the difference between two distance, then you take a limit. So it's t minus x. So this is my x, this is my ct, this is c zero. This is C0. And you can think of this T as the distance between C0 and C T. So it's the difference between this orange segment and this, say, green segment, X to C T. Okay. Then you take a limit, and actually, this limit always exists, and it defines a continuous function on the entire M, right? On the entire M, right? So you can view this BCX as a certain renormalized distance from X to infinity along C. Now, for example, if you take the, so let's take the R2 as an example. And we just use C as the positive x-axis, right? Then we normalize, let's say, Normalize, let's say I require, say, the distance from zero to the infinity point along C, the distance is zero. You re-normalize it, right? Then if you get closer to C, sorry, if you move along C, then somehow it gets closer to the point at infinity. So the distance should decrease, right? So intuitively, you should assign, say, negative one. Sign say negative one, but this is the negative of that normalized distance. So here it's actually one, but well, in some literature, people just take distance minus t instead of t minus this. It just differs by inside. So at say one, so you can draw a vertical line, then actually this BCX on this line, they take a value as one, right? As one, all right, and uh, so the level sets of this uh boost map function are really uh vertical uh vertical lines. So, in the case of R2, for sure. This I'm gonna say I'm using the R2 in an example. And then you can define the so-called Boost Meth function at a point. So, once you fix a point P, then you take all the rays starting from this point P, and every ray gives you a boost. And every ray give you a Boostman function B C, then you take the supremal of them. So that gives you the Bootsman function at a point. Now, again, for example, if you look at that R2, let's say I have my point here, X, and P is my origin, right? Then you want to find the supremo. So let's say you think about all the rays. Let's say you think about all the rays starting from P, right? It could be this one, it could be this one, it could be this one. And among them, you want to find the one with the largest value of its Bootsman function. So because the level set of Bootsman function is always perpendicular to these arrays, so actually this one is the correct ray. And so BPX is actually the distance from P to X. So in the case of R2, right? So this will be the maximum. If you take a different one, you take the positive x-axis, then its Boostman function has value this one. If you take C, the Bootsman function has value this one. So, so you take this one, it's larger, right? So, you get this. Now, for convenience, we use the term Bootsman function to refer to the one at a point. Now, the Bootsman function is a very useful tool in studying open manifolds. So it plays an important role actually in both sectional curvature and reach curvature. Curvature and reach curvature. So, in the case of sectional curvature, we have this result by trigouromosis. The Bootsman function is convex and proper. So, here I mean the Bootsman function at a point, right? So, this is one of the key steps in the proof of Trigo-Gromo-Sau theorem. And also, convexity implies the properness. So, here, proper means So here proper means proper just means if you take closed bounded interval, then it's per image is also compact for any so compact interval it would be like this. So convexity implies the properness Properness, this is because suppose it's not suppose it's not proper, right? Then you can find points divergent further and further away. Now you join them to the first point. So that gives you segments, right? So by convexity, all of these segments. All of these segments stay in the perimage. So you can take convergence, you get a limit rate. And this limit rate is still in the perimage. And now you can take points that is going very far into this ray. And the Boostman function, so say BC of this CT is T and it could be very. Is t and it could be very large, right? And BP will be even larger. So you take a T that exceeds your started interval, then it's a contradiction. Because by convexity, this C and should stay in the pre-image, right. Okay, so for Richie curvature, it's known that this is again by Shigu Guramo, the Boostman function is superharmonic, and this is also one of the key steps in the proof of the splitting theorem. And there's the open question since the time of splitting theorem asks whether the bootstrap is always. Whether the boost map function is always proper, assuming non-active retrieval region. And by the way, so the properness of this BP does not depend on a choice of a base point. So it's really a property of the entire manifold, right? And there are some partial results confirming this. So under certain Confirming this, so under certain conditions, the Boostman function is indeed proper. So, first of all, this is by Shen in 1996. So, it says if n has Euclidean volume growth, so that's the largest way it can grow in terms of volume, right? So, in that case, the Bootsman function is indeed a proper. And the second layer is by Somerny in 1998, says if 98 says if M grows the smallest possible way in terms of volume, so that's the case of linear volume growth. So, in that case, M also has a proper Boostman function. So, in these extremal cases, in terms of volume growth, we do have the properness of BP. Now, so So we give a negative answer in general by looking at some examples. So this is a statement. So given any integer, at least four, we can find an open manifold with positive ritual curvature and a non-proper Bootsman function. So we don't know about dimensions three case, actually, by the way. And And another question one can raise is: so in Somali's work, where you have linear volume growth, or in Shen's work, where you have Euclid volume growth, in both cases, the asymptotic cone of the manifold is always polar. So I assume we know about asymmetric one, but we'll talk about that in more details later. That means you do a blowdown, right? So here are So here Ri goes to infinity, and you do blow down, you get a limit space, say x small x. And it may depend on the choice of your Ri, but if you have a linear volume growth, this capital X is either a half line or a straight line, right? Or if you have Euclidean volume growth, you always get a metric comma actually. Get a metric on actually by using the result of sugar coding, and you always get a metric. Now, in both cases, they are polar. So, polar means for any point, say Z, that is not your base point, then you can find a ray starting from your base point going through Z. So, that's the meaning of polar. So, in both cases, we do have polar asymptotic cones. And we can Cons. And we can raise the question: that if we also assume all the asymptotic cones of M they are always polar, is the Boostman function proper in this case? Because that seems the case in previously known results. And actually, we can also construct counterexamples. So it has positive reach curvature, it has a unique polar asymptotic cone, but it's still. Audio Kong, but it still has non-proper boots male functions. Now, let me say a few words on this example. So, the bottom line is, as mentioned, we look at the universal covering of doubly warped product. So, similar to Nominal's construction, but now we take the universal cover. So, for some suitable F and H. Now, as long as Now, as long as this h decreases to zero, so recall that I mentioned in the Manasseh construction, h can go to zero or can go to a positive constant. So when it goes to zero, then the universal covering actually has a non-proper Boostman function. And when this H also has logarithm decay, which is also allowed, right? Then this M actually has a unique polar asymptotic cone and the asymptotic form and as the standard half-pane so so it's like it's like this so the this is your base point and you have a standard half pen so that this will be the asymptotic of m tilde when h has logarithm decay but you still have a non-proper Bootsman function because this H goes to zero right so as long as it goes to zero the Boothman function is not proper okay so now let me say Okay, so now let me say why this is true. So, to show that the Boostman function, so your base point you can pick a favorite point because the properness does not depend on your base point. So, to prove that the Bootsmap function at a chosen base point is non-proper, we need to find what are the race in m tilde, right? Because we need to find the race, then we need to take the supremo of these. Need to take the supremo of these Boostmap functions associated to these rays. So, the idea is we first find all the geodesics in M because you pick a ray on the universal cover, you can always project it down, you get a geodesic in M. Surely not all geodesics lifts to ray. So, we're gonna look which one actually lifts to ray later, right? So, this is our base. So, this is our base manifold, and we write every point m as rxy, and we fix a point x equals to 0, x, y at r equals to 0 as our base point. So under this representation, it will be the same as say 0, x prime, y, because recall that the sphere has zero diameter as zero, so x and x prime really Prime really are talking about the same point. Now, for every x, we define a semant for this cx is you fix this x, then you take all the other r and take all the other y, and then you also take the negative part of that. So, this will be a totally jodistic and a geodesically complete semantic. Complete the manifold in M. So if you shoot out a geodesic, it always stays in Cx, right? And we included a plus or minus here is because if you have a geodesic, say you start from R positive, so starting from this positive X, then it hits at R equals. Then it hits at r equals to zero, then actually goes to the negative part. So we add this negative part to make sure it's geodesically complete. And then the induced remaining metric on this Cx will be isometric to the surface revolution, just this R cross circle. So this is really zero to infinity H circle that is dr square plus HR squared. HR square G circle. Okay. I mean this metric. Yeah, so also notice that if you take all of these Cx, when you vary this X in the sphere, and you take the tangent plan at P, that actually covers the entire tangent plan of N. So to study the To study the geodesics in M starting from P, it's equivalent to study geodesics in this surface, right? Starting at, say, R equals to zero. But, oh, sorry, I should say that I got it wrong. Okay. There's a, it should be the from negative infinity to positive infinity instead of the half line. So, so this H is extended, okay. So, this h is extended. Okay. So, so I think I write it wrong here. So, because we also include a negative x. Now, this is surface, so there are known results to apply, right? And by classical differential geometry and our choice of age, so And our choice of H. So here, choice of H means it's an even function, it's decreasing, it goes to zero. So a geodesic in this surface starting from a P has one of the following forms. So let me draw this surface here. So this is our This is our surface looks like, right? And this red point is our base point. Now, there are only three types of geodesics starting from P. The first one is a radio direction ray. So you just go this way to the infinity, right? The second one is a closed jaw distance. The second one is a closed geodesic as the circle r equals to zero. So it's the largest blue circle here. So this one will also be a geodesic. And the last one is a bounded geodesic oscillating between R positive and R negative. And then they oscillate indefinitely. So you shoot out at an angle that is not zero, not half pi, then you may wop around this surface. This surface. And the point is that at a certain point, it'll turn back. Okay. At a certain point, it'll turn back. And then it's oscillating. So it'll go to the negative pot. And then at a certain point, it turns back again. Okay, so you know the idea, right? So it's going back and forth here. Okay. Okay, so these are all the possible geodesics in this surface. Now, if we start a unit speed rate on the universal covering M tilde, then we project it down, then we got a geodesic in M. And it will be a geodesic in some CX, which so you get a geodesic in this in this surface, right? In this surface, right now, by the above classification and the splitting theorem, this C actually is indeed C must project to a radial ray in M. So it will be this one, the first case. It goes through this. So this is because the splitting theorem. So if it's the other cases, like a circle or a bounded geodesic oscillating around. Disec oscillating around. So you can lift the disk to the universal covering and it will give you a ray. So it's a standard argument like you use some covering map or disk transformation to move that around and it always stays in a bounded set. So eventually you can converge to a line. And now you converge to a line, then it's a contradiction because we are having positive reach curvature. Are having positive reach curvature, right? Positive reach curvature. If you have a line, it'll split, then you have non-neck, you have zero reach curvature somewhere. Sorry, I always mean reaching curvature. Maybe I misspoken somewhere. Positive reach curvature. So, yeah, so it always projects to a radio ray. So then we. Then we can estimate how the Boostman function associated to this ray. So let's say I have a generator of the fundamental group. So the fundamental group is A. So let's so all other elements will be gamma to the air. Then, so on the universal covering, I have this P tilde here. Then this is gamma to the air p tilda. Air p tilda, and I have array here, right? So this is c so I want to measure the difference of say c0 to ct, so here, and so let me draw point ct and the distance between gamma error p tilde and ct, right? So now if you draw minimal geodesic, regardless how it looks like, you can project it down to the To the manifold, then in a surface of revolution, right? Maybe I should use a different color, but anyway. So the first one is clear because it's just says that the covering map is distance not increasing. So gamma error p tilde maps to p. gamma L P tilde maps to P and the C T maps to C bar T and we know this C bar T is a radial ray so T to C bar T is exactly T. Now for the other side you just project the minimal geodesic from gamma error P tilde and C T projected down and it will be the shortest loop that goes from that goes from a That goes from a sorry, this is not P tilde, this is just P that goes from P and the C bar that waps the cylinder exactly air times, right? So you can just pick a special one to give an upper bound. So you go directly through this ray, radio ray from P to C bar T, and then you walk here air times. Right, so this loop gives an upper bound on this distance. So it's smaller or equal than a t plus error times pu pi ht. So that's the, so pupi ht is the distance of this loop. And the point is that this term goes to zero as t goes to infinity because h goes to zero, right? So now you say, okay, t minus this term, right? Then you take t to infinity. Right, then you take t to infinity, so you get zero, right? And then you take the supremo of all c because this argument works for every c. So you get the Boostman function at this base point p tilde, then you evaluate this at a gamma error p tilde. Any orbit point is always zero. So the level set p tilde inverse zero, this level set contains the entire orbit, which is unbounded because. It which is unbounded because this karma is zigzag right. You have covering maps, you have an infinite group, right? So it's always unbounded. So that's it. So it cannot be compact. Okay, any questions at this moment? Okay, so let me move on to the second half, which is Richard Lemmon space. And so I think Guofan already mentioned a lot. So I'll be quick here. So we have this Gromov's pre-compactness theorem, right? So as long as you have reached a lower bound, then you can find a convergent sub-sequence. A convergent sub-sequence and it goes to some XP, referred to as a Richard Lemon space. And we have this regular singular decomposition on there. So it's K-regular. A point is K-regular if every tangent cone at this point is isometric to the Euclidean RK. And we say it's singular if otherwise. And we write this fancy R to the K as the set of K regular points and this fancy S as the set of all. And this fancy S as the set of all singular points. So there's an important regularity theory developed by Trigger Coding and Neighbor. So here is one of the important results that you can find a unique integer k between zero and n. So this n is the dimension of the manifolds. Dimension of the manifolds. Okay, so you have mi to the n goes to x so that the set of k regular set has four measure with respect to any renormalized limit measure. And moreover, this Rk part, so this k regular set has first off dimension exactly k. Okay, so we refer to this unique integer as the This unique integer as the rectifiable dimension of x. Now, if the sequence is non-collapsing, so record that means you have a uniform lower bound on the volume, then trigger encoding they showed that the rectifiable dimension of x and the host of dimension of x, they are both n. So, again, and So, again, and it's the dimension of the manifolds. And moreover, they got a control, this co-dimension two theorem, the control on how large the singular set is. So, the singular set, the host of dimension of the singular part cannot exceed a minus two. And the regular part, so the regular part is so that also becomes the So that also becomes the hotstop dimension of X in the non-collapsing case. And at the time, they raised the question that whether a similar thing holds for collapsing rich limit space. In other words, is it true that the host of dimension of the singular set cannot exceed that of the regular set? Or equivalently, you can add. Or equivalently, you can ask whether the rectifiable dimension gives the same integer as say host of dimension, right? So rectifiable dimension is always an integer, by the way. But host of dimension in general, in general, metric spaces, it may not be integers. Okay, so ideally, you may want this to be true because you don't want the battery. The bad points to have a dominating sense, right? So, and actually, we also give counter examples to this by looking at the universal coverings of these number non-alike constructions. So, now this is the statement. Now, given any beta, so this beta could be any number, not necessary, and an integer, then we can find a sufficient. Then we can find a sufficiently large n. How large it is, depending on this beta. And we can find a positive open manifold of positive rich curvature so that its asymptotic cone satisfies following. Well, it's an asymptotic cone. In particular, this will be a rich Lima space, right? And it comes from positive Rich curvature. So that on this asymptotic cone. On this asymptotic cone, a point is either singular or is true regular, and moreover, so now in particular, you can apply the regularity theory says this R2 has host of dimension two, right? And you don't have other regular points, so it's all R2. But the singular part has hot stop dimension one plus beta. Now, if you take Now, if you take this beta greater than one, your favorite number greater than one, then it will exceed this two. So it will become the dimension of host of dimension of capital Y. Now, in particular, this Y may not have integer hotstop dimension. You can have any number greater than two. So, and this also says that the limit measure. This also says that the limit measure and any dimensional host of measure may not be mutually absolutely continuous. Right, because if you take because the singular part, if you use the host of measure, regardless what kind of dimension you choose, it always has a dominating, it's always dominating over the regular part, right? So if you use the say exactly this one plus beta. Say exactly this one plus beta as you already mentioned, then that the regular part will have a zero measure under that host of measure while the singular part is non-zero. Okay, so let me recall asymptotic homes, right? So we have this open manifold, then you can do a blowdown that goes to say, for example, if you take a flat cylinder and it If you take a flat cylinder and you bloat it down, the circle shrinks to zero, so you get a line. Right, as a matter of fact, if you have non-negative sectional curvature, the asymptotic cone is always unique and it's indeed a metric cone with vertex A. And it looks like this. But in general, when reach a positive, the asymptotic one may not be unique and it may not even be polar at the base point. Even be polar at the base point. Metric cones are always polar at the vertex, by the way. Now, yeah, we're going to look at a universal covering. So we'll also take the gamma action into account. So gamma is the fundamental group. And then we can obtain this equivalent pointed grandma positive convergence. It carries the isometric action of gamma to the left. Action of gamma to the limit, so you get the limit group action. So this G is a closed subgroup of the isometry group of Y. And moreover, so this is by Fukaya and Yamaguchi, that if the quotient, so Y modula G is exactly the asymptotic on the base manifold when using the same scaling sequence. right so we call this capital y small y capital g and equivalent asymptotic cone of the universal covering with gamma action now for for example if you look at the flat cylinder that the universal covering will be r2 right and with z action and the action will be translations now when you bloat it down these nearby orbital points These nearby orbital points become closer and closer. So eventually they form a line. So it goes to R20R. The orange line is the orbit at the orange, it's pure translation. And so And so, if you have non-active sectional curvature, then it turns out that the equivalent asymptotic of the universal covering is also unique, and the orbit at the base point will always isometric to RK factor. So this basically says the cylinder picture, somehow, in some sense, you can still see it as long as you're assuming non-active sectional curvature. So here, So here the limit orbit at a base point is a straight line, it's R1. So in general, non-active sectional curvature, the limit orbit at a base point is always an RK factor. But we're going to soon see that it's very different in reaching curvature. Now, bottom line, again, we look at a universal covering of Wall product like this. And so And so in all these number nod alike examples, so why this this asymptotic cone of the universal cover of the universal covering capital Y, it always has rectifiable dimension two. And the orbit gy is the singular set actually. So the orbit at the base point is exactly the singular set. And this orbit is homeomorphic to R, right? To R, right? So topologically, it has dimension one. But when this H has polynomial decay like R to the negative beta, so that's in Bohan's construction actually. So then the orbit actually has hostile dimension one plus beta, right? So that's the bottom line. Now, to explain why this is true, so we'll start the True, so we have studied a fundamental group action on the universal covering. So it looks like, so this is M, right? We're going to use the same function in waste construction. And we'll have a point P here, right? So on the universal covering, you have this P tilde, gamma, error, P tilde. We are interested in the distance between them, right? So this translates. So, this translates to study, say, the minimal representing loop of gamma to the air. So, let's say there's a CR and you want to walk the cylinder air times and comes back and it has the minimal possible lengths. Now, because this H is decaying, H is decreasing, so the minimal representing loop will So the minimal representing loop will go a little bit into the end and it may wop air rounds here and then comes back. So CRMA looks like this instead of just going directly a rounds at R equals to zero, right? So this one will be shorter. So it has shorter lengths compared to, say, air and it has large. And it has larger size, right? So, yeah, I'll go to the next slide and say more. So, because this H is decreasing and this C r goes further into the end as air increases, so this shortens the length of C r. And it turns out that we can have this estimate that the length of C r is comparable to air to this power, air to the one over one plus two alpha. One plus two alpha, and this is also comparable to the size of C here. So, here size means you at the base point p, you can draw a metric ball that exactly includes the this loop, right? So then the radius of this metric ball will be the size, right? So it's the smallest ball center. The smallest ball centered at a P that includes this loop. So all these are comparable, right? So now we go to the universal covering. So we have this P tilde, gamma error, P tilde. So recall that when you lift that C error, you get a minimal geodesic from P tilde to gamma error P tilde. So the lifting will go like this, right? Now, because it has size comparable to the lens, so this means on the universal covering, this minimal geodesic will stray away from the pre-image, or you say from all the orbit points and comes back. How far is it strayed away? It's comparable to the length of this loop, right? Sorry, the length of this curve, no, no, loop, or is it the length of this geodesic? Of this geodesic. Okay, then you bloat it down. To see it clear, you can first say, okay, what's happening on the base manifold, right? The base manifold, when you bloat it down, it just goes to a half line. So there's zero to infinity, and small Z is the base point by zero. And this Z is also Y modular G. So you can think of this capital Y as attaching. As attaching orbital points to this half line. Okay, so now we blow this down. One thing is similar to the cylinder cases. Now the nearby orbital points, they get closer and closer to each other. So eventually they form something continuous. So here they form something continuous. So this is the limit of. So, this is the limit orbit at a point base point gy, and you also have this, at least you have a ray, right? Yeah, so that's it. Okay, so that's how capital Y looks like. It's homeomorphic to a half plan, right? But one different thing from the actual half plan, I mean, the standard half plan is the minimal geodesic from y to gy, it goes like this, okay? Because just like Just like it comes from a sequence blowing down sequence, right? So, on the sequence, you always have this minimal geodesic definite away from the entire orbit compared to, say, their distance. So, this feature is preserved in the limit. So, the minimal geodesic will go this way, right? So, this is very different from the cylinder case or the non-active. Cylinder case or the non-negative sectional curvature case, because in that case, the limit orbit is flat RK, it's right, it's an RK factor. So, minimal geodesics between two points on the orbit, they always stay in that orbit, while here it has to go away from then comes back. And you can actually get a more precise distance estimate on the singular points. So, here is. So here is you call this point one zero. You can assign a coordinate, you call the base point zero zero, and then you can attach a coordinate on that so that this B0 is so let's say being, but in general, you can take being R so that you have this So this is g y and this b zero is sorry g to the b y right because it's a biden so so you can yeah it's r so so this g to the b makes sense all right so for for any b in r this makes sense and then then you use the lens estimate that i mentioned before so it's comparable to Mentioned before, so it's comparable to that air to that power. Then you can show that the singular set for two points on a singular set, their distance between them is like b1 minus b2 to this power. All right, here's c1, c2 only depends on alpha. It's actually one, by the way. Yeah, I mean, c1 and c2, they're both one, actually. And yeah, as I mentioned, one feature here is this gy is not convex. Here is this gy is not convex, right? You take two points, the minimal geodesic goes away. In fact, any non-trivial curve in the orbit has infinite lengths. And also, because of this distance estimate, this limit orbit has hot stop dimension one plus two alpha. Okay, this is like if you define. define dxy so on r right you define dxy equals just square root of x minus y then the host of dimension of this d is actually two all right it's the similar story here because now we have this power so it gives you one plus two alpha a few more remarks so any point outside your orbit at the base point is actually too regular point is actually too regular and this asymptotic one is indeed unique so you so for different scaling you always end in the same space and this capital y is non-polar at base point so the first examples of these non-polar islandicons are constructed by mango so here it's non-polar because uh right it looks like this you have y you have gy and now you take this gy as the point uh outside Point outside, not a base point, you cannot draw a ray from Y to GY that going through GY. So there's no way you can extend this minimal geodesic while keeping it minimal. It just stops here. So you won't have rays going through G1. And so if we adjust this alpha to zero, To zero, very close to zero, then actually this limit space will be equivalent gram of host of close to the actual standard half-plan, where you have this splitting and goes as pure translation. Now, if this HR has logarithm decay or it goes to a positive constant, right? So you can view. Positive constant, right? So you can view these as say they are slower than any polynomial decay. So you expect that to be the standard half-plane, and actually it's true. So this log, if you take a logarithm decay, then the asymptotic cone will be the standard half-plane, and it will be polar, right? Standard half-plane is polar. And recall that it also has non-proper bootsman function because it goes. Non-proper bootsman function because it goes to zero. So if you use a W wall product with logarithm decay, then its universal covering will give you examples with positive rich curvature, unique polar s and Hardy const, but non-proper Bluesman functions. All right. Now, lastly, let me give a side note on how it looks like if you use waste construction. Waste construction where you have a new bottom group, right? So you take this Hessenberg three group, then you get this N, you get this almost flat matrix, blah, blah, then you have positive reach curvature. Anyway, so then you look at a universal covering and then blow it down, right? So it turns out that this capital G is the three-dimensional simply connected Hashenberg group, and you still have this feature that. And you still have this feature that the orbit is not convex. The minimal geodesic has to go out. And the center of this G, which is isomorphic to R, actually has host of dimension at least two. And this G, Y, this orbit has host of dimension at least four, respectively. And as a remark, you can also modify the metrics on the new portion ones so that this New pattern ones so that this limit group G is isomorphic to R3. So, right. So, the drawing is like: so, this is your ray direction, and this is your orbit. This is Y, this is GY. So, the minimal geodesic from here goes out. You have this feature, right? So, this is capital Y, Y, G. Okay. Okay. So, one thing I want to mention here is that this capital G could be isomorphic to R3 or could be the Hashenberg III group. In other words, the new potency structure in the fundamental group may not be preserved in the limited group, right? It may be the case that new potential ones just become subeduous ones. But a question is: maybe I don't have time for that, but okay, let me say a few words. Okay, let me say a few words. The question is: Suppose you have a finitely generated torsion-free newpoten group, and you call it newpoden lens air. So newpoten lens means C1G is G, right? C2G is the commodator group, and CKG is G with CK minus one G. C k minus one g right new pollen means uh four sound air plus one g is identity, right? So new pollency length is the smallest air such that this is true, right? So a Belium group has has C2G zero, so its New Potent lens is exactly one, right? So the question is, is it So, the question is: Is it true that for any equivariant asymmetry cone, this limit group must contain a closed R subgroup, but its host of dimension is at least air? So, recall that because we have these examples that the new potency group structure itself may not be preserved in the limit. So, this question somehow says it's possible that it's preserved in the metric sense, it's not preserved in the limit. Sense, it's not preserved in the groups sense. So, one may compare this to the so-called Carnot group, where you have this finite generated torsion-free new polyton group with new pollency lens air, or you can just take any virtually new polynomial because you can always find a subgroup with this torsion-free. Then, indolent with a word lens metric, then you bloat it down, then you. metric then you bloat it down then you got a so-called charlot group it has topological dimension as the rank of gamma it also has new policy lengths error but any r subgroup in this common c kg has hot soft dimension exactly k now in particular if you take the one in c airg has hot soft dimension error right so this question says if you have non-negative recipe curvature then Active reach curvature, then it's possible that this part has hostile dimension at least here. Okay, I'll stop here. Sorry for exceeding the time. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your talk. Are there any questions? I mean, if not, I think. I mean, if not, I think you said it in this last part of your talk, but can you tell us again about these polar spaces that don't satisfy that their Bozzmann function is proper? And if for these examples, the dimension starts at four right? Or do you have to choose a dimension bigger? Yeah, you have to choose a large dimension in that construction. So the examples come from taking age logarithmic? Sorry? I mean, do these examples, these polar examples with Bozeman function non-proper come from taking H that is with this logarithmic behavior, right? Yeah, it has this logarithm decay. So let me go to a previous slide, maybe this one. Maybe this one'll be this one. Okay, good. K is at least the like 15 or something. Yeah, and you also have to choose F. Okay, good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so if there are no more questions, let's thank the speaker. Yes, thanks for having me.
