And I realized I had done a bit of behavioral stuff. I'm going to take a sort of brief tour through a few models. It's essentially going to be the pendant of what Ian started with. So we're going to close modeling a bit the same way by going through a few models. These are models I've worked on. I don't think they're good. I mean, not a men, I don't think they're particularly good or anything like this. It's just that I think they. This. It's just, but I think they illustrate different ways of modeling behavioral stuff. So, okay, and yes, I'll mention, as others have done, that I work on Treaty One land and the homeland of a Mete Nation. So, the importance here. So, what I'm going to do is show you three types of, yes, this is Gemini. Gemini. I asked Google to generate images for my sites. So I'm going to go over three different slightly different types of ways of incorporating behavioral change. So the first one is essentially avoid contacts. The second one is a model that's very dear to me. I'll explain why. And the third one is a spatial model. So, in terms of avoiding contacts, I'm going to show you three ways of doing it. One is to educate susceptible individuals. The second one, I'll say, corresponds to the idea that it's actually something that Jane mentioned, oh very well, that Jane mentioned in her talk when she was showing you how they had looked at these newspapers articles and how she had this curve in there. And the third one is going to be explained. Third one is going to be explicitly released contact. So, as I said, I'll go quickly. So, that one is actually recent-ish. It's work I did with some colleagues in Morocco about behavior change during COVID. And I think that represents the simplest possible way in a model to incorporate some sort of behavior change, effect of behavior change in a way, which is to say, In a way, which is to say, well, there is some sort of awareness about the disease presence, and that awareness triggers a change from being susceptible to being an educated individual about the disease propagation and so on. And what that does is that reduces the rate at which you become infected. Okay, so there is an explicit movement. There is an explicit movement of individuals from being in one compartment to being in another compartment, and that movement is triggered by a function that I'll show you in a second. And the idea, yes, is essentially I'm parking people away in this compartment in which they are less likely to become infected. So by educating them, I'm moving them somewhere else. You'll notice that the model is a bit naive. I mean, we're using it over a short time period. Using it over a short time period, people don't forget, and I'll come to that in a moment. So, the overall idea is this awareness builds up, and as you become aware, you tend to move here. Awareness, which I'll pontify for the French people here, which is the rate of Jean-Claude Panda Misasser. So, if you don't understand, I'll explain, but not here. So, yeah, just to say, he popularized. Just to say, he popularized the word aware, British word aware in French, not for the good reason. But, okay, this is a function that as a function of awareness moves you from the S compartment into the E compartment where you are less susceptible. So that's one consequence of education. Another one is a paper I did years ago with Ken Cook put in London. With Ken Cook, Pauline van den Grish, and Jori Pelasco Hernandez. And we looked at something with a leaky vaccine. And I'll just say why this is awareness, I mean, education. I was at a conference in 2003, but it takes me a bit. I presented my thing as someone in the audience, when I presented my model, and that person might be Herstewig or Odo Dickman, said, Julian, this is very nice. Julien, this is very nice, but you're presenting a model where you're vaccinating against a disease in which you assume that there is absolutely no immunity. What type of vaccination are you thinking of? So, as I did often when I was working with Pauline at the time, I went back to consult with Pauline and we said, okay, let's rethink the model. And we thought, oh, education. So, although we still have published it with vaccination, the model is for education. Vaccination, the model is for education. So it's the same idea as the one I was just showing you. The idea is that I have some susceptibles through vaccination of sorts, I move them to the educated class where they are less likely to contract the disease. The thing is, compared to what Jane was showing, we have an arbitrary distribution of times spent here before moving back into the susceptible compartment. So people forget. So, people forget, and we assume that they can forget in a very complex way. And just to show you, that's the only complex equation I'll show, that's what the model looks like. So it's an integral differential equation that you can transform into a delay integral differential equation. It's a big mess, but it's a cool model because if you have data like Jane was presenting, you can try to parametrize your function, your forgetfulness function. Third one is actually my function. Third one is actually my first facial model that I published with a former postdoc of mine. And here, what we thought is: okay, let's use another type of, so let's look at a spatial context. A spatial context doesn't play a big role here, but let's make it spatial. I don't cover spatial stuff. And the idea is that the infection happens in both locations. So we have two locations, people moving back and forth between locations. 43 locations. And the important thing here: there's that function beta of i, which is essentially being aware of the presence of the disease. That awareness lowers your probability of transmitting the disease. And the function we use is simply negative exponential. Okay, so that was a paper that originally in the single population case it was wiping through, and we use that. And I point out this was very That and I'll point out this was very weird because I started doing things for the public health agency of Canada after I did the spatial work with them. I went into other stuff and we started fitting things with that function and it worked surprisingly well. I was in a sort of not very active periods of spread of a disease. I was working. Okay, I'm not a big fitting person, so I was surprised. Now, this is here. We're all going to. Now, this is the, we're all going to diving. So, if you know Ten Ten, this is actually the motivation for that model, is that guy, okay? So, let me show you how that works. The idea here is that I switch depending on where I am in my disease prevalence. So, as the prevalence changes, the model switches. So, those models, those two cases that I'm showing you are not really the ones I wanted to show you. The one I want to show you is the one that's more. Want to show you is the one that's motivated by this type of thing, which is when things go bad, people panic. And I mean, it's been shown. I mean, this is a description of the plague of Athens. And there's a description of the fact that social order sort of disintegrates, and people start to say, Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well enjoy my time before I die. And that's been remarked in other contexts, like during the plagues and etc., that happened as well at the beginning. That happened as well at the beginning of the HIV epidemic in the mid-80s, etc. That was also something like high-risk behaviors were more frequent in some populations, not everywhere. And that's an interesting situation because in the model that gives you something like this, I'm going to have my solution living in SI space, and then when it gets to some prevalence level, it switches. For example, from a From a proportional incidence to my section. This, unfortunately, I wasn't able to publish. I'm still playing with it from time to time. This is a Philippov-type solution. Okay, you have a complete discontinuity in your vector field. This leads to very, very funky solutions, even in such a simple model. And the last one I'll show you is: you shouldn't go there. So, this is the pendant of the first one where I was showing you what happened. One where I was showing you what happens when you sort of repress contact within patches. So, here we asked ourselves what happens if it's actually knowledge about the infection somewhere that changes your behavior in terms of going there. So, the idea here I have a normal nonlinearity here, but I have a non-linearity in the movement rates, where you tend to reduce your travel to a location. Reduce your travel to a location if you know. So, for example, if I'm following this arrow, I am going to reduce my travel if I'm aware of the incidence being high, the prevalence being high in the location to which I'm going. We actually tried the other way around, flee, but it wasn't much more interesting. So, this is five ways of doing this. I'll just conclude by saying Pigro phenomenal. Okay, I'm not describing the mechanistic aspects. There are words that French can't say in English. So I'm not describing the mechanistic aspects. And I think it's important to do a bit of everything. I actually came here. One of the main reasons is to learn more about how to get more into the details of the mechanistic descriptions of this. But I would claim that it's also. I would claim that it's often a good thing to do, also, having a phenomenon of description works okay. And the other thing is, this is just a rule for the modelers here. If you haven't tried that, there's a very, very frustrating thing with some of the models I showed you. So, for example, if I take this object here, when you're formulating a model like this, you're very happy. Oh, look at this, I have this. Look at this. I have this dependence here on this term. You compute your disease-free, you want to compute your R0. So, what do you do? You take your disease-free equilibrium, you plug it in there, and all these terms disappear. Okay? So, and that's the same with that exponential minus ki. So, essentially, you're formulating a model, you're all happy, you talk to your collaborator, and you say, look at this new effect on all the so all your So, all you can do is look at the more complex aspect, and that thing is a mess to study. So, that's it.
