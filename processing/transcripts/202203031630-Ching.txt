Thank you. I would like to first thank the organizers for the invitation. I am Emily Cheng at the Department of Physics of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. So this work was done together with my students, two students, and Ogre Susanna's group in Max Prime Institute. And so we are interested in understanding buoyancy turbulent thermal convection in a class of buoyancy different. In a class of buoyancy different turbulent flows. And one of the most extensively studied paradigm of such flow is radio binar convection. So radio convection is convection in the fluid confined between particular two horizontal plates. The bottom is being heated and the top is cooled. And for such a system, there are two control parameters, the weight number defined here and the printer number. Defined here and the Prandtl number. So we number measures the amount of forcing by the temperature difference, and Prandtl is the ratio of these diversivities, the kinematic viscosity and thermal diversity. So a long-standing challenge is to understand how heat flux, as measured by the Mussel number, depends on these control parameters, the Rayleigh and Parental. So there was a scaling theory developed. A scaling theory developed by Grossman and Losset quite some years ago. And the theory has got results that has been these results have been shown to be able to describe both experimental and numerical results using prefactors that are obtained from experiments. But in their theory, they make use of two results of the classical Prandtl classes Powhausen bound-layer theory. In particular, one result is Particular, one result is the velocity boundary layer fitness being universally related to the square root of Reynolds, and the other is this scaling dependence of its Nussel number on the Reynolds and Pento in the two limits, low and high pental limit. And we know that this classical boundary layer theory is for steady flow and the fluid motion is force and also the horizontal velocity component will approach it. Velocity component approaches a constant far away from the boundary. In contrast, in very binary convection, terminal convection, we know very well the boundary layer flow is actually fluctuating and fluid motion arises from buoyancy. And also the horizontal component of this large-scale circulation will vanish far away from the boundaries. So it's pretty clear that this classical view shouldn't be directly applicable. Be directly applicable. And a few years ago, people tried to understand whether this classical boundary of Euro indeed can give you results for the total connection. So they compare the look at the mean temperature profiles. And I'm showing you here that these results, the symbols are from direct numerical simulations. So there are two sets of So there are two sets of results. One with open symbols, therefore Prento equals to 4.38. And the other set is for closed symbols is for this Prento, 25547.9. So and I'm showing you here this dotted and long dashed lines, which are actually here. They both, we cannot distinguish them. They are the results obtained from the classical theory, I call them PDP. The according PPP, Prento classes perhaps theory for these two values of Prento. So you can see clear deviation from the DNS results. So it is quite clear that this classical theory cannot describe the mean temperature profiles. So we, well, it all is quite, so we need a boundary layer theory for turbulent thermal convection and that takes into account various defects that I mentioned, the fluctuations, the fact that the horizontal Uh, the fact that the horizontal component of the velocity will vanish far away from the plate. And with such a theory, we hope that to be able to get from this theory the results for turbulent heat transport and also the details of such abundant layer profiles. And in the past few years, we have been working on this. So, in our theory, we start from using the Bosnicox approximation. In this approximation, the governing equations for this. The governing equations for this system is given here. So there's a buoyancy time in the velocity equation, and the velocity satisfies the incompressible. Well, this is the not continuity equation, it's a divergence rate because it's under this approximation. Then we take this approximation. This is classic 2D, so we just focus on x will be along the plate and z will be perpendicular to the plate. set will be perpendicular to the plate and the velocity field will have two components horizontal and vertical and make use of the Reynolds decomposition and write each of the quantity of interest each of the fields of interest as a sum of the average over time and the fluctuation and then we also make use of the usual boundary layer approximation such that that is the variations along the plate would be less Along the plate will be less than the rotations perpendicular to the plate, the rate of change. And so we make use of this, and then we'll get the these are the boundary layer equations. And you see here that the buoyancy term is balanced by the vertical radiant of the pressure. So this balance can allow us to estimate the pressure, which is of this order, with dimensionless. Of dimensionless number b times density and vote u squared. And this b is can be obtained as this: this relay divided by two pental venous. So five halves. So we looking at the, we have a direct numerical simulation data of this B as a function of for different planto and also different radar. So you see here that here that this B for a fixed Prandtl it will decrease as Rayleigh increases and and for if well it also increases as Prandtl increases so from here there are two different cases we can consider the first one is this B is X larger than equal to one such that this horizontal pressure gradient in the this velocity field here is significant. Is significant. And the other case will be this B is much, much less than one, and so that term is negligible. And in that sense, the buoyancy does not directly appear in the boundary layer equations, but it will be manipulated via the boundary condition of the velocity. So from this results of the obtained from the DNS, the direct lineman simulations, we also see that for a fluid with any fixed plant hole, then if we get to then if we get to sufficiently high relay then this b will be decreased to below one and so this case two will be reached for any planto at sufficiently large relay so we'll get that to that point later and to continue we we introduce a string function to take care of the continuity equation and then for the fluctuations so there are two terms in the equations one is this correlation between the One is this correlation between the velocity fluctuations, and the other is this velocity and thermal fluctuations. So, we use the eddy viscosity and eddy thermal diffusivity to study these fluctuations. But these eddy viscosities and eddy thermal diffusivities, they are position dependent. They depend on position. And then we look for similarity or self-similar solutions, as usual, and defining the similarity variable. Similarity available generally depends on Rayleigh and Prandtl, like this, and this string function: there's a dimensional string function, the pressure, and also the temperature. And we obtain results like this. And in particular, there are this term, this buoyancy term, and it will be there. That is, this HB will equals to one for the case one, B is much, much larger, is larger, much sweeter than or equals to one. Much sweeter than or equals to one. So that's the case when the horizontal pressure gradient is relevant in the equation. And the other case will be this B much less than one case two. That term will not be there. And the boundary condition is a useful one. The velocity is no slip on two plates and the temperature is by this fixed temperature with a difference from top and far wave, from the bottom plate and far wave. And so to continue, we see. And so to continue, we see that to get the profiles actually for the case of the large pental that we can do some simplification. So in this large pental limit, the fermobundo layer is nested within the viscous bundle layer. So within the fermobound layer, we can sort of approximate the velocity, the mean velocity to be linear. And so the stream function will be quadratic. stream function will be quadratic and also you can expand the adi-fermo diversificity in the equation and well you look at the definition and do the work and then you see that it is the first non-zero term will be cubic and they actually check the dns data you see that for this particular relay the this cubic dependence uh work rather well up to a large part of the boundary layer so we keep The boundary layer. So if we keep these two approximations, we can just focus on the thermal boundary layer equation and get the results for the temperature profile. So that's the details. And then you can work out or solve this equation and get this is the result, but it will be in terms of the gradient at the plate. And this temperature gradient at the plate is exactly related to the Nussley number, the heat transfer. And here, And here, besides this gradient at the plate, there's also seemingly two parameters, but they are not independent. They are related because by fixed by this boundary conditions far away from the plate. So to know details, we need to this failure, the temperature gradient at the plate obviously depends on the velocity. So we will need also the velocity equation. But if you just want to know the profile, particularly the shape. Profile, take the shape, and we can look at the normal normal as temperature boundary layer profile by rescaling divide take out this temperature gradient term such that the profile has a gradient one with this normalized units, and that will be the analytical expression for such profiles. And there's the one independent parameter. So the DNS data show that for this pental number, the 4.38 showed this two. The 4.38 that I showed, these two pental numbers that I showed before, for one, for the pental for 4.38, this A is approximately this value or the corresponding B, but B and A are related by this boundary layer, boundary conditions far away from the plate. So B is approximately one and B is approximately two. And it turns out that for just such values of B equals to one or two, this expression can be analytically obtained. This can be solved in an integral. And so we obtained these analytical expressions. Obtained these analytical expressions for the temperature, the normalized temperature profiles, and then we can directly compare with the DNS results. So, that's the same figure I showed before, but now I tell you more details. So, this dashed line, this black dashed line here and the solid line there, showing expanded u here, this dashed line and solid line, they are the corresponding theoretical results from the expressions I just showed you. And you can see they agree with the DNS data pretty well. With the DNS data pretty well. And you also see that again the deviation from the classical result. Okay, so that's for the large planto, we are able to get the normalized signature profiles and they are in good agreement with DNS. But of course, we've also input of this B from the DNS. But to get a results for a general parental, so we go back to the set of equations, the boundary layer equations, in the in the similarity with the similarity variable. With the similarity variable. And you see that we need to take care of this eddy thermodynamic and also the eddy viscosity. So there is this kosher problem. We need to close the equations. And so we need to find a suitable kosher to do that in order to proceed. And we make use of Prandtl's mixing length ideas to write the fluctuations in terms of the gradient as before mixing length, L V and L theta. And then we need a place. And then we near the plate, we estimate the maximum lengths to be proportional to the distance from the plate. And so you see that these two eddy viscosity and thermal difficulty, they will be proportional. Well, if you take the grade, take the derivative with respect to the similarity variable, proportional to the dimensional stream function. And so we just make this, well, this suggests to us that these two derivatives, well, the derivatives of Derivatives well, the derivatives of these two LD viscosity and thermal viscosity with respect to this similarity level is proportional to the dimensional string function. So we propose this coarser model with both of them being proportional to the primitive function, the integral of the string function. And there's this constants k1 and k2, they are positive and they measure the size of fluctuations. Size of fluctuations, these eddy viscosities and thermodynamic measured fluctuations. So, we use this kosher to, well, and also we first check the kosher approximation for this particular set of results using a DNS. And so we calculate the correlation and compare it with the quotient. And we see that its agreement is pretty well up to a certain value of C. And using that, we're able to derive two cold sets of equations for the two cases: the one case for the horizontal pressure gradient being significant. And in that case, because this term is significant, then the buoyancy term is directly in the equations. And using that, we can actually get the dependence on the Rayleigh and Panto directly there. So A and B are the corresponding scaling. Corresponding scaling exponent for that. And so that's the equations and the boundary conditions. And we also can get the equations, the set of equations, which are close for the other case when the horizontal pressure gradient is negligible. In that case, requiring the velocity component field to be well behaved far away from the plate. And we also have set the condition of the CSV related to K1 this parameter for measuring the size of fluctuation in the eddy. Size of fluctuation in the eddy viscosity. So we have these two sets of equations, they're close, well, up to this constants, k1, k2, and then we're able to use them, well, solve them numerically to get the two the profiles, the velocity and the temperature boundary layer profiles. And we have done that for to try to compare DNS result. So this is the case for Printer being 0.1. is the case for Parental being 0.1 and ray value at this 10 to 8. And from this DNS you can get the this parameter b the value for this parameter b and this is 0.082 which is much less than one and so this belongs to this case two. So we solve the boundary layer equations numerically I just the set of equations I just showed you for this case two. And then we try to change the values of k1 and k2 to get the best fit. So you see here that we Get the best fit. So, you see here that using these values of k1 and k2, we have been able to fit the DNS data pretty well. So, they again we get our equations we obtain can get the agreement with this DNS results. And they are again deviate from this dashed line, which are the classical the result from classical PPP, the pentoplasmic power symbol. And then, so we have And then with the boundary layer equations we obtained, we are able to get the profiles up to the K1K2. And then the next thing we want to pursue will be to use the theory to get results of the scaling results for Nussel, Nussu, and Reynolds, etc. So using the theory, we're able to get the expression. Nussul will be the dimensionless heat transfer. So it's given like this. And use the theory, you'll get the expressions that is related to. Get the expressions that is related to the gradient of the dimensionless temperature at the plate. And we define the okay, we can also get the velocity boundary layer thickness. We define it as by the distance that this velocity approach has a maximum value. The distance from the distance from the this maximum value from the plate is the velocity boundary layer thickness. And then the Reynolds number is defined using the maximum value of this horizontal. In the maximum value of this horizontal component of the velocity field. So it is zero in that boundary, horizontal boundary, and then it moves increases up to a maximum and then decays to zero far away from the plane. So that's the expression, but you see here that the expression depends on all these results of the profile, the temperature gradient at the plate. This is related to this dimensional string function at the maximum. Dimensional string function at the maximum value. So, we all this should be able to obtain from the equations and they depend on the parental and all this and all this and these two parameters k1, k2. And now we focus on case two because we're interested in the scaling in this high pantomime, a high radiant invert. So we focus on case two and using the equation. Using the equations for case two, in this case, we're actually able to derive analytical results for the relevant quantities. So, using this analytical results, we're able to get analytical expressions for the velocity profile. This is complicated looking expression, but they are all can be calculated. So, we check this expression obtained analytically from the equation with the numerical result obtained by numerical result obtained by solving the equations numerically. So I'm showing you here the expression for this velocity boundary and thickness. Symbols from the simulations and the lines, sort of lines from this expression. So it's this good agreement. And we also can get results for the Nussel where we can look at the equation for the temperature, boundary from temperature boundary layer equation. We can solve this gradient at the plate and it's related to this dimensional string function. Uh, dimensional string function this way. So we look at these two limits: the high parental limit. And in this case, because we're interested in this b less than one, so for high parental, the way to approach this limit will be you need also high Rayleigh. So this is the high Rayleigh, high Prandtl limit. And in this limit, it's the same idea that the velocity, the thermal boundary of the layer is nested within the velocity boundary layer. So we can make this approximation for the velocity field and we can get the expression. And we can get expression result for the temperature gradient. So we can get a result for the Nussel in terms, and we see that the Nussel will be related to Reynolds and Panto in this manner. And as you may recall, it's actually the same as the dependence is the same as in the classical result. And we check the analytical expressions with the numerical results obtained directly from BISOF. Results obtained directly from by solving the equations, the boundary layer equations. So, symbols are from this numerical calculation, and the lines are from this expression. Okay, so there's good agreement. And we continue to look at the low Prandtl limit, this low parental limit. And in this limit, the DNS results show that this turbulent Prandtl number actually gets decreased as Prandtl increases. And the data shown here, the blue. And the data shown here, the blue one are for the Rayleigh 10 to 8, and this red one is for Rayleigh 10 to 7. So, this suggests to us that in this limit, in this low Prandtl limit, because this turbulent Prandtl number can be written in terms of this K2, K1 in this manner. And so that suggests to us that in this limit, K2 approaches zero and K1 will approach the maximum allowed value for the K1, which is two. And so we work out the velocity at the And so we work out the velocity temperature gradient in this limit, and we're able to get that the dependence of Lussel, which is it approaches Reynolds one half point one half and one over square root pi. So we also check that disagree with the results directly obtained by solving the boundary layer equations numerically. So combining the results, you see here that we get results using the boundary layer equations, we're able to get expressions or analytical results for LUSO in the two limbs. Results for LUSO in the two limbs. And interestingly, we see this resemblance of such dependence on Reynolds and Prandtl with the results obtained by the classical Prandtl-Barcels Poles and theory. So the dependence on Reynolds and Prandtl, they are exactly the same. But this is a non-trivial resemblance. We worked it throughout using the boundary layer equations that take into account fluctuations, buoyancy, and also the correct boundary. volunteer and also the correct boundary condition for the velocity field velocity horizontal velocity component but we we see that there is a resemblance and this non-trivial resemblance thus solves the puzzle why you know this apparently this ppp results can be applicable in the scaling theory of developed by gosson and losset so the dependence is valid not because this classical theory is is valid it's because even if we would consider all Even if we would consider all the factors, relevant factors, feasible factors, the dependence is the same. Okay, so I'm not sure what. Okay, then we can also directly compare the pre-free predictions from the fury with the DNS results. So here I'm showing the LUSO as well, the dependence on Pranto, on looking at the dependence on Pranto. On looking at the dependence on Pranto, because you see here this goes like Reynolds one half, but different plantal dependents. So for Prento, much less than one, I should point here, it will be one half, parental one half. And for the rather limit, parental large limit, so it will be one third. So you see here for low parental, this line is one half, parental one half. So you see this is a good agreement with the dependence. With the dependence. And when we increase pental, we remember we are still in, we need to be in this B much less than one limit. So all the blue symbols will obey this B much less than one. And the other symbols, this will be about one and this will be greater than one. So as long as we remain in this case two, and if you move towards high parental, then you see that there's a trend of the data move towards the other dependence. Towards the other dependents, this parental one third dependence. Well, for these other, because these are out of this case two, it's not the case to case two, so we cannot really check it directly. So for this friendal, we have to go to even higher relay in order to get to the case two. Okay, so I guess I pretty finished what I wanted to tell you. So let me summarize. So we have Let me summarize. So, we have developed this set of this bundle layer theory for turbulent radio green arc convection, or more generally, this buoyancy different turbulent flow above the horizontal plane, taking into account all the relevant physics fluctuations, the buoyancy, and also the correct boundary condition for the velocity component far away from the horizontal velocity component far away from the plate. And we from this close. From this close set of equations we obtained, we are able to, if we solve them remotely, we are able to get the profiles and then for any parental and then different relays of different values of k1 k2. And for the cage of high relay, sorry, high parental, we are able to get approximation and get analytical expressions for the temperature profile and be able to DNS. And for case two, which is the case that will be reached for eddy parental at high, sufficiently high The parental at high, sufficiently high relay, and we have derived analytical results for the scaling dependences of muscle on vanilla and pantal. And in both the high relay and low, in both the high pantal and low pental limus, and this scaling behavior has been found to have a close resemblance with the scaling of in derived in obtained from the classical theory. Theory. And so it actually solves this puzzle why such dependence are valid in Kalburin radio connection. Okay, with that, I thank you for your attention. Great. Thank you very much, Emily. Hit the clap emoji. Okay. Great. So
