Involved with this fantastic workshop and for inviting me. So, what I'll be talking about today is the numerical characterization and control of visco elastic instabilities through chorus medium. So, with that being said, my talk will mainly focus on two main aspects of the tail end of my PhD work last year, which are two recently published works. So, in the first part of my talk, I'll really be looking at the numerical simulation and viscal acid instabilities through different products. Viscolo acidic instabilities through different porous media geometries. And then the second part, I'll be looking at how these viscosity instabilities can potentially be used for some practical applications through chorus media as well. And before I go any further, I'd like to thank some of my main collaborators. So Professor Emily Seray from the Queensland University of Technology, who unfortunately, or in my case fortunately, couldn't make it here today, which is why I'm here instead. Here instead, and then also Dr. Christopher Soriano from the University of Manchester. Okay. So just quickly, a background on viscoelastic fluids. I'm sure most of you are well familiar with these types of fluids, but in case you're not, they're a special type of non-Newtonian fluid with both viscous and elastic material properties. I guess the main takeaway from this slide is that they're not solely or specifically. They're not solely or specifically encountered in complex laboratory environments and settings. We can encounter them in our everyday life. They're really ubiquitous. Some examples that I've highlighted here on the right are just some biofluid examples where we have blood, DNA, suppliva, mucus. So the real takeaway is that viscoelastic fluids are quite ubiquitous. And one of the many interesting aspects of these viscoelastic fluids is that they can. These viscoelastic fluids is that they can actually transition into complex nonlinear instabilities. And to understand how this occurs, let's just simplify the polymers as two beads connected by a spring, so the classic dumbbell model. So what happens at relatively low elastic effects, which we can characterize by the dimensionless Weisenberg number? Well, these polymers stretch, then they relax back gradually towards their initial equilibrium state. But what happens when these Weisenbergs? States, but what happens when these Weisenberg numbers increase? Well, they stretch so much so that they overcome something called a stretch transition. To put it simply, they produce really large elastic stresses and transition into these complex visceral elastic instabilities. And one of the interesting aspects of these instabilities is that they can occur in the inertialist regime as well, at very, very small Reynolds numbers. And they can produce very similar features as traditional inertial turbulence. Features as traditional inertial turbulence, such as increased mixing, really large flow fluctuations characterized by a broadband spectrum, but they're triggered by purely elastic effects and not by inertial effects such as traditional inertial turbulence. So why is it important to look at these inertialist viscoelastic instabilities? Professor Adekani might have mentioned some of these in her previous talk, but just quickly, it can produce increased It can produce increased mixing capabilities for microfluidic applications. In terms of porous media, we can have potentially enhanced oil recovery processes. And I should quickly mention that the idea of using polymers for enhanced oil recovery is not a new idea. We already have had polymer flooding for many, many years, which involves injecting some polymers to increase the viscosity of the displacing fluid, which creates a more stable displacement process. Stable displacement process, but recent investigations have looked at whether or not these inertialist viscoelastic instabilities and elastic turbulence can further aid and promote enhance oil recovery as well. So naturally, a lot of previous work has been done to investigate how these visco-elastic instabilities behave through porous media. We have a look at the simple geometry of a single cylinder. And although the geometry is relatively simple, The geometry is relatively simple. The flow behavior becomes not so simple and chaotic as the elastic effects increase, which transition into elastic turbulence. Recent studies have also extended this work into 2D pore arrays, where they've shown that the general arrangement and formation of the cylindrical pore obstacles can strongly impact the behavior of these inertial elastic instabilities. Instabilities and specifically the front and rear stagnation points of the cylindrical obstacles are what really control these viscoelastic instabilities. But what happens in other types of pore geometry such as 1D pore arrays where we have these continual contraction expansion regions as well as these dead end regions in the cavities which are typically encountered in complex polar networks. Poor networks. So, initial studies looking at these types of geometries at the low to moderate elastic regime have really found that the flow behavior deviates from the cutaneous flow behavior. So in the top right, I'm showing you the velocity streamlines. In the bottom right, I'm showing you the corresponding polymer trace fields and where the polymers are being stretched. And you can see as the Weisenberg number is increasing, we deviate away from the symmetrical flow patterns and start to Flow patterns and start to transition to flow asymmetry as well as the build-up of secondary autices in the cavity regions, and that's because the polymers are starting to stretch quite a lot. And we also see, in terms of the apparent relative viscosity, which looks at the resistance of the flow, moderate Weisenberg numbers, we see strong shear thinning effects, and then a transition into a shear thickening regime at a critical Deborah number. Not bad. What happens at even larger elastic effects? Well, Professor Arakani mentioned this. We transition into a complex multistability phenomenon where large polymer stresses induce a dynamic transition state in each of these neighboring pores where the flow behavior transitions from eddy-dominant to eddy-free states in these pore cavities over time as well. And because of the complex nature of this problem, Nature of this problem. No one has really looked at how the geometry can impact this type of instability. And that brings me to the first work I want to highlight, where we look at this 1D core array for the classic symmetrical, I'll call it the ideal core geometry here, highlighted here on the left. But we also induce some asymmetry in the pore geometry as well, which I'll refer to as the asymmetrical non-ideal pore geometry. Refer to as the asymmetrical non-ideal core geometries here. We characterize the geometry asymmetry based on the R hat parameter here, which is simply just the radii ratio R1 divided by R2. And you can see as we increase the asymmetry, we have varying levels of porosity. We also have varying levels of confinement and streamlined curvature as well. In terms of setting up this problem, we use periodic boundary conditions. Problem. We use periodic boundary conditions and to streamline x direction. We use two characteristic unit cells. I'll explain in a second why we've done that. We also use mostly boundary conditions in this problem. In terms of the dimensions parameters, Reynolds number is very, very small. We control the Weisenberg number to be very large. And we have a relatively concentrated polymer solution. And just quickly, before moving on to the results, just the numerical method. Just the numerical method and the description for the polymer field. We use the FENED model, which is a simple extension to the Old Roy B model, which imposes finite extensibility as well as certain shear thinning properties. We evolve this confirmation tensor C tensor here, which is a RENC2 tensor describing the average molecular orientation of these polymers or these dumbbells. And once we solve for this RENC2 tensor, we can relate it back to. So we can relate it back to the elastic stress, which we couple back onto the right-hand side of our quantum Navier-Stokes equations. In terms of the hydrodynamics, we don't solve the Navier-Stokes directly, but instead we solve it based on a different type of approach based on kinetic theory. We use the Lattice-Oldson method, LBM for short. Put simply, it just simply describes the collective behavior of particle groups through distribution functions at i. Distribution functions at i. The particle velocities are discretized on these 2D lattice structures, and the algorithm is relatively simple and straightforward. We have this initial collision steps where particles collide and relax towards an equilibrium, and then they screen to their nearest, latest neighbors. So, I won't go into too much detail about this because this isn't the focus of the workshop. But if you do have any questions, just let me know either after the talk or during any one of the lunch. During any one of the lunch breaks. But to summarize, we have this decoupled approach where we solve the elastic stress velocity field and both solvers rely one another. All right, and just quickly, some additional numerical considerations for anyone in the audience who does want to run some numerical simulations of viscous elastic fluids at high elastic effects. These are just some of the tips I would recommend from my own experience. Instead of solving the confirmation temperature, Of solving the confirmation tensor directly, you should instead rely on a decomposition approach to solve. Yeah, so instead of solving the rank 2 confirmation tensor directly, use a decomposition approach. We use the Cholsky logarithmic decomposition. So the reason why we do that is to preserve the symmetric positive definite qualities of the confirmation tensor, otherwise, your simulation will blow up. And an additional numerical tool you can An additional numerical tool you can use is implementing artificial diffusivity to your polymer model on the right-hand side. Essentially, what it does is it induces some diffusion to your steep polymer stress gradient terms. So, in regions where you have these steep stress gradients, they can be problematic for numerical solver. Including this additional term tends to smear out these steep stress gradients, but it can unphysically induce diffusion, so if there is a trade-off between So, if there is a trade-off between how much you should use, if there is a scenario where you can run the simulations without using this term, you shouldn't use it at all. But there are many times when you can't get away with not using this diffusion term. And then finally, where you use periodic boundary conditions, like in most of my problems, I've noticed, or in my previous work that I published, I've seen for simulations of elastic turbulence, if you use limited levels of periodicity. Limited levels of periodicity or insufficient characteristic unit cells, then that can also create numerical artifacts and create unphysical flow behavior as well. And we see this for our recent simulations of porous media as well, where limited periodicity tends to laminarize the flow problem and create unphysical flow behavior as well. So, in saying that, let's look at some of the initial results for the three different. Some of the initial results for the three different board geometries. So, what I'm showing you here are the velocity streamlines and the corresponding polymer trace fields for the three geometries at the different Weisenberg numbers, relatively low to moderate Weisenberg numbers. So, for low Weisenberg numbers, you can see that the velocity streamlines correspond mostly like the Newtonian case, where we have these symmetrical streamlines because we don't really have too much polymer stretching occurring. Polymer stretching occurring. As we increase the Weisenberg number, we start to see the buildup of secondary vortices in the cavity regions. And then, if we increase the Weisenberg number even more, we see asymmetry developing in the cavity regions for all three pore geometries as well, which directly aligns with previous studies as well for the symmetrical pore geometry. We also characterize the problem based on the apparent relative viscosity. The apparent relative viscosity, which we calculate based on a general Darcy's expression. And what we see for all three four geometries, moderate Weisenberg number effects, we see strong shear thinning behavior before an eventual transition into a shear thickening flow behavior for only the symmetrical core geometry. So the reason why this occurs, this sudden increase in the apparent relative viscosity at high Weisenberg numbers. High Weisenberg numbers is due to the growing vertex or vortex size in the cavity regions. And we don't see this for the other two asymmetrical pore geometries because of the larger contraction to expansion ratio for the symmetrical case. We would see it for the other two geometries if we just kept increasing the Weisenberg number. It's just slightly delayed. Okay, so then what happens when we increase the elastic effects even further? The elastic effects even further, well, we transition into that multi-stability phenomenon where in the cavity regions we have these eddy-dominant and eddy-free states occurring over time. When we look at the velocity streamlines here across different instances in time, we see a transition into three distinct flow states, where in the early stages we have the steady symmetrical case before transitioning into the steady asymmetrical case where we move. Asymmetrical case where we lose the symmetry in the cavity regions, and then finally, the flow transitions into the unsteady and asymmetrical fully developed multistability phenomenon. And what's interesting to note here is that these three distinct flow states occur for all three geometries, but the time it takes to transition into this behavior becomes faster and faster as we increase the asymmetry in the core geometries. Not only this, Not only this, but when we look at the flow fluctuations in each of these geometries as well, we see that the pore freight fluctuations oscillate at a much higher frequency for the most asymmetrical for geometry. And also, when we look at the RMS velocity fluctuations through these different geometries, we see more intense fluctuations as more and more intense fluctuations as we increase the asymmetry in the core geometry. So, why is this occurring? So, our initial attempt at characterizing why this is occurring, we look at the flow type parameter, which Professor Adikanji already explained. So, on the left-hand side here, I'm showing you the initial contour plots of the flow type parameter, as well as the late-stage flow type parameter. We can see for all three geometries, we start to have more and more mixed flow kinematics occurring. On the right-hand side, we can see the topology. On the right-hand side, we can see the topology count in these corresponding late stages of the flow, where for the most asymmetrical case, we see that it's mostly still elongation or dominant. But as we increase the asymmetry in the pore geometry, as the pore geometry becomes more and more confined, we see more and more mixed flow kinematics and starts to become even more shear dominant. This makes sense as the pore geometry becomes more confined. And I should mention, based on previous experiments, Mentioned based on previous experimental work of elastic turbulence in a single pore contraption, the transition into elastic turbulence was characterized as having more and more mixed flow dynamics as well, as well as a build-up of the normal stress difference, which we calculate here as well, based on the different flow kinematics for the three geometries. So, what we see is that the normal stress difference is actually largest for the most asymmetrical pore geometry, and it tends to occur in Geometry and it tends to occur in the shear-dominant regions as well. We also look at the Pachda-McKinley parameter. So, for anyone in the audience who's not familiar with this term, it simply provides a general elastic instability criterion based on some of the fundamental key elements that drive these purely elastic instabilities, namely just the streamlined curvature. So, what we see in our three different geometries are the same flow conditions. Are the same flow conditions? Is that this Pachdel-McKinley parameter is maximum for the most asymmetrical case as well? And we also see more instances or regions throughout the flow that have a relatively high value as well. So when we look at the individual contributions of this Pachdahl-McKinley parameter and break it down, what we see essentially is that these viscoelastic instabilities become stronger and stronger as the asymmetry in the pore geometry. Asymmetry in the poor geometry increases due to an increase in normal stress contribution arising from more confinement in the geometry, as well as a higher streamline curvature as well. Okay, so having said that, I would just now quickly like to move on to the second part of my talk, which focuses, I guess, a bit more about the practical side of things with these mystical elastic instabilities through porous. Viscal elastic instabilities through porous media. So, just to quickly reiterate, polymer flooding techniques just purely rely on increasing the viscosity ratio through enhanced oil recovery processes in forest media. But currently, previous experimental and numerical studies highlight the potential for additional displacement or mobilization in EOL practices based on risk or less instability. So, for instance, experimental work has shown that resilience. Experimental work has shown that residual oil ganglia tends to fluctuate due to the transition to elastic turbulence over time, and these fluctuations tend to mobilize this ganglia. And then previous numerical work has also highlighted that strong miscible elastic effects can mobilize viscible droplets in dead-end regions as well. And experimental studies have shown increased mobilization displacement when we have viscoelastic fluids. Viscoelastic fluids as well. But all of these studies have been conducted with favorable probability ratios. So, what we wanted to have a look at a bit more closely was whether or not we can mobilize an emissible trap fluid in porous media just purely from the elastic effects without any favorable mobility ratio. So, that's what we look at in this problem. We have this multi-phase problem. So, it's a bit of a toy problem. It's a bit of a toy problem where we have this 2D porous media in the very center obstacle. We have this trapped emissible Newtonian droplet attached to the front stagnation point of this cylindrical obstacle. And surrounding it is either a viscoelastic or Newtonian fluid, depending on what we want to simulate. In terms of the T-dimensionless parameters, the Reynolds number is very small. Parameters, the Reynolds number is very small, approximately 0.01. We have different Deborah numbers depending on how high we want the elastic effects to be. We vary the polymer concentration. We also have different capillary numbers in this case as well to have different strengths of viscous forces. And the key thing is that the mobility ratio here is set to one, constant throughout our simulations. In terms of the boundary conditions, we use periodic boundary conditions in the We use periodic boundary conditions in the y-direction. And then, importantly, for the Newtonian droplet attached to the solid obstacle, we have hydrophobic boundary conditions with different wedding contact angles as well. So we simulate different capling numbers and we also simulate different wedding conditions as well. And I should mention, if you are interested in the numerical solver that we use for this case, feel free to ask me, but I've also Feel free to ask me, but I've also provided the relevant papers down below here. Okay, so looking at some of the initial simulation results, some of the qualitative results, so looking first at the Newtonian solution, so what we see with the Newtonian case is that the Newtonian droplet tends to move from the front stagnation point to the rear stagnation point over time, but remains trapped to the obstacle. To the obstacle. But when we change the surrounding fluid to a viscoelastic fluid at relatively low elastic effects or relatively small Deborah numbers, we still see that the droplet is attached to the obstacle but is slightly more elongated compared to the Newtonian case. And only when we increase the Deborah number of the elastic effects even more do we see that the droplet becomes mobilized and untrapped from the cylindrical obstacle. Down below I'm showing you the animations of the correct. Below, I'm showing you the animations of the corresponding polymer trace fields, so really where the polymers are being stretched, and we can see the development of bifring strands around these obstacles. And we can quantitatively actually measure how much of an increased performance we have with these visco elastic fluids. So, what you're seeing here is for different wetting contact angles or non-wetting contact angles, what is the critical capillary number, or what is the critical viscous force required? Critical viscous force required to mobilize or deform this droplet from this solid obstacle. And what we see compared to the purely Nutanian case, the black lines with the blue viscolesic high Debra number case, is that we have this increased performance region where we require a smaller viscous forces to deform and mobilize the structure compared to the mutation case. And so, some key questions arise. And so, some key questions arise based on these results. What's actually causing this droplet to become mobilized as we increase these elastic effects? Are they spawned from purely elastic effects or is there some dependency on the shear thinning behavior as well? So to answer these questions, we initially just looked at the total momentum contribution from the polymers themselves. So we looked at the polymer feedback force vector plot around the butanium droplet. Butanium droplet, and what we see is the emergence of really strong momentum sources around the droplet near the triple contact point. So, the region surrounding the droplet, the surrounding fluid, as well as the solid boundaries, where we have these strong contributions in the streamwise direction, as well as moving vertically, pinching off this droplet from the solid obstacle as well. So, it tends to cause the droplet to actually be displaced or move away from the solid obstacle. And when we look at the And when we look at the individual elastic stress components around these regions, we see that the local maximum also occurs near these triple contact points. So it's really the buildup of the elastic stress that's causing this additional momentum contribution. And by systematically varying some of the parameters, we actually tested three different cases where we had high shear thinning behavior and low elastic effects, moderate shear thinning, and moderate thin. Moderate shear thinning and moderate elastic effects, and then low shear thinning and high elastic effects. And what we see from our simulations is that at low elastic effects and high shear thinning behavior, we still see that the droplet becomes trapped over time. And only when we increase the elastic effects, a relatively small shear thinning behavior, do we actually mobilize the droplet. So, providing a clue that this behavior or this mobilization mechanism is in fact induced. Is in fact induced by strong elastic effects. We quantitatively try to measure or demonstrate this by calculating an effective polymer feedback contribution term. So at relatively low elastic effects, the polymer feedback force is essentially just an additional shear force contribution or a viscous contribution, shear stress contribution. And at higher elastic effects, we have not just a viscous shear stress contribution. Not just a viscous shear stress contribution, but an elastic stress contribution. And we essentially calculate what this effective elastic stress contribution is by removing the initial purely viscous stress contribution. And so with this effective polar feedback force, we have a look at for the three different cases where we have high and low shear thinning effects and high and low elastic effects, what this effective feedback force is. And what we see is that this. And what we see is that this effective feedback force, this purely elastic momentum contribution, increases as we increase the relative elastic effects, unsurprisingly. And what we see is that for the cases where we have the strongest elastic effects or the strongest effective forcing contribution, we see increased mobilization performance here. Okay, so just to quickly conclude from the initial part of my talk with the 1D core arrays. My talk with the 1D core arrays. What we saw was the transition to strong visco elastic instabilities for the three different pore geometries. And we saw that slight modifications in the pore geometry, specifically the asymmetry, where we changed the level of confinement and streamline curvature. We saw that there was a difference in the total viscosity stress performance, sorry, strength, instability, and behavior. So, future work. So, future work, and I think Professor Adakami mentioned with this actually, we actually have very similar illustrations here, purely a coincidence, is to look at the impact on mixing and displacement of trapped immiscible fluids in the dead-end regions of this four geometry. And finally, for the mobilization mechanism I just talked about, we saw that a purely strong elastic stress response can actually mobilize trapped emissions. Can actually mobilize trapped initiatives droplets in porous media. And I understand that this is really a toy case and far from realistic, practical porous media applications. So future work should look at more realistic porous media with heterogeneous porous media surface roughness disorder 3D effects as well. So in saying that, thank you for listening and I welcome any questions. So on slide 17 you showed the velocity fluctuations. I was wondering if you can comment on what the dominant frequencies of these fluctuations. The dominant frequencies? Yeah. Good question. In hindsight, we should have looked at the frequency spectrum or the frequency Frequency spectrum or the frequency response of these fluctuations. I'm not sure why we didn't in the end. So I'm not I can't answer that question, unfortunately. So I would only be able to guess, but I can't really determine exactly where they're coming from or what the dominant frequency is. But yeah, in the future we should look at the spec the spectral behaviour of these fluctuations. These fluctuations. Yeah. Really cool simulations. With your oil mobilization, I think it's really cool. You see this, you have the onset of curve, but then you only see oil mobilization at a higher widespread cover curve. Yes. Do you know, is there like a sharp critical widespread curve when we mobilize things? What we hope to do in the future is to really look at, like, explore a greater parameter space of this motion. Greater parameter space of this mobilization mechanism. So, looking at really different Deborah numbers, when does this mobilization occur? Is it a gradual transition into it, or is it really just a critical Deborah number that this occurs at? We've just really did a fundamental, really simple investigation where we want to see.
