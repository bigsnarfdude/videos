Hi, everyone. I'm Marian. I'm a postdoc at Magpie Group at Simon Fraser University, and today I'm going to present our recent work in declustering of bacterial activity images. Whole genome sequencing or WGS data. Or WGS data provides a rich view of the ongoing diversification, evolution, and selection in pathogenes through the lens of phylogenetic tree. However, the interpretation of whole genome sequence data for public health can be challenging. One way for interpreting bacterial data can be connecting the evolution and epidemiology to the visual patterns that are immediately seen in the three images. One example of this can be One example of this can be seen in the phylogenetic tree of Estaphlocus aureus that you can see here in the left figure. When antibiotic resistance Estaphloccus aureus MRSA arose and spread widely, the phylogenetic tree of MRSA had a comet shape. With the comet head indicating the recently adopted drug resistance. Recently adapted drug resistance isolate, MRAS, and the tail represents the drug-sensitive isolate or MSSA. Another distinctive tree shape in the esophagus or yes phylogenetic tree is a cell-like phylogeny, the bottom figure here, which indicates the recent rapid expansion of the MSSA only lineage. In this work, we ask what other tree shapes analogous to the MRSA comets are present in bacterial whole genome sequencing data sets. These characteristics shapes might signify shared epidemiology, ecology, and evolution. To do this, we extract a small sub-trees from large bacterial genomic data sets, visualize. Visualize them as images and then cluster the images. Dimensionally reduction is an essential pre-processing step in a high-dimensional clustering task. For this aim, we use autoencoder, which is a neural network that is trained to copy its input to its output. Output. We trained the train network efficiently encodes the original images of size 160 by 160 into compressed images of size 16 by 16. We then use three clustering methods to cluster the compressed images. We use k-mean clustering, hierarchical clustering, and affinity propagation. And then we use an ensemble technique to combine. Use an ensemble technique to combine the result of these different clustering methods. We create a clustering graph in which each knot represents an image and two knots are connected if they are clustered by these three clustering methods. Here the clicks represent our final clusters. Using this approach we could find nine Could find nine major groups of tree images, including comets, dabel comet head, cell-like phylogeny, barbell phylogeny, and other shapes. And comments on the evolutionary and epidemiological stories that this shape illustrates. This human familiar graphical description of trees are convenient ways that public health researchers Public health researcher could place new whole genome sequence data in an interpretable context. Thanks. Okay, thanks very much, Miriam. And our last
