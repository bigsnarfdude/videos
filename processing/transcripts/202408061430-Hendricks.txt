Because there are all those people on Zoom who aren't in bounce. Okay, so I asked a couple of co-authors what my trick was and one of the things I got was, well, there's that lemma about the homotopy type of symmetric products and function surfaces that you pull out all of the time. Maybe some of the, at least some of the younger members of the audience aren't familiar with that and would like to hear about it. So I've combined that with maybe a little bit about the symptom geometry of the same situation. Of the same situation, with maybe, I hope, sort of the theme: here's some stuff you might want to know about Hangar's Lair theory if you think about it from the point of view of a syntactic geometer. Okay, so before we get to saying anything about the actual object of studying, we'll maybe remind ourselves why it comes up. Lots of people have mentioned Hagar Floor Theory already today, but the two-second review, so we recall how do we define this object. So, Hagar floor, maybe I've got. So Hagarthor, maybe I've got a three-manifold and a non-homologous not within it. More generally, link, but we'll keep it simple for today. I pick a Morse function on my three manifolds, self-indexing. Maybe for simplest version, I init system only has one index here and one index three critical point. I arrange it so that the knot looks like a union. The knot looks like a union of flow lines between those things. And then in the creative edge of three halves, we have some surface of genus G, where G is the same as the number of index one and index two critical points with the restrictions of me. And I look at the ascending manifolds of the index one critical points. Those intersect in a set of simple closed curves called the alpha curves. Curves called the alpha curves that are pairwise disjoint and span a half-dimensional subspace of the homology of the surface and say rational coefficients. Similarly, if I look at the descending manifolds at the index two critical points, thanks again, City. I get another similar set of simple closed curves spanning half-dimensional subspace transverse to the Subspace transversed to the alphas. And then I put some base points where these two flare lines pierce the surface to keep track of the data of the knot. Okay, and then given that, let's take our flare homology in the simplest form, hf hat of the swing map. HF hat of the Smee manifold is the so-called Lagrangian Flair homology of SIM G. And if you don't know what that is, we'll say momentarily that's going to be a G-fold symmetric product of the surface with one base point removed and some product of the alphas and product of the betas in between them. Those are our so-called Lagrangians. And then And then, if we want to have the theory associated with the not instead, we don't change Lergo grantiants, we change the symplectic manifold. If you don't believe me, that's a symplectic manifold. We're going to get to that point later. Okay, and what is this? What's a symmetric product? It's the ordinary product quotiented out by the action of the symmetric group. So, points are on order g2 points on the original surface. Okay, so at the Okay, so, and then given that, since the alphas, for example, don't intercept, we have a torus that looks like the regular product of all the alphas, and a torus that looks like the regular product of all the betas. Okay, with that in mind, so paygrow floor has lots of combinatorial tricks, and lots of people, you know, spend extremely productive careers sort of never thinking very hard about these manifolds. But today, we're maybe going to think about them a little bit. So the first half of the talk is devoted to showing that this manifold deformation retracts under a really simple space that you can hope to understand concretely. Okay, so maybe this is one topology. Okay, so say I have a surface he genus G and it will have n punctures. I don't actually care about n. Punctures, I don't actually care about n. In particular, I don't currently care about them being arranged in a way that would represent any topological data. So, and I want to look at maybe sim K, sigma G with n punctures in it, where K is not going to be necessarily related to G because in the most general case of Hagar flu homology, you can get K's that are slightly different from G and we want to cover that case too. And what I'm about to say. Cover that case too, and what I'm about to say is going to be true. Okay, so you can of course equip this with a CW structure, which means the product has a CW structure, which means and it's preserved by the action of the symmetric group on the earth. So a choice of CW structure over here induces some choice of quotient CW structure on the K-Folk symmetric plot. Now, an important thing about this construction I've just explained, you take the product, you quotient. I just explained, you take the product, you quotient out, et cetera, is that if you had a Hamataki equivalence between spaces X and Y, and you take your K-fold symmetric product, you now have a Hamotaki equivalence between the result. And if you have a deformation retraction, maybe x cross I onto Y at subspace, so maybe this is a death retract, then Then you also have a deformation retract of the symmetric product onto the corresponding subspace. And this just comes from taking the map of a product, observing that it's preserved by the action, so we have an induced map down here. Okay, so what I want to know is sort of like what's the topology of the surface for some functions. Of the surface with some punctures, maybe we'll draw two punctures. I'm asking questions about what's the topology of well, a deformation or caps onto wedged circles. Red and blue are exactly the wrong colors to choose for us. Fortunately, there are two others. Alright, so here, what does this punctured surface? Deformation retracts deformation retracts onto so much, where maybe we have this q. Where maybe we have this can be u one, and this can be mu two, lambda one and lambda two. And then all but one of the punctures get their own pedal, so maybe this is gamma, and more generally it'd be gamma one to gamma n minus n. So in general, this just goes on to a Goes onto a wedge of 2d plus n minus 1 circles. Okay, so I'm interested, in fact, in knowing what's the topology of this wedge of circles look like, because whatever it looks like, I'm going to deformation retract onto it from my somewhat complicated-looking selected product. All right, so the first question we might ask ourselves in figuring that out is, well, what do I get if I take the symmetric product of just one? The symmetric product of just one circle with itself a bunch of times. And the answer to this is quite well known. It's more or less in Hatcher, but I'll remind you of what's going on because I want to be a little bit careful about how I do it. So the answer to this first thing is that the symmetric product of a circle with itself a bunch of times deformation retracts onto a circle. In particular, you can think of this as the subspace. Of this, as the subspace consisting of one potentially non-trivial element followed by a bunch of base point elements. So throughout my circle, it looks like there's one, there's the base point, it's the zero cell, the cell structure is that also one cell. I'm sitting inside of sin K of S1. Okay, so let's examine that for a moment and then let's be careful. Examine that for a moment and then let's be careful about how we do that deformation attack because it turns out I can say more about this. I'll add another line to this in just a second. So how do we see this? Well, the first thing is the k-fold symmetric product of this circle. Well, I can include the circle into the complex plane, and if I include it into the punctured complex plane, just from moving the origin, that's a perfectly good homotopy equivalence. So it induces a We got a homotopy equivalence, so it induces a homotopy cobunch between these points. Okay, and this just maps us to the point we were at previously. So this is some unordered, but I'm drawing commas because otherwise it's really hard to see on the board, but the brackets, the braces are supposed to mean this is unordered, set of points. And then there's famously a biholomorphism between the k-fold symmetric product of the complex plane. The complex plane and just c to the k, which interchanges the roots and the coefficients of a polynomial. So you start with, you know, x minus c1, x minus ck, which has the roots of all it has just an unordered set of roots. And then you look at the coefficients of the polynomial, and that's an ordered set of the elementary symmetric functions of those terms. And maybe you add some negative signs. And maybe you add some negative signs to account for all these minuses you picked up. But that's the biholomorphism. And if you apply that to this situation where none of your points were supposed to be zero, you end up in CK minus one cross C star by doing the map. Because what does that map actually do? It sends you to Z1 plus Zk. Well, the first one is the sum, and the last one is the product, and in the meantime, Last one is the product, and in the meantime, you have other elementary symmetric functions. Okay, and if you were coming from C star, the last one's never zero, but everything else you can get whatever, you get whatever number you like, so it's ck minus one. And then that self-deformation retracts. Onto C star with the origin removed. Squish this term. The origin removed, squish this term, and that goes on to S1 back again. So, in this case, we can just drop all the other terms and we map to the product. My handwriting is getting a little messy at the edge here, for which I apologize. I hope the people on Zoom are following okay. And finally, this just, if you started with all terms on the circle, then the map where you collapse to the circle doesn't do anything to you. Do anything to you. In general, it wouldn't modify your norm. Okay, and everything in this whole thing is a homotopy equivalence. So we see we have a homotopy equivalence to the circle, and we can think of it as a retract onto this subspace. Now, now we have an inclusion of CW complexes that's a homotopy equivalence, so I can turn that into a deformation retract if I would need to. Alright, but I can do a little better than this. I can do this such that so. So that the deformation attract onto this subspace never increases the number of non-base point terms as we go along. Which is to say, so inside of the k-fold symmetric product, I have copies of the k-minus first symmetric product and the k-minus second symmetric product and so on, just by sort of adding ones to the points in those spaces. In those spaces. And I can take my deformation retract to preserve all of those spaces so that I never start with two non-base point things in a point, and then my path and the deformation retraction tugs it up to three. Okay, so there is a definite trapped onto the subspace, which never increases the number of non-base points. Number of non-base points increases the number of non-base point charts. Okay, why would such a thing be true? This just comes from thinking for a sec about the relationships between those pairs. Which is to say, so if I have Which is to say that I have sim, say, let's say just k minus 1 for simplicity of s1 with 1s appended. So thinking of that as something that lives inside of sim k of s1, both of these things, by the previous construction, deformation retract onto s1. Are trapped onto S1. And this is a cellular inclusion. So just using the cellular structure induced by the closure. So this is a CW pair, this, this, that has trivial homotopy, trivial relative homotopy groups. And therefore, in fact, I can deformation refract this one onto this one, which means I can do this in stages. I can take everything that has k terms and grow to possibly as many as k non-base point terms, map it down to something that has at most k minus 1. Add more k minus 1 on basic point terms and keep doing that expenses. Okay, which is the same since this is a CW pair with we now know trivial relative homotopy groups because these things have the same thing. We can do a death retract one onto the other and make the whole retraction onto the circle go in steps like this. Okay, what does this mean we can prove? Well, so far you're probably not very excited. You might have already known what the case old symmetric product of a circle is, and in any event, it's not that complicated. Event, it's not that complicated. So, the point is that this is a tool in proving the following result. I first learned this from a paper of AUM, but I think it may be proved some other places as well. Okay, so the lemma is that the symmetric product of a website is a very simple. Of a bunch of circles, deformation retracts onto the following thing. If deformation retracts onto a subset of the product of those circles, which is to say, so it looks like some Z1 through ZR. Okay, so it lives inside of a torque. Okay, so it lives inside of an arthold torus such that at most k coordinates satisfy ZI isn't the base point. The place where they're all wedged together at one, we're treating that as the base point. So at most k of the coordinate. Most k over coordinates can be anywhere else. Okay, that's a complicated thing. What is it actually saying? Well, if k is greater than or equal to r, this is the torus. So it's just the product of the circles. Which is to say, because any of them can be non-base break terms, they can all be anywhere in the circle. Right turns. They can all be anywhere on the circle simultaneously. And if k is less than r, this is the k skeleton of the torus. With the standard product CW structure coming from the structure on the circle that's got the two sides. Alright, so this is the casekeleton. Okay, um, it's late in the day. It's late in the day. No doubt we're tired. Before we groom it, let's draw a picture. Here's my picture. The example is that sim two maybe of there's the colors. Let's say I have three circles and they're I have three circles, and they're A, B, and C. So it can definitely track this back onto its subspace that looks like a two skeleton of a three torus. So it looks like a union of three two Tauri was in blue, such that, you know, wherever I see Such that this circle here is the same as maybe this circle here. So I have A, A, and then B, and I guess these next to be here, and C and C. And I glue along these next. Okay, so it's just a chase balloon. Chase follows it. Okay, and what's the proof? At this point, the proof of the statement is actually simple. The proof is: let's think about our symmetric product of wedged circles. Okay, and this can be thought of as a subset of a larger symmetric product. Let's say k times r of the same space. But that's something really fast. Like r equals 1, that's the product of a circle. So it's quite a product of the circle. Yes. But the next thing you say that it's going to a torus. Yeah, so the one torus, you understand, there's a circle. Um, so, okay. So, uh. Oh no. Yeah, I think it's just that it should be an I so look. It should be um called Sorry, where is that type of? Oh, oh, this should be an R. Absolutely, thank you very much. Yes, um, the one tourist you perceive is a circle. Great. Amazing. Uh Amazing. Okay, so we put this inside of a larger symmetric product. Again, by appending copies of the base point one, if we like. Then any point that lives here, I can factor it. So as a point In the following product, in sum k of s11, cross width all the way through sum k of s1r, which is to say I have a string of k things, the k I have a string of k points, and I can separate it out into things that just separate them out, put each of the terms that live in S1. Of the terms that live in S1 here, and then into S12, and then the S1R. And no more than K of them ever are non-base point terms, so this is a fact. So we do lie in this space, and the factorization is unique. Okay, but now to each of these, I may apply the deformation attack from the previous lemma to get down to an actual circle. A copy of S11 and a copy of S1R. And a copy of S1R, sequentially, if I like. Maybe the deformation of track from the previous lemma was F. And now you say, but I have the concern that we're in this big space, and I know that the total number of terms across all of this that are non-base point can't be more than k. So we need to remember that as we do the deformation refract here, we never increase the number of non-base point terms we have running around. So we never step out of the copy of SIM. Step out of the copy of SIMK lying in SIMKR as we do this retraction. Okay, and that's the argument for this. Pause for questions and then why would you want to now begin with the baby? Okay, if everyone is satisfied, a moment's remarks on why you might consider caring. So, firstly, one remark is that this can be made compatible with lots of maps between spaces. So, I said that in Hagar floor, if we look at the not invariant, we're deleting two points, and if we look at the manifold invariant, we're deleting one point. So, there's a map, there's a So there's a map, and there's a map from, an inclusion map from the space for the not invariant to the space for the three manifold invariant. And let's say we're working with a picture from the beginning where we had a lambda one and a mu1 and a lambda two and a mu2, and we'll have a gamma one. So this is an example of something we'd get from a Hagar diagram for a knot, with the Hagar diagram being genus 2. And we've seen that this can be. And we've seen that this can be retracted onto a subspace of a product of circles with no more than k non-base point terms. And if we want to then include into the torus where only one of the base points is deleted and where one puncture is now filled in, I can, in fact, change. I can, in fact, change my formula so that I'm deformation interacting onto not the web, not the symmetric product of the wedger circles, but I re-included a puncture, I fill in this disk. So symmetric product of wedger circles plus one disc. And again, this goes onto the subspace that looks like, well, it's the product of those things, except you have to have a subspace such that no more than k terms are a non-base point. And then this, well, now this just squishes, and this goes to the presentation we would have seen earlier of only one puncture on the surface. And there's, again, just the map here that crushes the disk. Okay, so what remark is this place really nicely with maps? Another remark. Maps. Another remark is: okay, so if I know the homon talking about the type of my space, is a skeleton of a torus, I know exactly its homology and cohomology, and they're very simple. In particular, they're torsion-free. But it's a very useful fact about the world that if you have torsion-free cohomology, you have torsion-free K-theory, and the Turing classes of vector bundles on your space exactly determine the stabilization. Exactly, determine the stable isomorphism classes of those vector models. So, indeed, maybe it's worth remarking that when, let's say a compact CW complex to reduce the chances that something bad will happen, has no torsion in its colonology. And its chronology The true classes of vector bundles determine their stabilized market class. Okay, and why is that? We recall that if we look at the k-theory of a space, we have the churn character map into the rational cohomology. If you're a line bundle, this just takes your first churn class and exponentiates it, which is to say evaluates the power. Which is to say evaluates the power series for e to the x using that as the argument. And then the split it by the splitting principle that just determines everything. And as we learned in Ian's algebra 3 class, if you tensor with Q, you get an isomorphism. Okay, so these guys, so in particular, the cohomology and the K-theory have the same name. But there's also the ATI transiverse spectral sequence, which goes from, for your favorite. Which goes from, for your favorite adonic cohomology theory, which K-theory is, to from cohomology of the space in coefficients, in coefficients, the value of the exotic cohomology theory at a point just to that exotic cohomology theory. And indeed, this has exactly the same rank as the cohomology tiled a few times, and this is exactly the same rank as the K-theory. The same rate as the K-theory. So if there's no torsion on the first page, there would have been a cancellation to get any torsion here, and there's not, which means that the K-theory is non-torsion and the turn cost is just a turn for every thing. Even better, this is a torus. This means that a suspension is a wedge of spheres, because it's a product of spheres, and when you suspend, you get a bunch of different suspensions of the terms and their joints. And the term character isomorphism is, in fact, an integral. Is in fact an integral isomorphism for spheres, which means it's an integral isomorphism for this space too. So for our space, knowing that we have the homotopy type of this very simple thing tells us that the churn character is actually just an integral isomorphism. Okay, so that's a very nice thing to know. Maybe one thing that's Maybe one thing that's worth mentioning is that we know exactly what the tangent bundle on this face looks like, and what's easy to write down given the picture that we now have. So, which is to say that another remark is that The total churn class of sim k of sigma g n is exactly. So remember, here's my space, and here are on the surface, I have some lambdas and some mu's, which are a standard basis for the homology the way I drew them. Homology, the way I drew them, maybe I have some additional gammas to go around the functors. All but one of them. Okay, and the Them. Okay, and the total churn class of this thing is C is the product of I equals 1 to G of 1 minus mu I dual lambda i dual. These are not Poincaré duals or anything fancy like that. These are the actual duals of the homology classes like with respect to this basis for the difference homology. And then you take their products. Will you say I don't see K anywhere in this? I don't see k anywhere in this formula. That's a really great objection. Where does k appear in this formula? Okay, so where does k appear in this formula? It appears in where these products stop being non-trivial. So as an example, so if I do sim three, maybe, of a twice punctured, Of a twice-punctured genus 2 surface. Okay, so we know this is the same thing as SIM3 of, this is going to be a wedge of five circles. So that's going to look like, so I have mu1, lambda 1, mu2, and lambda 2. mu 2 and lambda 2 and some gamma. And the total trim class is supposed to look like the product of mu1 minus mu1 hat times lambda 1 hat times 1 minus mu 2 hat lambda 2 hat, which is 1 minus mu 1 hat lambda 1 hat plus mu 2 hat lambda 2 hat. And then in theory, there's another term of the product. Another term of the product. But of course, there isn't because this deformation retracts onto something that's something that's lying in a five torus. That's lying in a three, that's a three skeleton of a five torus. And that term just drops. And now I've just got, it's only got non-trivial C1. Okay, so this computation. So this computation is a result from a long time ago, the 60s I think, of Ian MacDonald. In fact, there's a version of it through non-punctured surfaces, but the formula is a little bit more complicated. So, alright, so this means that we can get a really good grip on vector bundles on the surface of the symmetric product, including the tangent bundle, by only really thinking about what they're doing on these curves. What they're doing on these curves here in the wedge. And we see here the tangent bundle is interesting on the part of the two skeleton that comes from pairing mu1 and lambda1, and the part of the two skeleton that comes from pairing mu2 and lambda2 is not really interesting anywhere else if you restrict it. In particular, nothing that involves gamma is really going to get interesting behavior in the tangent model. Now, the fact that the loop around the puncture isn't interesting. Loop around the puncture isn't interesting from the point of view of the tangent bundle. It also has other consequences. So, in particular, it means that, well, what are some stable isomorphisms of our vector bundle? They're an affine copy of its first k-theory, and now it's zero. So, and like we've just seen, the k-theory isn't complicated. It just looks like, well, the first k-theory is going to look like the odd cohomology under the term characterizing optim. So, the odd cohomology isn't very complicated. Odd cohomology isn't very complicated. And if you're in Hagar Floorland, you can additionally pick this loop so that it's linearly independent of the Lagrangians. That's a special fact about the topology. And you can use this to prove in particular that any isomorphism of the tangent bundle of this space, if you have two pointers for a not deleted, can always be modified to extend over filling in the overfill. filling in the punctures to extend the space with only one point deleted without changing its behavior near the libogs. That's just a result of staring at this very nice picture of what exactly the cohomology ring is and how that relates to a tape theory. Okay, pause for questions. Okay, um Okay, um so I was going to say two words maybe to wrap this up about symplectic geometry and Hager flare homology. So we maybe want to, we know Hager flare homology is supposed to be Lagrangian flare homology. What does that mean? So what are the simplest assumptions you could ever put You could ever try put on a symplectic manifold with two Lagrangians, so this is maybe section two very briefly, with two Lagrangians, such that you get Lagrangian flare homology. So one thing is you want it to be exactly the same. So this means my syntactic form, my closed Q form, is itself, has some primitive lambda. And I want, and again, in the simplest possible set of assumptions, I want compact exact Lagrangians L0 and L1. And I'd also probably want to be convex at infinity. want to be convex at infinity. So omega is minus ddc of some phi, where phi is a proper and bounded below function from m to r. Minus ddc means take d multiply by the complex structure j on m and then take d again. So maybe we have enough time to talk about why the About why the symmetric product of a punctured surface would satisfy these simplest possible set of assumptions. Although, since this has gone a little slower than I expected, possibly we won't be able to talk about exactness of the Lagrange terms. So I have my surface. Okay, so I can pick a complex structure j for my surface, and it's not hard to pick an exhausting function. And exhausting function, so proper bounded below for my surface, by patching together as copies of just the radial function on C and starting as functions with the pole at the punctures along charts. Okay, and then we can let lambda, once we pick an exhausting function, be minus VC of phi, and then our symplectic form, our area form, is minus db. area form is minus V D C of phi. Now given that, you end up with a probably singular function, which still has the property that minus V D C of phi is strictly positive. So it's a sort of singular two current instead of a form from the symmetric product. And I should mention the punctures. The punctures are sort of important in there. Okay, so you looked, if you picked a function that generates your lambda and your function that generates your lambda and your omega on the actual surface, you get some probably singular function off the symmetric product. And now it's a result of Tempirics that you can always smooth, so this is just by taking the product of phi bunch of terms, that you can always smooth this by tilde. This phi tilde to a phi, which is still proper and bounded below. And is smooth and agrees with the previous function, so in fact, just agrees with taking a default product of the function. Taking a default product of a function away from the set of points in the symmetric product where you have repeated points, which is often called the fat diagonal. And now the conventional way of getting a symplectic form upstairs is to take minus ddc of that phi so that it agrees with just the product of omega. Just the product of omaguf away from the fat diagonal, and in particular near the Dulagrangians. And then exactness comes from that construction of the symplectic form, which is now omega tilde is D of lambda tilde, where this again agrees with lambda cross G, where that makes sense. That makes sense. And I have four minutes, so I could maybe say two things about the exactness of the Lagrangians. Okay, so so far, so good. Maybe so far, maybe so far, so not so complicated. The only interesting thing here is Tim telling us that we can take the function we want to generate, the symplectic form on the symmetric product, and turn it into something that's actually smooth that will generate the function, generate the form. It's not totally obvious that the Lagrangians. Totally obvious that the Lagrangians are exact coming from that. Okay, so maybe the thing that's worth saying in the last few minutes is that exactness of the Lagrangians is a consequence of a condition that we usually impose on Hegerday. That we usually impose on Hager diagrams called weak admissibility, which says that any, which is bio memo or John Salvo exactly equivalent to there is an area form on. On my surface sigma, and coming from a Hanker diagram, as we had at the beginning, with the property that any two chain on the surface Which does not contain a wow okay a base point non-trivially and has boundary and the union of the alpha curves and the beta curves. has area zero. Okay, and if you think about that statement for a bit, you'll quickly come up with an idea that you can use this to insist on altering the primitive on your surface so that it's exact on every single curve, every single outline maker curve. Curve, every single alpha and beta curve on the surface. And then you can use that alteration to go back to this construction, which again, the primitive just agrees with the product of the one on the surface away from it near the Lagrangians, and alter this primitive so that it's actually exact on the two Lagrangians. And now that the heavens have indicated I should scop, I think I'll do that. Thanks for your attention. Oh yeah, if you have a single log graph gene and you can actually do this trivially, it's doing both at once. That's a problem. So the situation is, so if I'd had more time to finish this group, I would have said, if you've got a linearly independent set of curves. Independent set of curves on the surface. You can just pick a one form whose integral along all of those corresponds to whatever the lambda currently evaluates to and subtracts from your problem is that the total set of alpha and beta pairs might not be linearly independent. So you do all so you can make the form exact on all of the alphas and some of the betas. And after that, you have a beta that's maybe a linear combination of the previous ones. Combination of the previous ones. But that means there's a periodic domain with boundary that theta plus some other things, maybe times an integer to make everything integral. And now we integrate that entire expression and oh the area form of value rates to zero in any periodic domain. So when you took all the linearly independent ones and made the form exact on them, you additionally did so the other ones too. Yes, very good.
