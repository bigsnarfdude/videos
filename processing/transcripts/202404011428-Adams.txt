Here and here and here and here. That's really gluing it together along the interior of this tube right here and the interior of this tube right here. That's how I'm gluing it together. Okay? So that's what I call the spherical reflective doubling match, MAC, MAC. And it's generating this knot in a thickened torus. Here's a second option. So that was the first option. The second option is a little bit simpler. Start with your knotoid. Again, remove little discs around the poles. Only this time I'm just going to glue the Only this time I'm just going to glue the boundary of the disk around the pole here to the boundary of the disc around the pole here. That turns my sphere into a torus with a knot on it, and I'll thicken it up. Here's the picture, if you think of it, it's set of projections as a thickened bound. Okay, so I've got these two different ways that I can define this idea. And then, of course, you can guess what's going to happen. We're going to say a spherical matoid is hyperbolic under the reflective doubling map if the complement of that knot in the thickened torus is hyperbolic. I'm going to take, because remember, in the I'm going to take, because remember in the reflected doubling map, I took two copies of the object, so I'm going to take the volume to be half the volume of that object. In the case of the gluing map, I'll say it's hyperbolic. Again, the corresponding knot in the thickened torus is hyperbolic. And then the volume, because I didn't do any doubling, the volume is just going to be the volume of the component of that knot in the thickened torus. Great. Of course, you don't really want two different versions. Well, good news, there aren't really two different versions. It turns out that if you have a spherical knot, It turns out that if you have a spherical nautoid and you consider its image either under the gluing map or the reflected doubling map, then it's hyperbolic in the one and only if it's hyperbolic in the other. And furthermore, these two volumes that would be defined are equal. So either one of those two pictures works fine. So either way you want to picture it either as a reflective double or it's just gluing the two ends together. It's going to give you something where you'll get the same volume either way. Okay, so good. So here's sort of the first thing we can do, which is kind of interesting, and it behaves very differently than knots do. Behaves very differently than knots do, behaves very differently than most of the hyperbolic object that you look at. If you take a product of two oriented hyperbolic spherical montoids, so I have one over here that's hyperbolic, another one over here that's hyperbolic, the result will always be hyperbolic, and the hyperbolic volumes of the spherical montoids actually are additive under multiplication. So under this product, my standard multiplication under this product, okay? So I just add the volumes together. This isn't actually that surprising. This isn't actually that surprising when you look at the picture. So here's a quick proof of that fact. If I take a product of two natoids and I do this construction to it, okay, so then I'm doing the construction of the gluing map, then I have these two notoids stuck together like this, and I'm in this thickened torus. I can always represent a thickened torus as the complement of a hot flink in the threesner. So I'm going to replace that missing part on the inside here by a single component like this. Inside here by a single component like this, and then throwing around the outside, I have another component out there. Okay, and then this turns out to be a situation where I have exactly this particular kind of a situation where I've got a trivial component, that's the one you see at the top, and then one tangle here, and I have a second trivial component, and a second tangle, you can do those separately, and I'm putting them together to get something like this. And that's what's called a belted sum of knots. And it's been known for a while back. It's been known for a while back, proved that in 1985, that in fact, anytime you have something hyperbolic here and hyperbolic here, you get something hyperbolic here and the volumes will add. And it's really, I'm sure many of you who think about these things, you recognize why, it's because this twice function disk here is totally geodesic. And because it's totally geodesic, you can sort of cut open and paste and put things together. But it preserves the hyperbolic volumes when you add them. Okay, so here's the beginning of a chart: volumes of A chart of volumes of hyperbolic nautoids, and so you see these hyperbolic nautoids. And again, it doesn't matter whether you're using the spherical reflective doubling map or you're using the gluing map, and you can start calculating these things. This one is non-hyperbolic. Why is it non-hyperbolic? Because that one there is what's called a knot-type note. If you have both of the two poles in the same region, that will never be hyperbolic. Okay, so that one's not hyperbolic, but all the rest of these turned out to be hyperbolic. You can do these calculations. Let's look at the Let's look at a particular category just to see how this works. So, we're going to define a rational notoid to be a natoid obtained by taking a rational tangle. I'm going to glue the southwest strand to the northeast strand. Okay, so I get an object that looks like this, and this is going to be my rational motoid. And it turns out, if you take rational motoids, you can actually prove, you know, one of the things you want to do in hyperbolic, low-dimensional hyperbolic stuff, is finding the smallest volumes. And so, actually, Volumes and so actually the Steems I were able to prove the following: the unique rational natoid of smallest volume is the natoid 2,1 with volume approximately 5.33349. Now, interestingly enough, so that's this natoid right here. That is, in fact, the conjectured volume of the smallest manifold with three clusters, the smallest orientable manifold with three clusters, or three, if you think of it in terms of not the smallest link with three components, and that's still an With three components, and that's still an open problem, although people are getting closer. I think Digital I was working on maybe trying to prove it. That's true. And this particular proof, proving this fact, we use results of Fudor and Guerreeau and also results of Fuder calfy universal both about these volumes after day flowing. Okay. Planar notoids. Okay, so we've been talking about spherical natoids. How do things differ with planar nautoids? First, I have to find this. I'm going to say that a link complement in a three-manifold is TG hyperbolic. Manifold is TG hyperbolic. TG stands for totally geodesic. TG hyperbolic, if they're capping off all of the spherical boundaries, if I have any spherical boundaries, I'll cap them off with balls. If I have any torus boundaries, I'll shave off the torus because those are going to become cusps. And then if I have any higher genus boundaries, I need them to be totally deves. So that's what I mean when I talk about the TG hyperbolic manifold. And it's relatively easy to see that when this occurs, the associated volume is unique. You can just double across the total units. You can just double across the total units of bound using a five-volume hyperbolic three manifold. And so the volume is uniquely associated with these TG hyperbolic manifolds. And I'll mention this, although I think a lot of people are familiar with this. The work of Thurston implies the corresponding 3-manifold is TG hyperbolic if, as is often the case, there are no properly embedded essential disks, spheres, amuli, or I. Okay. So now what I want to do is I want to take one of these One of these planar notoids. And so I've got a diagram like this. And as I mentioned before, you can think of it in the plane, but you can also just think of it in the disk, right? Because you can just shave off the rest of it because you're not going to get outside of that disk very far. Anyway, I'm going to do the same thing we did before. I'm going to take my original copy of my punctured disk and a second reflected copy of that disk. I'm going to again glue together the corresponding boundaries of those missing disks. Boundaries of those missing disks here and here and here and here. And that gives me an object that looks like this. And then I'm going to, this is what the projection looks like. And then when I thicken that up, it in fact looks like this. And what I'm getting is I'm getting a knot and a handleball. And that's going to be really the theme of this talk, is knots and handlebars, although we'll look at them various different ways. The three-dimensional analog of this without thinking about projections is I start with my original natoid in this thickened punctured disc. Thickened punctured disc. I create, oh, I what I do first is I'm going to want to glue this tube here, this annulus here, and this tube here to another copy. So the first thing I do is I pull that tube up to the outer surface. So that's where that tube right there, I pulled it up so that it's sitting on the exterior of this particular object. So it'll make it easier to glue. I'll then take two copies of that, the original and a reflected copy, and then I glue them together along their associated anuli, which is like. Along their associated animalite, which is like gluing this to a reflected copy along those tubes. And I get this object again, which is just a knot and a handle body. Okay? So anyway, a lot of this is motivation just to say knots and handle bodies are interesting. We'll see some more reasons why I think they're interesting as well. Okay, let me just mention there's a second way that we could do it, just as there was a second way for spherical matoids, where I'll start with my original and instead of taking a reflected copy, I'll do the Taking a reflected copy, I'll do the same trick of pulling my tube up until it becomes on the boundary. So the standulus now appears on the boundary in this picture. And then I'll just glue the one to the other. And because each one has one of the endpoints of my not tote on it, those will get glued together and I get this. So this is what I'm going to call the planar gluing map. Unlike what happened in the spherical category, these are not equivalent. So in fact, it turns out that if the reflected doubling map for a planar notoid is hyperpotential, The gluing map for a planar notoid is hyperbolic, then so is the gluing map, but not vice versa. And the volume of the gluing map has to be greater than or equal to the volume of the reflected doping map. So why is that true? Well, it all comes from this picture right here. This is the gluing map. So I've got my nautoid in here, and it's got some, it's two endpoints that were going out to my two tubes, but when I glued them together, it now just becomes a component that looks like this. So this is the gluing map picture. Looks like this. So, this is the gluing map picture. I'm going to take a double cover of this over this particular part right here. So, I get this thing. I've changed it from a K to an R so we can kind of keep track of the orientation of that particular part of it. So, this is an R and then this is just the rotated copy of that same R over there. This one is the reflective double, the reflected double. I took the original thing and I reflected it up, and so my R is reflected from the original. Okay? Regional. Okay? Let's suppose this one is hyperbolic. That's what we're assuming. If the reflected doubling map is hyperbolic. So we're assuming this one is hyperbolic. Because of that reflection, we'll notice that this surface here I'm calling F double prime together with this part over here. It's disconnected, but it is just a surface matter. Because that is preserved under the reflection, it has to be totally geodesic. So these two punctured annuli, this one here and this one here, and this is important to say, these are not twice punctured disc. Important to say these are not twice-punctured disks in the sense of being totally geodesic in that sense, because this has boundary. The boundaries are on the boundary, so they're not twice-punctured disks. So we don't know automatically that they're totally geodesic, but because they're preserved under that reflection, they are totally geodesic. So these are both totally geodesic. And then there's this very nice theorem of Agall, Thurston, and Storm that says if you have a hyperbolic manifold and you've got a totally geodesic surface in there like that, you can cut open along that surface and then reglue a different way. And then re-glue a different way, and you will still be hyperbolic, but with potentially bigger lot. Okay? And so that's what we're using here. So I'm going to cut along the F double prime here and here. I'll take this piece out. I will move it around in funny ways, like I can reflect it and put it back in in a different way. That's okay. I'm allowed to do it because the two pieces are the same two pieces of homeomorphism. And then I glue it back in in a different way. That's what I'm getting here. And the result is going to be hyperbolic, and the volume is going to potentially go up. Okay, the only way actually that the volume can be the same is if these two surfaces happen to also be totally dead as a which in general aren't. Okay, so let's take a look at some volumes here. So these are the notoids under the planar volumes. And as I said, if the reflected double is hyperbolic, then the gluing map has to be hyperbolic. So these ones here, if this one's hyperbolic, this one has to be hyperbolic. But this one doesn't have to be hyperbolic here. Okay? And for anyone where the reflected gluing map is hyperbolic, The reflected gluing map is hyperbolic, this volume should be less than or equal to this volume there. So that's what you're seeing in the spectrum of the volumes that you see right there. Okay, good. Let's generalize, right? That's what we do. We generalize. So let's generalize. Instead of thinking about natoids, where every pole has one line segment coming into it, why stop there? Why don't we allow two parts coming into one of these poles? Why don't we allow These polls? Why don't we allow three coming into a pole? Why don't we allow none coming into a pole? Why don't we allow all these different possibilities? Why don't we allow components that actually don't have any poles? So this is what we're going to call a generalized notoid. And I did have a long description of this, and I realized that's just a waste of time. This is what the picture looks like. What are the rules? So I can do it on any closed-orientable surface. It doesn't have to be the sphere of the plane. So you have a closed-orientable surface, you have a finite graph. Surface, you have a finite graph. I'm not requiring G to be connected or simple, it can have valence in zero. Vertices, I'm going to call the edges, and circles are called its constituents. And then the forbidden move is, again, anytime I have a pole, you cannot slide a strand over a pole. So that's the same as before. And I have one other condition, which I didn't have before, which is if I have a bunch of these constituents coming into a pole, I can't just locally twist them. So it's these vertices you might. So, it's these vertices, you might think of them as what are called rigid vertices as opposed to being able to twist on those vertices. Okay, so those are the forbidden moves for these generalized notes. Okay, so generalized not to surfaces and equivalence classes, such as diagrams up to local right-hand motion moves and isotopy, not allowing those forbidden moves. Okay, so let's look at some examples of things we're familiar with that fall under this category of generalized natoids. Certainly, a spherical natoid is a generalized natoid with two poles and one constituent. A planar notoid, well, you can think of the plane going off to infinity as just an extra pole that you're kind of removing at infinity. So that prevents the natoid from being pulled around the backside because that pole is there. So really, any planar notoid is just a notoid with three poles, two of them connected by one constituent. Classical knot, generalized notoid with no poles, that's kind of cheating. Multilinkoids just mean a bunch of different Just mean a bunch of different notoids all tangled up together. And then these are sort of interesting, so-called polar knots. And so these were defined before this as n-polar knots, where you have these poles on the knot. So every one of the poles is valency 2. You also, if you've seen long knots before, and they go off to infinity, you can think of, again, infinity as being a pole, in which case you can think of that as a one-pole curve. So all of those are examples of these things. You can do string links. You can do string links if you maybe have seen these before. String links have been around for a while, quite a while now. And you've just got this ball, and you've got these strings on the top and strings on the bottom. And there are some rules like the string on the top has the end of the string on the bottom, but they're not braids that can go up and down. Inside there, these are so-called string links. And you can represent those as notoids with a single pole of valence to 2N. You have to make sure that anyone that leaves comes back in the same position, but otherwise it can be represented this way. Can be represented this way. But this is the one I'm really interested in. Because to me, this is something at least I had never thought about before when I saw this. And that is, what about these ones that have these so-called isolated poles? So I'm not going to put any poles on the knot. I'm just going to put these isolated poles in. And the way I want to think about this is I want to think about taking the knot diagram, taking two sticks, and just sliding them through the knot. And now the knots kind of stuck on these sticks. And as far as I know at the time, nobody had thought. And as far as I knew at the time, nobody had thought about these, and I thought they were really kind of an interesting category. So we started thinking about them. Let me tell you first how to do hyperbolicity for generalized notoids, and then I'll come back to the stakes. Okay, so for generalized notoids, I'm going to use the reflected doubling map. Only this is the rule. I'm only going to glue, when I glue the one to the other, when I take the reflected copy and I glue them together, I'm only going to glue it along the particular ones of these rails that have... These rails that have an end point on them. Okay, so in other words, this is an isolated pole right here, which corresponds to an isolated rail here. And I will not glue them together along that one. So for the other two rails that you see here, I'll pull them up so I get these annuli on the top. I'll create a second copy of it and I'll glue them together. And of course, once again, I'm just getting a knot and getting a handle up. So for any generalized knot toy, you can define hyperbolicity in terms of just half the volume of this particular. Half the volume of this particular knot living in the handlebony. So, again, sort of interested in knots living in handlebars. But I want to come back to stake knots. As I said, I thought they were new until I gave a talk. You were there, actually, and Lou Kaufman said, oh no, I invented those a long time ago. And it turned out he did. This has happened to me more than once, actually, and it's always true. He always has. And he called them tunnel links. It appears in a paper by Goldman and Kaufman back in 1993, but they were. Back in 1993, but they were interested in sort of electrical properties of networks. And in particular, they only had two of these, right? So they had a very special case where they had two of these. And so, but it has appeared, it did appear before at that particular context. Okay, so how do I want you to think about these stake knots? Well, I want you to think about it much in the context of what we saw before. I'm thinking of stake knots. For now, the projection surface is a sphere, and I'm going to think of this knot living in a thickened sphere, and my stakes, I'm going to think. In a thickened sphere, in my stakes, I'm going to remove tubes going out like this, this, and this from my thickened sphere. Now, notice if you do that, you can take this particular one down here that's missing, put your hands in and stretch that out until it looks like this. So, again, we're looking at a knot living in the handlebody. Okay, so I'm just widening this hole until it looks like that. So, we're looking at knots and handlebodies, and we're looking at staked knots and links. One stake's not interesting. If I take a knot, thinking of it again in the ball, and I put in one stake, that's just going to give me, when I remove the neighborhood of that stake from a thickened sphere, I'm just going to get a ball. It's just going to be a knot living in a ball. And knots living in balls, the theory of knots living in balls is no different than the theory of knots living in three spheres. So that's not interesting. So we're not interested in that case. Two stakes. Well, if we think about two stakes, and I removed this, I put a little tunnel in here. This, put a little tunnel in here and a tunnel in here. I'm now really just creating the complement of a knot component, that red knot component that you see right here. So that just becomes the complement of a two-component link. And in fact, we know something about two-component links. So for instance, the smallest volume of a two-state hyperbolic link is 3.6638. And that follows immediately from the fact that Ian Agel proved that 3.6638 is the smallest volume. 3.663, it is the smallest volume of any two-component hyperbolic lick. Okay, so, and we'll see that this is actually realized in just a second. Okay, so now I've tried to motivate why people might be interested in notch living in handle bodies. Let's look at some examples. This is actually the first example I could find, which is one that Alan Reid and I did back in 1993. It's going to come up again in a second, but this particular not living in the handle body proved that it was TG hyperbolic. Okay, so it's a TG hyperbolic. Okay, so it is a T hyperbolic wink. Fregerio extended this to an infinite class of examples, where here it's a little hard to see what's going on, but there is this trivial component wrapping around, and then there is this graph, and you're taking a complement of that graph, which is giving you a genus G Hamblebody, but that not lives in. And this is an example of that. It was not any obvious thing, but that's an example of that. So he gave an infinite set of examples. Then in 2004, Figuerio Martelli. In 2004, Fregierio Martelli and Petronio were trying to list small hyperbolic manifolds with totally geodesic boundaries. So they were doing them with a certain level of complexity. And they came across this example. And I'll come back to that one in just a little bit too. Okay. And then I just want to mention that Josh Howley and Jessica Purcell in their paper in 2018, which is much more general than this, but one of the particular corollaries to what they were working on is if you've got We're working on is if you've got a knot and you project it to the boundary of a handle body and you get an alternating projection satisfying certain conditions, it has to be alternating, cellular, some other things, and it crosses the boundary of each of the essential disks in that handler body enough times, then in fact it would be hyperbolic. So there is this way of generating lots of examples from hand. So that's another option. That's not the way we're going to do it though. So we're going to do a different way. And this is joint work with Joy Chen, who's an L graduate student at MIT. An now graduate student at MIT. And instead of projecting to the boundary of the Hammond body, we're going to project, we're going to think of the handle body as being a surface cross I, where that surface has boundary. Most of the time, I'll be thinking of a disk with some holes in it cross an interval, and then I've got a projection on the surface of it that is alternate. Okay, so that's going to be the kind of way we're going to think about these particular objects. And this is the theorem that we proved. And I kind of restated it. I tried to restate it in terms of states. It actually is easier to read. Is easier to read, but less obvious why it's relevant if I did it in a different way. But I'm going to try to think about it in terms of stakes. And I want you to think, instead of a closed-orientable surface, just think of a sphere. Okay? So imagine I have a sphere and I've got a link sitting in the sphere cross I. I'm going to assume I have what's called a cellular. Actually, let me just say cellular just means all of the complementary regions are disks. It's irrelevant if you think of this as the sphere. They're always, that's always going to be the case if you're on a sphere. Okay, so it's a. Okay, so it's a closed oriental surface, it's an alternating projection. I'm going to pick some points, which are going to be my states. So you find a collection of states in the complement of the link. I'm going to let F be that particular original surface minus neighborhood to those, so I put in little holes. I've got this link sitting on there. And I need the following conditions. It's a set of conditions I need. Number one, the projection has to be weakly primed. Now, weekly prime means there are. Weekly prime means there can't be any circles that hit the knot twice that bound the disk with some non-trivial knotting inside it. Okay, so that's what it means to be weakly prime. But if I put a stake in there, now it's weakly prime. Okay, so you can kind of deal with things that aren't weakly prime by adding some stakes inside it and getting rid of the problem. So I need it to be weakly prime. I need every region to contain at most one stake. You cannot put more than one stake. One stake, you cannot put more than one stake in a region. The minute you do it, it will not be hyperbolic anymore. I can have two adjacent regions, namely two regions sharing an edge, to both have stakes in them. And then this last condition is messy. Okay, and I apologize for being messy. We'll look at examples in a second. But I will put it down here. There are no simple closed curves on the projection intersecting the projection exactly in the non-empty set of crossings. I promise I'll show you a picture in just a second, such that it bisects the crossing. So it's only intersecting across. The crossings, so it's only intersecting the crossings, bisects the crossings, and each of the two regions at that crossing that the curve doesn't pass through have a stake in them. Okay, I'm going to call this, and I'll explain why when I show you a picture, a pond path curve. If I have all these conditions, then in fact, the complement of that link in the Hamlet body in F cross I is in fact TG hyperbolic. Okay, so let's look at a couple of examples. This one satisfies all the conditions. I'm not going to talk about that too much. That's flat, this is on the torus. That's flat. This is on the torus. It satisfies all the conditions. This one has one of these pond path curves. What does that mean? Here's a curve on the surface. It passes through only crossings. And I want you to imagine, somehow I think about this in England, where it's a beautiful park in England, walking along, and you come to an intersection. And if you go left, you'll hit a water, you'll hit a pond, and if you go right, you'll hit a pond. Similarly, down here, you get to the next intersection, you go left, you hit a pond, you go right, you hit a pond. Here's another example here. Pond. Here's another example here: left or right, at each intersection, there's a pond, there's a pond. Okay, keeping in mind, although this outer thing looks kind of like an ocean, it's really just an expanded state. So there are all kind of states and neighborhoods and states we think of as ponds. I'm sorry, why is there not one in A? It seems that the same one should exist in A. So the reason is if I took the loop right here, right, you'll notice if I went to the right at this intersection, I hit upon. But if I went to the left, this loop. But if I went to the left, this region does not have a function. Okay, so that's the condition. Now, you might ask, well, what's the problem? These actually preclude hyperbolicity. What's the problem with these pond path curves? And this isn't the best picture, but at least I can give you a little bit of an idea. So this blue curve is my pond path curve. The green curve is the knot. And then what you're seeing in purple is the boundary of the corresponding. Is the boundary of the corresponding annulus, and there's an annulus made up of four discs. One of the discs looks like this one right here. I didn't draw all four of the discs in this picture because it gets really ugly really fast. But there are, in fact, four discs that sort of look like this one here, and then there's another one on the bottom here, and another one out here, another one out here, that together actually create this annulus that precludes hyperbolicity. So the annulus is there in a case like this. So pi-path curves cause problems, okay, and that's what. Cause problems. And that's why we want to avoid interpreting. Okay. All right, so now I want to go back to hyperbolicity of staked knots and links. And I want to prove actually, so you give me any knot or link in the three-sphere. I claim it has a diagram that can be staked to be TG hyperbolic. Now, as many know, if you're looking at knots in the three-sphere, then the non-hyperbolic ones are all the satellite knots, all the torus knots. Satellite knots, allotaurus knots, composite knots, which are also satellite knots. There's lots and lots of knots that are not hyperbolic. Here we're saying it doesn't matter, start with any one of those you want. We can actually stake it and make it hyperbolic. So hyperbolicity will be defined for any knot diagram, any knot that you want to start with. And here's the idea. So imagine I've got this projection of my knot sitting on my surface, and as we know, actually, this is on the disk, actually, because this is in the 3-sphere. Disk actually because this is in the three-sphere. So I'm sitting on my surface. And as we know, given any projection of any knot, you can always change a subset of the crossings to make it alternate. Okay, so this is a well-known fact that you can always change crossings to make it alternate. So what I'd like to do is pick my stakes to either side of a crossing that I want to change from what it is to the opposite one to make this alternating. And in the 3D picture, I now have one of my rails over here and one of my rails over here. And one of my rails over here, and I've got this disc right here that's punctured twice by the knot. I'm going to cut open my handle body along that disc, twist a full twist, glue it back, and that will reverse the crossing. But that'll be a homeomorphism of the complement. So I can reverse crossings, so this looks great. So I can just do that. I can just put two states to either side of my crossing and just switch the crossing from what it is to the opposite. The crossing from what it is to the opposite. Okay, so that looks great, but it has some problems. It could create adjacent stakes, so I could want to change this crossing here, and then there's another crossing over here, and I can do it. This shaded disc right here. So, see this shaded disc here? I'm going to cut along it, so now I have two copies of it. I'm going to take the left side, twist the full 360, and then glue back, and that'll reverse the cost off. Okay? Yeah, great. Please, anybody ask questions. Please, anybody ask questions. Okay, so, but unfortunately, it could create adjacent states, or even worse, a pond path curve, right? There's no reason why I couldn't get a pawn path code out of that. So I'd like to somehow deal with that problem. And so here's, oh, and here's an example, right? You could just say, why don't you just take the checkerboard shading of your particular knot diagram on the sphere, take your checkerboard shading, put a stake in each one of the shaded regions, and then I could change any crossing because I've already got two. And I could change any crossing because I've already got two states to either side of any crossing. The problem is that always generates a pond-path curve. You just take a curve that goes around any region, that will be a pond-path curve. So that's not going to work. So that's the problem. So how can I fix this? Well, we're going to do a little trick. So let's imagine we're back in a situation where I've got a non-alternating diagram and I want to change certain crossings. And this is one of the crossings I want to change to make it alternate. So I want to change this crossing. Well, I'm going to do what's called a swirl. Well, I'm going to do what's called a swirl move. And a swirl move means you take a little piece of the projection here and you just pull it around the crossing. So that's magnitude. Just pulled it around the crossing. And what that does is it shifts the crossing you want it to change. So this used to be the place where it was non-alternating, but now that was the wrong crossing, but now I put an over crossing here and an over crossing here. That's no longer the problem. This is the crossing you now want to change to make it alternating. I've moved the crossing that I want to change to make it alternate. Okay? I want to change to make it alternate. Okay? Great, and then I'll just put some stakes in here and here, and I can change that crossing. But again, this stake is to the outside, and there might be another stake, and there might be a pond path move, etc. So I'm going to do the move again. Okay, so I do a scroll move again on this crossing, and now this is the crossing that I want to change. And now I can stake to either side of it, and because these two regions are contained in this picture, they won't get near any other regions. There can't be any pond path curves because if you have a pond path curve going through here, it's The pont path curve going through here, it's stuck. It can't pass through here. You get a continuation of the pont path occur. And so, this is the way that I deal with the problem. So, that's the idea. Yeah, sorry, it says all that. So, then once I do this particular idea, I can change the diagram to make it alternating so that it satisfies all of those conditions of that theorem that I said. There's no contract curves, and therefore this guarantees that it will be the same. Okay. Okay, I'm looking at this picture. Yeah. Okay. All right, so every knot can be staked to be hyperbolic. I'm going to define the state volume of a link to be the least hyperbolic volume for any hyperbolic staking of the link. Okay, so that's the goal. Conjecture of K is a hyperbolic knot, if state volume is the hyperbolic volume. Namely, you stake it with one stake, you get a knot and a ball. You'll remember when you talk about Tg hyperbolicity, if you have any sphere. TG high probosity. If you have any sphere boundaries, you can cap it off with a ball. And so the conjecture is that that's always true. It's known for the twist knots, but that's the only category it's known for. State volume of the trivial knot and the trefoil knot is exactly this number that I mentioned before, 3.6638. There's a trivial knot that's been staked with two states. There's a trefoil knot that's been staked with two states. No one stake is hyperbolic. You can't stake the trivial knot or the trephole knot and get something hyperbolic. Two states are the Hyperbolic. Two states are these two component lengths with volume 3.6638. And as I mentioned, Ian able proved that the volume of a hyperbolic to the component length has to be 3.6638. When you stake this one, you actually get the lighthead link. This one also you get the way head link in terms of the complement is a homeomorphic to the complement of the weighted link. And then if you have three or more states, you have totally geodesic boundary, and Miyamoto proved that if you have a manifold with totally geodesic closed boundary, it has to have a volume of at least 6.452. So these are definitely the smallest. Too. So these are definitely the smallest that you can get. I want to look more at stake links of three or more stakes. So there is totally neutesic boundary. There's other cases that didn't have totally neodesic boundary. I mentioned this one here, which is the smallest volume known, has volume 7.797. But when my student Lizzie and I started working on this, we didn't know about that one, so we were trying to look at simple examples. This is Lizzie, she's doing an undergraduate thesis with me right now. And we called these bongles. So bongos are very simple examples. So, fondles are very simple examples that look like this, where it is a trivial knot, and I've put stakes in each one of these little monogons that I created here. The monogons can be to the outside or to the inside. It can be alternating or it can be non-alternating. Okay, so these are what we call bongles. This example that I mentioned, that first example that Alan and I came up with, is actually just one of these really simple bongles, a little three bongo that you see right here. All these ones that Figario had, those are also all bongos. He also proved some nice. All bongles. He also proves some nice facts about buying from those of that infinite goodness. Okay, so here's something that Lizzie and I proved. A bongle is hyperbolic if and only if it's alternating. So I start with the diagrams. This is why I think it's alternating. And to prove that if it's alternating, it satisfies, you just have to show it satisfies those conditions of that theorem that I mentioned, that pi L is weakly prime, that's obvious. Every region contains at both one state, no two adjacent regions. Stake, no two adjacent regions both contain stakes, and then you check that there's no pond path curves, which there clearly aren't because anything because through one of these crossings, there's not another stake on the other side. Okay, so that's easy. So B is TG hyperbolic. If it's non-alternating, the first thing to notice is if you had a non-alternating dongle, there would have to be two of these segments that are not alternating. So if you have an under-under, there must be an over-over. Okay, so you must have at least that. That. So let's suppose I have two overs like this. In fact, there is a hidden annulus in this picture. I'm going to show you the picture here, but you take an annulus and you create a little flap. It's sort of like the flap that you find on long juns, and you flip it up and you put it on the rail, and then you just take your knot and it travels around it like this, and that annulus will preclude hyperbolicity. Okay, so if you have something like that, that doesn't work. So we can assume there are none like this or. None like this for two wonders. If you have an innie and an outie, meaning one's to the outside and one's to the inside, you can take the two rails and cross them over each other and you get a picture like this. That still, that annulus, sorry, that Moby span you see right there actually isn't in the diagram because there has to be a second way for this thing that, for this part of the bondle that's going in to come out. But if you have two of those, that precludes, so if there's two pairs like that, that precludes hyperbolicity. That precludes hyperplicity, so we can assume that there are not two things that look like this. So, assume there's not a pair of these, one and then another. And then the last case is what if I have two unders and two overs next to each other. This is the sort of messiest case, and that precludes hyperbolicity because of this surface, which I have not taken the time to try to draw. I don't even know if I'll be able to draw it in Adobe Illustrator, but it's. Adobe Illustrator, but it's sort of an ugly surface here. The yellow is one boundary of the angulus, the green is a different boundary of the angulus. This eight gets glued to this eight, this nine gets glued to this nine. It's sort of a messy picture, but in fact, it does preclude hyperbolicity. Okay, and then the last thing I'll say, because I'm running out of time, if you have one of these bundles and you switch in-ease to out-ease, that will change the volume. Okay, so here you see a volume 23.7, here 27.78. 27.78. However, if you have two bundles with the same numbers of innis and outies, that will also always give you the same volume. And so that's something that Listing I recently proved. So you can reorder them as long as you don't change the number of how many are in and how many are out. And you get these grades. It's okay. And I am just, I think I won't take the time to say any of this stuff, but you can put in more interesting, other than just the bottles, you can put in more interesting tangles, and you can. You can put in more interesting tangles, and you can, if they have certain properties, you can get lower bounds of volumes, et cetera. And I think I'm going to skip this, other than that, Daniel. He did really nice work too. And I will stop there. Thank you very much. Any questions? Yeah, so um you you had a couple of results about uh things having the same volume. Are they actually the same geometry or it's Are they actually the same geometry, or it's different geometries with the same volume? So, the way we prove, right, for instance, that one I just showed you, this one, the way we prove those are the same volume is we actually get decompositions into bipyramids, so two tetrahedrals stuck together. Okay, and it turns out that the angle, but these are truncated tetrahedra on certain vertices and ideal vertices on the other, and we can show. On the other, and we can show that the collection of what set for both of these two are exactly identical geometrically. So they're geometrically an identical set. They're glued together in different ways, but geometrically they're an identical set that gives you the complete hyperbolic structure. And that's how you show it. These are very common for us to put decomposition, triangulation, and the trunking that you need. We have a longer break until 3C routine. So just a small announcement that please sign up for short talks as soon as possible, just to give us a chance to put you in the reasonable time on Thursday night. And anyone told us like any topic.
