Hello everyone, both in the person audience and a live audience. So we are going to have the second part of lecture by Joshua on sustainable energy system for remote community. Thank you. Okay, so good morning, everybody. We're going to continue our foray into looking at different technologies for sustainable energy projects in remote communities. And I was very happy with. And I was very happy with the discussion that we had yesterday. It was nice. We had a lot more conversation than I anticipated. And so we made it a little slow through our slides, but that's perfectly fine. What I aim to go through today is finishing off where we left off yesterday, which was talking about hydraulic turbines. Here we are. And then I'm going to show. And then I'm going to shift a little bit and concentrate on wind and solar, okay, today. And I'm going to give enough theory to make you dangerous in the context of understanding how these technologies work. And just as I mentioned last class, the idea here is to provide a surface level kind of insight and understanding about how these technologies actually work. Okay. Okay. All right. So we talked at the end. All right, so we talked at the end of the lecture yesterday about the fact that you have in hydraulic turbines two types that extract energy from the head difference in the flow, and they work more or less on two separate principles. When you have a high head difference but a low flow rate, the most efficient way of getting the energy out is to Of getting the energy out is to convert your head into kinetic energy and push against a runner and make it spin. That's what we call an impulse turbine, an a Pelton turbine with where you have jets squeezing out air or excuse me, squeezing out water as a jet into and then hitting buckets on a runner and resulting in a torque. Like this is an example of an impulse. Is an example of an impulse turbine. The other approach is to allow the pressure drop. And another important point here is that in an impulse turbine, the change in pressure or the conversion of pressure energy into kinetic energy happens before the turbine is entering the turbine. And that's what the jet does. If you think about it, you have this very. Does if you think about it, you have this very high pressure fluid. When you pass it through a jet, you convert the pressure into kinetic energy. It begins squirting out, but it squirts out, and the pressure in the fluid is now atmospheric pressure, and it's converted the pressure energy to kinetic energy. It went from being a slow-moving, pressurized fluid to a fast-moving, not pressurized fluid. That's what the impulse turbine does. In a reaction turbine, Impulse turbine does. In a reaction turbine, the pressure change occurs in the turbine itself, and the turbine equipment rotates in response to that pressure change. So in that sense, this is kind of a little bit more similar to a wind turbine, where it's not the impulse of the wind pushing against the blades, but it's the aerodynamic forces of the wind as it flows around the blades that generates the torque. Same idea in the reactor. Same idea in the React shed turbine. Okay. The other point is the flow fills the runner completely, and you have equipment upstream and downstream that is essential for the operation of the turbine in bringing the flow on and off of the turbine and adjusting the pressure. Okay. So, this spiral casing is critical to introduce swirl into the flow. Why that is necessary is imparent if you look at Necessary is inherent if you look at the equation that governs the amount of torque you get out. Essentially, a turbine is a device that removes the swirl from the flow, removes angular momentum. And there's an equation called Euler pump or turbine equation that gives the amount of work you can get out as the amount of angular momentum you add or take away. Add in the case of a pump, take away in the case of a turbine. So this volume or scroll. So, this volume or scroll adds in the swirl. The draft tube is where the flow, which is very low pressure coming out of the turbine, is gradually brought back up to a pressure that's commensurate with the flow downstream. Okay, the two broad categories are Francis turbine, which is what's shown here, and its principle of operation is based off of the change in velocity and the change in the components in the velocity. Change in the components in the velocity within the rotating piece. I won't go into that in detail. And that relates to the efficiency and then I do give a worked example. And then the other type is a Kaplan turbine. And a Kaplan turbine is essentially a boat propeller spinning the other way. It's exactly the principle of a boat propeller, even looks like a boat propeller. Propeller, it even looks like a boat propeller, but instead of adding work to the fluid, it takes work away and generates power. Can I ask something? Yes. So on a turbine you showed yesterday, there was a turning equipment, rotating equipment, and there was kind of hoses that were directed. And you said they should be in like in a two. In a they should be located such that they're in like less than 180 degrees. Which, which turbine is it? Yeah, so this is the impulse turbine, and the name of the turbine is called the Pelton turbine. Yeah, Pelton, Francis, and Kaplan are the names of people that invented these turbines. Thank you. All right. I provide an example as well for how a caplan turbine works. So we don't have the solution. Cap and turbine works. We don't have the solution. We'll have to provide that later. That being said, okay, we've looked at the kind of conventional turbines that are used in producing hydroelectricity. When you're looking at the kinds of hydroelectric dams that are for large-scale utility generation for powering cities, like Kelowna, it's powered by a dam near Revelstoke. Most of BC is powered that way. Most of BC is powered that way. The large hydroelectric dams that you'll see, like the Hoover Dam and the Shasta Dam, Three Gorges Dam in China, and the big dams in the world, they're all Francis or Kaplan device. If you have higher pressure change, but a much lower flow rate, then you prefer an impulse machine. It also be like a Pelton churn. Okay. Tidal power is a bit different, and I'm not going to go into great detail on. And I'm not going to go into great detail on tidal or wave energy. Suffice to say, if you're looking at a remote community and it's on the coast, and you can demonstrate that there's a high tidal change, that change in the elevation of water represents a head that you could use to generate power. Also, tides mean water is moving in and out very repeatedly, right? Repeatedly, right, in a very clear, periodic manner. And you could take advantage of the kinetic energy of that water as it's moving in and out. Last week, earlier in the week, Richard Carson presented and he talks, he didn't talk so much about tidal work energy, but he does a lot of work in tidal energy. And a tidal stream that's based off of kinetic extraction of the kinetic energy effectively is really identical. Effectively is really identical to a wind turbine. Its operation is almost exactly the same. And the turbines look themselves look very, very similar. A big difference, of course, is it's a lot smaller for a given power output. And that's merely because the fluid is about a thousand times more dense. So everything else being the same, you're going to generate a thousand times more power per unit area. Just the density being that much higher. How comes the density is that much higher? Because in a wind turbine, the fluid is air, and a water turbine is water. Kind of with the river, kind of like the hydrostatics. One could take one of these things and put it in a river as well. But that's generally not what I see in terms of extraction. I see in terms of extracting energy from the river. The better approach is to take advantage of the head difference within that river. But you'll do see sometimes like on YouTube, you find some hobbyist and he makes some, you know, handmade one of these things and uses it to power his cottage, right? Anyways, one could do that. But the other way of generating energy from a title head is, well, let's put it. Is well, let's put in just like we put a dam in our river, let's put a dam in our tide, and we'll hold the water in a certain place and generate a delta H. And then I can let the water out, and while I'm letting it out, I'll let it out through a turbine and I can generate a work. And that's what a garage system is. You just build a, if you like, a fence, a pen, a dam for the water, and you hold the water. And you hold the water at the different tides, and you generate these delta changes in the head between your high tide level and your low tide level on the two sides of your barrage. And you can do that by having sluice gates that open and close. A lot of barrages are built that you have a road on top. So you can, it's a good bridge at the same time as a barrage. And then you build the barrage with the turbine that's able to work one way or the other, right? So it can work efficiently. Can work efficiently no matter which direction the water is moving. Those are the two systems. The equations for generating work are exactly the same as for wind turbines, but the high water density makes it more compact. When you have a barrage, the amount of work that you can produce is intermittent because you need a certain delta. Because you need a certain delta between the heights of the water on either side of your barrage. But the nice thing is that it's not like wind intermittent, which you can't predict. The tide is intermittent in a very regular manner and repeatable manner. And so if you think about it, if you have a single pool and you hold water on one side of the pool and on the other side of the pool and you allow for these to be different, you're only going to generate power when there's a sufficient head difference. When there's a sufficient head difference, okay? So here's the ocean level. The tide is rising, and now you're filling your pool. As long as there's a big enough delta H, difference in the water level in the pool, you can generate power. Once the difference in the water level gets too small, you can't generate power anymore, right? You can't overcome the internal friction and whatnot in your turbine. So now you stop generating power until the turbine. Generating power until the tide starts going out again. Now, your pool is more full than your ocean, and you let the water out the other direction. So, you can then generate a second production of power. So, you have two power production periods within one tidal period, right? You produce power twice within a single tidal period. And one could take your pool and break it in half. Now you have two pools. Half. Now you have two pools. And you let water into pool A during one portion of the ocean tide. And so you would have another pool with just slightly out of phase from this one. And that allows you to generate power a little bit more uniformly. Okay. And you could do that umpteen times and generate completely uniform power. I've only seen two pool systems. They give you relatively uniform power. relatively uniform power that with some power conditioning electronics you can you can you know feed an electrical grid uh but me and then sorry oh just a just a quick question so because i've been to the bay of bomby i know the tie is really really high yeah we which which way is more effective you know um that's a good question for richard um canada i forget if it was in nova scotia I forget if it was in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, but there was a barrage-based tidal energy system that operated for some decades, but now is decommissioned. Yeah, it has quite substantial ecological impacts. You can appreciate where you're putting a giant dam and you're holding the tide in, right? That stops fish from coming in and out. It holds the water in that tide in an unnatural way. You can imagine the ecological impact. You can imagine the ecological impacts are going to be significant. On the other hand, your garage could act as a bridge or it could act as other things, right? So you have some other benefits. Not to mention, if you try to put in a hydrokinetic system, those, especially in the Bay of Fundy, where you have the flow coming through it at very high speeds, there's a lot of energy there, a lot of energy density, but it's hard to build systems that are robust enough. And so, to my knowledge, there aren't any commercial title. There aren't any commercial tidal energy systems even yet installed in the Bay of Funding, right? There's still research projects and ongoing development, and it's not yet reached a full commercially implementable scale at the bay of funding, to my knowledge. And so the answer is like both or neither, right? One has worked commercially for a while, but it's not being used in Canada anymore. And others, there are some large barrage-based systems. There are some large barrage-based systems installed in the world. I know in South Korea, there was a very significant one, and it actually kind of generated an artificial lake that was also designed for recreational purposes and also to prevent, I think maybe it was to prevent like impacts of the tide on what they were trying to do with irrigating and the change of the land use for agricultural. Land used for agricultural purposes, right? So, yeah, you're kind of changing the environment with these barrages in a more severe way. All right, then one could look at using the energy available on waves, right? Tide and waves are a bit different. So in a tidal system, you're taking advantage of the delta in the height or the kinetic energy of the tide as it moves in and out. In a wave energy system, you're taking advantage of the periodic oscillation in your water. Periodic oscillation in your water column. And there are so many different kinds of wave energy converters. And I'm not going to go into detail about all of them. Yeah, if you are interested in different kinds of wave energy converters, I can provide another link to a full lecture that I give on ocean energy systems. But you'll find that there's not very many commercially in use. Commercially in use, and there's all these companies that pop up with a new idea, and then after a few years, go bankrupt. And there's like dozens of these companies. And the way that you extract energy from waves is really different depending on whether you're in a shallow water, in a deep water, whether you're taking advantage of the change in pressure that you get as the water column rises or grows, or if you're taking advantage of the Or, if you're taking advantage of the motion that you can put from those waves onto a body. Or you can have a fact that your waves result in an undulating surface. And so there's dozens and dozens of different types of wave energy converters. And some suggest, you know, like there's some indication that they could work, but it's not easy. And to my knowledge, very few, if any, have really found significant commercial applications. Significant commercial application. Other aspects, of course, of hydroelectric systems are you have to create a reservoir generally for conventional hydroelectric power plants, which creates upstream and downstream impacts. Dam failures are very uncommon, but they're one of these high consequence, low likelihood events. Right? It's a low, very low likelihood of a dam failing, but if it did. But if it did, the consequences are very substantial for people that live downstream. There are instances of dam failures. None in North America come to mind, but some in China in the 70s and 80s come to mind where many tens of thousands of people died as a result of the dam failing and downstream villages and communities being flooded. Question? Was there a question? I thought Boober Dam did a one by zoning one. And data one by design. Okay. Yeah, I don't know. It's an old banner, very possible. Hydroelectric power systems are low cost operationally and very high cost capitally, right? If you're paying attention to the news, Sight C Dam in BC, it was like decided to be built maybe about 15 or 20 years ago. And it was supposed to be, you know, some billion dollars. And now it's like five or six times more billion dollars. And it's still not even available. And it's still not even available at the present time. Okay. Then, some types of hydropower systems have very low power density, right? So, for example, wave energy systems, very, very low. The energy is abundant, but it's highly dispersed spatially, right, in the waves. And then as well, barrage-based systems are also very low power density for the amount of area you need to create a barrage, generally. Okay, so I'm going to shift gears now to wind power, which may be a little bit more. Wind power, which may be a little bit more relevant to what we talked about. And I can take advantage of what Richard and Adam presented last week. And we looked at last week all the factors that affect the amount of energy available to be removed by a wind turbine. And what we saw from last week is that it relates to the wind velocity that approaches the turbine cube. That approaches the turbine cubed, the area swept by the turbine, and the wind density. And that's the amount of energy that's available in the wind. But that's not the amount of energy that we can actually remove. Imagine if we were somehow able to remove all of it. What would happen to the wind? It would stop. So now we have no more wind coming. Can we remove any more? We can't because the wind. We can't because the wind stopped. And so, fundamentally, it's impossible to remove all of the energy from the wind. Because if you did, you'd have no more wind. And so one can actually derive, I'm going to skip ahead a little bit, one can derive theoretically the maximum energy that can possibly remove from the wind. And this is called the Betts limit. Just one second. Has anyone heard about the Betts limit? Has anyone heard about the BETS limit before? Has anyone seen it derived? Okay, I'm going to derive it. It's not going to take more than a few minutes. And this will be very useful for you because every now and again, somebody comes up with this new doodad or whatchamacallit that claims to enhance the energy efficiency of a turbine by so much. And then when you look at it, if it violates Bett's law, you can very quickly know that it doesn't pass the smell test. Yes, you're right. The snell test, yes, why is it intuitively v cubed? I would think kinetic energy, like v squared, right? Why is it cube? Yes, uh, that was discussed last week, but the answer is because it's the flux of kinetic energy, right? You have kinetic energy that's being moved past the turbine, and so it's uh rho v squared times v that moves it by. Okay, so with this, I'm going to switch over to my. Oh, I forgot my notes. Can you toss me my little black folder there? And I'm going to go through a very, very quick and dirty derivation of this BETS limit, which I think is going to be beneficial because at least now through the understanding the BETS limit, you'll get a sense of what fundamentally is limits the work that Is limits the work that you can generate from Truevine. All right. Folks on the Zoom, can you see my note? I think I'm sharing my full screen. We can see it on there. They can see it. Okay, okay. Assuming it all is working. They can see it. They can see it, yeah. Robots on it, okay. Fantastic. He's a polite bow. No, we can't. Not anymore. Of course, it's uh today is the day that my pen has to die. I don't understand why because actually there's no battery in this pan. Well, I think I know I'm missing some drivers on this dang tablet. All right. So, what I'll do instead is if I do the is if I do the derivation on the board, I think the camera can catch most of what is being presented. So the folks on the Zoom, I'm going to do this derivation on the board and hopefully you can see. And if I'm not writing clearly enough, please unmute yourself and say that I need to write bigger or something like that. All right. All right, so this is my turbine, and I'm gonna draw a control volume around my turbine, and I'm gonna consider what happens to the flow entering this turbine with a certain pressure and velocity. Is this visible to you folks on the Zoom? The Zoom, maybe I can draw with the black marker. Is that better? I can see it. Okay, thank you for letting me know, baby. And my control volume is far enough upstream of my turbine that it doesn't feel the effect of the turbine. So, what I have here is my wind speed upstream of the turbine and the atmospheric pressure that's present. And I'm simplifying. And I'm simplifying my analysis. I'm neglecting the fact that my wind, of course, has a velocity distribution that varies with the height from the ground. And I'm neglecting the fact that it's very varying in time as a result of diurnal variations and velocity variations as a result of turbulence, et cetera. All of that I'm neglecting. And I'm just treating that what's coming into this disk rotor is a uniform speed V. A uniform C V and pressure P, P atmosphere. And then I'm going to consider a streamline that goes up to my disc. I'm treating my turbine as a disc that mysteriously is able to extract momentum and power from the fluid. So I'm neglecting all of the aerodynamic processes involved in that extraction. Involved in that extraction. And I'm just imagining that my turbine has this magic disk that can remove energy. And this is point one, which is the streamline up to the disk. Then right downstream of the disk, I have point two. And then my streamline continues. Far, far away, the wind, there's a wave. The wind, there's a wake. We understand all of that. We did that from last class. But far, far away, the wake is lost, and what you're left with is some exit velocity, and it recovers back to your atmospheric pressure. And so, if I were to plot pressure and velocity along the Velocity along this streamline, my pressure would look something like this. As it approaches the rotor, the flow begins to slow down because it knows that this rotor is removing momentum. And so the pressure goes up. The rotor removes momentum and Momentum, and in so doing, applies a force on the fluid. And so the momentum of the fluid goes down, but you can't violate mass conservation. The same amount of flow that goes in still has to go out because the rotor doesn't suck up the air. It doesn't destroy some air. And so the velocity can't change across the rotor. So then the only way for my momentum to change is for the pressure to go down. And so across my rotor, my pressure drops. My pressure drops. This will be 0.1, and this is 0.2. And then my pressure gradually will recover to whatever the far-field value atmospheric pressure is. And this is over my rotor. That process takes place over my rotor. And this analysis basically imagines the rotor as just a disk, what's called a rotor. Just a disk, what's called a rotor disk. Is that negative pressure at Tom, at two? Imagine that this data is arbitrary. Yeah, of course it's not negative in absolute sense, but in fluid mechanics, often we'll use gauge pressures, and so atmospheric is zero, and then you're dealing with negative gauge relative to atmospheric. Okay, so then my velocity is going to look like this. As I get close to my rotor, it's slowing down. Rotor, it's slowing down. Across my rotor, my velocity doesn't change because we're imagining my rotor to be very thin. And the mass that comes in has to equal the mass that goes out. My air density doesn't change appreciably. We talked about that. So my velocity doesn't change appreciably. And it's going to look something like this. And eventually, we know that this wake is going to recover and it will regain back after. Regain back after everything mixes out again. But this analysis doesn't look that far downstream. It looks far enough downstream that we can neglect any non-uniformity in this direction, but it still has less, if you like, there's a velocity deficit in the wake. Okay. And the okay, so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to apply Bernoulli's equation. Going to apply Bernoulli's equation from the entrance of my control volume to point one. And Bernoulli's equation is a representation of the first law of thermodynamics. It's just basically energy balance. So I have P atmosphere my inlet pressure over rho plus. rho plus one half velocity at the inlet squared. So I'm going to use VI and the inlet and VE for the exit equals P1 over rho plus one half row B one squared. We would also have a G term, a G Z term. A G term, a GZ term to do with potential changes, but we're assuming that our streamline doesn't change elevation much, so that term can be neglected. Yes, Nadia. Are we assuming constant density? Yes, and we're assuming constant density, and that's a reasonable assumption because this is constant density from here to here, right? The density through this control volume is not going to change much, even in real life. Again, we're Again, we're neglecting diurnal variations, annual variations, all of that's neglected. This is a highly simplified. Okay, so this is, I'm going to call this equation one. This is applying Bernoulli equation from the inlet to point one. Bernoulli equation cannot be applied between one and two because we have work being removed that violates a Bernoulli's equation. So, but I can apply it again between the outlet and point two. The output and 0.2. So here, 0.2 over rho plus one half rho b two squared equals the exit pressure statement rules here. All right. Now, I'm going to make an assumption that my exit pressure and my inlet pressure are about the same. And I'm going to say that the pressure change in my turbine or from the inlet to the outlet is not so. From the inlet to the outlet is not so substantial, and so I could just call those two pressures equal. So now I'm going to subtract these two equations, and what I find is P1 minus P2 equals one half times rho V inlet squared minus V1 squared plus V2 squared minus V exit squared. And I'm going to make another. And I'm going to make another assumption that V1 and V2 are very similar. And in fact, what we often call these is the blade velocity or the velocity that will be experienced at the blade. And we know that there is not a velocity that's experienced at the blade, right? The velocity over the blade is. Velocity over the blade is varying, et cetera. But within this analysis, we imagine that our blade is just an actuator, an actuator disc. In fact, that's what this theory is called, actuator disk theory. And so if that's the case, then these terms drop. And what we have is P1 minus P2 equals one half row. Oops. V I squared minus V E squared. All right, now I'm going to have to make space. Now, if I look at my control volume, I look at the actual, the axial force on my control volume. The force in the x direction is going to be equal to the area of my blade or area of my rotor. Or area of my rotor times P1 minus P2. So this is the force on my control volume. If you like, it's the force on my instantaneous momentum flaps.  That velocity that you have right here at the blade, let's call that the blade velocity. And your momentum flux is going to be the difference between the momentum in and out of your control volume. This is at the exit, which is equal to your blade velocity times. Blade velocity times the area times rho, that's your mass flow rate times Vi minus VE. What is upper dot? Yeah, thank you. M dot is the mass. M dot is the mass flow rate of air in kilograms per second that passes through that turbine. Okay, now I can equate these two expressions call this expression three and this expression four. And this is what we get. By equating these two, our area drops off, and we have the The B is equal to, did I scoop a step? I did. Down there, what we get is one half AB row B I squared minus B E squared. Okay, that's expression three. All right. All right. Then when we equate this expression and that expression, then we get that our blade velocity is the mean of what's coming in and what's going on. Yes. So AB is the area of the blade and AB is the velocity of the wheel passing through the blade. Yeah. On the first, on the equation three, just to the right of fx, there is an A. It is also A B, right? Yes. Okay. So we did not do okay. So we did not do okay. I see. Yeah. So if you look at our rotor right from the front, this is my rotor. This is my rotor radius. And then AB is going to be pi times R squared. Exactly. And excellent. Okay. So that's equation, that's that expression. That's that expression. So now let's consider the power. Power developed is the force, axial force or thrust, times the velocity at the plate, right? It's the and W dot is the W, if you like, is. dot is the w if you like is work and w dot is the rate change of work power that's a common way of writing power and i can take my expression from above and this yields one over four a v rho bi squared minus v e squared bi plus v e. And then I can rearrange this a little bit. Pi D. D is my rotor diameter. K. Spreading Row. And we'll call that equation pi. So, this is my work. Now, I'd like to know how my work varies as my speed changes. As the wind goes up, how does my work or the power that I can produce change? So, let's take the derivative. So let's take the derivative of that expression with respect to VB. I'm sorry. I think something, what m dot is equal to rho AB VB? M dot is equal to, yeah, rho V B A B. So it's the mass flow rate of air. You have flow that's going through a certain area, and that flow has a certain density. So the mass that's going through per unit time. That's going through per unit time is the density times the area times the velocity. Okay, you know, I want to know that how you find exactly, for example, the lambda is kilogram over the per second. So I want to know how you find the unit for the right side, that it will also be the unit of the left side. You know, my question about the unit. Row B B yeah, the A B is meter squared. Is uh meters squared meters for okay, so meters cubed and meters cubed dropping out, so then you have kilograms per second. Yes, yeah, all right, so take the derivative of equation five with respect to. With respect to my exit velocity. By the way, W dot is already a derivative, right? Right, yeah. The W dot is already a derivative, if you like, right? It's the rate change of work per unit time. But just think of it as a power, right? The power. And so I want to understand how does my power change as my wind speed changes? As my wind speed changes, and in this case, it's as the exit velocity, the speed that's exiting my turbine changes. And so I can take the derivative of that expression with respect to VE, and I get actually what I want to say is y d square rho over eight. Phi d square rho over eight times pi squared times. Yeah, what I want to say is I want to take the derivative of that quantity and set it equal to zero because I want to find the power. I want to find the I want to find the most amount of velocity that I can remove to get the maximum amount of power. Right? So I want to find the point where that first derivative is zero and I have a maximum. And I want my turbine to extract as much energy as possibly can. And so the Ve at the backside of the turbine is the minimum possible. So that's why I take this derivative and I set it equal to zero. This derivative, and I set it equal to zero, and doing that gives me three Ve squared plus two VE Vi minus Vi squared equals zero. Let's solve for VE. All right, so then that tells me that the optimum power. So, then that tells me that the optimum power, under all the assumptions I've made, is achieved when the exit velocity is one-third of the inlet velocity. So, if my speed of the wind coming into my turbine is nine meters per second, the turbine is going to generate the most power if the velocity leaving the turbine is a third of that, three meters per second, under the simplifying assumptions that I've made. Yes. That I made. Yes. This equation had another solution where V is equal to minus Vi, right? But I get neglected. Right, because I can't have negative velocity. Okay. The flow is going into my control volume and leaving my control volume. So I can neglect that. And that's probably minimal, right? Yeah. I think that's stationary point with minimum maximum of two lowers of this in the chart. That's probably just zero. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. That's another rule for stationary point, but it's right, and I think that that would make sense if it's something it couldn't occur in real life. If you want to install your turbine, right? Perhaps if you have the winds blowing as a like that's yeah, wind 100 yards. Sure, sure, yeah. In a real turbine, I don't think that's possible. Just connecting back to the Is a comment you made at the beginning of this discussion that we can't zero. Right. So, what happens in this form when V is equal to zero? Well, that means that VI will be zero. And so you're generating no word and you're not, then the analysis is not clickable. Right. So this analysis assumes that you have. Is assume that assumes that you have flow into your turbine at some velocity. But if you have no wind, then your turbine is not a turbine. It's just a very expensive decoration. It's just sitting there not doing anything. Okay, but can we still think of it as so? It's not optimal to have VE as small as possible. I mean, right? It's optimal, sure, sure, yeah, sure. It's it's it's for a given input velocity, I want my VE to be the value that maximizes my power production. But I can't make it as small as possible because if I made it zero, then that means there's the flow stopped. And if the flow stops, I'm not producing any power. Producing any power. So I need to slow down that flow with my turbine a certain amount. How much? According to my analysis, a third. And if I do that, then under my assumptions, I'm going to generate the maximum power. And the assumptions that I've made are under idealized conditions, right? All of the, if I were to relax all of these assumptions, the power production drops. So this theory is the maximum that I could. This theory is the maximum that I could possibly generate theoretical shapes. Correct me if Barbara, you did work on turbine spacing, correct? Like the optimal spacing in between turbines. Right. And that's changing the loss mechanisms that are inherent in the stuff going on inside of my control volume that I'm not really accounting for. Okay, okay. Right? It doesn't take into, by adjusting the spacing of these turbines. By adjusting the spacing of these turbines, you still can't get a condition where the turbine is generating more than the maximum power theoretically. Okay, I got you. All you're doing is adjusting the weight losses, which we talked about last week. Yeah. And then, sorry, does that does that also incorporate not weight losses, but like normalization velocity at the end? You know what I mean? Like you have the velocity exit, and then there's yeah, the re-energization of the boundary there. The re-energization of the boundary layer, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so in a turbine, in a wind farm, you're going to have losses due to individual weeks, and then you have losses associated with the reduction of the slowing down, right, right, right, yeah, exactly. So, you all of that is our losses that account for inefficiencies in the wind farm and in the wind turbines. What we're looking at here is what's the maximum work I can actually generate from one of these things, anyways? Generate from one of these things, anyways. Right. And then, on top of that, we have to consider all of the other losses that might be present. But this is looking at if everything else is not present, no other frictional losses, generator losses, any other losses, how much theoretically work can I actually remove from blow? I can't remove all of the energy density because then the flow will stop. But how much can I remove? And that's what this is getting at. Yes, you're. Yeah. Yes, you're. I mean, this is so that's a side question, right? I mean, we've done there's lots of simplified assumptions that people know how sensitive the maximum efficiency is because these yeah, yeah, yeah, because what we do is we we calculate, this is getting ahead of ourselves, but we calculate a capacity factor, which is the amount of production the turbine is giving us compared to its theoretical maximum. Month. And we do all kinds of optimization to improve that as much as we can in terms of tailoring the shape of the blades, adding in a special every turbine manufacturer has a different shape of blade. Why are they all different? Well, because they developed a blade that they think works best. And of course, they're accounting for non-aerodynamic factors as well, like the rigidity of the blade, the longevity of the blade, the manufacturability of the blades, the cost of the materials. Of the blades, the cost of the materials, etc. But nobody broke the 16th or something. I mean, so I don't see why this is not the absolute maximum, this is the maximum you get under lots of simplifying assumptions, right? Yes, but all of these simplifying assumptions are ideal, idealized, right? So if I were to relax all the simplifying assumptions, yeah. Sorry? No, sorry, people. Yeah, if I were to relax all of these. Relax all of these. I suppose the simplifying assumptions I are making here is akin to saying, like, frictionless parts, that kind of thing, right? If I relax that assumption, the constraints are more extreme. So this is under idealized conditions, right? Under idealized conditions where I'm neglecting any of the inefficiencies that may be present as a result of the aerodynamic factors. Factors associated with my blades and everything else, right? This is with a magic turbine that's able to instantaneously adjust and extract momentum from the flow, right? And assuming that my flow in is uniform when I know it's not, and a big portion of my turbine is going to be experiencing less than that rated velocity. It's spherical cow kind of assumptions. Yeah, that's right. And so, if you look at a real cow that's not spherical, you know that it's going to behave less optimally than your ideal, right? Right. Okay. So that's why this is a theoretical maximum and we can't violate it. Because another way of looking at this is that this is the constraint imposed on us by the first law of thermodynamics. us by the first law of thermodynamics. This is the constraint imposed on us by the first law of thermodynamics. And the first law of thermodynamics is embedded in our Bernoulli equation, which I erased. So further addition of any kind of complexity on this model is going to be reducing the amount of power that we get, right? Through power that we get, right? Because of friction and that kind of stuff. That's right. It's going to be opposing. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. But it's nice to know if I'm shooting for something like I have a certain turbine efficiency, what is that compared to the best that I could get? And that's the motivation for this. Because I'd like to know if I have a turbine and it has an efficiency of 58%. Efficiency of 58%. Do I need to invest a lot of money to make it better? And the answer is probably not, because if I were to get 58%, I'm very close to the theoretical maximum. That's a pretty good turbine. And no turbines are that effective. Yesterday we talked about various best turbines. Are there additional best limits for non-wind turbines? One could apply the same approach for hydraulic turbines as well. One thing that's a little bit different. One thing that's a little bit different about hydraulic turbines, if you think about a tidal turbine that's sitting in the water, the water has a surface, a free surface. And so the flow is not free to flow around the turbine in an unconstrained way. Okay? Whereas in wind, it is. And so the free surface imposes a constraint that violates some of my assumptions. And so these hydro kinetic. Hydro kinetic tidal turbines, actually, you can find designs that violate Bett's limit, but that's because of the effect of the free surface. And it's a positive effect, so it actually increases the efficiency. Yeah, it does because it's kind of like putting a lid on the flow and forcing the flow around your turbine. So the turbine can't escape around the sides. The free surface will have other problems, but for certain turbine designs, you can actually. For certain turbine designs, you can actually, in a hydro kinetic sense, do better than this if you take advantage of the constraint that the free surface gives. So the velocity that I said is one-third the velocity, right? Yeah. So for the equation five, you have four-thirds VI in the first turn, and then it's eight ninths DI in the second turn. And so that gives you four over 27 then. And you have two over 27 over there. I'm not sure where I have that too. All right. So thanks, Coda. That's a good question. So what we have here is VE is one-third VI. So I'm going to plug this. So the optimum power is achieved here. I'm going to plug this one third VI into. Into equation for truple equation five. So when I do that I get this. So I have one-third VI squared, it gives me one over nine plus one-third VI. I have a pi d squared over eight here. I think one of us. I think one of us has some arithmetic mistake, and this one's from the textbook, so I'm pretty sure that it's correct. But I'm happy to be proven wrong. My ability to do arithmetic in my head is like just completely gone. But so this is my maximum efficiency based off of the idea that it's the velocity leaving my turbine that yields or gives me a local maxima in terms of my delta dot with respect. alpha dot with respect the derivative of d dot of w dot with respect to my exit velocity. So if I plug in this value into here, I get a power and this is the power that is maximum, right, theoretically. And so my maximum efficiency is just going to be the maximum power divided by the power that I can get. Sorry, the other way around. Which is 16 27ths. Can it be the WLS? WS or the W if it was a pump or a compressor. Is there a tipper on the WL? Oh, oh, yes. No, no. This slide is wrong. This slide is wrong. Yeah, slide is wrong. Think about it like this, right? My turbine is designed to extract power. The bigger one should be on the bottom. When the maximum is smaller, then the double dot, then there's excess. Yeah, it would be like this if it was not a turbine pump, right? Yeah. Okay. So, so. It's really full. So, so, yeah. Uh, this is a nice thing to see once in your life and to see that, oh, yeah, turbines cannot be any efficiency that you would like. There is a certain upper limit to how efficient a turbine can be. You've seen this before, right? I guess. Yeah, okay. And this limit is what we call the Betts limit. And Betz was, I want to say, Dutch. I want to say Dutch, but I'm not sure about that. Person who did this analysis the first time. All right. Here's German. German, thank you. Excellent. I thought you'd not have that realistic, but I was wondering in general how close can we get that the general how close can we get with the current technology to value like is it meaningful to try to improve or is it diminishing returns after this point from a cost point of view sure um so the max is what we showed realistic is 30 to 35 percent the more efficient turbines are the the biggest ones that operate in offshore conditions the um more blades you have the more efficient you can get The more efficient you can get, but there's other challenges. And so, if you look at what we call this power coefficient CP, which is just this, this efficiency here, if you look at optimizing CP or the turbine efficiency, you can do it based off of spinning your blade at different speeds. And the tip speed ratio, it's the ratio of the tip speed to the on. It's the ratio of the tip speed to the oncoming speed, and you get better efficiency at a certain tip speed ratio. That's why, when you look at the load curve for this turbine, it looks like this with respect to this is velocity and this is the power of the turbine. And the reason why it has a certain cut-in speed and a certain cut-out speed, and the reason why it has a certain cut-in speed is because under a certain velocity, you don't generate. Under a certain velocity, you don't generate enough torque to overcome your back EMF and friction and everything else. And the reason why it has less speed at these conditions is because the oncoming blade, the oncoming wind is low, but the turbine wants to rotate at a certain frequency to generate power at a certain frequency, and that's not aerodynamically optimum. But once it starts operating in this condition, then it is aerodynamically optimum and it has. It is aerodynamically optimum, and the blade will be controlled. There's a few ways. One is to adjust the pitch of the blade so that you get a uniform power delivery over that range of wind speeds. And so you're going to have a lower turbine efficiency in this regime as compared to in the design regime. Well, it's just, it feels very interesting that at that speed, like when the At that speed, like when the w dot becomes constant, yeah, flat, I feel like maybe like it should at least kind of like growing in all those slow but a linear pace. So, why does it stay constant? Yeah, yeah, that's because you have to operate your turbine to deliver to deliver power that matches a load, right? Right, so your electricity grid, your electricity. And your electricity, the frequency of your electricity grid needs to be held constant. And so the load needs to balance the supply. And so it's much easier to manage an electricity grid, and probably Cersei can talk more about this, when your supply is well, as uniform as you can, right? And easily controllable. And so, and And I think it's also to do with the internal machinery electronics and everything else. It works better if you have the turbine rotating at a certain speed. Yeah. All right. But again, this power coefficient can be improved by adjusting the tip speed ratio and adding more blades. So we see three bladed turbines. Those are like the dominant utility scale horizontal. Utility scale horizontal axis wind turbine. Why not four or five? The answer is: sure, why not? You could have four or five or six. And what you see is the more blades you have, your power coefficient goes up. But after three, it flattens out, right? So you get a very marginal improvement in efficiency with one additional blade. With a fifth blade, it would be very even more marginal. So why go through the? Marginal. So, why go through the cost of additional blades, weight, and materials, and everything else? If your improvement in your power coefficient or your efficiency, it doesn't change very much. Okay, and then there's another reason why you would want three and not four, because remember, running out of space. Yeah, can I finish one point first? Okay. Yeah. Another reason why you would want three and not four. You, why you would want three and not four is because if you have this uniform velocity, imagine this is my velocity, and I'll imagine I'm looking at the turbine head-on. So here's my blade. Oh, right. I have high load on that blade because it's facing a much larger wind speed. Speed and low load on these blades because they're facing a lower wind speed, right? Now imagine my turbine shifts. Now I have low load and high load. Load, but because they're not pointing straight up, this amount of high load compared to this amount of high load is the same difference as the difference in these two low loads. And so you can actually have a balance. And so you do have oscillating forces, but they're much, much less than if, for example, you had a turbine that looked like this. This four-bladed turbine would generate much more axial thrust under these conditions than in that condition, right? Why is the low one? Because remember that the velocity into the screen is higher here. Imagine this is 10 meters per second, and down here it's 7 meters per second, right? Because my blade is big 200 meters. Blade is big, 200 meters, the diameter might be. And so, over that 200 meters, my wind profile can be non-uniform for the reasons discussed last week. And so the oscillations when you have a three-bladed rotor is much less than if you had a four-bladed rotor like this. And so this would generate a lot of oscillating forces and fatigue when turbine. All right, so that's another reason why three-bladed turbines have. Bladed turbines have won the day. I've seen a photograph of a one-bladed turbine as a research turbine. And it basically consisted of a shaft with a blade on one side and then a counterweight on the other side. And it worked. It works, right? It's one of these one-bladed turbines. Looks funny, but it operated. I actually saw a new, I mean, it doesn't have one blade, but they made it one of those offshore main parts. They made it one of those offshore wind parts. It is like anchored to the seaground, but the wind turbine itself can move. So they can like rotate it and actually even like travel it for like around the radius. Yes. According to Redovin's shows outro. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So if you want to build an offshore wind farm and the ocean is very deep, it doesn't make sense to mount your turbines to the ground. Instead, let's build a floating one. Let's build a floating wind. And these floating wind turbines are ideal for deep, far offshore applications. And so, of course, it's floating. So that means it has the freedom to move around, to those kinds of things. But you design the base so that it's has a large gravity base and yep. Okay. Yeah. Yes, so what was TSR? Tip speed ratio. It's just the omega r. Omega is the rotational speed, r is the radius of the blade at the tip divided by your velocity in. Yeah, and you have an optimum value of that. And so these turbines are controlled to spin at a certain speed for a given wind speed. And the way that you can control the turbine is by adjusting the. Turbine is by adjusting the pitch of the blade. So if it's spinning too slow or too fast, you increase the pitch or decrease the pitch to generate more aerodynamic load. Another way some blades, some turbines are designed is they're stall controlled. So the blades are designed in such a way that as your wind speed goes up a certain amount, the blade performance automatically degrades and it stops generating that torque. And so it doesn't offer. So, it doesn't yield good production anymore. And that means you can have no mechanism. You don't need a mechanism to adjust the pitch. And the smallest turbines, the cheapest ones, are like that. They don't have a mechanism that adjusts the pitch of the blades. Yeah, they're not as efficient, but they're much cheaper. So, just to include and clarify the talk online, so the number of plates, does it make Of plates, does it make more sense to use three or four? Three, okay. Yeah, that's why if you go around, you look at every single utility scale cars, uh, or horizontal axis wind turbine, they're all three. And it's been that way for decades. Okay, yeah. And that was very interesting. I never thought of like why they have all the trees going. Yeah, very good. Um, there's other turbines that have many more than three blades, right? If you think about gas turbines, there's Right, if you think about gas turbines or steam turbines, they have tons more. And the question is: well, why is that? And the answer is because the flow is forced to go past those blades because they exist in a shroud. The other thing that you probably recognize is, I don't know if I have a photograph of it. These old style farm wind turbines that you have, like from an imagine like a picture of. You can imagine like a picture of a farm from Kansas with these old turbines with many, many blades on them. Those were generally not used for generating electricity, but for pumping water. And in that application, you don't care about power, you want starting torque. And so those turbines that are used, they're not even called that generally. They're called windmills, right? That you would have on a farm. They have a large number of blades. They're relatively rooted management. They're relatively rudimentary. The blades are not necessarily very aerodynamic, but they're not designed for power perfection. They're designed for high starting torque to get the pump started to pump water. The windmills that you use, like in the, you know, the Netherlands and Europe for milling grain, those were designed in a similar manner, right? And I think those ones, if I can think about it, I only remember four. About it, I only remember four blades for most of those windmills, those old traditional ones. So that's kind of curious. James, you look puzzled. Yeah, so you go three to four, understand that loss completely. Let's go four to like 15 plates. Then that oscillation no longer occurs. That's right. Right? Why are there 15 plate turbines? So if I take this curve and I plot it out, it becomes completely flat, essentially. So all that extra cost. So, all that extra cost for 15 blades gave me very little marginal increment over three. But I spent five times more money on it. Okay. More than five times more money. Okay. But it's no longer a function of mechanics. Right. Yes, yes. Well, up to a certain point, because as you change the number of blades, you change the porosity of that blade, of the turbine, right? Imagine if you have a million, right? Then your turbine is not a turbine anymore, it's like this big disk. So then, this the actual aerodynamics begin to break down, okay? So then the analysis that led us to these kinds of things is changed. Yeah. Yeah. All right. What time am I supposed to done? Noon or two or three minutes. Two or three minutes. Okay. Minutes, two or three minutes. Okay, we talked about wind-speed distribution a little bit last afternoon, and Adam and Richard talked about it as well. On the Earth, rally distribution is useful, and the way you can use a rally distribution to predict power performance at a given location if you only know the wind speed, that mean wind speed, is useful. I talked about that a little bit yesterday afternoon. And if you have questions, I can go over more this afternoon. There's, for example, an example here. There's even simpler ways of predicting the local power capacity or what we call the annualized energy generation that takes into account all the annual fluctuations. And it's a very simple method, and it just takes into account that the cube of an average is not the same thing as the average of a cube. average of the cube and if you if you look at this averaging of the local velocity cubed rather than the mean velocity cubed you get something called the power velocity which you can you know show is about one and a quarter times the mean velocity and if you use that power velocity that gives you a reasonably good like plus or minus 10 or 15 percent estimate of your annualized wind speed right so this is a Wind speed, right? So, this is a way of accounting for that long tail on your rally distribution. This is what you do if you're tremendously lazy and you just want to know from my mean wind speed, irrespective of the actual probability distribution of wind, what's the annualized power I can get out? And within 10 to 15 percent, this works relatively well. And does it depend on the length of the interval if you want to teach you? Of course it does. But when you grow, when you, for a gross approximation, one could imagine that this is when you take an interval over a year or a reasonable period. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm going to skip that. When we get to solar, the most important thing for solar is what's the rate at which energy hits my solar collector? Because the sun is emitting the same amount of radiation everywhere on the earth, or rather, On the earth, or rather, this everywhere at the top of the atmosphere, the same amount of radiation is hitting the earth from the sun. But the rate at which it gets to my collector depends on so many factors, right? Where I am relative to the equator, right? Then that determines if the sun's radiation is at normal to me or at a big angle. So the latitude is a big impact. The time of year matters a lot. The time of day matters a lot. Matters a lot. And the angle of the sun to the horizon, which is the solar altitude angle, matters a lot. The zenith angle also matters a lot. And the azimuth angle. So the orientation of my surface relative, or I should say the orientation of the sun relative to south on the northern hemisphere or to north on the southern hemisphere matters a lot. And so you have all of these angles. And so you have all of these angles that play into the actual amount of solar radiation that hits the surface. And so one can actually calculate the total amount of the incidence angle of the sun, and then you can approximate the daily energy that reaches a solar device if you know the time of day, the latitude, the solar, all of these different angles, etc. And what you end up with at the very Et cetera. And what you end up with at the very bottom, after a bunch of trigonometry, is the energy flux. I know what it is outside of Earth's atmosphere, but what is it at this time of day, this time of year, at this orientation for this collector facing this direction? Right? And that's going to be highly variable depending on the day and the time and everything else. But the nice thing is it's easy to calculate. And so, what one would do is if you have a solar collector that's sitting in a certain oil. Vector that's sitting in a certain orientation is I calculate that value, the number of the rate at which the solar energy hits that surface, and that's for that day. I do it again for the next day and the next day and the next day, and I can do that in a spreadsheet or in a Python program for all the days of my year, and that's my available solar energy. And I can now use that available solar energy to produce electricity. To produce electricity using a photovoltaic cell, or I can collect the thermal energy of the sun. But the point is, this is how much I have. And that's important to know because you can only retrieve the energy that's available. And the energy that's available is going to be dependent on all of these things. Okay. Maybe I'll stop there. The next bit of slides talk about the actual technology associated with. Technology associated with getting energy from that solar incident radiation. We can use the heat content, or we can use a photovoltaic cell to generate electricity from the sunlight, which is a special material that generates through the thermosolar effect. Thermosol, no, not throwing solar, photovoltaic effect. And then all of the different parts. Now, last afternoon, when I talked about how do I use this in the context of a sustainable energy system for a remote community, I need to account for the variation in the sunlight in the community and the weather that that community experiences and the location of that community and the way that that location is latitude-wise and everything else. That's a lot of factors. Lot of factors. And so, what's conveniently tabulated for us is what's called a regional factor. And that regional factor is an amalgamation of all of those effects. And it tells you if I have this many kilowatts installed, I'm going to generate this many kilowatt hours of energy. And it depends on what we talked about last time, whether you have a system that changes the orientation of your panel. That changes the orientation of your panel, the tilt of your panel, the latitude of your panel, time of day, everything else, right? And so these values are provided to you by, for example, NRCAN. So you can go if you're choosing a solar project for a community, you can look up for your community what my regional factor is. And it'll give it to you if it's a collector that's flat on the ground, vertical, oriented at a tilt equal to the latitude, more or less than the latitude, et cetera. More or less than the latitude, etc. Notice that sunny places have a higher regional factor than less sunny places like Vancouver. So this is per kilowatt installed? Yep. So a regional factor is the kilowatt hours produced per kilowatt installed. Kilowatt hours produced per kilowatt installed. And you get different numbers for different values. You can get it on a monthly basis or on an annual basis. These are for annual. These are for annual, all right. So, I have to stop here. Uh, I do have some examples, so if you want to apply some of this information, uh, we mentioned biomass just a tiny bit last class. I won't have time to go through it, but what you can highlight is the different types of ways in which you can get energy out of biomaterial, the different kinds of biomaterials that there are, and the different crops, the different ways you use them. A lot of this. Ways you use them. A lot of this involves chemistry, and I got a C- in chemistry in 11th grade, and I've tried to avoid it ever since. Critical importance is the life cycle assessment. Are we ahead or behind? And then one could talk about fuel cells as well, but I'm not going to address that at all. All right. Thank you so much for your attention and your interest. Any questions? Any questions? Folks from the Zoom, any questions? Not to my knowledge anymore. There was a barrage system, and I want to say it was in Nova Scotia. And they sank it. Whale swam in in 2004, got stuck on the other side. And I think it finally closed in 2019. But that was a big news. That was a big news story. Wow. That was the, it was called Church something or another, wasn't it? I don't remember. Annapolis, something. Annapolis. Yeah. Annapolis. That's right. Any other questions from anybody on the Zoom? All right. Well, I don't want to take up any more of your lunch.
