Yes. Okay. Um we're moving into the afternoon and we are moving into social science. So um I will have an equation. I will talk about COVID and that will be evident as I move on. Okay, so I'm talking about community resilience today. Specifically, what is it? I'm going to define my terms. I'm going to talk about a study, and then hopefully I'm going to pose some intriguing questions for my math friends to watch. Questions for my math friends to want to collaborate and others. So, what is community resilience? Not surprisingly, people don't agree on what it is. Let me find that. They generally fall into two categories. One is something innate or a characteristic of a community that allows them to use their resources and bounce back, prepare for, respond. Bounce back, prepare for, respond to extreme events or epidemics. So there's something about that community that makes them resilient. Another set of researchers and thinkers think about it as a dynamic system and adaptive network. That community resilience is a dynamic ecosystem process linking these adaptive capacities to adaptation. So that is where I'm going to be landing on. Where I'm going to be landing on for this talk. So, how is it studied? Community resilience is multidisciplinary in lots of different areas, disaster preparedness, public health emergencies, obviously climate change, resource, ecosystems, city or national infrastructures, violence, political ideology. And in terms of the theory, the theories that inform this work, again, Form this work, again, multidisciplinary. So depends on who you are and what you're interested in. Decision theory, social ecological theory, etc., etc. So I'm not going to fall on a theory sword today. I like to be agnostic around. I like a good theory, but I don't know yet. This is discovery at this point. Okay, so the key concept that is Key concept that is guiding this work. I'm viewing community as a network. It's just an interconnected network of systems that impact human society, including socioeconomic. Here I can look at this one. So, community as a network, interconnected systems. The other piece is that that community network is a complex adaptive. Community network is a complex adaptive system. So I'm thinking about complex adaptive systems, dynamic change in these systems, and different relationships between actors and interactions. And that it is a community resilience as a process, that it changes over time. Okay? So that's guiding the work. The context that I'm going to be presenting research on is in social care networks, and I'm going to define that. Care networks, and I'm going to define that in a second. Network analysis, and population health outcomes. Okay, so what's, let me give you a little bit of background on social care networks. What are they? They have different names, but essentially they are these formal or informal community or regional partnerships of cross-sector, different types of organizations working together. Maybe it's medical care, maybe it's health. Maybe it's medical care, maybe it's health, maybe it's social services, but not other systems. So they're coming together to care for people in their communities. Those networks are designed specifically to improve access to services. So if you come into your community, maybe you're a pregnant woman, a social care network is designed to connect you to the WIC clinic for maternal and child health. Child health or childcare. And that these networks are best positioned to influence community health factors like behaviors and social and economic as indicators of community health. So their whole purpose is to make sure people get connected to services. So the current study, I have a large population and large in our world. And large in our world is, I'll show you what that is: a large population of networks that allowed us to really test between different types of networks in predicting community-level health factors over time as a function of the cohesiveness of the network. We also modeled the dynamic process, not as well as I think we could hint. I think we could hint underline the interconnection, interconnectedness of those networks as the key resilience factor for predicting how communities respond. And hypothesis, more stronger, interconnected, cohesive networks are going to be positively predicting social and behavioral factors related to health outcomes compared to those that are less. Ones compared to those that are less strong. All right, you with me? Okay, great. So, design and methods, non-equivalent groups. Obviously, these are social care networks. They are not equivalent across a sample, and I'll show you where they're at in a second. We did this basically, the study period is right before COVID, up until December. Up until December of 2022. So 36 months is our time period. Context, unsurprisingly, is COVID. And you'll see why that matters. I did two analyses, network analysis and a linear regression for predicting. Okay? So essentially, we have the social care networks in. networks in four different states in the US across 44 US counties that have a social care network. What you see over here to the right is some of the base network analysis statistics on them. The number of nodes, i.e., the number of partners. So these are organizations between 37 for, that was the mean, up to 120. That was the mean up to 125 partners working in this network. Edges are referrals, their interactions between these organizations to refer people. And the network age, the maturity of how long the network had been varies. Network data, where do you get that data? Here's where we get it. From the same technology tool, it's something that. It's something that my team developed at the University of Kansas. It is called IRIS, and it is essentially a referral tool that helps communities connect each other and people to services. So that referral becomes the interaction or the edge of a network collected during January to December of 2022. Community level health data, where does that come from? The University of Wisconsin. The University of Wisconsin puts out a county health ranking data in the U.S. It allows us to match standardized health indicators across different domains to the counties that are impacted. Problems with it? Yes. So, what we did first was group the networks. Remember, I've got this population of This population of networks. So I ran network analysis on all of them. And what we, a natural grouping mechanism between these is those that had higher cohesion as measured by closeness centrality and global clustering coefficients. So those that were 50% above the mean on both of those were in the high cohesion networks. Those that were below were in the low cohesion network. Cohesion network. And then we co-varied network age and baseline community health outcomes. Okay? With me on that? Here are the types of indicators that that county health ranking data. It gives you basically z-scores on things like health factors, which is a composite of these health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and physical. Economic factors and physical health. You can see the different kinds of data sources that they've collected over the years and then standardized. We also had an event factor for time, so basically during the COVID years and then when we measured our network. So again, network analysis. I think some folks in here are familiar with it. Ran it in our basically iGraph. It's spatial map. Spatial math. We also did a difference in difference test. That's allowing us to isolate the effect of an event by comparing changes in the outcomes between two groups to remove some of the bias from pre-existing group differences. Always open to stronger analysis if you think. And then here's our general linear model. And look, there's my equation. Okay, this so we basically grouped the networks and then used that grouping variable as a predictor over time of population level outcomes. Okay? What did we find? Here are all the small numbers. What's most important is one, the group by time interaction, that's a difference in difference score. Difference in difference score. That says that network cohesion is significant for every dependent variable, controlling for network maturity and baseline community health. Okay. And also network group, some of the main effects, but that interaction was a higher level. You'll also see a negative constant across all of these, and I'm going to tell you that is the COVID effect. What does that look like on a graph? What does that look like on a graph? Essentially, between 2020 and 2021 and 2022, everybody suffered. And that's the basic here. This is the COVID effect. Every health indicator across most of these communities went down. So that's the trend that you're seeing down. But what you're also seeing is that the cohesion of the network mitigated against the steep decline. The steep decline. So, the more cohesive the social care network was, the less impact on the decline in these outcomes. And what we are looking at here is health factors and health behaviors. And so, this is a composite of all of the different domains. This is just behaviors, and this one over. And this one over here is social and economic. So, here, just to kind of put it out here: the composite of health behaviors, clinical peer, social and economic factors, and physical environment. That's the composite, and that has that pattern essentially. Health behaviors are things like tobacco use, diet, exercise, alcohol, drug use, risky stuff. And then social and economic things are like education, employment, income, family, community safety. Income, family, community safety, et cetera. So, again, essentially the decline, but less steep for cohesive networks than Orange ones. So, here's my hopefully intriguing thought. This is new area for me, so I'm open to conversation, but ultimately, what I'm trying to understand is there is a taxonomy for community resilience? If so, what is it? If so, what is it? Specifically, how do we start classifying community networks or ecosystems or networks into those that are essentially resilient? So those that are effective in changing outcomes, so cohesion, some are going to be higher at the ability, well, a dynamic process of changing outcomes. Process of changing outcomes, but they might be not as resilient as against losses in the network. So, what do I mean by that? This is where I don't know, but essentially I have some thoughts around the methodology of how do you simulate a network to remove, let's say, an influential hub or relationship. Does the network still remain effective in changing the outcomes or does it fall apart? It fall apart. So, resilient is if there's losses in the network and effective if it can change. So, I'm looking at how to classify networks in that manner. Why and how? One, I'd love to figure out how to do dynamic network analysis. It's essentially, you know, these are organisms that are changing over time. These networks are changing over time, oscillating, etc., etc. I don't have a Etc., etc. I don't have a good handle on how to do dynamic network analysis, and I would love to because I think it matters. Time-varying graphs, discrete, etc. This is for my math friends to help me. And then finally, why does it matter? Why does it matter? Because if you can start class. Because if you can start classifying which networks are more resilient and which are not, you can use that information to intervene in weak or fragile networks and make them stronger. And you can use your network data to start testing whether those interventions actually have the impact that you're wanting. So, how do you intervene in these kinds of networks to make them stronger and more effective and more resilient? That's my And more resilience. That's my ultimate goal. This is one way that says, I think you're on the right direction, but I'm interested in thoughts.
