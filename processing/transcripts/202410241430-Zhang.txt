So I'm very happy to be here to give my talk on my recent work. So this is about the interface problems. So as mentioned by Professor John, it is quite match this topic of this conference. And this is a joint work with my former PhD student who is now in industry. And this is Shu Xing Chai from a PhD student. Zhu Wen Zhang from Hong Kong Yu. He's an associate professor in Hong Kong Yu. And Professor Julian Li here. So this topic is about moving kind of line problem. We try to combine some existing methods to produce a second order numerical method. Okay, so let me first introduce what is the Let me first introduce what is the moving kind of line problem. Maybe you have come across that before. Maybe in the, if not, you also see that in some other natural phenomenons. So actually the moving kind of line is defined as the three-phase interface. It's actually a triple junction point. So and it has wide applications in many industry and in many industry and the biological science problems. For example, if you encounter the coating problem in industry, you must have to deal with this kind of phenomenon. So you have to model and simulate the dynamics of this moving content line. And you also see that in the nature like the sorry. Like the droplet in the lotus leaf. And between these two phase, there's an interface, and this interface will be in contact with the leaf surface. So that will produce three-phase triple junction. So how to develop the the equilibrium of the and the dynamic of this uh uh three three-phase triple junction is uh is a uh very old problem. Very old problem. More than 200 years ago, Thomas Young has established the balance equation for the equilibrium state of this kind of problem. Actually, he just established that the angle here, there's angle theta y between these two interfaces. And this angle is well related to the surface tension, which is an important property of the material. Materials. So you may just remember that this angle is related to this surface tension or surface property. And we will use this relation again and again in the later. So this phenomenon has many wide applications and also have many important behavior. Many important behavior, important phenomena and behaviors. For example, one can observe the stick-slip behavior in the coating problem. And this is also observed in many other industry problems. And also, if you throw a droplet onto a substrate, you will see the breakup of the droplet and you will see the bouncing and also the absorption of the droplet on the substrate. Droplet on the substrate. So, this all these phenomena can be described or can be modeled by the moving canal problem. And to model similarly, this kind of problem, one has to solve the following several problems. The first one is how to model the content line dynamics correctly. The second one is how to simulate this kind of dynamics by using a high-order, at least second-order numerical method. Other numerical method and how to resolve this topological change. I think this topological change problem relates to Qinghai's research. And let me first go to the simplest model. The first simple model is that we use a two-phase Stokes equation. So for Stokes equation, we can have this, there are two kinds of Stokes equation must be established on two sides of the interface. Two sides of the interface. And then there's an interface condition here. The interface condition basically tells you that the curvature force can be balanced by the jump of the tensor. And there's also a kinetic condition for driving the interface evolution. So combine them together, you can model the whole problem. But there's still one thing left because you. One thing left because you still don't know how these two points, say the counter line, how they evolve. So, these two, uh, because there is a energy dissipation here, so they must be driven by the friction force. So, uh, so we still have another condition here. This is the so-called kind of angle condition. This condition basically says that. say that this young stress or unbalanced young stress must be balanced by the friction force. The right hand side give you how large the velocity of the content line is. The left hand side gives you the physical force coming from the surface tension. So in equilibrium state this will be zero. So they are balanced. This is what we are talking about before. We are talking about before, say this Young equation. And when this Young equation is not satisfied, it will produce a new velocity for the current line. So how to involve this condition into your computation? This is one of the problems we are going to solve. Okay, so for the whole C system, one can establish energy distribution laws. So that means the whole problem can be. The whole problem can be written as a variational formulation. And now we want to go to the simulation part. We want to establish a higher second order numerical method for that. So before doing that, we do the dimensionless form and we try to use some existing method and try to combine them together to produce a second order method. So for solving So for solving the interface problem, we all know that there are many methods. For example, the finite element method that I discussed in several talks in these days, and also the inverse boundary method, also discussed this morning, and also the immersive interface method. And to track the manifold, there are also many existing methods. For example, the level set method, volume fluid, brand tracking, and MARS from Qinghai, and Cartesian-based method. And Cartesian-based method, and also PFEM from this BGN. And this is also talked about by Buyang Li in the first talk. And so our strategy is that because in our problem, we have both interface problem with a fixed interface and also the evolution of interface. So we have to combine these tactics together. And we also aim to deal with the topological change. With the topological change. So, to achieve that, we first want to take advantage of this second-order accuracy of immersive interface method. So that we will discuss later. And then we also want to take advantage of this variation formation of the PSEM method. And we want to connect these two methods to get a second accuracy method for the new moving kind of line problem while the The new moving candle line problem while the candle line is in motion. Okay, so this is a brief introduction for the immersion interface method. We just produce a correction term into, and then put this correction term into your equation. And actually, one can apply the Taylor expansion to compute this correction term. And this correction term acts as uh act as a a a residual between the the the the standard laplacian and the and the the the the laplacian in this interface problem and and if you do the tail expansion you will find that uh this uh the collection term is related to the the nearest point on the interface and you can you can project this uh this point onto the the nearest point on the interface but for example if you do the five point stencil you you you will do that you will you will will do that you will you will uh you will uh do the stencil on this center point but this there this center point uh use the uh the value of this the the the nearby uh one two three four four four point but for this two point this is not on the other side of the interface so so you have to uh you have to uh uh uh make up the difference between this this value and the one on the other side so uh so this may this makeup has to be done this make this makeup has to be done by using the interface condition so so so one has has to project this point onto this uh the the the nearest point on the interface and to do that one can use a tailor expansion and when you when you use the tailor expansion you will find that there's this uh up to the second order right here and you you can you can compute what is the fraction here and to compute that you will make use of the uh of the uh interface condition like uh Interface condition like this interface jump condition to produce the second other jump. And if you add back the old fraction term, you can produce this immersion interface problem for this Stokes equation. This is standard. Actually, there's a remark that the immersive interface method has a truncation error at least OH at the irregular point. What is so-called irregular point? That is the point. So-called irregular point that is the point near with the grid point nearby the interface. And on the regular point, I mean the other point, there will be a second order accuracy. And so far so good. But if you deal with the fixed interface, so far so good. But if you deal with the moving interface, so this is not enough. Because on the right-hand side, all this correction term depends on the local geometry of the interface. interface. So if you are given a fixed interface, you can compute that exactly. But if you are not given that, you have to simulate and compute that value up to certain kind of accuracy. So let's go back to what the value of that correction term. Actually, the correction term depends on the second order correction here. This correction depends on the second order derivative of the Then the second order derivative of the velocity. And the second other derivative of the velocity just depends on this curvature. So that means you have to compute the curvature correctly up to the second order. So that's why we want to introduce the interface interface tracking method. We have to track the interface accurately so that this curvature can be computed after the second order. So hereby we just introduced, there are many methods to achieve that. To achieve that. Hereby, we just apply this parametric finite element method. Why do that? Because this method has a variational formulation. By using the integration by parts, you can easily take into account the moving counterline condition. So because if you write, this has been introduced by Buang Li in his talk first day. So this first one is the kinematic condition. The second one is a definition for the curvature. One is a definition for the curvature. And by applying integration by parts, we just multiply both sides by a test function. Then you do integration by parts, you have a boundary condition. Because now we are dealing with open interface. So there is an open end. Okay, so for these two, there are actually two open end. Each open end is associated with one moving counter line. So we can substitute this condition by our moving counter condition here. moving canal condition here. So that's why we want to use this directional form. By using that, we can easily establish the discretization for this scheme. Okay, so for this discretization, we just put into the boundary condition here. And we can also, because this is based on the parametric finite element method, so we expect that this can achieve. Expect that this can achieve second-order accuracy for both the location of the interface and the position of the interface and the curvature. Okay, so now we formally have solved the problem from the local geometry to the map from the local geometry to the IIM method. After we solve the velocity field from the IIM immersive interface method, we also have to also have to interpolate that velocity back to your interface motion. So we have also to do one interpolation. So to do that interpolation, we also want to maintain the second order accuracy. So we have to use at least a second order interpolation. So that's the whole algorithm. So first is to use I method and this depends on the curvature and second to And second, to update our interface by using the parametric method. And there are several remarks. So, how to choose this nearest point? We can choose the midpoint. That's one choice. There are many other choices. And about the interpolation, we just use bilinear interpolation because it can achieve second-order accuracy. And for the time integrator, we can use. We can use a FOBOL or a second order, Longa Gunga Kuta. And we can also generalize this scheme to deal with discontinuous viscosity problem by introducing the augmented variable, which is mentioned by Juneni in the morning. And we also learned that from Professor Li. And we can apply this for this continuous disclosure problem. This caused the problem: the resulting linear system is no longer a standard five-point stencil problem. So, we can now solve it using the fast-fourier transform. So, we have to apply this JM-RES. So, now let me show you the convergence test. So, we can see that both the velocity fields can be maintained in the second are accurate. And this X means this error in the content line or content point, we can see that. Or content point, we can see that this is also second-order accurate. Sorry, this is the interface. This CL is a content line point. So all of them are in second order. And we can, because of the equity distribution property of the parametric finite method, we can also test that the interface marker are equally distributed. This is as a result of that method. method. But if you have, as mentioned by Yiang Li in his talk, if there are a large deformation of the interface, this may not be maintained. And we can easily compute several benchmark problems, such as Kelvin pendant droplet, which is a droplet hanging on this roof. And for different kind of angles, you will see that there's different behavior. The left one is. Yeah, the left one is a small kind of angle. The right one is a large angle. And we can also easily deal with the chemical roughness. That means the substrate on the floor is no longer homogeneous. Kind of there are a mixture of two different materials. For example, there's a red one and a blue one. The red one and blue one has different surface tensions. Surface tensions. So, so their corresponding kind of angle is different. Young's angle is different. So, we can apply this as our new boundary condition to do the simulation. You will see that this one is coming from the industry experiments, and this one is our new email result. Would you please play this? And you will see that there's a like a jump for six-flip phenomena, right? Or a stick-slip phenomenon, right? This is because this substrate is not homogeneous. But you can also see our solution can capture that. You will see that it's like an inch warm, one motion, right? So when we take some picture here, and you see that maybe. Here and you see that maybe we can focus on this one. So in the subsequent time step shot, so you see that when t is equal to five seconds, there is an interface here, and after a second here, and the interface will only move its local contact point, and the global interface behavior is not changed too much. Heavier, it's not changed too much. But when the kind of point height has been moved to the next position, say t equal to set the set the seventh second, then it will pin here. And then the interval starts to evolve until it's like a circular shape because of the curvature force. So this behavior will continue to happen. Happened in later motion. And we can record this behavior by taking record of both the contact point position and the contact angle. You see that the content angle like oscillation here. And actually, this oscillation depend on how the substrate is, how rough. Is how rough is the subsubstrate. When the roughness is small, you will see that the magnitude of the oscillation becomes smaller. And actually, there is a limit. When epsilon goes to zero, this angle converts to a value. And there are two different curves because this one corresponds to a large Yang Xiang, and this one corresponds to... Sorry. this one corresponds to sorry uh this one corresponds to the the the motion up uh motion to the right and this one uh is the motion to the left so there are uh all this uh all these two uh all all these uh curves are applied by the same same system with the same physical parameters, but we only change the driving velocity of this system. Velocity of this system. So, for this one, we drive to the right, and for this one, we drive to the left. So, you will see that there are different behavior and a different convergent angle here. This is so-called the two-angle are differences, and this phenomenon is so-called a counter-angle hysterics. And we can also compute the other several cases by changing this. Several cases by changing this driving velocity. And actually, you will see that there are symmetric and asymmetric behavior for this kind of angle his races. And we can also compute the problem with viscosity ratio, with different viscosity ratio. Okay, so let me go to the second part. This is because in the first part, we just consider a very simple model without any inertial. Simple model without any inertial effect. So, then, second part, we have to add back the inertial effect to this system. So, we have to consider the neighbor-silax equation. But for the neighbor-silax equation, the only additional term is here. So, we have to deal with that. So, our strategy is to apply the pressure formulation. This is coming from Jing Wo-Liu and his collaborators, and we just implemented it here. By taking the divergence operator on both sides, we can arrive at these two couples system. And both of these systems are in person type. So we can solve it by using the person solver. So the 25 equation is what we used in our simulation. It is still in most interface formulation. And in this immersive synthesis, So and in this most interface formulation, we only have to deal with the jump of the value across the interface. So in this case, the jump becomes the pressure and the normal gradient of pressure. And this also can be calculated by using the interface geometry. So it also depends on curvature. So we can compute this by using the fixed interface. By using the fixed interface. But when the interface evolves, start to evolve, we can also use the parametric pen element or the other method to capture this value. So this is a PPE scheme, what we use. And we first update our velocity field, and then we compute the pressure-Poisson equation to solving the pressure increment. And this is our jump condition, what we have to solve, what we have to include in this pressure person formulation. And another problem we want to solve is to deal with the topological change. So in this case, we just apply this simple strategy to tackle the topological change. For example, because we want to model the droplet. Because we want to model the droplet impact. So if you think about that, there's a droplet from upside to downside, and there's a substrate here, then the droplet will get contact with the substrate, and then it will be attached there or it will bounce up. So there are several different cases. And the right part is that we take into account the merging of the two, the coalescence of the two droplets. coalescence of the two droplets. For example, there's uh oh sorry uh oh sorry this uh oh this one uh this one is uh the the the droplet uh impact and the bounce bouncing and I think I also put uh maybe I didn't put that so uh actually when two droplets coalesce there you will also encounter this uh topological problem okay so so let me just take this one as an example so in this case we we want to uh d detect detect when and how the two interface of the drop kits they can they can be combined together to form a new interface. Okay, so the idea is that actually when these two there's only one interface right because the other this one is a substrate. But we can imagine that there is a mirror here. So this is a ghost. So this is a ghost. This is like a ghost droplet. So this droplet will have the same motion as the original droplet, this true droplet, and they come into each other. And when they come closer enough, say this, let me see. Let me see. Say this two points here are close enough, then we can regard these two interfaces as going to merge into one interface. But this is not the only condition we have to use in order to determine this merging phenomenon correctly. Because if you use the marker to track your interest, the neighboring marker are the neighboring marker are also close together, also very close to each other. So if you just use the neighboring condition to determine the topology change, it's not enough. So we also have to take into account another condition, that is the angle condition. That means if one point has a normal to the downside, say the other point has a normal to the upside. The upside, this downside, we can only detect the topological change, even only if the two normal have the angle between these two normal is large enough. That means, let's see, let's look at this second case. In this case, actually, there's no topological change, but these two markers are close to each other. So because the interface is continuous, so their normal vector has a very small angle. But in the first case, these two match points are also close to each other, but their angle, their normal has a large angle. So in this case, it's going to have a toggle change. So actually, we have two conditions. One is the distance condition. The other one is the angle condition. For both these conditions, we have to introduce two. conditions we have to introduce two artificial parameters that is not that cannot be avoided in our method so but this is very ugly in the in the in the in the in the in the real simulation because uh this will introduce and your your your your maybe introduce uh some other numerical uh numerical error so this one epsilon is that uh we use epsilon to detect how whether these two points are close enough and Points are close enough. And we also use a threshold for the angle. So when the angle is greater than this threshold, we say that the topological change are going to happen. Okay, so by using this method and including the inertial effect, we can also have the second order accuracy without any topological change. So this should be easy to This should be easy to understand. But okay, so but when you have the topological change, you okay, this is a merging of two droplets. Second one, yeah. The difference between two th th these two uh uh these two uh experiments is that the the left one has a very small rate Radio standard. Is so so so actually this can be uh described by the Stokes. can be described by the Stokes equation. And the other one has a lot relatively larger Reynolds number, so you can see that there's an oscillation after their coalescence. Okay, so this is the snapshot for that. The left one is Rados number is equal to one, the left one, the right one is 100. And actually, we have tested that after merging. After merging, this one, our method also maintained the second order accuracy, but because we are lack of exact solution. So this is done by using the mesh refinement. So it's still not convincing. And we can also apply this method to do the collision of droplet onto substrate. These four pictures, four These four pictures, four videos correspond to different physical parameters, like we choose different Reynolds number, different Kepler number, and different substrate property, like surface tension. You will see that sometimes it's it's uh it's uh after the collision they it it spounce up. It sometimes it is split to two and sometimes it's uh uh like uh splashing. Like splashing. But this is 2D simulation. It's still not realistic. To be real, we have to deal with the 3D simulation. So, I think after describe this, I think this is snapshots of the previous videos. Okay, so you see that, let me see. Yeah, to compare this, each. To compare this, each experiment horizontally. So, the left one has a larger Reynolds number, the right one has a small Reynolds number. You see that the Reynolds number, the difference of the Reynolds number can determine different phenomena. In the left one, it will split after the droplet impact, droplet collision, and the right one will be bounced up. Sorry, not bounced up, it's just be attached. Buns up, it just be attached onto the interface. And if you decrease the cavity number, that means you increase the surface tension. So that means if you decrease the calculator number, increase the surface tension, I think there's much difference between these two phenomenons. So the the drop is still attached here. And but this one with a larger definition. Sorry, this one is a larger definition, I think. And if you change the counter angle, that means you change the surface property, then you will see that even though you use the same Reynolds number and the cabinet number, the phenomenon will be different. And also, we used a very large Riemann number. The very large radius number and large surface kind of angle, then you will observe the splashing of the droplets. Okay, so I think that that's all.
