And oh that may not be working, they may get one thing. I mean we can ask when they exist. Uh can any zoom people fine. I mean well there are three five I know we've actually got over 50 people volunteers and they might not attend every single talk they may be planning to attend. We're planning on attending a particular talk on our first time because if I don't know it's already up well, I can send a message to everybody I take. Why don't you run and ask Linda? What year is she? She's downstairs. Oh, okay. 104. Downstairs is hard to get to, it's right by the It's hard to get to you right by the way. I don't know what else it wants to go for. Okay. And this knows this stuff very well. Okay. Sure. Oh, and can you turn off these lights for the movement? Yeah. The overhead lights. That's good. Okay. Father, do you exist? Slava, can you hear us? Yes, okay, you can hear us now. I didn't hear the last the last thing you said. Can you hear me now? Yes, yes. I hope we have one more minute in front of you, Jim. All right, Slavic will be continuing his overview of descriptive set theory. All right, thanks. So what we've done so far is we've defined the Borel and analytic sets. Then we also have the kind of internal representations with respect to the spaces in which these sets live. There's a sigma algebra or using operation A in case of the analytic sets. Relationship between Borel and analytic, we know how close it is. There is a separation theorem and we know that an analytic and And we know that in analytic and co-analytic sets, these are precisely Borel sets. And we have some closure and regularity properties. So, closure, obvious thing was analytic under continuous maps or Borel under continuous injective maps. Less obvious for Borel, for example, closure under the complements. Notice we did not prove the closure of analytic sets. So, Borel sets are closed under complements. Analytic sets, one can, it's not difficult using operation A to show. Difficult using operation A to show that they are closed under countable unions and countable intersections, but they are not closed under complements. This will play a role later on. Okay, so the last regularity property I mentioned were this fact that analytic sets are measurable with respect to any Borel measure, and analytic sets have the Berke property. So the reason for it is that measurable sets Are closed under operation A. In the sense that if I take, you know, in operation A, there were these sets FSs. If I take all these FSs to be measurable and I apply A to them, the resulting set A of F S is also measurable. And same with Veriprokret. Same thing. There's actually, and I might, we'll see what I will do tomorrow, but there is a very nice general theorem of Shpiveri Marchevsky that explains exactly what kind of families of sets are closed under operation A. And these are just two particular cases, but I will not go into it. But I will not go into it right now. This takes some proving, right? This is some, it's not completely immediate, but it is true. All right. So talking about regularity properties, there is a standard regularity property people in set theory consider, but it's also important in many situations, kind of gives you canonical elements, canonical subspaces of spaces. Of spaces. So the theorem here is that each analytic uncountable set contains a copy of the cantoset. The counter set for me will be, you can, this is a little bit abstract notion that is space that is homeomorphic with the usual one-third counter set that people that people know usually. But this is a space of all A space of all so it is zero one. I take zero one two two element space that is discrete and I take its countable product. So this is the space of all infinite sequences, infinite binary sequences. Notice that this is clearly a compact subspace of n to n. It's a subspace there. Okay, so how would one prove something like this? Ah, this is you. Hausdorff proved it for Hausdorff proved it for Borel sets, and then Susslin proved it for analytic sets. Notice that it divides now analytic sets. This is an important theory because analytic sets are either countable, so sort of trivial, or else they have to contain this canonical large space. Large space. In particular, the size of an analytic set is either countable or it has the cardinality equal to the cardinality of all the reals. So we get it as an immediate consequence of that. So, how does one prove that? Any questions here about the statement? How does one prove it? So we have F We have f going from n to n to onto our space A, making it analytic. And what one again one uses combinator, so A officially is a continuous image of a Polish space, but each Polish space is a continuous image of this. So I can just start with the bare space. And what is the main point of this argument? Again, we use the combinatorics of this space here. Of this space here, this tree structure that's behind it, what one proves is that for each S in N less than N, with the property that F of N S is uncountable, one can extend this S to T one, T two, both of them extending S such that I preserve uncountability. And, but I make them disjoint. So, in particular, this T1 and T2 have to properly extend S because if one of them were equal to S, it would include the other one. The image of F of The image of f of n t i, whichever ti was equal to s, would include the other one. So there would be no hope for disjointness. Assuming that something like this is true, so you see, the point is that we can carry over uncountability of this image of the basic open set to a smaller basic open set and do the split here. It's a standard move in every embedding of the control set. Embedding of the counter set. Okay, and then assume we have that, what do we do? Well, this gives us a loop, right? We can just run this loop. So we start with the empty set, S equal empty. Then Ns is just the whole space. So clearly, the image is uncountable because A is assumed to be uncountable. And we can split it into two. So S1, S2. Two, but we split them using that condition. So these images, each of them separately is countable. F of n s1 and then n of n s1 and n of ns2. This allows us to split it again. So t1, t2, and there is a split here, t3, t4, again using this loop here, and we can continue doing it. Then there will be eight of them here, B8. And then we can continue doing it. So, what are we actually doing in this situation? We are actually constructing a map from finite sequences. So, this is, aha, there's this again set-theoretic convention that I already mentioned. Already mentioned, this space is conveniently denoted by 2 to n, not because 2 is equal to 0, 1, it's equal to its set of its predecessors. So, this is this is all coherent with what we agreed before. So, I'll just write 2 to the n. 2 to the n. So, basic open sets in this space, just like in that space, are indexed by finite sequences, but now binary sequences rather than arbitrary sequences of natural numbers. So, here I take So here I take an S and to each such S, I associate with each such S, I associate T S in N less than N. Notice this is what I'm doing. To empty, I associate empty. To sequence one, I associate S1 to the sequence con, sorry, to the sequence zero, I associate S1, to the sequence one, I associate S2. And here I go zero, zero. This is T1. This is T1, 0, 1. I associate with it T2, 1, 0, T3, 1, 1, T4. And I continue like this. So to each binary sequence, I associate a sequence, a finite sequence of natural numbers. So to 0, 1, T2. T2 may be quite long. It doesn't have to have legs too. It may be quite long. So this is what is happening here. And what I know about this is that. about this is that f of n t s intersection f of n t s prime is equal to empty if s equals the lengths of s and s prime are equal and but they are not equal as sequences right this is what what's happening here in this picture these two have these two sequences have length one and the way i split it so these are the sequences Split it, so these are the sequences associated with the sequences of length one, they are disjoint, the images are disjoint, and same on this level, same on the level, on the next level, and so forth. So, this is what is happening. And then, notice this to an element here, alpha, I can associate an element beta alpha in n to n. How do I do it? Well, this is the Well, this is the common extension of key alpha restricted to n over n equals zero, one, and so forth. Notice these are these sequences are getting longer. This is just empty. It's included properly in T alpha restricted to one, t alpha restricted to two, and so forth. And so forth. So there will be an element beta depending on alpha that extends all these sequences. So to each alpha, I can associate in the control set, I can associate an element B alpha of n to n, and then I can apply f to that. So I get a map to alpha, I associate f of beta alpha. This is now in A. In A, right? Because F maps everything to A. Yes? So what's happening here is if I pick alpha, for example, alpha that looks like, say, starts with zero, one, and then goes zero again, I follow this path and then zero here, whatever is associated to zero, one, zero. And I continue. So this. And I continue. So, this gives me, for this alpha, like that, this gives me that beta alpha. And that beta alpha through F gives me an element of A. And now, by this condition here, it's easy to check that this function is injective. And also, it's not difficult. And also, it's not difficult to check that this function is also continuous. So, what I did, I embedded injectively and continuously the Cantor set into A. Because this is a compact space, it actually is, this embedding is actually a homeomorphic embedding, so homeo embedding. So, I got what I wanted. Got what I wanted here. So, as long, so this is a very typical construction in descriptive set theory: embedding of counter sets, often with additional structures, maybe there is an equivalence relation with it and so forth. But there is always this move that you make that you are given an element and you split it in two. So, in this case, uncountability allows you to split the element. And how do we get And how do we get? I mean, so getting this uncountability, getting this split in this situation is particularly easy, right? Because let's see how it goes. If I have f of ns is uncountable by the fact that the space that the But the the space the the the target space is separable. Let's draw this N S. This is a large set f of N S. It's not difficult to see that. And then this set is relatively open in F of N S, so I can find a T1 strictly or Strictly or extending, strictly extending s such that this set will contain f of m t1. And just because this set is relatively open in the image here, I can find that t2 such that this set contains f of n t2 and t2 properly extends s right. If I have the reason is continuity of this space, right? I take I take this set is relatively open in this set. I take its pre-image. It will be a relatively open subset of NS itself. And because this is a basis, I can find a basic set of this form inside of this pre-image that is open in NS. And I do the same thing here. And these are my two extensions. They are disjoint. They are extensions. They are disjoint. Aha. Okay. Oh, okay. They may be countable, but the point is that this whole set, so I have to backtrack a little bit. This whole set is the union of sets like that. And this whole set is the union of sets like this with these properties. And there's only countably many T1s and T2s like this. So this countable union is uncountable. This is an uncountable set, and that's an uncountable set. So these countable unions are uncountable. Uncountable set. So these countable units are uncountable. So there will be one T1 such that this itself is uncountable, and there will be a T2 such that this itself is uncountable. So I'm using the fact that if I cover an uncountable set with countably many sets, one of them is uncountable. And then I have my extensions. So that's how these things work. And actually, in some sense, proving this theorem, not in some sense, proving that theorem for analytic sets. Theorem for analytic sets is kind of easier, very natural than proving it for Borel set with the standard definition, not with our definition. With our definition, it's as easy. Okay, but so this is Hausdorff and Susslin. The counter space is included in each uncountable analytic set. Let me maybe mention. Oh, sorry, this one. Oh, sorry, this one. Yeah, actually, I can do it here. Maybe mention something here that will come up later on. So this is inside of A, as long as this one is uncountable. But I mentioned, of course, this space lies inside of n to n naturally. But also, n to n can be homeomorphically embedded into 2 to the n. This large space actually is a subspace. Space actually is a subspace of 2 to the n, and this lies as a subspace of all binary sequences that don't stabilize to one. So you can find a natural, a natural, quite natural map here that will be a homeo, not onto, of course, but onto all binary sequences that don't stabilize are not one from some point on. So, in fact, every uncomfortable So, in fact, every uncountable analytic set contains a homeomorphic copy of n to n. So, in particular, for example, each Polish space contains a homeomorphic copy of n to n and 2 to the n. So you get all Borel sets contain homeomorphic copies of n to n and 2 to the n. So this kind of is a nice and general theory. Are there questions about this stuff here? Okay, so we have this additional We have this additional one more regularity property of compact spaces of analytic sets. Let me say a little bit. So far, how is it going? So far, we were somehow analytic sets where we saw them as rather tame. They had nice regularity properties. They related very closely to Borel sets that they were. Closely to Borel's sets that they were preserved under continuous functions and so forth. So, the next, in what I will be doing later today and tomorrow, we will actually take this other point of view and we will discover when we analyze things a little more closely that actually analytic sets that are not borel are actually very far from being borel structurally. So, this is where we are going. But before that, let me there is this. Before that, there is this notion of Borel functions I need to introduce because this shows up in many places. So, this is a bit of a detour or rather a side remark from the main road here for us. So, okay, so what are Borel functions? Let's define them kind of more generally, not on polar. More generally, not on Polish spaces, but if I have Borel sets, subsets of Polish spaces X and Y, I have a function going from B to C. I call it Borel if pre-images of Borel sets are Borel. So for example, all continuous functions are Borel, because pre-images of open sets are open for continuous functions. And since Borel sets turn out to be equal to the sigma algebra generated by open sets, we will have that preimages of all Borel sets are also Borel because. Also, Borel because the sigma algebra operations are preserved under pre-images. Okay, so now there is a nice, simple at this point, this will be a nice application of the separation theorem, a simple but very useful theorem that if I have a function, it is Borel precisely when its graph is Borel as a subset. So if this function goes from B to. So, if this function goes from B to C, this is from B to C, this is as a subset of B cross C. So, these are we are talking about two different things here. It's important to know that it's not a tautology. So, if F is Borel going down is the standard procedure thing, I fix UN topological basis. Of let's you can say C as C lies in Y, so there is a topological basis, a countable topological basis, and one easily sees just by direct computation that the graph is equal to the following intersection. So, what I take here, notice I have a graph here of F, I take an open set U, I take the pre-image of U, pre-image of U, and here I take this rectangle. This rectangle U cross its pre-image pre-image and on the complement here of the pre-image I simply take everything so I have I have this set here clearly Clearly contains the whole graph, and it's easy to see that the intersection over all such n gives me exactly the graph. And now what we look at here, we notice that since F is Borel, this is a Borel set because by default, U is open, so Borel, so preimages of Borel set are Borel. This product is again Borel. Borel, it's easy to see that the product of two Borel sets is Borel. It's just the intersection. I will leave it to you to check. You would get it from the fact that Borel sets are precisely the sigma algebra of generated by open sets. Similar situation here, that's a Borel set. Its complement is Borel. We know complements of Borel sets are Borel. That's Borel as the product of Borel sets. Again, easy to check with the product. That's again easy to check with the product. And now, here I have a countable intersection. Borel sets are closed under countable intersection because they form a sigma algebra. So, this is a Borel set. Now, going the other way, it's a little more, it's more interesting. It's simpler maybe at this point, but it's more interesting because, so going up, what we notice is that if graph is Borel, we have, so we need to check. We have, so we need to check that F, so F goes from what was it, B to C. I take D here, subset Borel, and I need to check F minus one of D is Borel, that F minus D is Borel. But this is equal to the set of all X's such that F of X is in D. So if I now set E to be equal to graph. equal to graph of f intersection x cross d I see that x belongs to f minus one of p if and only if there exists a y such that xy is in e. So this set here is equal to the projection on x of e. X of E. So let's think about it. These are all easy computations. I mean, this equality simply follows from here. If you just draw a picture, it's immediate. So now I have, this means I take E and I forget the second coordinate. So I project it onto the first coordinate. The first coordinate. So this set is represented as a projection of some set E. The set E, let's look at the set E. This set is Borel because it's a product of two Borel sets. This is assumed to be a Borel. That's just an intersection. So that's a Borel set. I take its projection. So I take its continuous image. This is analytic. Because Borel set is analytic. Because Borel's set is analytic, continuous images of Borel's analytic sets are analytic by definition, so that's analytic. So f minus one of d is analytic. Okay, so we are not, it doesn't seem like we are in such a good shape because it was supposed to be Borel, but notice that F minus one of C minus D of the complement, this is also Borel because complements of Borel sets are Borel. Because complements of Borel sets are Borel. This is also Borel. So this is also going to be analytic. So I have now, but this is equal to F, so it's equal to B minus F minus 1 of D. So I check that D and F minus D are both, the complement of F minus 1 of D are both analytic. So it follows from Susslin that F minus 1 of D is Borel. Is Borel because it's analytic and it's complementary. Complement is analytic. So it is Borel. So it's a nice application of that theorem. One should notice here I'm doing things on Borel sets, not on Polish spaces. I'm applying these theorems of Suslin relatively to a Borel set. Doesn't these things really change anything from our definition? A Borel set is a continuous one-to-one image of a Polish space. One can transfer all this whole business here, pull it back to the Polish space of which B and C are injective continuous images, and simply do this argument on this background space. And it's all good. Okay, so this is kind of nice. This is kind of nice that we have. And let me maybe just state something that came up in the last talk. So, this is the theorem of Kuratovsky that says that if I want to consider things up to not homeomorphisms or continuous functions, but up to Borel bijections, then all Polish spaces that are uncountable are isomorphic. So if I have a Are isomorphic. So if I have two Polish spaces that are uncountable, there is a Borel bijection going from X to Y, ha, from X to Y. I should say something here, a nice consequence of that theorem. Notice that if I have, if f is a Borel function that is bijective, that immediately the preimage, sorry, the inverse of f is also Borel. The reason is if F is Borel, it's graph. Is Borel, its graph is Borel. But the graph of f and the graph of f minus one are essentially the same set, modulo flip in coordinates. Therefore, the graph of f minus one is also Borel. But this means f minus one is a Borel function. So it's a nice thing from that theorem that inverses of Borel functions are Borel as long as these inverses exist. So if I have here a Borel bijection, So, if I have here a Borel bijection, this is, it forces this to be Borel in both directions. So, I have a Borel bijection between any uncountable Polish spaces. And I don't want to go into the proof, but we are not far away from it. Notice that each X, as I mentioned, is each Polish X is a continuous one-to-one image of a closed subset of N-to-N. So I can by. So, I can by this is a continuous bijection here. So, it's Borel. Therefore, I can also look at it in that direction. It is still Borel. I just mentioned it. The inverse of a Borel bijection is a bijection. So I embedded X inside of N to N. And I already mentioned that N to N will also bijectively embed into X. Embed into X. So this is Borel, let's say, and this is actually continuous. So also Borel. So I have biject and injection from X to N to N and injection, Borel injection from N to N to X. And then running the so-called counter-Bendingson argument, one can get that X is Borel isomorphic to N to N. I use here. I use here the fact that x is uncountable. So we are not far away from the modulo standard argument. We already have all the tools to prove it, but I will not go into details of that. So as far as Borel bijections go, all these Polish spaces, they are uncountable. They are all the same. Of course, in particular situations, these Polish spaces come equipped with additional structure that is not preserved under Borel bijection. So this is useful. So, on has so these are useful only in situations where we are interested in descriptive set-theoretic structure on X or Y, but not if there's some additional algebraic structure or topological structure or something else. Okay, so let me just, so this is all so spaces that are not here are countable, and then if I have countable two countable spaces for Polish spaces, they are Borel isomorphic precisely when they have the same cardinality. When they have the same cardinality, finite or countable infinite. So it all classifies all Polish spaces, this theorem. Okay, in any case, so now we have to move a little bit farther. So I want to talk about Borel hierarchy and just kind of indicate that these analytic sets that are not Borel are kind of far away from Borel, from Borel sets. So, okay, so we need to introduce this ordinal number called omega 1. This is the least. Number called omega one. This is the least uncountable ordinal number. So I'm not sure if people are familiar with that. But so what one does is, I'm not sure, I'm making gestures here. Is it am I visible then or it's am I am I? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, oh, okay, okay, good. So what one has here is one can one can do the follow, one can do the following procedure. One can produce something called One can produce something called ordinals in the following way. One takes a point, puts another point on top of it, yet another point on top of it, and one continues that until one reaches omega, the first infinite ordinal. So we have this tower of points stretching out to omega, but nothing stops us there. I can put another point on top of it and another point on top of it, produce another omega on top of the first one, and then a third omega, and then omega of omega. Omega, and then omega of omegas. And I can continue doing it. Nothing stops me. So, in fact, what happens is, given any set, any sets, whatever, one can take the set and the points that I was picking, one can pick them from the given set, no matter how big it is. So, one takes the first point and another point and another point and another point coming from this given set. From this given set. And then what happens is we will exhaust, no matter how big the set is given to us, we can exhaust it by this procedure. So there will be this huge linear order that we produced that exhausts all points from the given set that we have. Okay, so now one can do it with an uncountable set. So we take, say, the reals and we do this. Say the reals, and we do this procedure. We keep piling this point one on top of the other, right? One, two, three, boom, boom, boom. Here's one, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and so forth. Okay, so we exhausted all the reals. We have this huge tower of points. Now we look at points there in this tower, and we look at a point, and when we look at the point, and we look down. And sometimes in the beginning, this. Sometimes in the beginning, this if you look down here, what's down is actually finite. If you move up here, it will be count infinite but countable, and then for a while it will be infinite and countable until we hit the first moment where that point and everything is when whatever is below that point, sorry, not that point, whatever is below that point is uncountable. There will be a first moment like that. So up to that point, if you if you look Up to that point, if you look back, we are countable. And then we hit the first point that's uncountable. And then, no matter what set we started with, uncountable set. So, notice there may be other stuff on top of this first point where what's below is uncountable. There is other stuff. So, no matter what uncountable set we started with, we will always hit a first point like that. We have this linear order here that everything. That you know, everything, all initial segments are countable, but that from that point, it's uncountable. No matter what uncountable set we started with, these linear orders that we produce, they are isomorphic with each other. If I started with the reals, I get this first point where I'm uncountable, and then I started with some other uncountable set, all continuous functions, from 0, 1 to r, I hit the same. zero one to r i hit the same point i hit that point what i produce is they are isomorphic with each other so this is called this isomorphism type is called is called omega one so i was a little brutal here in this what i did i used freely something called the axiom of choice and and so forth this omega one can be true no so one doesn't have to be one can be more gentle but then there's more to explain so And there's more to explain. So there is this omega one that places the same in the same position. So this is a linear order. It's something called well order. So it has the property that no matter what non-empty subset of it I pick, it will have the small as smallest element. It will be a unique element in it that's smallest in the set that I chose. Just like omega. Omega has the smallest. Just like omega, omega has the same property. Omega, remember, that's the same as n with the linear order. So omega one to the countable is in the same position as omega to the finite. There is something like this, some omega one like this. It's very important here to realize that objects like this exist. There is a common when you talk with sometimes with analysts and people like that, they think that all these things kind of end at omega. All these things kind of end at omega. There is this important object omega one above it that is qualitatively different from anything that's below it. Okay, that's now important for us because we want to are there questions about this kind of brutal introduction to Obeka 1 that I just gave. Okay, so if not, so let's let's let's now, how does it relate to Borel sets? So it turns Relate to Borel sets. So it turns out that the Borel sets come in this hierarchy. So Matt had a picture of it. It looks like a whale, if you draw it appropriately. So let me just define this hierarchy. It is important in its own right, but it also gives you a sense how far analytic non-Borel sets are from anything that's borel. So let's take open sets. I will denote them by sigma 01. 0 is Zero is just something that is constant here. Important here is this one. So, sigma zero one are open sets. I'm staying within some Polish space X. And then pi zero one are closed sets. And then, remember, Borel sets form a sigma algebra. So one can imagine gotten from open sets. So, how does one produce the sigma algebra step by step? Well, one Step by step. Well, one takes open sets, if one took countable unions of open sets, one wouldn't get much. Sorry, let's take pi zero one. If one take countable intersections of pi zero one sets, one wouldn't just would get again closed sets, but one can take countable unions. There's two operations at our disposal: countable unions and countable intersections. One takes countable unions of pi zero one sets, and then one gets sets that are. And then one gets sets that are μ, no longer pi 0 1, no longer close. And in general, they will not be open. For example, here, the set of rationals, if the space is the reals, one takes the space of rationals, it is a countable union of singletons. So that's a set that is going to be sigma zero two, countable union of pi zero one sets, that is not sigma zero one, that is not open. zero one that is not open and then one goes to the dual class one takes complements of sigma zero when one goes from the previous level to the next level one takes the complements of sets in in in in in sigma zero alpha plus one so here this is the same it turns out it's the same as countable intersections of Of sets in sigma zero alpha. So, what are these? Let me say this: what are these alphas here? These are elements of this order, this partial order. So, what we do, notice we look at sigma 0, 1, then we from it we get pi 02 from sorry, we take it's it's it's later here than there. It's so we have something. So we have something that is pi zero one, we get sigma zero two as countable unions. Then we flip, we go to pi zero two, and then we run the same procedure again. To get sigma zero three, we take countable unions of pi zero two sets. Then we flip, we go to pi zero three, I guess, then sigma zero four and so forth. And then sigma zero five and so forth until we produce until Until we produce, until we hit omega. So we exhaust all natural numbers and we hit omega. Many people think that this is where things end, but of course they don't, because you can take disjoint unions of sets, one set here in sigma zero, one, here in sigma zero two, sigma zero three, sigma zero four, and so forth. Disjoint union like that. Take this union. It's clearly not going to. It's clearly not going to be in any of these classes because it's not in sigma 04 because there is this bit here that is in sigma 05. It will rule it out as a member of sigma 04. So it's in none of these classes. So I can take this additional countable union and I'm getting out of all these finite classes. So this element will be, this set will be in sigma 0 omega. I should have said pi here. So if I So, if I run this hierarchy over natural numbers, I don't stop at once I exhaust natural numbers. There is new sets in general in a Pauli space produced at the omegas level when I take countable unions of whatever I produced before. And I continue doing it. I go to sigma omega plus one, sigma omega plus two, and so forth, using this procedure here. And then the Here and then there are these ordinals that are limit ordinals. I already encounter one like this, omega. In that case, such an ordinal lambda, so ordinal less than omega one, is not of the form alpha plus one. I just then take countable unions of sets that are in pi zero alpha classes before that lambda. And then pi zero lambda will be simply complements, which is the same as countable intersections of sets. off sets lambda in sigma zero lambda in the union sorry in in the union alpha it's lambda sigma zero lambda sigma zero alpha so is that is that okay so i'm i'm starting with closed of open sets and i iterate over the operations of countable union The operations of countable union and taking complement. And I count how many iterations I have to take: countable union, complement, countable union, complement, and so forth. This count is done by this ordinary. And what happens in all Polish spaces, so I somehow privilege taking countable unions and complements rather than countable intersections, but what these statements that need to be proved, but which I won't, say that it's not really the case. That it's not really the case that I could have that class, the pi classes are actually coming as countable intersections of previous sigma classes. So I could have taken countable intersections and complements, countable intersections and complements, and I would get the same hierarchy. Okay, any questions here? I continue it up to omega one. So let's draw a picture. So let's draw a picture, kind of not a whale, but okay. So we have the sigma zero one and pi zero one. When I take countable unions, I go here, countable intersections of sigma zero one, I go here, unions, intersections. So these sets, these families grow in that direction. I already said that at level omega, I get something new if the space is uncountable, non-trivial, and then I continue. continue ah pi zero sigma zero omega plus one and i continue but i continue only up to omega one up to this ordinal omega one and not farther why is that what happens is that borel sets it turns out that borel sets are equal to the union are equal to the union sigma zero alpha alpha less than omega one, which is the same as union of alpha less than omega one, pi zero alpha. Yes, so it turns out that actually going up to omega one exhausts the whole hierarchy. And the reason for it is that if I take sets, let's look at unions, let's take sets A0, A1, and so forth. And so forth, coming from here. This one will be in some sigma zero, alpha zero, this one in sigma zero, alpha one, and so forth. If I take their union, I have these alphas here. Where will this union be? Well, I take these alphas, these alphas, all of them come, are below omega one. Can this? Omega 1. Can they reach? So alpha n, can they reach omega 1? Well, they cannot. The reason is everything that is below alpha 0 is countable inside of omega 1. And everything that is below alpha n is countable. So if they reached, if their supremum was omega 1, this union of sets that are below them, this union would be equal to omega 1, which would make omega. Which would make omega one looking backwards, omega one would see only countably many points, but it was the first point when it was uncountable. So all these omega ones have a certain supremum alpha that is still below omega one. Therefore, this is in sigma zero alpha. So backed in this class. So these classes are closed under countable complements, under complemented. Complements, and the complement that's easy to see, but also countable unions. So they actually form a sigma algebra. So for this reason, they include all Borel sets. The other direction is kind of obvious. So Borel sets are now given as this growing hierarchy. So as you can see, yes, so we have this hierarchy, and so there is this. So, there is this reaching for the uncountable. And if I have an analytic set that is not Borel, it cannot be reached even through this very long chain of countable operations. Is this okay with people? Any questions here? So, again, it's important to remember that there are these. So, let me give a couple of examples. So, let me give a couple of examples. So, very natural examples turn out to be somewhere higher in this Borel hierarchy rather than not just at the open or closed level. For example, if we look at functions that are n times continuously differentiable, as long as n is bigger than or equal to one, all this space lies inside of the space of all continuous functions from 0, 1 to r. This set turns out to be pi 0, 3. So this is. Pi zero three, so this it is on the third level here, but it's not here, and therefore it's not anywhere below. So this is a set that is actually pi zero three, a natural set that is pi zero three, that is not sigma zero three. And then I so another, this one we encountered already, this Borel set. This is a subset of continuous functions from zero, one to r. functions from 0, 1 to r, the space of all home, the set of all homeomorphism from 0 to 1, it's at the second level, it's pi 0, 2, and it is not sigma 0, 2. So it's not below. You reach it at the second iteration, but not earlier. And then let's do a kind of a computatorial example here. Let's look at all elements of this counter set represented in this form. counter set represented in this form. So these are all binary functions, functions of values 0, 1 from the set n cross n. And let's just define a set just because we can that I want to look at the set of all x's such that for infinitely many m there exists, there exists infinitely many n such that x of m n is zero. So this set turns out So, this set turns out to be one can compute, it is pi zero four. It's a naturally defined combinatorial set that is not any earlier. It's not sigma zero four and it's not earlier. Yes, so what are these quantifiers? We just say for each m prime, there exists an m, there is infinitely many m's, such that this m is such that for each n prime, there exists an m bigger than an n prime, such that x of m n is zero. Such that x of m n is zero. So, by the way, I want to. I think I have still maybe a couple more minutes. So, I have to say here a little bit about counting quantifiers. This comes up quite often in all these considerations. One can immediately see from the form of this set that this set is going to be pi zero four. The difficult part is that it's not sigma zero four. Why is it pi zero four? Why is it pi 04? One just counts quantifiers. Countable quantifiers of the existential type, when one says there exists something and this something comes from a countable set, like natural numbers, they correspond to taking countable unions. And a universal quantification over countable set, they control countable intersections. So this condition here defines a set that is both closed and open. That's easy to see. In that spectrum, Easy to see in that space, this condition defines a set that is closed and open. I'm taking here countable unions, so this set here is open. Then I'm taking countable intersections. So this set therefore is pi zero two. This set is sigma zero one. This set is sigma zero two, sigma zero three, because it's a countable union of pi zero two sets, what precedes it. And then the last quantifier. And then the last quantifier adds another number here. So it's pi 0, 4, because it's a countable intersection of sigma 03 sets. So these are, but just by looking at the form of a formula defining a given set, one can often get a kind of this upper estimate on where in that hierarchy the set resides. Right, so this again, this hierarchy here is a growing hierarchy as we go to the round. Going hierarchy. As we go to the right, sets get bigger. And if the space is uncountable, they get strictly bigger. So, any questions about these examples? There's a question in the chat. Oh, there's a question in the chat. Yeah, but you present a little complicated syncraft. Yes. Should the quantifier exist in what? I think it's fine because it's fine. It's fine. So there exists this quantifier is red. There exists infinitely many M's. What does it mean for it to be infinitely many M's? So sorry. Oh, no, yes. Thank you. Ah, yeah, Dakota. Thanks, thanks, thanks. Yes, it is infinity. Yes, very good. I think I read them as infinity exist, but I. them as in exist but i i wrote in human for all but your formula is correct this this formula is correct and the pi zero four is correct okay am i out of time yes your time ran out a few minutes ago okay so this is it for today and tomorrow there will be more about the differences between analytic and more else Addition, just maybe zero example you could put the rationals are a sigma but not gaze. Yes, zero here. You could, I mentioned it, right? But so if q if you look at q as this is a very good example, actually, q subset of r. subset of R, this set is sigma 02, but not pi 02. It's an interest pi 02. It's an interesting exercise to show that it's not pi 02. Here it takes some kind of more non-trivial than this one. Any questions or comments? Thanks, Lana Kigi I don't know. Thanks, Laura. Give it.
