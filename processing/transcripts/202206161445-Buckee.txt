Thanks. So I guess I'm going to talk at a slightly different kind of in a different way about some of this. During the pandemic, my approach, in addition to supporting some of the countries I work in, like Bangladesh and Guyana, was to take the thing that I know how to do well and see if I could actually work with policymakers and help them interpret new data. And help them interpret new data streams. And I'm kind of, I'm gonna talk a bit about that and then hopefully talk about some of the lessons learned with respect to structural problems and how we might fail again if there's another pandemic and what we can do to fill in that gap. So I don't need to explain to this audience, but most of the work that I'm going to talk about is about spatial models, trying to understand the spatial spread of the coronavirus or Of coronavirus or anything else, and usually within meta-population frameworks, but also just thinking about migration dynamics in general. So traditionally speaking, as of 20 years ago, and still in many places, travel surveys form the basis of mobility models where trying to understand how people are moving around within a metapopulation framework, or we use gravity models or something like that to parameterize mobility. To parameterize mobility between different places, whether that's between cities, between countries, and so on. And over the last more than a decade now, we've been working with data providers like telcos to use mobile phone data to try and understand those parameters and apply them to epidemic models and forecasts to try to make sense of how diseases might spread and see if we can use this data routinely. Use this data routinely, especially in the context of an epidemic, to help with the predictions about where disease might go next and to try and understand what's happening in general. And you'll see here on the right, this is just as of 2018. And of course, this has gone up now everywhere. Everyone has a phone and telecoms routinely collect this data for purposes of churn analytics. So I'll talk a bit more about the data itself, but the basis of this talk is how. The basis of this talk is how we were using this data during the pandemic and what I think it says about our preparedness in terms of integrating new data sources, particularly private data sources, in models and in surveillance moving forward. So we've been doing this for a long time. This is an example of what you can measure with mobile phones. This is a project we did in Bangladesh. Aisha Mahmoud led this, and you're looking at the movement of about 65 million. 65 million SIM cards in Bangladesh. And this was looking at the Eid holiday. So Dhaka is at the center there. And during the Eid holiday, people leave the capital, they move out into the countryside, and then they all come back in. And the heat map just shows the flow of people out relative to the flow of people in. And so at the start of the holiday, people all leave. And then after the holiday is over, they all come back in. So obviously, with a So, obviously, with a gravity model, you don't get this kind of asymmetric flow of people. You can't measure in real time what's happening. And especially if there are large asymmetric movements or differences in movement patterns, this kind of data is very helpful. And so, in this context, this paper, we were looking at a chikungunya outbreak in Dhaka in the capital. And so, we had a mechanistic model for the dynamics of the disease in the capital. Of the disease in the capital, and then we use the mobile phone data to try and understand the spread of the disease out of the capital. The reason that's important in Bangladesh and in other settings like Bangladesh is because there's very little routine surveillance in the rest of the country. And so there's an important question of where you look next for the infection when an epidemic starts to happen. So, again, the reason it's particularly helpful in the context of pandemics or epidemics is because you have a lot of signal in the Because you have a lot of signal in the case data. And if you have large surges of the population due to non-pharmaceutical interventions or for other reasons like a holiday, then the movement data is really useful because you can start to see some of these dynamics that you wouldn't normally be able to look at. One of the general findings from doing this work over the last 10 years is that there is just a huge volume of travel that's relatively long distance, especially in low and middle income. Especially in low and middle income countries. So, this is work from Thailand by Matt Kiang, who's now at Stanford. And if you look at the sort of expected frequency distribution of the number of trips of different lengths, so here on the sorry, the x-axis doesn't seem to be labeled, but eventually that's essentially the x-axis is the distance between locations, and the y-axis shows you the number of trips that you would expect between those locations based on a standard. Those locations based on a standard gravity kind of model, an abstract model, and then you look at what you actually see in Thailand. And what you can see is a very large amount of travel, a lot of it at this intermediate distance. And that intermediate distance is interesting because it's very related to the geography of the country. So that big spike that you see in the middle happens to be the distance between Bangkok and many parts of the country. And so, sort of the geography of the country, how it's laid out, how the system. Geography of the country, how it's laid out, how the cities are, will really determine what this distribution looks like. Generally speaking, there's a lot more travel, a lot more long-distance travel than you might expect from some traditional models. Right, so there's Bangkok in the middle, and you can see that there's some symmetry in the distances there, that that's why that peak happens. In the chicken gunya model that I showed you for Bangladesh, if you do compare your epidemic model, Your epidemic model forecasts about where you think things should go, and then you look at what you would expect with a traditional model. Generally speaking, what you see is that the longer distance places, the disease arrives sooner than you would expect. And some of the closer range places don't receive it as quickly as you would expect. And this finding we've actually seen in, we saw it in Pakistan when we were looking at dengue. Looking at dengue. We've seen it in Thailand in various contexts. And so I think there's something general about how we move, at least in the pre-pandemic era, that we could start to build out generalizable frameworks potentially. So during emergencies and epidemics in particular, you can see the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions. And so we did this for Ebola. Corey Peake led this work. And we were just looking for anomalies to see whether you could see the impact. Whether you could see the impact of national lockdowns. The epidemic is shown here on the left, and then there's this very simple anomaly detection algorithm that Corey looked at. You could see travel between places goes along with some noise. And then when a lockdown is impacted, you can see a drastic reduction in mobility that bounces back when it's lifted. So when COVID happened, we had non-pharmacy. We had non-pharmaceutical interventions enacted globally, of course. So, this list is from BBC and it just shows the timing of lockdowns on national and local levels in different parts of the world. And really, it was such an unprecedented thing where suddenly the whole world stopped moving and had these NPIs put in place all of a sudden. So, it's this massive kind of experiment. And because we've done this work before, Because we've done this work before, and there are different ways that you can use mobile phone data. In this paper, we just kind of outlined the types of places during an epidemic when it might be useful. And you see the boxes in red, one of the key things is these non-pharmaceutical interventions, because you can measure big changes in mobility patterns very clearly using mobile phone data. So, when COVID happened, we decided that this was a good place for us to kind of focus our efforts. I should say that there are two I should say that there are two types of data here. There are data from mobile operators, so these are CDRs, and they are associated with the use of SIM cards, including dumb phones and cell towers. So whenever you use your phone, you have a cell tower ID associated with that. The operator keeps a log, and then as you move from tower to tower, there's an approximate location that depends on the density of towers in that place, but it's approximate. Towers in that place, but it's approximate. And so you have a discrete, a time series with gaps in it, and you're making inference by aggregating all of that data, clustering all the people at that tower at that time, and then trying to measure how many people move between towers over time. In contrast, we also have data from people like Google, Facebook, the foot traffic data, points of interest data, and these are GPS-based. They're often add to. Based, they're often ad tech associated, they're often sold by data brokers, and I'm happy to talk about that a bit later. But those are much more precise and in terms of regulation, they are much less regulated, but they have usually have less representativeness because they rely on smartphones and particular apps and things like that. So, those are the kinds of data that we're talking about. And as you are all probably aware, when Probably aware, when the lockdown started happening, many data providers started spitting out these kinds of mobility dashboards, mobility trends. People started using this data in epidemic models, but also just like trying to understand what was going on in terms of human behavior and the extent to which human, this type of mobility was actually correlated with transmission. And so, in addition to doing In addition to doing a lot of kind of just help supporting policy in general, we decided that this was a good place for us to kind of work. And the problem, the sort of the translational problem is that companies have all of this data, policymakers want to understand what's happening, and then there are all these dashboards in between, but the policymakers really don't know how to interpret it. And often the data wasn't presented in a way that was actually. Data wasn't presented in a way that was actually useful. So we made this network of researchers. Some of the people there were probably in that network. Together with Sachit Balsari and Andrew Schroeder, we started this network of people. My graduate student, Nishant Kishore, who's now at CDC, was really pivotal in pushing this work ahead. And the idea was that we tried to partner researchers with local policymakers to help them interpret some of this data in the context of specific policy decisions that they Context of specific policy decisions that they had to make. So, for example, Nishant was giving daily situation reports to a number of different city and state level people within the US, and then we were also working internationally. And from that network, we built out this platform. And really, it's kind of an experiment in how you take new methods and modeling potentially and actually try and translate it. Translate it. And I, in my mind, having been a modeler for quite a long time now, this is the real problem for pandemic preparedness. It's the breakdown in translation and the lack of expertise in the right liminal space between science and policy. And so we broke this down for this context in terms of the data itself, which in this case came from private companies, the methods or the analytical tools we had to make sense of it. Analytical tools, we had to make sense of it in the context of models and just as a data analysis in that context, and then how well policymakers could actually use those insights to make decisions. And we tried to build out a network of people. And I think in the context of what we need for the next pandemic, I'm convinced that the most important thing is this data translator role. It could be, it could say modeler, but essentially, we don't have enough people. But essentially, we don't have enough people that understand local contexts who also understand science, who also understand the local needs and can translate it to policymakers. And I think, as a field, we're going to have to think about how we scale education and training for that group of people that are kind of in between worlds. So, some of the work that we did, Nishant and Rebecca Khan led this piece. We were just looking across cities in the US and looking at Cities in the US and looking at Facebook data and look at percentage changes. And so, you know, you can see this pre-lockdown surge of activity when people are preparing and buying toilet paper or whatever else they're doing, followed by this reduction in mobility patterns. And we saw an emptying out of urban spaces that was heterogeneous across the country. In New York, it was very, in many cities, in fact, it was very. In many cities, in fact, it was very differentially distributed. We saw Manhattan emptied out, the neighborhoods around Manhattan did not. And when you started to compare that to patterns of transmission, so for example, in this study, it was a seroprevalence survey looking at, actually it wasn't seroprevalence, it was PCR prevalence in pregnant women delivering at hospitals around New York. So a relatively good random sample. And if you compare And if you compare those data to the mobility data for commuting, and you look at commuting patterns in particular, so movement out in the morning, back in the afternoon, you see a good correlation between the point prevalence, PCR prevalence among pregnant women, and how much that neighborhood could lock down. So, in places that were able to really lock down and show large decline in commuting, we saw much less transmission occurring, not surprisingly, but it gave Occurring, not surprisingly, but it gave a kind of mechanistic basis to why that might have been happening related to essential workers. The lockdowns, we also looked at lockdown behavior in the context of when you announce the lockdown relative to when the lockdown starts. And we did this using night lights. This is from Nishant and Rebecca's paper. And this graph shows France, India, and Spain, and it's stratified by nightlight category, which is a Statified by nightlight category, which is a proxy for how urban a place is. And then you look at percent change in the Facebook data for those populations. And if you just look at the India chart there, you can see that in the places with the most nightlight, so that's cities, we saw a large decrease in the population as people left to go to the country. And the further before, the longer before the lockdown started that it was announced, the more. Lockdown started that it was announced, the more we saw this mass exodus out. This shows a similar thing from Bangladesh. And in this study, we were looking at some of genomic data from around the country as well with our colleagues there. And we were looking at the impact of the cyclone on top of the lockdown orders. And you saw a very distinct signal in the data that you could link to some of the dynamics and transmission. In cities, we saw a very strong parallel dynamic that was happening in New York, which is in poor neighborhoods that were unable to lock down, you saw more transmission. So this was Santiago in Chile led by Pamela Martinez. And what you can see here is the layout of the city. The heat map of the city shows the socioeconomic status of the different neighborhoods. And on the right, you can see the correlation between that socioeconomic status. Between that socioeconomic status and the COVID deaths per 10,000. And if you look at the mobility patterns, then you can see indeed that people in poorer neighborhoods were less able to lock down. So during that full lockdown period, people in rich areas were able to really stop moving and the others were not. Again, that's only mechanism, it's only an association, so it provides a hint at what might be happening. We and others were. We and others were interested in the fact that this was correlational and the data was difficult to work with and sometimes not necessarily representativeness. And so something that Nishant did together with our collaborators was to really start to look into the data itself and try and make sense of where we were going to get reliable information and where we weren't. I think because this is a new data source, there's a whole, there's an eagerness to jump. There's an eagerness to jump onto it and use it, which is great, but there is a lot of uncertainty. And so, trying to quantify and translate that uncertainty to policymakers becomes a challenge, and I think is a general challenge for modelers, which maybe you've discussed already. For this kind of data, there are very clear spatial patterns of missingness that is going to affect the estimates. So, here on the this is a heat map. This is a heat map that shows for different parts of the US, organized from urban to rural, we lined up all of the mobility data we could get our hands on. So the SG is SafeGraph, Mapbox, Google, Facebook, Descartes Labs, Canberra, and Apple. And then we looked at missing this. And so what you can see is that we, unsurprisingly, we do best in urban centers, but there's not just spatial differential. But there's not just spatial differential on an urban to rural gradient, there's also temporal variation where there's just data missing sometimes. I'm really happy to talk about this more. It's a complicated data landscape that I think doesn't, there needs to be more discussion of it. So Nishant has started to, we've started to try to lay out a framework to try and do this in a systematic way and understand how uncertain the data are and what that means for model predictions. That means for model predictions as well as other kinds of intervention-related work. So, you know, the coverage, depending on the data sources variable, here we just have for one state, we have three different data sources. They show different signals. And there's a lot of methodological work to understand how to combine this data. And I guess it's, you know, for a lot of us, there is new data, there's genomic data, there's wastewater data, and so on. And it's about Wastewater data and so on, and it's about trying to understand how the signal, when is the signal reliable, and what is exactly the use case in a public health context. So, I want to talk about the structure of this. So, before the pandemic, the way that this kind of work was done was that the private companies have the data. Scientists have developed these methods and used them in models and shown that they might be useful. Public health departments. Public health departments have operational commitments and decisions that they have to make. So, in the past, when I've done this kind of work, there's been a whole bunch of regulatory data sharing IRB types of steps that have to happen in advance. And this can take years, sometimes two to four years, national regulator approvals, data use agreements, internal IRBs. The national regulators are usually Ministry of Telecommunication. Are usually the Ministry of Telecommunications, you have an agreement with the Ministry of Health. All of these approvals have to be there, and that represents a very significant hurdle to the use of this kind of approach routinely for surveillance, especially in the context of a public health emergency like a pandemic. So these types of relationships have to be ready upfront. And I think this is a huge challenge that we have to overcome as we move forward. As we move forward. What's interesting to me is that now, when the pandemic happened, it was just like the floodgates opened. So now we have a very, much more complicated ecosystem. We have middlemen, data brokers who buy data from companies and then sell them on. We have ad tech data, which is completely has its own missingness and representativeness issues and so on. There are ad tech. And so on. There are ad tech data providers that are now selling mobility data directly to law enforcement, as well as data brokers who are selling to law enforcement and public health departments. It's very much unregulated at this point. There's no longer all of these sort of slow, cumbersome processes. And I, you know, it's unclear to me if that's happening with other kinds of data that might be useful in the future for pandemic preparedness. But this has become a very big issue as we try and move this. As we try and move this into a routine data sharing landscape. So, for example, we've been discussing the possibility of an emergency trigger that would, in the case of a pandemic, that would facilitate data release from operators for public health purposes. And that's something that has precedent in the context of natural disasters with the National Space Charter. So, satellite businesses have to release data with certain triggers. Data with certain triggers. But at the moment, that doesn't happen. And so, you know, it's usually very hard to get access to the data. And it's become kind of a problem on one end. And then the other problem is that now it's this wild west where people are selling data inappropriately, including, for example, some ad tech and data brokers selling data within the Ukraine on the location of people. So last year, we put together a series of We put together a series of seminars on the use of this data for public health emergencies, including pandemics. And there's a white paper of that. And then last week, I co-chaired a National Academies session on working group on this because I think it's going to become a very contentious issue. And I think there might well be other data sets that would be useful for pandemic preparedness that we need to have these governance and Governance and regulation conversations about. In general, for me, having done a lot of modeling, I really felt that the biggest failure was, and in some ways it worked amazingly well, and in other cases it didn't work at all. There's this liminal space, like I mentioned, between academic science and decision making. And in some ways, sorry, my slides. Yeah, and in some ways, Slides. Yeah, and in some ways, the gap there is one of time scale, specificity and urgency of the question, and the technical and analytical capacity. So the possibilities for surveillance and pandemic response in terms of technical methods and analytical approaches is now very, very high. And it's much higher than policymakers' ability to absorb those. Policymakers' ability to absorb those methods or even understand them. And so we have to find a way to do that translation that is context specific. And that's going to require a lot of people. So like I said, I think that for me is the biggest problem that we face as a group. And there are some of these really interested participatory approaches, networks of people that could be built. And the question is, you know, how do we find funding? You know, how do we find funding and interest in making sure that that gap is filled effectively during the next pandemic? And that capacity is local in the sense that the context is well understood. And then the last thing I'll say, and then I'll stop, is that I've noticed from where I'm sitting that we, so last in 2020, I wrote this piece about women fighting the pen. Piece about women fighting the patriarchy and COVID-19, and joined by some other female researchers. I think another thing that we really need to care and worry about is that I think women are going to leave science. I think it's already happening. I see it in my graduate students and my postdocs, and especially among infectious disease modelers. I think this is going to happen. We saw a really difficult and hostile environment for female researchers. For female researchers in the media and how they were treated and who listened to them, even in academic institutions. And I was very troubled by this. And I think that we need to come together to understand why it happened and how to stop it from stop the sort of hemorrhage of women that I am worried will happen if we don't do something. And so I don't know if this is the right context for that conversation, but I think women and particularly women. But I think women, and particularly women of colour, had a really difficult time. And, you know, I think the structure of our training programmes needs to change to accommodate this more local capacity that's global. And I also think that we have to think about the culture of the field. So I'll stop. I'm happy to answer questions. And again, I'm really sorry I can't be there. Life gets in the way sometimes. So.
