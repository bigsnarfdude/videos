The opportunity to give a talk, and I would like to greet everyone in Oahaca and attending online. So, this is a joint work with Florian Tranold and Jens Reinald. And before going to the statement of our results, let me recall what the Matson-Weiss theorem says. It's about moderate spaces of surfaces. So, I will denote So, I will denote by Mg1. By the way, can you see my mouse? Yes, we can. Great. So, Mg1 will denote the modular space of compact Riemann surfaces of type sigma G1. By this notation, I will mean a surface of genus G with one parameterized boundary component. When I say that a boundary component is parameterized, I mean that there is a preferred different That there is a preferred diffeomorphism with S1. And as a model, as my favorite model for S1 is the unit circle in the complex plane. So when you consider model spaces of surfaces with boundary, they are classifying spaces of their fundamental groups, so they are spherical. And the fundamental group of Mg1 is also known as the mapping class group. Class group. I will denote it by gamma g1, and it's the group of diffeomorphisms of a surface sigma g1 fixing the boundary point twice, and diffeomorphisms we consider them up to isotopy. Now, one is interested in studying this modular species, or therefore their fundamental groups, the mapping class groups, and there is a construction. Construction to consider this modular species, not each one on its own, but all together. The easiest instance of this construction is given by taking two surfaces, sigma g1 and sigma g prime one of the genera g and g prime, and one can glue them together. In this picture, you see I've taken a surface of genus two and one of genus one, and then I've also taken a disc with two. A disc with two smaller disks removed. You can glue the first surface along the inner component, the first inner component of the disk, and the second surface along the second component. And in doing this, we also use the parameterization of these two boundary curves. In this picture, the little dot is supposed to remember, recall that we have parameterized curves and Have parameterized curves, and it should be the starting point of the parameterization. And you see also that the outer boundary of the disk is a new boundary component of the new surface, which has genus 3, and it is parameterized as well. In fact, this construction gives rise to a slopily, you can see it's a topological monoid structure on M star 1 that is. M star one that is the disjoint union of all these modular spaces. A bit more precisely, I could say this gives an E1 algebra structure on this disjoint union. And in fact, it's easy to see that this extends even to an E2 algebra structure. And the formulation of the Matzen-Weiss theorem is that if you take this topological monoid and we group compared to logical monoid and we group complete it. So we apply omega b, what we get is an infinite loop space and namely the infinite loose space of the spectrum MTSO tool. And as a historical remark, I mean the fact that there is an E2 algebra structure tells you that this group completion you can expect is a double loop space. And it's a result of Tillman that in fact you get some infinite. And that in fact you get some infinite loose space of some spectrum, and Manson and Weiss identify this spectrum. So, this is the classical story. And now we pass to our problem. What about free-loop spaces of this moduli space? Here I've just copied again the Manson-Inweiss theorem. So, now we consider the free loop space lambda mg1 and Mg1, and by this notation I mean just the space of the mapping space, the space of maps from the circle S1 to Mg1. It's a general fact that if you have an E2 algebra and you take mapping space from your favorite space into it, you get again an E2 algebra by pointwise operation. I've written here lambda wise. I hope this is intuitive. intuitive. So all in all we get that this joint union of free loop spaces lambda m star one is also an into algebra. And we can ask the analog question what is the group completion of this group completion when we consider this just as any one algebra or topological monoid, if I can say this. This well, there are two features of these group completions that we can see immediately and justify quickly. The one is that in fact m star one is not only an e2 algebra, but is an algebra over a larger operate. This is the operat of surfaces introduced by Tillman, and which I denote with this calligraphic M. With this calligraphic M. So calligraphic M contains E2, a version of the E2 operators. As a consequence of this, and consequence of a result by Thielmann, if you group complete an algebra over a surface operator, what you get is always an infinite loop space. So whatever this group completion is, it's ought to be an infinite loop space. Not only this, but we can also consider this. But we can also consider this sequence of maps. We can go from m star 1 by taking constant free loops into lambda, m star 1, and vice versa. We can evaluate at 1, 1 is a point of S1. We can evaluate three loops at 1, and we get the four maps from lambda m star 1. Lambda m star one to m star one. And both of these maps are maps of algebras over the operat m and the composite map is clearly the identity of m star one. That is, since Tillman's result is functorial, when we grow complete, we get a map of infinite loose spaces from m star one, so from the group completion of m star one. So, from the good completion of MSR1 to the good completion of lambda MSR1, back to the good completion of MSR1. In other words, one of the factors of this infinite space ought to be the group completion of MSR1, which is this omega-infinity MTSU2. And at this point, we can state the main result. So, the result is that there exists a topological. exists a topological space X which I will talk about later such that the group completion of lambda star one is the product of the classical factor omega infinity MTSO2 and the free infinite loose space generated by X. So let me remark that the previous discussion I made in previous slide just tells you that this could Just tells you that this group completion is the product of omega-infinity TSO2 with some infinity due space, but it's not clear that this question marks should correspond to a free spectrum. And this is part of the statement of this theorem. And the other part is we give a description of this space X, and this will appear in the last slide of my talk. So keep listening. So, if you see this statement, it will remind you of a generalization of Tillman's result, which is due to Bastera, Bovkova, Ponto, Tillman and Diego. And what they consider is a notion of operats with homological stability. I wrote in parentheses monochromatic because later I want to consider operats. I want to consider operators with many colors, but at the moment we just stick to the more familiar, possibly more familiar notion of monochromatic cooperative. So there is this notion of monochromatic cooperat. For the purposes of this talk, it suffices for me to restrict to monogromatic cooperatives that contain a version of the E2 operator as. The E2 operate as a sub-operate. This is a stronger assumption than what these authors need, but sufficient for this talk. And then, yeah, there is another condition which gives the name operate with homological stability. I will not go into the definition. I will just state that Tillman's operate M is an example of an operate with homological stability and And one of the results of these authors is that if you have an algebra y over an opera with homological stability O, then these authors can give a description of its group completion, in particular they prove it's an infinite loose space, always. And if the algebra is free, is a free algebra generated by a space X, then A space X, then its group completion has this form. It is the group completion of the initial O algebra times the free infinite loose space generated by X. And yes, also this initial, the group completion of this initial O algebra is an infinite loose space. So in general, not a free one. Yeah, this theorem translates in, I mean, if I mean, if you take, yeah, let me just, let me just compare. Sorry. Let me just compare our theorem with this theorem. If you know this theorem and look at the statement of our theorem, you might guess maybe the way in which they prove this statement is by proving that lambda m star one as an algebra over the surface operate is a free algebra. Surface operate is a free algebra, right? If this were the case, such a statement would follow immediately. So, unfortunately, this is not so easy. The reality is a bit more difficult. And I will describe what's going on in the sequel of the talk. So, the first important thing that I want to point out is even if we are Out that is even if we are only interested in free loop spaces of moduli spaces of the form Mg1, so surfaces of genus G with only one boundary curve, we will need to consider a moduli of surfaces with multiple boundary curves. In the entire talk, I will only consider actually surfaces with non-empty boundary. So So, but possibly we have to consider surfaces with disconnected boundary. So, by Mgn for G greater or equal than 0 and N greater or equal than 1, this talk, I will consider the moduli space. Mgn is the modular space of Riemann surfaces of genus G with N ordered and parameterized boundary components. What do I mean by ordered and parameterized? I mean that the boundary of S is equipped with a preferred diffium office with this one manifold, the product of the set one up to n with S1. And we require also this parameterization to be compatible with the boundary orientation in the sense that, you know. In the sense that, you know, if you have a Riemann surface, it induces the Riemann structure induces an orientation on the boundary. And also, this parameterization induces an orientation on the boundary. And we ask that these two orientations agree. Yeah, also in the case with many boundary components, as soon as there is at least one, it's true that mgen is a cost-even space for the mapping. Space for the mapping class group gamma gen, which is defined as the group of isotopic classes of diffeomorphisms of sigma gen fixing pointwise the boundary. And now there is an observation which is, we will use it for especially for n equal one, but in general, if you have the free loop space of the classifying space of a discrete group, this will be homotopy. This will be homotopy equivalent to this joint union of class event spaces of subgroups. And in our case, we have a disjoint union for phi running over a system of representative of representative of the conjugacy classes of gamma gen of classifying spaces of the centralizers of phi in gamma gen. So the centralizer is the Centralizer is the subgroup of gamma gen of elements commuting with phi. This, such a I mean, an equivalence like this is available for every discrete group, in particular for gamma gen. And so in some sense, the first goal would be to describe, to understand what these centralizers are. And we would like to understand them when phi. To understand them when phi is mapping class in gamma g1, because that's what we need for our problem. Nevertheless, the description of such centralizers will involve all mapping class groups with also with many boundary components. And that's the reason why we have to enlarge our problem. Excuse me, Andrea. There's a question in the chat from Chris. There's a question in the chat from Chris Brav. He asks: How does the diffeomorphism group take into account the parametrization in complex geometry? There are two modelized spaces: marked points and marked points with tangent direction. Okay, equivalent to either one of those? So if you think of marked points instead of boundary curves, then you should think, yes, mark points with tangential direction. Tangent direction. And tangent. Direction and tangent preferred tangent direction. And then the idea is that a plane boundary curve corresponds to just marked points that you can remove or you can remove a little neighborhood of it so that you get a boundary curve. And instead, if a parameterized boundary curve also tells you how to glue in a disk. Glue in a disk whose center is standard framing of the standard disk in R2. So, so yeah, so but I prefer to consider surfaces with an actual boundary, a one-dimensional boundary, because this allows me to talk about gluing surfaces with each other. Great, thanks. So So, this talk has a technical part, and before diving into it, I would like to discuss some mapping classes and how their centralizers look like. And I will use this picture of a surface of Genome 7 with one boundary curve. And the first mapping class I want to consider is the dent twist around this green. Around this green curve. So, what can we say about this mapping class? Well, we can find the composition of the surface as you see now. There is a yellow region containing the green curve and there is a white region. The yellow region is a two polar neighborhood of the green curve. And the fact is that. And the fact is that the dense twist around the green curve can be represented by a diffeomorphism of the surface, which is the identity on the white part. So it's a diffeomorphism that only acts on the yellow part. And not only this, but there is another feature that this decomposition has, namely, suppose that psi is any mapping class of this surface. mapping class of this surface that commutes in the mapping class group with this then twist. Well then psi must send up to isotopy the green curve to itself, possibly up to reversing the orientation of the green curve. If this is the case we can represent psi by a well-chosen diffeomorphism that sends the actual green curve to itself. Actual green curve to itself. And up to changing the representing diffeomorphism again, we can also achieve that this diffeomorphism representing psi sends the yellow region to itself, so this cylinder is mapped to itself, and also the white region is mapped to itself. And of course, these two restricted diffeomorphisms have to be compatible on this two they have they must have the same behavior, they must glue on these two yellow curves. These two yellow curves. Moreover, the diffomorphism on the yellow region ought to commute with the dent twist. And it's a fact that indeed vice versa, if you choose a mapping, a diffheomorph is more the white region. And the diffheomorph is not the yellow region commuting with the dent twist up to isotopy. And this clue where This glue well along the yellow curves, then you can get a diffeomorphism of the entire surface, which will be a mapping class commuting with a dent twist as a mapping class in the big surface. Here is another example. Here now I take the product of these two dent twists and again I can define this decomposition of the surface into a white and a yellow reach. The surface into a white and a yellow region. Again, there is a representing diffeomorphism which is supported on the yellow region, so it's identity on the white region. And again, if psi is a mapping class commuting with the product of the two turn twists, then how can psi act on the isotopic glasses of these two green curves? It can possibly swap them or send each. them or send each curve to itself and possibly can reverse some orientations. But as an oriented isotopic class is this the set of these two curves has to be invariant. And again you can represent psi by a diffeomorphism which sends the yellow region to itself, the white region to itself and the yellow curves to themselves. And there is in this example I want to point out that it's actually possible to point out that it's actually possible to to to find a diffeomorphism psi that exchanges uh this uh cylinder with this other cylinder swaps them or you can also uh exchange fix send each cylinder to itself but exchange the two boundary curves of a cylinder and thus invert the orientation of a of a curve and uh i mean there are other examples i can draw And there are other examples I can draw. Here is, for example, the product of two separating tint twists. And again, there is the composition into a white and a yellow region. But notice this time that the yellow region is not just a union of two tubular neighborhoods of the green curves. It's slightly larger. So you can think that I first colored in yellow to In yellow, two small cylinders around the green curves, and then what was left was disconnected. There were three components, and I colored in white only the component containing the boundary of the surface I'm interested in. And everything else which is disconnected from the boundary ought to be yellow as well. Again, a mapping class commuting with this product of the end twist can swap this yellow component with this. This yellow component with this yellow component, but I mean, the important fact is that it can be represented by a diffeomorphism that preserves this decomposition. And here is the most complicated example of the ones that I've prepared. So here I will take the product of the dent twists in the order in which they are labeled. So d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6. 4, D5, D6. Take this big product. It's a mapping class, and the composition of the surface I want to consider is the one that you see now. And again, mapping class commuting with this product of green dent twists can possibly exchange this cylinder with this and can possibly. Cylinder with this, and you can possibly also swap this component with this component. But it has to restrict on the yellow part to a mapping class that commutes with the product of the identities, and it has to restrict to some mapping class on the white part. And these two have to be compatible when we study their behavior on the yellow course. Last example: if I take the pandor twist. If I take the panda hidden twist, so I push the panda inside and consider the panda hidden twist. Here, pay attention because the decomposition I want to consider is the following one. So, basically, everything is yellow and just a color neighborhood of the boundary is going to be white. Again, the reason is that I want the white region to be connected to the boundary, and as we will see later, this We will see later this in the case in this case we will say that this is a mapping class which is boundary irreducible and this should not be confused with more classical notion of irreducible mapping class. This means this mapping class is not classically reducible because there are plenty of simple closed curves that are fixed up to sort of inbate. But it will be But it will be boundary irreducible. So the general statement is the following: given a mapping class phi in a mapping class group, possibly with more than one boundary component, then we can find the decomposition of the surface sigma gen into a white and a yellow region. And the yellow region that I've denoted by W and Y along a multi-curve, so a system of curves C1 up to CH. And these multi-curves have the property that for each of them, on one side there is W and on the other side there is Y. So in particular, each of them obtains an orientation as boundary of Y. On the other hand, there is no. On the other hand, there is no canonical order on this system of curves. And which properties does this decomposition have? Well, every connected component of W touches the boundary. In our previous examples, there was only one boundary curve, and this forces W to be connected. No connected component of Y is a disk. And most important feature is that phi can be represented by Is that phi can be represented by a diffeomorphism that fixes w pointwise? And there are possibly many decompositions with all these properties, but there is exactly one up to isotopy for which W is maximal in the posit of isotopy classes of subsurfaces respecting all the requirements that I've listed before. And this is going to be the so-called this. To be the so-called this multi-curve is what we call the cut locus, it's where you have to cut the surface to consider the maximum the mapping class as acting as the dentity on W and as something non-trivial in the yellow part. We also give this definition: a mapping class is boundary reducible if the cut locus is precisely the Precisely the multi-curve given by pushing inside the boundary components of the surface. Yeah, there is this fact that if phi is any mapping class and you represent it by a diffeomorphism fixing W pointwise, in particular phi must preserve each preserve each boundary well it fixes each boundary component of y and because y is in the middle between w and y and in particular each component p of y is sent to itself so we can consider the restriction of phi at least of this diffeomorphism which has to be chosen but let me let me let me not comment on this because Comment on this. We can construct the restricted mapping class in the mapping class group of P and this mapping class has the feature of always being boundary irreducible. It is important to note that even if we started from a surface sigma g1, as we saw in the examples, yellow components being yellow The yellow subsurface may contain some component which has more than one boundary curve. We have seen some cylinders and you can come up with more complicated examples. So that's why we want to consider surfaces with more boundaries. And yeah, if we start with a mapping class in gamma G1, then W is going to be connected because it has to touch the boundary. Because it has to touch the boundary, and any set Y can be disconnected. That's what I already remarked. So now we go into the first technical result of the paper. So fix a mapping class phi, decompose the surface along the Along the cat locus and also fix parameterizations of the curves on the cat locus. I will get rid later of this choice of parameterizations. Now you can represent phi by a diffeomorphism fixing w point twice and define the restricted mapping class phi y on the as a mapping class of the yellow surface. Now, Now, I mean, we have to take into account the fact that a commuting mapping class can swap some of these components. So we introduce this extended mapping class group, gamma y. And this is the mapping class group of isotopic glasses of diffeomorphism that possibly permute the boundary components of the yellow surface and even permute the components of the yellow surface. But most importantly, whenever you map a curve to another curve, you have to do it. To another curve, you have to do it in a parameterization-compatible way. This is how gamma y is defined. And similarly, this gamma shw will be the group of mapping class group of the few morphies that fix this boundary and possibly permute uh act on the on the yellow part, uh, possibly permute its other yellow boundary components, but if they do it, then they must do it in a Do it, then they must do it in a parameterization-compatible way. And the fact that we insist that parametrizations are respected because then we can define a gluing map as follows, if we have two diffeomorphisms of W and of Y, and they act in the same way on connected components of, I mean, on the set of connected components of this yellow multi-curve. This means that this product is. This means that this product is a fiber product over the symmetric group SH, then we can glue actually these two mapping classes and get a mapping class in gamma G1. And if in the first, sorry, in the second factor, we choose a mapping class in gamma y that actually commutes with phiy, then the glued mapping class will be a mapping class commuting with phi. And there is this probability. And there is this proposition that says that actually this gluing map is surjective, and its kernel is given by Freibelian groups at H, generated by these elements. The idea is that if you take one of the yellow curves, for example, this one, you can push it in the yellow surface or in the white surface. And the two and twists that you get are different elements in this fiber product, but they clearly become the same element. Product, but they clearly become the same element here. But that's all of the kernel. So we get this short text-like sequence. Remember, we are interested in understanding this group. We can understand pretty well this group, of course. Here we have something that looks like a mapping close group of a surface, so we are happy about this. This is fiber product over a finite group. Fine. We still have to understand this centralizer. So basically, we reduce the So basically, we reduce the understanding of this centralizer to the understanding of this centralizer. And what we've gained is that now phi y is boundary irreducible. We still have to take into account the fact that different components of y can be permuted. However, when can we permute different components of the yellow part? Well, first of all, they have to be diffeomorphic. So, for example, here we can only permute We can only permute this cylinder with another cylinder, but also the mapping class, the restrictive mapping class here should be similar. For example, if here I have a den twist and here I have a square of a den twist, I will not be able to swap these two parts. So we get to a notion of similarity between yellow components. Yellow components, and if we partition y according to this equivalence class of similarity, then we can also factor this centralizer as a product of smaller groups. And in this product, we see some semi-direct product over some symmetric groups. And the important thing is that again, we have a centralizer of a mapping class, but this time. Of a mapping class, but this time is a mapping class of a mapping class group of a connected surface, and it's a boundary irreducible one. So we have reduced to this sort of basic or atomic type of centralizers. Putting everything together, we obtain this formula. There is also another little issue to take care of, namely, here we take a fiber problem. Of namely, here we take a fabulous product over the entire symmetric group SH, but actually, the joint image of these two group homomorphism is a smaller subgroup, and you can compute what it is and express it again as a product of semi-direct products. I don't want to discuss all details. I also don't have actually time to do it. So let me just say that there is such a short exercise. There is such a shortx sequence of groups, it's a central extension actually, and we are interested in this group. And we can now take classifying spaces of everything. On the right-hand side, we get the classifying space of this group, which is one of the components of this free loop space. And on the left-hand side, after converting this Z to the H in a quotient by a Torus action, and this fiber product over H also. And this fiber product over H also gives rise to this balancing by H here. And similarly, here we pass to the replace this group by the finite index of group of mapping classes that actually fix the boundary of W point twice. And here we also get rid of these factors by putting them here essentially and close. Essentially, and taking classifying space of these centralizers, that's what we get. That's the homotopy type of one of the components here is expressed in this form. What form is it? It's a product of some moduli space, some classifier space of a mapping class group. And then there are classifiers of centralizers. And you should think of. Of centralizers. You should think of these as being the atomic building blocks, and this to be as a space of operations to put together the building blocks. And there is some balancing in combining the two. And the balancing also has two parts. One part is a symmetric group, which you can think of permuting the inputs of an operatic operation. Operation. And there is another piece of balancing which maybe was unexpected. This is some Lie group acting on these generators. And this tells us that we better go to operates to now start studying the problem of operates. So let me make a quick introduction to operates. To operates, colored operates. So if n will be a set of colors, it's just a set, but later our favorite set will be positive integers. That is the possible numbers of boundary components that a surface with boundary may have. And an uncolored operator is a collection of spaces of operations. Basis of operations. Whenever you choose a non-negative integer R and a list of R input colors and one output color, you get such a space O K1 up to Kr N. And yeah, we say that K1 of 2KR are the input colors and N is the output color. And composition is defined in a similar way as for normal operators, but only it's Normal operators, but only it's only defined when there is compatibility between the colors. That is, if you want to compose an operation with input colors k1 up to kr and output n with some other operations, then this other operation must have outputs, exactly the colors that then are inputs of this operation. And the result would be an operation with input, the list of the concatenation of the lists of colors. Concatenation of the lists of colors and output the colour n. What is an O algebra? An O algebra is not just one space, but it's a sequence of space, one for every color. And what are the structure maps? Again, if you have an operation with some input colors and some color, and if we pick points of the correct colors, we can combine them together. Colors, we can combine them together and get a point of the output color. So in the space Xn, if the output color is n. And there is this observation, if you have an operate, an n-colored operate, and if it contains a sub-operate O prime, then you can restrict the action. And so every time you have an And so, every time you have an O algebra, you can restrict the action, you get an O prime algebra. So, there is a forgetful functor from O algebras to O prime algebras, and this functor admits a left adjoint, which is denoted as written here. If you have a O prime algebra X, you can freely complete it to an O algebra, and we will need this. And we will need this notion in a second. Well, now it's time to introduce a colored version of the surface operator. So it's going to be colored by positive integers. And if you restrict this colored operator to the color one, so you only consider operations all of whose input and output colors are one, then you recall. One, then you recover precisely the in-man surface operate. For generic colors, the space of operation is the modulus space of compact Riemann surfaces W, which have the following additional structures. So the boundary of W is partitioned into two parts called inner and outer boundary. Outer boundary, and we require that each component of W touches the outgoing boundary. Moreover, the outgoing boundary has if the operation has to have output colour n, which is a natural number, then the outer boundary has to have exactly n components and we require w to be equipped with parameterization. So the film of So diffimorphism to 1 up to n times this one. And similarly, the incoming boundaries of W is partitioned into some clusters of components, one for every input of our operation, and each cluster a size equal to the color of that operation. And everything is parameterized once again. In this picture, for example, you see an operation with output. For example, you see an operation with output color 4 and with three inputs of colors 2, 2, and 1. Now, what is the sub-operate that we want to consider? Well, it's actually a pretty simple form of sub-operate, namely as an end sequence of groups. If you this sub-operate arises purely as Purely as a sub-operate of monary operations, so operations with one input and one output. And for color n, the group Rn is going to be this twisted torus, is the semi-direct product of nine-dimensional torus with the symmetric group Sn and we can see this as a subgroup of M. Of M and N, so monary operations from color n to color n by considering cylinders, those Riemanns moduli of those Riemann surfaces that are actually a disjoint union of cylinders. And you get to choose how to pair the labels below with the labels above. And this is a permutation here. You also get to choose how to rotate the parametrization. The parameterization below relative to the parameterizations above. And this accounts for these tn coordinates. I mean, as I said in the previous slides, every time you have an M algebra, you can restrict to an R algebra, and vice versa, if you have an R algebra, you can freely complete it to an M algebra. And the upshot of the Of the discussion done before with studying carefully the centralizers of mapping classes is contained in this slide. We can combine those complicated descriptions of the stabilizers into a more concise statement. So we need a couple of We need a couple of definitions. So, for every again, this Rn denotes the twisted torus and it acts on each of these moduli spaces mgn. How does it act? It just acts by changing the parameterization of the boundary. In particular, Sn will act by relabeling the boundary components of a Riemann surface and Tn And Tn will act by rotating the parameterizations of the boundary components. So, well, if Rn acts again, if Rn acts on Mgn, it will act also lambda wise on every free loop space. And here there is another couple of observations that Mgn can be considered as g n can be considered as zeroary parts of the zeroary operations and are n parts of the monary operations and you can think of this action of the action here just as given again by the opera just by composition of an operation of this type with an operation of this type with output an operation of this type recall again that the free loop space of mgn is a this Mgn is a disjoint union over conjugacy classes in the mapping class group of some components which are classified species of stabilizers, sorry, of centralizers. And now we give this definition. This is, yeah, I think this is the most important definition to introduce finally this promised space X from the Space X from the second slide. So for every G and every N, we consider inside the free loop space lambda Mgn those components lambda Mgn phi corresponding to boundary reducible mapping classes because these are the ones that are relevant as building blocks in the In the discussion we made before. Let me also note that if you have a mapping class and you act by an element of, I mean, RN acts on this space and this is an invariant subspace. Roughly speaking, if a mapping class is boundary reducible, it will not stop being it just because you relabel the Because you reliable the boundary components, or because you change their parameterization. So we can take also the disjunction over G and define this space factor CN. And yeah, I mean, this is a sequence of spaces, one for every natural number, and each of them is an action of the group Rn. So it's an R algebra, just a sequence of spaces with actions of the corresponding groups. The corresponding groups. But now the translation in this language of what we have said before is just that lambda m star one is inside the free completion of this R algebra to an M algebra is the part of color one. So this completion is again a colored algebra and you just select the part of The part of colour one. This is a concise statement. And once we have this concise statement, we are in a good shape to solve our problem. Well, almost we need a version of the theorem of Pasteura, Popkova, Ponto, Tillman and Jeekel, which can be applied to this setting, which is slightly different. Which is slightly different. So that's the last thing that we do in our work. We develop a good enough version of their theorem which works in our setting. So first of all, there is a notion of colored operate with tomological stability. And it's and in our setting, we consider And in our setting, we consider an operate with colored opera with tomological stability containing a sub-operate, which is of the form for every color, a group, a topological group. And it's a sub-operative purely of monary operations. And if x is a g algebra, that is a sequence of species with g n action. And And if we fix a color in our set of colors, then we can consider the n-color part of the free completion of the G-algebra X to an ON algebra, to an O-algebra as a topological monoid. In doing that, I should say that again, in the definition of encolored operate with homological stability, we assume that That the operate, I mean, there is an inclusion of the opera D2 inside it. So for every color, in particular, for every color, there is an inclusion of the opera D2 in the part of the opera that only looks at that color. And in particular, we can talk of the group completion of this object. Of this object, and I forgot to say it, but the colored version of the surface operate is an example of an uncolored operate with tomological stability. So later we will be able to apply the following proposition, namely there is an equivalence of loop spaces between the group completion of the part of color n of the free completion to an OR. Free completion to an all algebra of the G algebra X with a product of two things. One thing is the group completion of the zero re-operation with output colour n. And the other thing is a free infinite loose space generated by the homotopy quotients of the spaces xk by their corresponding acting group GK. Once we have this proposition, we can apply it to our setting, and we just have to put everything together. Recall that this Cn is the nth space in our sequence, and it's a dissonant tune over different genera of all components of free roto spaces corresponding to boundary reducible mapping classes. Boundary reducible mapping classes, and yeah, the combination of all I've said so far is that the group completion of lambda m star one is the product of the group completion of m no input one and the infinite loose space generated by this fancy disjoint union of homotopy. The disjoint union of homotopy quotients, which I will denote by x. And yes, I mean, the first factor is also the just the completion of the topological mono considered by Madison and Weiss. So it's just omega infinity mt sut. So thank you very much for your attention. All right. Are there any questions for Andrea? So let's do this again this way. Are there any questions here in Oaxaca? I do have a question. These homotopy orbit spaces, CN modulo RN, those are still classifying spaces of. Still classifying spaces of groups, right? There's like some semi-direct product of the centralizer of phi with this twisted torus group. Yeah, that's true. You can actually, I mean, if you remember, this, where does this RN come? RN has two components, let's say two factors. One is a symmetric group and the other is a torus. The torus comes from the fact that some slides ago, fact that some slides ago there was this central extension by yeah uh by this um by this three abelian group right and uh the symmetric group instead comes from the possibility of permuting this yellow component so the the the answer to your question uh what is cn what is cn remember that cn is a disjoint union of Cn is a disjoint union of several components, but each of them is also a classifier space of a group, namely the stabilizer of some map in class φ. Now, quotienting by the turbulent groups at H means we pass from the mapping class group components, but each of them is also classified in space of a group, namely the stabilizer of mapping class. Wait, what is happening? I don't know. I I don't know. I I think someone's mic is on. Yeah, is it maybe Andy's? Yeah. Andy, Andy, did you have your microphone on? Maybe I did. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. So yeah, we were hearing Andrea coming from your computer with the delay. Coming from your computer with a delay, right? Okay, let's start again. Yeah, so remember that this is supposed to be the classifying space of a subgroup of the mapping class group, namely a sum centralizer. Now, since we consider mapping class groups of surfaces with boundary and we require our diffeomorphism to fix pointwise the boundary, we have this subgroup of boundary and twists. This subgroup of boundaries and twists, and I mean, boundaries and twists are always in commute with every other mapping class. So, this, what we are doing is basically passing to the mapping class group of a punctured surface. We fill in the... For people from algebraic geometry, we are replacing points with a tangential direction with just points. Direction which just points in taking this quotient. And the symmetric group also goes away in that we allow permuting the punctures. So yeah, and then inside this punctured mapping class group, which now is a mapping class group of a closed surface with punctures, so there are no boundary components left, we take the centralizer of what Of whatever the mapping classifiers become. Yeah, that's what it is. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Are there any other questions for Andrea? Any questions from the Zoom audience? So could I ask a question? You must have said it, but I've forgotten. Said it, but uh I've forgotten now. You have this sequence of groups G N and they form a sub operate of one array operations. Does that mean basically they are a subgroup of S1 and they have to act through that S1 action that you normally see in the sorry, I'm thinking about the surface opera. Yes, if you're thinking about the surface opera, then the answer to your question is definitely yes. Is definitely yes. I discussed this very quickly in this slide. So an element of Rn can be thought of as an isometry of the disjoint union of n circles, an orientation-preserving isometry of the one-manifold, which is a disjoint union of n circles. And I mean, this semidire product decomposition accounts for how you act on pi naught. For how you act on pi naught and how you act on each circle by rotation. And yes, this picture with cylinders is essentially telling you that this also can be considered as a subgroup of the one-ary operation. If you want to be very, very, very, very, very, very, very If one wants to be pedantic, one should say, well, actually, this doesn't form a group, but they form a sub E1 algebra, which is group-like. But I've tried to hide this piece of sloppiness. Yeah, no, it's fine. Thanks. Can I ask about? Can I ask about sort of a bigger picture here? I mean, if you think of a free loop of Riemann surfaces, it might sort of be thought of as a three-manifold somehow. If you think of the three-manifolds, a little. So it tells us something which has to do with free money for definitely. So that's a good point. That's a good point. So, a free loop in Mg1 gives rise to a surface bundle over the circle, which is a particular, stota space is a particular type of three manifold, but I would say it's a very specific one. And I mean, most three manifolds don't admit of fibring over. Fibbering over S1 and not only this, but also we are remembering the map towards S1. So we are remembering how these three manifolds. So I would hope that there is an application to study of three manifolds, but we haven't found. We haven't found one yet. This is, of course, it's an interesting and perspective worth being investigated. Thanks. Yeah, maybe let me ask one more thing. This theorem. This theorem that says that the group completion of the relatively free algebra has this factor that's a free infinite loop space. Do you think there's any hope of generalizing that to other suboparads that are not just unary operations? Yes, I mean, we have been a little, how do you say? As you say, we wanted to reach the result, so we have proved this theorem in this setting. But yeah, I mean, in principle, one can try to push the... I mean, our argument is a variation of the original argument by PBPTY. The why and uh and yeah, I don't see any reason why this cannot be pushed even farther. I wouldn't, but I would prefer not to make a statement of what could be next problem. Okay, that my next question was: if you had a guess for what would take the place of that space X, which is the disjoint union of these homotopy orbits? Topiolovitz. But if you don't want to say anything, that's fine. I mean, one. Yeah, I would. Maybe I prefer not to see something. I mean, you can think that these are the the the this this homotopy I will think of something containing the words derived in the composables of the small operat. You can see the small operators, I mean, they're derived in the composables should be interpreted as whatever can be obtained by combining two or more inputs into an output should be just. To an output should be just quotiented by, right? And on one array operations, you should take commodity quotient. Maybe, maybe, I mean, this is some notion that I think derived in the composer, which has been used. And maybe this is the thing that is relevant also here. However, maybe what one gets Maybe, maybe one what one gets first of all. I'm not sure that the final result will be just of the form three infinite space. Okay, I would be more on the safe side and bet that there is some spectrum of which you have to take the infinite space. And this spectrum emits some filtration, and the associated gradient of this filtration has something to do with the derived in the composite. Something to do with the derived indices. But this is the yeah, this is just what I don't know. This is my opinion. I don't have strong arguments in the moment to support. So I'm just wondering whether, I mean, whether one should expect a very general theorem along A very general theorem along those lines because I mean the first factor would have to change if the sort of the G would not just be one of the operations. I'm not quite sure. Is that what you were hoping to replace and replace G by some sort of opera that's a little more Of operate that's a little more complicated and not just consisting of one array operation? Yeah, I think that was the question. Yeah, yes, that was the question. Yeah, I think that would be would have to change the first factor, right? I mean, even this one, you mean? Yeah, I mean, why should that be just saying the stun, you know, all of O. I mean, this reminds me of just a general sort of. Just a general sort of splitting there, I might call it, where you have the mapping class group and you have punctures, and basically the punctures or the circles that you might have, that's what you're splitting off, right? So the mapping class group with surfaces, or even in higher dimension, Lucy has proved an analog where you can split off in some sense the circles. Split off in some sense, the circles or the points that you consider of some mapping class group off. And then you get just the mapping class group itself and then cross whatever you have effectively left from the points or the circles. And if you have a point, then you have to consider the S1 action, which is basically your G acting through the one-away operations, right? And or if you just have circles, then you just get some full action, and so you just get a symmetric group. So that's somehow how I would think of this. And I would have felt that if you act, you know, you have to model more than just the one-away action, then you probably do something more drastic to the first factor. And I don't know what the second factor. So I don't know what the second one is. I mean, you could try an example, right? And what would happen, but maybe that's too simple, but maybe that certainly should show you it couldn't be generally true. But if you take, for example, the mapping class group of an unoriented An unoriented surface is somewhat I mean let me think let me think just trying to build an operator suboparat and then the suboparat of oriented surfaces I think you probably get something rather more complicated. I guess also taking the extreme case of the sub-opera G being all of O points out that there are some limitations. Well, but in that case, I mean yeah in some sense, yes, but in that case, wouldn't this just be X? That would be X. And then we put We would basically be saying that the group completion of X is an infinite loop space, and this is actually, well, probably something that we didn't try to prove this for a general X algebra, that is group completion at colour n is an infinite space, but monochromatically, this is also one of the results, and probably it is also in the Probably it is also in the colored case. But it doesn't have the first factor, does it? And then we would be saying that one of the factors is, yes, is the initial. And now, yes, now you see that, right, there is a map from the initial, I mean, the initial O algebra maps to any O algebra, but I don't see a reason why there should be a retraction. I mean, a map. Should be a retraction. I mean, I'm map the other way, a map in the other direction in general. So, so, yeah. So, so this, yeah. So, so, so, so, in this example, I would agree with that a general statement should be, I mean, one shouldn't expect it really. Maybe, I mean, more general than what we prove, yes, but completely general, probably not. And I don't know what should be the level of intermediate generality to guess. Okay. Well, I guess let's thank Andrea for his talk again. Okay, thank you again for your attention.
