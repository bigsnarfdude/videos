To parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification, but not being as bold as she has been. And I'm trying to do something much simpler. So we'll see what you think of it. So yesterday we talked about a longitudinal model for OGTT patterns. I gotta say you were out for a second. Okay, keep going. But how can we decide which group a patient belongs to? So I showed that if you look, say, at the one-hour versus two-hour glucose, you might get some clue, but we want something more comprehensive than that. Comprehensive than that. So we will explore whether the longitudinal model that I used yesterday can be adapted to estimate insulin resistance and beta cell function. And there are a lot of other models that can do this. Cecilia talked about one of them. But let's give this one a whirl. So our goals are to find something that uses OGTT data and could be and we've And could be, and we've been using relatively short OGTTs: five points, two hours, not 11 points and three hours. It's also simpler and less invasive than the CLAMP or frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests, which could have more than 20 samples. Easier to implement than the Cobelli oral minimal models, and more complex than existing algebraic indices that are in wide use like the Matza. Indices that are in wide use, like the Matzoda index and HOMA, but with better properties. So here's our equations. And for fitting, so yesterday in the model I talked about, we had SI, insulin sensitivity, beta, beta cell mass, sigma, beta cell function, and gamma, another component of beta cell function, were all dynamic variables. But on the time scale of an OGTT, But on the time scale of an OGTT, they don't change. So we fix them. And we fix them at the same values for all subjects, which could be too extreme, but let's see how that goes. The model looks very simple, but there's some hidden extra complexity that may help us, that this R0 term is the glucose influx. And it's both what you ingest and also what comes from the liver. And the liver component. Liver and the liver component is dependent on insulin and the insulin sensitivity, which is not found in the Cobelli model. So, maybe that gives us a little bit of an advantage. Also, the rated insulin secretion model is derived from a model from exocytosis that can do first and second phase insulin secretion. And finally, I want to point out that there are many parameters. There are dozens of parameters in this model, and we're going to be very Model and we're going to be very modest and just fit two of them and set the others to that hyper, they're basically hyperparameters, but we're just kind of setting them to numbers that have worked for us in longitudinal simulations. So the first set of data I'm going to talk about is the Federal Women's Study, data provided by Stephanie Chung and Ann Sumner, NIDDK, consists of 113 women, mixed black and white. BMI ranges from BMI ranges from 20 to 45, mostly overweight or mildly obese, and middle-aged. Mostly normal glucose tolerance, a few with pre-diabetes. No people with diabetes were allowed to participate. So these are the mean fits to the glucose and the insulin. The date is in red. The model is in blue, and doesn't look too bad. Here are the error historical. Here are the error histograms. This is the weighted residual sum of squares. And one thing you can notice is that the error distribution is not anywhere near Gaussian. It looks like log normal or exponential. So we have a lot of people whose errors are modest and a few that are poorly fit. And if we look at the, these numbers may not be very meaningful, but if we look at the r squareds, 96%. Squareds 96% have an R squared greater than 0.9. So that's pretty good. We compared, one reason we chose this data set is that there was estimation of SI using the Bergman-Minnel model from FSIGT. So we want to see how we compare to that. So here is SI from our model versus SI from MinMod. The red The red is the regression line, and the dashed is the line of equality. So it looks like we're doing pretty well, and we can make that more formal by doing a bland Altman diagram looking at the difference between the two models plotted against the mean. And we find that the points fit within this confidence interval, 95% confidence intervals, and there's no systematic deviation. And there's no systematic deviation as shown by the regression line as you vary the size of SI. So we have good correlation and agreement. The correlation correlation is about 0.7. We also looked at the Mazet index, which is defined as 10,000 divided by the square root of the product of fasting insulin, fasting glucose, mean insulin, and mean glucose during an OGTT. So if either you're OGTT. So if either your insulin is high or your glucose is high fasting or during the test, then that means you have low insulin sensitivity. So we compared Matsuda to MinMod, and we see that the correlation is good, R is 0.75, but there's a systematic underestimation. And we can see that again with the Vland-Altman plot with a significant Sharply sloped regression line for delta versus the average. So MinMod's correlation with MinMod is similar to what we got. We call RSI MSI, but the agreement with MinMod is much poorer. Systematic, sorry, I said underestimation, it's systematic overestimation. And it's maybe not so surprising that we do better because our equation for glucose is derived from the minimal model, but we've also made The minimal model, but we've also made a lot of changes. And there's also a measure of secretion that you can get from the FSIGT called AIR or the acute insulin response. You just see how much insulin is secreted in the first 10 minutes in response to a 75-gram injected bolus of glucose. And here is our beta cell function parameter, sigma, versus AIR. And R squared is 0.45. R squared is 0.45, so r is about 0.6 something. So the correlation is good, but the scales are very different: one versus a thousand. So we couldn't do a Gland Altman plot for this. Okay, we also wanted to get an estimate of confidence intervals to get an idea of how precisely we measure the parameters. So we did this by bootstrapping. And the bootstrap was based on the residuals. The residuals, the difference between the fit and the actual data, but the weighted residuals. And so here are the histograms from 250 bootstrap repetitions for SI and sigma. And you can see that we're pretty tightly constrained between 0.13 and 0.155. The red line is plus or minus one standard deviation. So we can think of that as a coefficient of variation. Coefficient of variation. Here's similar numbers for sigma, also pretty nicely constrained. And here are the points plotted in the sigma SI plane going from zero to one in both dimensions. And you see the cloud of points is nicely constrained. If you look at a box plot of the coefficients of variation, we did it both parametrically and non-parametrically using the interquartile ratio divided by two. By two, we found that only six percent were greater than 0.2 or 20 percent, and 4 percent greater than 0.2. So, most people are very precisely estimated, and then there's a small number of outliers. And here it is zoomed in. So, mean, you know, mean or median is about three or four percent, which seems good to me. Um, not everybody looks so great. There's four different subjects, and you can see that some. Different subjects, and you can see that some have more spread than others, and some show a degree of correlation. And if you do a box plot of the correlation coefficients, they're all over the map and not near zero. So we have correlation, which means non-identifiability, but I want to make the case that it doesn't really matter if these clouds are tight, then you don't care if maybe some of sigma is getting thrown into SI or vice versa. Is getting thrown into SI or vice versa. Okay, we also looked at another very different data set from University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, data provided by Silva Arcelanian and Jun Young Kim. This is a group of 130 adolescents who are obese, BMI above 80 percentile, mixed African American and white, mixed boys and girls. And a mixture of normal glucose tolerance impair and type 2 diabetes. They had two-hour OGTT so we could apply our model, but they also had hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamps that measured insulin sensitivity. That's considered the gold standard. And hyperglycemic clamps to measure first and second phase insulin secretion. So we can compare to that as well. Here are going to the mean data fits, not as good as the Is the better women's study, but not too bad. Here are the histograms of the errors against skewed. We have 79% with an R squared greater than 0.9. Here's our agreement and correlation with the clamp. The correlation is pretty good. R is 0.66, but there's a systematic deviation, and our SI is systematically smaller. Systematically smaller than the CLAMP CSI or CLAMP SI. And there's also a systematic, there's an increase in scatter as you move to higher values of insulin sensitivity, which we don't understand. But that's what it is. We also looked at Mozuda versus the CLAMP SI, and it looks very similar. It also systematically underestimates. It also systematically underestimates the clamp SI. Here is a measure versus the beta cell function from the hyperglycemic clamp. Here is first phase, R is 0.7. Second phase, R is 0.64. I didn't Google because the scales are so different, but you can see, again, there's some increase in scatter as you move to the right, which I'm not too happy about, but maybe we can live with that. That and other comparisons from the literature. So here is the oral minimal model: SI versus SI from the CLAP. R is 0.81. Our R was 0.66. And both have a systematic underestimation. They don't have the 1-1 line here, but you can see from looking at the graph. So, you know, we're not quite as good as them, but our model is simpler. Is simpler and otherwise kind of similar. Here is their phi dynamic, which is supposed to represent first phase insulin secretion from the clamp. This is from a meal test, not an OGTT, and there's no correlation whatsoever, whereas we had a pretty good correlation. And then here is the phi static, which is their second phase measure from the clamp, again from a mixed meal test. From a mixed meal test, R is about 0.68. This is a rescaled version to put them on the same scale. R is 0.62, Rs is 0.64. So comparable, but again, we have this increasing spread as you move to the right. Okay, conclusions. We have a model that is simpler to implement than CLAMP or FSIGT, needs less data. It's not much more complex than algebraic measures like HOMA, MASA. Measures like HOMA, MASA, and IGI. It's very fast. We can fit one person per second, so we can fit these entire data sets in a few minutes. It agrees well with MinMot SI and AIR, better than Matsuda. Agreement with CLAMP is not as good, but perhaps it's acceptable and it's similar to Matsuda. Correlation with first phase beta cell function, much better than OMM. Correlation with OMM correlation with second phase similar to OMM and the precision is good. Most people were simulated with a precision of less than 5%. The correlation is poor, meaning non-zero, but that may not matter because the bounds are tight. And I also want to say that our model is much simpler to implement than the OMM. If you want to do a beta cell function with their model, you have to do deconvolution, and they're very Revolution, and there are very few people in the world who can do this effectively. So we're proposing this as something that anybody can do. It's kind of goof-proof. Okay, so I'll stop here. I'm very interested to hear your reactions. And I can't see any of you, so I'll just have to go by sound. All right, one thing I was wondering, so I think this is wonderful. And have you so? And I assume you're working on publishing this. Yes. So, one piece that may be useful and would be good for the community, especially because this is this kind of analysis is in some sense the kind of analysis that everyone should do whenever they have a model. Is that you could release a data set and, in some sense, a set of metrics. In some sense, a set of metrics for standard model evaluation. Is that possible? You mean other people could try their models on the same data set? Yeah, effectively, you would put this data set on like physiodet, along with a set of suggested set of evaluation metrics. Evaluation metrics. Yeah, because I don't own the data. But for example, could you convince the people who own the data to give up the data or some subset of the data in an effort to help with model validation for not just you, but other folks who might build models like this? Or do you know what I'm saying? Yes. Do you know what I'm saying? Yes, we can probably do this. And it's a good idea because we would like to compare how we do head-on with other methods on the same data sets. You know, and I don't want to go and use and myself do everyone else's model on these data sets. So yeah, we can spread the work around. I mean, in some sense. They're using their own models and then I would be. Like, in some sense, you can publish that data set as here's a sort of a baseline data. Here's a sort of a baseline data set plus a set of markers for evaluating models, and then that would be a guidance for people in the future building models as the sort of gold standard for how we assess whether our models function or not. Yeah, sounds like a good idea. Awesome. I would love it. It's interesting though, because it's nice to look at these other measures, but presumably they're But presumably, there is more information that you could be getting out of yours. So it's like having a not perfect correlation with Matsura is probably okay. Like you want to have a correlation with it, but. Yeah, I mean, if you want to beat it, you probably don't want to be perfectly correlated. Like you don't want to match the thing that you can also get in other ways. Right. So you know. So perfect correlation, I don't think is what you want. Don't think is what you want exactly. I think you don't want it. And people could go beyond this. Like you could do, you know, there's MCMC methods that would give you UQ that would be. So there's a bunch of, but I think as a baseline set of here's sort of, if you want to compare, you want to publish a model, go to this data set and show what you're, what you look like. Not you, the model. But, you know, don't be found people that put models. We're not saying that this is the be all and end all. We're saying this. Is the be all and end all? We're saying this is something pretty easy and it's good enough. Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's a baseline, it's the baseline. You can go beyond it if you want, but this is a starting point. Everybody should do this. Could you say a little more about the correlation, Artie? Because didn't you say it was a correlation between sigma and SI? Yes. Yes, so you know, Cobelli claims no correlation because they use two different models, whereas we're getting no. Different models, whereas we're getting the same model, it's not that surprising that we're going to get some correlation. But as long as the bounds are tight, then that's what you really care about. Right. But there, isn't the sigma related to the secretion? Yeah, I mean, yeah, one's wet, one's mess. One's secretion and one is. Wit, one's mature secretion, and one is insulin resistance. Yeah, yeah, but so okay, but so correlation: are you just saying correlation is okay as long as it's small because the range of like SIs that you're looking at is still informative about whether maybe the individual's primary dysfunction is in insulin secretion or insulin resistance. Right. I think we're close enough that we won't make. I think we're close enough that we won't make that mistake. We'll be able to say your problem is insulin resistance and not secretion. Okay, got it. The reason why it won't be a few percent, who cares? And the reason why Forbelli's argument doesn't make any sense is you estimated two independent models. It's the same observable. So they're mixing it either way. So it's a, you know, I don't know, a scientific. Don't know a scientific is a conceptual scientific flaw to think that they're actually independent. They're not, it's like high school algebra style, you have a certain number of unknowns and a certain one data. Can you get thicker about this? It looks the other way, actually, because Art's using the same model and the same data and pulling out two different features within the cluster, they're almost not identifiable. Non-identifiable, and so there's a there's a correlation between yeah, they're in fact exactly not identifiable, but they're not, they're not if you have insulin, they're maybe identifiable, but if you have no insulin, yeah, exactly. But that's why that's why the correlation, that's why the slowness is different within different clusters because the way that non-economic viability Falls out in different regions with different clusters, it's just different. Yeah, it's exactly, but meaningless. Each cluster is one person, right? Yeah. But I think what, yeah, what Bruce is saying is the correlation doesn't matter because it's effectively an arbitrary artifact of the non-identifiable leaf. But is what you're saying. But what you're saying is that it does that non-identifiability doesn't matter because it's tight enough anyway. And all you're trying to look is for differentiation. Right. Which is enough. Excellent. We are at break now. If somebody wants to meet with Art and talk to him, they can use my computer. We're breaking now. So you can talk to each other and art. So, you can talk to each other and argue with each other, of course, in the normal way. I do have one question. We're talking about going for a hike this afternoon. There are a couple of options. One is to get on a public transportation bus that I don't know how to use yet and go to Lake Louise and walk around the lake maybe if it's open, but probably okay. Yarno knows how to do it. Okay, Yana knows how to do it. The other option is to hike up Sulphur Mountain. The weird, the not super enticing sounding hike. It's, you know, hiking up Sulphur Mountain. You picture like you're Gary and Anna going up a yellow mountain, but apparently it's nice. Well, I got up a tunnel yesterday, so Sulphur Mountain has snow at the top, just so everyone knows the trail is like snow. Trail is like snow, so but it seems like it would be like I say snow, like this, yeah, not deep snow, but definitely some which I think ends up micro microscope, which I think ends up at the gondola, or you can take the gondola because I don't remember when it scared me up the trail and sounds like exactly. So it does end at the gondola, or you can take the gondola down, or you can take the gondola up and down, or at any rate, we can talk about it a bit more. I just wanted to lay that out there. That's something big. Wanted to lay that out there, that's something to think about as far as what you might like. So that's uh seven miles out and back, it is, but it could be.
