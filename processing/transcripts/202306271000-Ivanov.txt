Announcements, and now if you got Ivanov for speaker, but what is the topic of my talk, Martin? What is the topic of my talk? Okay, great policy of nothing else. Yeah, so I guess the topic was something like course approximations for or of polytopes, say for polytopes. And I think that I have no clue what or does course mean. What does the course mean here? Let me start with more standard things like sparse approximations of something of polytopes. Like you quite often we consider the problem, we are given a convex set, we want to approximate it by a polytope, or we have a polytope and we want to approximate it by another polytope with some properties, with a few facets, with a few vertices. Few vertices or something like this. So, but I will give one example, one peculiar example that for this I need to define probably my most favorite object. So we have a convex body, and then we know that there is a unique ellipsoid of maximum volume, which is called John. Which is called John ellipsoid that is contained in your convex body, John ellipsoid. And then John Fried John, he showed the following. So it's a fine invariant construction. I can shift the picture, I can apply linear transformation, and the volume changes proportionally. Change proportionally, so I can put everything in a good position. For example, if I have a body that contains a unit ball, and then I want to say that the unit ball is the John ball. So then we have so what did he prove? What did he prove? Okay, he proved it in one direction, another direction was added by a heat ball. He proved that if B is the zone, ellipsoid. Okay, then a certain algebraic condition holds. So then there are There are numbers, T1, positive numbers, slash weights, and some unit vectors from the intersection of the surfaces, such that some algebraic condition falls and general image. And in general, you need to add that the sum is zero. Some equation. And then people, so I like this object because it's kind of the holy trinity, it's intersection of geometry, algebra, and analysis. So, and quite often the results is K required to be significant. No, no, no, no, I added here in the it doesn't matter for my talk. I just doesn't matter for for my talk i just yes no so with with this equation you don't need this condition and so and one of the equation is if i want to simplify my polytope yeah so we have kind of the section of half planes defined like this p such that there are That supports your ball and your body automatically as a polytope. And then you want to throw away as many these half spaces in such a way that you have another polytope, let's say with linear number in dimension of facets and such that it's geon ellipsoid, not the unit ball, but almost. Not the unit ball, but almost unit ball, like within some epsilon error, whatever this means in some metric. And it's, if you think about this, it's completely counter-intuitive. You can do this. It was proven recently. It was a huge breakthrough in a coding theory and quantum mechanics, but somehow, so the proof comes from algebra, I would say. say you can do this that you you can you can choose a linear for any epsilon you can choose a linear number more precisely like this number where it sees the universal constant of these half spaces such that they form a polytope and it's given ellipsoid not the unit ball but epsilon close to the unit ball Epsilon close to the unit ball in some sense. So, this is parts approximation. So, I will not talk about this today. So, but I like this topic. And one day, I sat in Lausanne in my office thinking about these problems. Thinking about these problems, and Martin comes and says, Okay, this nice topic, but I have a very nice, very nice problems. You will love them. That was true. It was right. And the question is that sometimes we are interested in the simplest case, in some sense. That I want to have the minimal number of. minimal number of of the minimal possible number of half spaces such that the intersection is bounded. Let's start with this one. So I give you an example. I have a polytop okay it's polygon because I cannot draw pictures in 3D and then I'm starting to throw away some of its Throw away some of its facets. That's what is going on here. And then I want to have this one, I throw it away, then I throw away that one. I have another polytop. So my question is what the minimal number of remaining facets. Remaining facets that I need, it's sufficient to have a bounded polytope after all. What would be your guess, Andrik? That was my guess. That's wrong. So yeah, that's yeah. Yeah, exactly. 2D. 2D is the nice example is a cube. Yeah, okay. Square. If you throw away any faces of it, yeah, so. Any faces of it, yeah, so your body will be unbounded. So one cannot hope for something better than 2D. But you can, then the next natural question is, if there is a constant such that I given a polytope, let's say I fix something, it's diameter. Polytop of diameter one. Let's see, yeah, and then I'm starting. And then I'm starting to throw away these facets, and I want to have a polytope with a few as possible facets, but let's say of diameter. So I threw away facets of P, which is important. Of diameter, I don't know, like, which is at most some constant depending of V. And essentially, as we will see. Essentially, as we will see, this CD is of order of magnitude, not some epsilon one or one half. It's kind of d to the sum power in the first bounds. So the answer is yes. But again, how many facets do we need? And essentially, this example shows you that if you want to have some universal constant, this is 2D again, because it just. Is 2d again because you just take a pencil of vectors that look in each phase here, and then you need a it's not hard to show that you need to choose a vector from every pair. So you can then choose d plus one, yes, such that the intersection is bounded, but there is no constant. So you need 2d. The helley number is 2d and Verse 2D and kind of spoiler, I have, I know several proof of different such lemmas results, but I don't understand why it's 2D from topological point of view. So this is what I call coarse approximation. So I'm looking for some universal content. I want to simplify the consider the Simplify, consider the most simplest case in some sense, yes, and define some bounds to show that there exists. And the first result, I think, is by Baron, Kechelsky, and Pach forty years ago. So big names. So, big names. So, and as Janus told me, Janus Park, that in that moment it wasn't clear that such constants exist in these problems. So, what did they prove? It wasn't clear that there is a constant dependent D such that you can. I will formulate the statement and then it will be clear. So, what is the statement? The statement is: let me have several convict sets, a family of convict sets, blah blah blah, A M in R D. And then we know that let's say the intersection, the intersection of K i's is of Is of some diameter like one then diameter one then it is possible to choose no no not necessarily. No, not necessarily. To choose at most 2D of them, let's say K E1, blah, blah, blah, K E2D. So at most means 2D, and such that the intersection of these guys has diameter. As diameter, which is at most some constant dependent on d and their constant was d to the d of this order of magnitude, but then you can play around so actually. Around so, actually, another version of it, and I will write this with a different color here. If I fix the volume of the intersection, and then here you compute the volume of intersection as well, and then the bound will be so there is a exist, let's say, diameter, and this here volume. And this here volume of d, and they show that this constant is something d to the d square. So as well, there is a yes, it follows. But I mean, those are separate problems, and sometimes we can say, so the diameter problem is harder. Harder. So I will explain the proof strategy because it uses John Elip. So what was the idea? And the idea was that, in the meanwhile, the proof, so now we call this quantitative Halley type result. Is a diameter quantitative Hayley, volume quantitative Haley? So we consider. Yeah, so we consider we choose the intersection model d plus one, but at most two d and then we demand that the volume change in some control or the diameter change in a controllable manner. That's the thing. And the constants, if you can see the constants, because what is the Halley theorem? This one. The Halley serum, you have a family of convex sets, then Of convex set, then all tuples. On all tuples, yeah. And here we want, no, but then, okay, it's the negation, it's easier. If there is a D plus one tuple with empty intersection, then the whole thing, the intersection of all of them, is empty. And here is the quantitative version of it. So the intersection of all is empty, then there is a The D plus one. Here you claimed if the interception is not empty but not a point but of some volume, then you choose the minimal possible number of them that you can reverse the direction. You can say that, okay, I have a set such that the intersection of for the volume of intersection of any to D of them is at most. For any to D of them is at most something, at least something there, yes. Then you say that the intersection of all of them is at least something. Yeah, that's that's hella assuming. So what was the idea? The idea was to use Caritadore type result. Okay, somehow the first magic step is like a basic reduction. We say that K1, Kn. Okay, k1 is the most convenient smooth polytop compact set, which is a half space. I just show the idea for half spaces because it's more or less the same. It's a standard routine. But what was the idea? So we have this intersection. And you see that in general, what we want to show that the ratio of the diameters is bounded or the ratio of the volumes is bounded. Or the ratio of the volumes is bounded. So, this problem is a fine invariant as well, in this sense. So, I can put the intersection in the most convenient position as in this problem. In the very beginning, about the joint ellipse. So, let's put, consider this intersection of k i's and assume that it's in the joint position. That it's in the joint position, so the unit ball is the joint ball of this guy. Then it's not convenient to actually bound the intersection of half spaces. It's a hard problem. So, and then duality camps. So, because in dual picture, so In dual picture, so what I mean by the dual, yeah. So for any set k, that's k lightly, p its polar is all functional such that p A is at most one and for all a in my p. That's a standard dual polar body. Dual polar body and what are the properties? So let's say for polytopes, that vertices, we map vertices to facets, facets to vertices, and then we reverse the inclusion. So if A is contained in B, then in the polar picture, because of these inequalities, it contains the And it contains the origin, which is important, then we have the reverse inequality because we have more inequalities in the definitions. That's why. So, and then what do we want to measure actually? So, for example, if the diameter problem, then we want to measure how deep the origin is in. Is inside our body. And then there's come the tweak. So what they showed, they showed the following version of this, not this theorem, but a quantitative, the quantitative correctadori theorem, which we now call quantitative standards because for some reason. For some reason. And so, what is the statement? The statement is as follows. Let's say we have body that contains the unit ball. Let's say Popolytop. No, no, not topolytop. So let be V one V N D the vertices, the vertexes. The vertices, the vertex of B then they claimed the proof that one can choose at most 2D there exist at most 2D vertices, blah blah blah, such that the convex hull of this V Of this V V contains the ball with the same center of some radius, depending on B as the unit ball, which is important. But the restriction, the main restriction, that one can use only the vertices. And their error, this for them, error of d was something like d to the minus d half or something like this, approximately, which is concepts. So let me draw a simple, simple picture, the idea of the proof. So not the idea of their proof, but what is going on. What is going on? Okay. What I want to say: this one so let's say we have three words what so that so the essentially this is for half That so essentially this is for half spaces, but uh it's there is a procedure how to reduce the problem for half spaces, which is more or less standard because any convex set is an intersection of half spaces. Okay, like this so we have helly word where we consider these type of things, then I would say this is caritadori word. Okay, I would call it steinitz. Okay, I would call it Steinitz work because for Todd, it's the Steinitz theorem. He improved Caritador result. He said that if a point belongs to the interior of the convex hull, that there is at most 2D vertices, because let's say Stein is four. And what this BKP did, Baron Kochelsky and Paige did, they considered this problem and Problem and they go here, they obtain this some with some tricks with radius, and then they go back because you automatically have this property kind of yeah, so that's what the problem. You know that if your body contains the journal. Body contains the journal episode that one over D times the ball contains your body. So you have, you sandwich it, and then you do this. And then, so Martin, the next thing that Martin told me was, and actually, and then conjecture that this bound is not d to the d squared, but d to the constant d. And this, and conjecture that this bound should be square root of d. Is should be square root of d, one of the square root of d. So square root of d. So they conjecture that the constant of this of order of, so this has to be polynomial bound and this is has to be linear in the exponent. And then Markton told me, okay, you know, I use your favorite object and I settled the conjecture. My day was ruined. So he uses some fancy stuff with no knowledge of geometry of this ball. And then Martin, like seven years ago, I think that he showed that actually this constant is actually no, no, no, this constant is of order magnitude. Is of order magnitude d to the constant d. Now it's a kind of first part: what is the c, and now the best one is three halves, and the conjecture is one half. So kind of the thing. And then he asked me a question about this journal eight, how we can work on this, improve that, but I didn't understand why do we use journal ellipsoid here. ellipsoid here this is this is the geometric problems that there's nothing to do with any ellipsoid we have we have a polytops uh we have uh we want we we are we have we can choose position and then uh what pops up pops up in our mind that kind of here i i cheated in a bit that i choose a center that probably if i choose a good center um then then i'm done Then I'm done. And we thought, okay, what if the body is symmetric from the very beginning? And for symmetric body, we had an argument with the best possible bound, I think. And then we realized that actually, probably we need to go in another war. Yes. So I want to be a politically correct. To be a politically correct, so you know, don't write any. So, we asked us, what if we consider a well-structured polytope from the very beginning? What does it mean well-structured? So, let's So let's have we have a polytope a set let's say V1 Vn in Rd set and such that so let's q it's the convex hull of them and we have the property the q is contained in the minus lambda q Lambda q or some positive lambda. So this is kind of the sandwiching that Baron Kachewski and Park use for the balls. But why do we interested in balls? Then, and this is kind of an upgraded version of Martin Lemma by Ambrosch and his student Almense Hernandez. His student Almense Hernandez that then one can choose at most so choose these 2D vertices such that the convex hull of them contains means it's easy to say it here lambda plus 2d minus q so i what what what is the picture i have a set i choose a few vertices yes and then with the same center i blow up it but with negative coefficient yeah and i that And that's like a homotet with a negative coefficient that covers the set. And so I have how many minutes, Martin? 15. Okay, if I will have time, I will prove this. This is 13. Okay. So this is a very simple observation, but first I show that how does Show that how does it imply this? So we have this lemma. And so assume that you have this setting, you are in the healthy world. Yeah. Then say you choose the best lambda you can get. It's another problem, how to choose the best lambda you can get. You took a point C such that point C such that I have for some for lambda I have this one then actually we are done because I can so I choose a center C so here when we go here we choose in a center center of polarity yeah and I consider in this word so I choose C and consider the polar And consider the polar with respect to the C. Then, what I have that if I have this inclusion here, then for the polar, the same inclusion holds is the same lambda because of the erased for the inequality. So, if we consider the polar, the sandwich remains, but then we can choose that most. We can choose at most 2D vertices, which is important, that corresponds to half spaces, yes, and such that we have this inclusion. So we can, for this, let's say, my Q, I can find this V V E1, V E to D, such that the convex hull contains the ball of some ball, you know, of the radius. So So, what can we do now? So, but most important, it contains the homote of the whole set. Yes? So, if you polarize it, so with the coefficient lambda plus two times d, yes, that's the homotide. I polarize it again, then my vertices goes to half spaces. The intersection of the half spaces. The intersection of the half spaces contains the homotet of the intersection of all of them with the same coefficients lambda plus 2 times t. So now the question, what is lambda? And this is kind of a standard thinking convexity. This lambda is always at most d, in dimension d. And there are plenty of points which satisfy this condition. For example, Which satisfy this condition, for example, center of the John ellipsoid or the centroid of your body. So it's a nice problem to understand why for the centroid of your body, we have B here with identity if and only if it's a simplex. And so it's kind of Grunbaum, symmetric distance, or Halle and symmetric terror. And symmetric whatever we call. So we can have this D here, and automatically we solve this. So we solve this problem with constants in the volume. We have D in the volume, we have our constant in B to the 2D or like 3/12 D, with if you optimize a bit, with the best possible and simultaneously for the Possible and simultaneously for the diameter, we have the polynomial bound, which is not trivial. So, and one year passed, and then we saw that, okay, but what is about this caritadora lemma, which is in a sense even more interesting than the Halli result because it's what we are doing in new algorithms quite often. And then we realize that we can kind of using We can kind of using these three words, we can, if we start with Steinitz problem, we can go here, then here, and then return back. And so, again, let me rest are you with me. Okay so let me uh formulate this finance problem. Again, I have a set Q in Rd such that the convex of Q contains the unit ball. Yeah, and I want to choose Yeah, and I want to to choose V1 V2D from Q such that the convex hull complaints of V i complaints the wall of radius are with the same center. The problem is with the same center. What I can guarantee here, what is the R? And so we obtained the first polynomial bound for. polynomial bound for so what what we are doing let's let's uh sketch our proofs given so first of all we don't like this problem yeah yeah we don't like this problem now because we can solve hello so we go from the stein's form to heliworth we just consider the dual set so we consider the cupola which Polar which is contained in the unit wall. But then actually choosing another center here, so let's consider this set. We know, yeah, cupolar minus C where C such that this lambda is equal to D. There is one. Is equal to D. There is one. And we go to the to Atlantida. Yeah. Then what we have in Atlantida? In Atlantida, we have, okay, C is from your body. So it's the norm, the norm is at most one. So this body contains the ball of radius one half. I mean, it's a constant factor from here. But now we have a beauty, it's a well-structured. Have a beautiful, it's a well-structured polytope. So because Q is contained in the unit ball, C is containing the unit ball is a point of Q, of Q polar. Yeah, so it shift contains in the ball of radius two, it means that in the opposite direction it contains the ball over two. That's all. So we have the same type of problem, but now we have that lambda. Lambda L polar is included in D times L polar because it's of the choice of C. And we have our lemma here. So, and when we go backwards, so we have this D squared here of the order of magnitude D, we can choose 2D such that with some constant D squared, how much the distance is D. Homota distance is d squared. But then, if we go back, so if we go back, so we hope we have this shifted body, yes. But the thing is that here are the distances, it's a triangle inequality. So, if your distance was d squared, then you shift it again by a unit vector, this at most d squared plus one. Yeah, and then you go back here. Whoa. Here, look, and you get something like Rd is of the order, I don't know, D squared by I don't know, seven, let's say, if you compute it, like roughly speaking, whatever, but the order squared. And at the point that you don't do anything here, just a polarity and understanding of the geometry. And this lemma is purely linear algebra. Linear algebra. So, that's all, but I want to formulate several open problems. So, the first open problem I already mentioned, and it's addressed to people here who master the topological arguments. Can you explain why the dimension is 2D of the problem? So, come out with that with description that the problem that you That the problem is that you need at least 2D, because most of the time it's less than 2D, so it's not a constant dimension. In the Helly theorem, I can explain it. Here, I cannot explain. Another problem here that in convexity, in control convexity, we like colorful results. So, and here, the natural conjecture is if you have a similar statement for 2D colors. For 2D colors, and in for Steinitz, there is a bound exponential, the radius exponential, and I doubt that I think that it has to be polynomial as well. We have no idea. But for the Halle problem, we even don't know the Halley number in the colorful result. So I can prove that, for example, if you have 2D colors, that you can find colorful selection. Colorful selection with hyperplanes, half spaces that intersection is bounded, no constant, just bounded. And we don't know whether it's true. And the last question is purely geometric, and I want to address that as accessible for students, which somehow hides here. I'm sorry, this is just an open problem. So quite often we consider we take a bullet. You take a body, we take a point in it, and then consider a centrally symmetric copy of your body with respect to this point. So it's kind of minus q plus 2x, yes? And you can consider the intersection of this. Yes? And if you look at the volume of this intersection, that it's low concave, and you can show that there is. Concave, and you can show that there is a unique point at which the volume of this intersection is maximal in your convex body. But central symmetric body is the center of the symmetry, that's the whole body. But I claim it's not hard to show that. And my question is whether for this point, our maximum of this functional is we have this inclusion with coefficient d on linear in d. On linear in D? I have no idea. I asked Barony because, I mean, it's kind of he's marked region and he worked with approximation polytops here. And he said that he does know the answer. So it's a very simple problem, it's nature. Once again, like for this figure to show that the problem was. So you choose X that maximize the volume of the intersection, and then you say that. And then you say that with respect to this, let's say x, yeah, you have that u minus x is in minus d u minus x or linear. Oh, there's three problems of different uh flavors. I mean, that's like topological and that's all okay. Thanks, Peter, for receiving some. And the speaker for the presentation. Anyone have a question? So this point was first studied by Russia. Magbet. Magbet. Magbet. So we could ask if the Magbet. Yeah, I called it Magbet point, but I didn't want to. No, no, it's not listening.
