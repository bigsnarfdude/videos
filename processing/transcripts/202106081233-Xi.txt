I don't think need too much introduction to this audience. That's a turbulent reduction. We all know that in a turbulent flow, in a plane pipe flow, a plane channel flow, the turbulent flow will obviously have much larger friction, much larger resistance compared with a laminar flow. But if you, in a turbulence, if you inject some dilute polymers, so inject some polymers into the turbulence. Some polymers into the turbulence at a very low level of concentration, you can achieve a very high level of dry reduction. That means that for the same pressure gradient, you are going to achieve much higher flow rate in a polymer solution compared with that in a laminar flow. And we are used to project the behaviors of the different dynamical behaviors of the flow into a parameter space between Reynolds number and Weissen number. So we know that if we had a Newtonian flow, So, we know that if we had a Newtonian flow, we all know what's going to happen. Then, that is that if you increase the Reynolds sample upon some critical Reynolds sample, you are going to have a laminar to turbulent transition, right? So, that's going to what's going to happen along this axis. And once you have polynomials, you are going to have a new axis. That's the Weissen number. And if you move along this direction, that's increasing on the Weissenberg number, you are going to see a range of different behaviors that is best seen from the mean velocity profile that's shown here on the right. Show here on the right. So, at a relatively low-wise number, what we have is what we call LDR or low-drag action, low-level, low-extented dragon regime, in which you can see that the mean flow is kind of higher than that of a Newtonian turbulence, but still it kind of retains most of the characteristics, including a log-low behavior of a Newtonian flow. But once you have high enough Weissen number, you can see a different behavior in which the Behavior in which the profile, the shape, the slope also changes substantially across the channel. That's what we call the high-extent reduction phenomena. We have a separate work on the transition between LDR and HDR, which I'm not going to talk about today. The focus of today is more at an even higher Weiss number that's for the maximum dry direction behavior, which basically says that once we have polymers, so once the polymer elasticity is strong enough, its dry direction effects start to saturate into. Gryadation effects start to saturate into an upper limit, we call maximum geodesical MDR. So, this is a problem that has been studied for at least half a century, and it still remains puzzling to the researchers in this field. And it's puzzling because there are a few critical questions that we are trying to answer. Number one is why do we even have this limit? Because we know that viabys and polymers can suppress turbulence. So why does it not suppress turbulence all the way and just push? Disturbance all the way and just push it all the way to laminar flow. We call this the existence question. And the second thing is interestingly, what we find from experiments is that using different polymers, polymer species, using different polymer solutions, or polymer concentration. So different polymer solutions will affect the initial transitions you have here. So what wise number do we see the transition, for example? But once you hit the ultimate limit, you hit the same ultimate limit. So why is this limit? So, why is this limit MDR universal to different point properties? And this final limit is characterized by a mean velocity profile given by Verke back to the 70s, and we call this a work MDR profile. And eventually, if we are able to identify whatever state is responsible to this limit, we should be able to explain why it takes this particular magnitude. So, for decades, the focus has been because we know that once we have strong enough elasticity due to polymers, we know that We know that the mean flow will converge to some sort of ultimate limit we call MDR. So the focus in the field has been searching for some sort of ultimate flow state that's responsible for MDR. So for decades, different theories have proposed different ultimate states for this final state. And I don't have time to go through all the historical research. So I'll focus on two views that's become more popular in recent years. The slightly older Yes, the slightly older one is something that we propose when I was still working with Mike Ram, who is actually going to present next to me. So we propose this picture, very simple picture, in which we observe that in a Newtonian turbine flow, this exists this strong state of turbulence, we call active turbulence, which actually dominates in a Newtonian flow. And there's also this very weak state called hibernating turbulence, which doesn't have too much of those turbulent actions going on. Turbulent actions going on. And in this picture, we know that in active turbulence, polymers can become highly stretched, exert very strong polymers stress into active turbulence. It's going to suppress this one so that it's going to basically push the state into hibernating turbulence. So statistically, it's going to bias towards this hibernating turbulence. And this state has a lot of characteristics that's similar to MDR. So in this picture, eventually MDR will be a state in which we statistically converge to this state, right? And this picture is a This state, right? And this picture is intellectually very appealing because it's very natural to address why this state is universal to different polymer properties. Because at this stage, the polymer isn't so important because polymer has relaxed. But the problem is that we have so far not been able to capture this state in which hibernating turbulence dominates flow in DNS. So this is something that's missing in this picture. And a few years later, there's a this something that has missing becomes Be missing become known to us from both numerical and experimental evidence that's called so-called elasto-inertial turbulence, which by name is basically a new kind of instability that occurs at the limit of both high Reynolds number and high wise number. And compared with the classical inertial-driven Newtonian turbulence, which in which the vortex you see will align with the flow. So in this EIT, what we see, the vortex is basically... What we see, the vortex is basically normal to the flow directional. So, this is the directional flow. So, the vortex will align in a span-wise direction. So, this is very clearly different than Newtonian turbulence. And it has been hypothesized in recent years that as you increase Weiss number, so initially there will be some sort of transition between this classical inertial-driven turbulence to this elasto-inertial turbulence. But eventually, it was hypothesized that the classical inertial-driven turbulence were totally. Classical inertial-driven technology will totally go away and you eventually converge into a pure 2D structure called EIT. So, this has been the more recent story. But the problem with this is that because EIT is an instability in which elasticity plays such an important role, so it becomes very hard to explain why the MDR limit is universal to different polymer. So, I will just briefly go through the DNS protocol we are using, which is pretty standard. So, I don't think I will. Pretty standard, so I don't think I will spend too much time. We look at channel flow, it's pressure-driven on the constant pressure drop, and X direction will be the flow direction, Y is war normal, and Z is Z span wise. And we couple Navi-Stokes equation with the Phini P equation to solve for the, which solve for the alpha, which is polymer confirmation tension. And if you write down the equation, if you do the non-dimensionalization, you end up with four dimensionless groups. And so this is a picture basically shows the two dimensions. The picture basically shows a two-dimensional solution we find here, two-dimensional EIT solutions. And we are not by far not the first group to identify that those so-called EIT solutions can exist in a 2D flow geometry. For example, Mike's group also has found that, and I believe he's going to talk about some of their recent findings in this direction. So we can clearly see that the EIT solutions have very interesting and very unique characteristics. So the white line. characteristics. So the white lines we are looking at here, they are basically the strengths of the vortex field. So you can see that the vortex is kind of aligning in the orthogonal direction into the screen. So it's in span wise direction. Whereas color you are looking here is basically the level of polymer extension. So you can see the polymer extension form this kind of very sharp tilted sheets along the streamwise direction. And the first question we ask is that if MDER is indeed this 2D AIT state, this to the AIT state. Very naturally, we would expect that this state will be insensitive. At least this flow statistics will be insensitive to increasing Weiss number. So we already know that the point field doesn't seem to be clearly dependent on Weiss number, which is not surprising. So we start to look at the flow field, how it changes. This is friction factor as a function of the level of polymer extension, which is basically increasing Weissen number from left to right. And if we look from left to right. And if we look at the 2D solution, that's the blue line and the red line here, we can see that the flow resistance, the friction increases with one's number, which is not surprising because we know that increase in watts number will increase the level of instability, increase this elasticity-driven turbulence component, which is also what we have all seen from the previous presentation. But this is total against this observation that MDR has to be universal. And also that we also simulated two different And also that we also simulated two different B levels, which basically models how flexible the point chain is. And we can see that the result coming from two different B levels, they don't really overlap. So the two DEIT solution, the mean flow doesn't really remain constant for different polymer properties. And what we find is that in order to get something like MDR behavior, we have to resort to 3D simulation. In 3D simulation, we see total difference. We see that the friction decreased with the weiss number, which was what we would expect. Number, which was what we would expect with dry duction, and eventually it reached some sort of plateau. So it saturates as what we have seen in experiments. It saturated into basically a converged mean velocity profile. So we have seen that we basically cannot explain MDR based on a 2D version of EIT. Some level of three-dimensional dynamics had to be there. So what is this three-dimensional dynamics? So what we are seeing here is that we just take a three-dimensional DNS trajectory and project into a state space. And on the left, you are seeing a Wisen number equals 40 solution, which is a particularly interesting solution because it's kind of in the middle of transition of two different type of behaviors. I'm also showing you a few different states just to show where everything is. So active turbulence is basically the dominant structure you will see in a Newtonian flow. Dominant structure you will see in Newtonian flow. ESO H state is basically where hibernating turbulence is supposed to be. And the 2D solution of EIT is at this corner. And the old picture Mike and I was initially proposing a little more than 10 years ago was that there will be some sort of intermediate transition between active returns and to the region for hibernating turbulence or edge state. So we still see that. And we call this type A cycles. So we still see that. But after this particular one number, we also But after this particular one number, we also see that occasionally the dynamics can escape this type A cycle and it can kind of pivot to a different direction. So you approach this direction of 2DIT. And because you have 2D IT, it cannot totally lammerize it. So it becomes bounced back and it go back around HC and go back to active filaments. So we saw this type B cycles. And so at the Wise number with faulty, we see this transition between type A and type B cycles. And if we further increase Wise number into So if we further increase wise number into 400, so we again show you where active turbulence, where edge state is, where 2DIT is. And this is a solution we see here. So we don't even see type. We don't see type A cycles anymore. We don't see type B cycles anymore. We see some sort of new cycle that's between these two limits, right? Some small fluctuation in this limit. We call this type C cycles. And let's just look at, again, these three types of behaviors in time series. behaviors in time series so i want you to focus on this variable again which is the instantaneous level of the friction uh friction drag as a function of time that's time series for different three different wise numbers so you can see that at the wise number is 40 you see these kind of typical spikes followed by these dips that's the type a cycle that's the transition between active turbulence and the uh and the hibernating turbulence we know before so the spikes are active turbulence these dips are hibernating turbulence These dips are hibernating turbulence. But we also see a different kind of dips that last for, it goes much deeper and lasts for a longer time. And that's what that corresponds to the type B cycles. The reason we know it is type C B cycles, if you look at how much energy is being transferred by polymers to the turbulent energy, it becomes positive. That means that the elasticity is feeding back into the sustaining of turbulence. And increasing to 17164, type A cycles go away. Type A cycles go away. It is dominated by type B cycles, and type B cycles also become much, much longer. So you actually need to run simulation very long to capture good statistics. At a very high one standard, one standard into the order of 100, what do you see is the type C cycle. You can see that we don't see those spikes at all. We don't see those active turbulence at all. But you see those kind of quasi-periodic wiggles. And that's what we call type C cycles. We call type C cycles. And so, this is just summarizing the type of behavior we are seeing for constant ring non-sember as we increase y-sember. And we can see that it transitioned from type A to type B and to type C. And recall that at beginning, we showed that in 3D simulation, as we increase the Weissen number, the friction drag will saturate into a plateau. So it becomes constant for a very wide range of Weissen number. And where does that plateau correspond to? So the plateau corresponds to the regime that covers... Correspond to the regime that covers both type B and type C cycles. So, what we are seeing here is that the phenomenologically, the regime corresponding to MBDR, the regime in which we see converged drag reduction, actually at least have two different kind of dynamical behaviors, covering a very wide range of Weiss numbers. If we further zoom into type C, and so what we are showing here, basically, what we found is that about Y7 equals 200, it's always type C cycles. Type C cycles. And what you are seeing here is that even within the regime for type C cycle, the dynamics is not really converging. It keeps on changing. The fluctuation gets longer and the period gets longer. So even within type C cycle, the dynamics still keep on changing with Weiss number. So even though the mean flow, what we measure here become converged, which is consistent with the asymptotic behavior at MDR, the underlying dynamics go through a lot of changes, including the transition from type B to type C. Including the transition from type B to type C, including the continued evolution in type C behavior. So we don't really totally understand the type C behaviors yet, but we can take a very quick look into what's happening in those fluctuations. So what are we seeing here? The blue line here is the rate of turbulent energy production. So how much turbulence motion that's being generated by the interaction between the mean shear and the renal stress, which is the traditional. Stress, which is the traditional mechanism for turbulence generation inertial-driven turbulence. And what we see here is that you have these kind of fluctuations, these kind of wiggles, and you can roughly divide that into two phases. One is relatively high production, the other relatively low production. Again, it's not strict here. And what we've found here is that if we take a moment, we call this moment three here for this high moment here. And if we just remove the polymer stress, run a new. remove the polymer stress, run a Newtonian flow, Newtonian simulation, the state will go all the way to Newtonian turbulence. That means that at this state, elasticity is not driving the instability. The elasticity is still suppressing the instability. It is still playing as a drag reducing agent. Polymer is still playing as a drag reducing agent. But at the moment four, that's within the dip, if you remove the elasticity, remove the polynomial stress. say remove the pawn stress it basically decays to all the way down to lamina laminar flow so there's at least two different two different phases in this uh uh uh in this dynamics one is uh in which inertia is playing the leading role in driving the instability but this cycle by itself is not sustaining of uh is not self-sustaining in the sense that you were always trying to kick into this low phase and at this low phase if you don't have polymer stress to sustain turbulence you will become laminar so the the the the the the polymer force The polling force, the elasticity driven instability is only important at this stage. And we'll finally take a look at the flow structures, so between type B and type C cycles. For type B cycles, we can see this transition between this streamwise velocity, which is what we typically see Newtonian turbulence, or what we call active turbulence, or this structure that is spanwise rows, so spanwise vortices. So again, the flow goes this direction. And this is typical of A this is a typical of EIT. And for type C cycle, which we see at a much higher voice number, you also have these two different phases. So this is the low phases in which elasticity is important. This is somewhat similar to what you see to a structure that's close to EIT. But for the high peak regime, where the inertial force is important, you see this are very unique helping kind of structures. So to conclude, we have shown. So to conclude, we have shown that with the increase in voice number, there's a transition between very interesting behaviors, different kinds of dynamical cycles, including type A, type B, and type C. And type A is basically consistent with what we have seen previously between the transition between active and turbulent turbulence. Whereas, once you reach the regime of type B and type C cycle, elasticity becomes at least essential to keep the turbulence to be self-sustaining. And behind the And behind the within the regime in which you see a converged mean flow that is corresponding to MDR, it covers different types of dynamics. So, that kind of, in our view, that kind of challenges the overall notion is of do we have a universal ultimate state for a single ultimate state for MDR? There are multiple states that behind this converged flow state. It includes both type B and type C cycles, and even within type C cycle, it also keeps on growing with increasing voice number. With increasing voice number. And finally, we also need to look at what do we mean by EIT when we use this term. The EIT we call in 2D flow is different than the EIT we saw in 3D flow, and the EIT we saw in 3D flow between type B and type C, they are also different. So currently the researchers has labeled as EIT in the literature, it's probably basically an umbrella term that covers a whole range of different flow states and different instabilities. Different instabilities. With that, let me conclude here and I'll try to answer any questions you may have. Thanks, Lee. Lovely talk. No questions have come in yet, so let me start off. And then if anybody else has got a question, please just add it to the chat. So a few people have talked, I think it's probably Yves Dubief and Chris White, that actually MDR is not truly logarithmic. I mean, is your data, does that kind of look at that? And then I've just wondered if you wanted to think about that. That if you wanted to think about that, when you say it's converging, have you looked at the indicator function to see if there's any subtle differences in the slopes of the data? Yeah, so there's actually two parts of the question. Let me just answer both parts here. The first one is about the loss of strict logarithm dependence. This is something that actually we have looked at that. And this is something that will happen at the LGRHDR transition. So I think, I think traditionally, there's I think traditionally there's a tendency in the literature to characterize the HDR as some sort of a log log that gives you a higher slope. But more recently, as you point out, Dubrief and White has shown that you don't really have, if you look at indicating function, you don't really have a logarithmic dependence in that regime. And we also see that. And we don't think that is related, necessarily related with EIT. You can have LQ HTL transition without EIT. HTL transition without EIT. Actually, numerically, we know that if you have an artificial diffusion in your numerical scheme, you don't even have EIT in your simulation. But in that kind of scheme, you can still capture this transition. For the second part, we haven't really strictly looked at the, other than the mean velocity profile, we haven't really strictly looked at the indication function or any kind of more detailed higher order derivatives of the flow profile. So that would be a good idea to look into. I mean, is that typically what you see there? I mean, is that typically what you see there that the data points basically overlap? Yeah. Yeah. So the data points are basically overlap, but we haven't really exactly taken a derivative to look at whether the higher order derivatives are still the same. Between type B and C, can you look at things like the Reynolds shear stress and see if there's differences in the averages to kind of have a more quantitative kind of saying, okay, this is type B or type C? So I So I have to dig into paper to see if we look at linear series, but we look at the turbulent kinetic energy, which to us is a more straightforward way of showing what is really driving instability. And if you look at the turbulent energy, the last term here is a, I think I have the equation, at least a simplified version of the equation somewhere here. Here we go. So last term here basically shows how much energy is being Basically, it shows how much energy is being transferred between the elastic energy and the turbine kinetic energy, and it becomes positive when the elasticity is driving the instability, and it is negative when polymer is suppressing the instability. And you can clearly see this distinction between the two different kinds of behaviors. Okay, thank you very much. There's no other questions come in. So, I think then we'll thank you for a lovely talk. We'll now move to the next speaker. It's Mike Graham. Mike, if you're Speaker, it's Mike Graham. Mike, if you're ready, you're good to share to be talking here. Actually,
