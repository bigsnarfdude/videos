All right, thank you very much. The second speaker is Mia Miyagi from Brown University. And Mia is going to talk about modeling introgression at LinkedLoki. Yeah, thank you very much. Thanks for sticking around for my talk. I'm trying a new audio setup, so let me know if you can't hear me or alternatively, if you can hear my neighbors. Yeah, as mentioned. Yeah, as mentioned, I've been asked today to talk about some work that I did during my PhD with John Wakely, who is here, on modeling introgression at linked loci. And ideally, time permitting, there's also going to be a little slice at the end where I'll talk about some work that I've been doing since starting my postdoc with Emilia Hortos. Cool. So, yes, apologies to Francois. I'm about to take something very for granted. Take something very for granted. I'm going to imagine that there's some true species tree that connects some set of species in general, in this case, four butterflies, and this represents some dominant evolutionary history or natural history that relates these species. Now, what probably I don't need to spend time convincing people here of is that at any particular locus, the evolutionary The evolutionary history relating an individual from each of these species can and often is different from the species tree, either in timings or topology. And in this case, I've drawn one such gene tree where the topology differs from the species tree topology due to something called incomplete lineage sorting. And incomplete lineage sorting is just a name for what occurs when two lineages that are sequestered. Two lineages that are sequestered together at some branch in the species tree fail to coalesce. So, as you can see highlighted in yellow here, the top two species had a time where they and only they could coalesce with each other in this species tree structure. But for whatever reason, at this locus, that event did not occur. And then, as a result, the middle two species have coalesced first, and we've gotten a different topology. Topology. Now, we can also get different gene tree topologies for a host of other reasons. Sort of one of the more interesting phenomena is introgression or gene flow. And in this case, now we have the two middle species most closely related to each other at some locus with the red gene tree. But rather than being due to incomplete lineage sorting, in this case, this is due to gene. This is due to gene flow or introgression. So there's some pulse between these species that allows them to enter the same branch of the species now network and coalesce in a different area than they would if they followed the species tree. Now, if we overlay these two gene trees on top of each other, we can see that they actually do have the same topology where the middle two species coalesce first, but Species coalesce first, but they're generated from very different biological processes, have very different evolutionary histories. And as a result, differentiating between these two phenomena that generate trees of the same topology is something that's of a lot of interest to many biologists. Now, the sort of most popular site pattern. Popular site pattern-based methods that try to differentiate between introgression and incomplete lineage sorting rely on a very fundamental symmetry where at a single locus, incomplete lineage sorting generates trees with different topologies uniformly. And that's quite intuitive if we look at just a simple example like this, where we have three species that we're really following in a route, which is sort of totally inert. And these species And these species A, B, and C, A, and B are most closely related to each other at the species tree structure, but incomplete lineage sorting happens, and A and B fail to coalesce in their ancestor. And so A, B, and C all make it to their combined ancestor without any coalescent events occurring. And now, of course, all of these lineages are essentially indistinguishable from each other. And we can get A coalescing with B, B with C, or A with C. With B, B with C, or A with C, all equally. And so, again, at the single locus, we would expect to see that ILS generates these three topologies evenly. And I've named them the species topology, which just matches the species tree, an introgression topology, which matches a putative introgression event, and a nuisance topology, which doesn't match, which in this sort of toy example doesn't match anything. And so we know this thing is purely generated by our. Know this thing is purely generated by ILS. Now, what I want to sort of get at today in this first part is just a sort of simple and natural follow-up question, which is, does this intuition hold for joint distributions of pairs of ILS gene trees? Which is to say, are all pairs of gene tree topologies for three tips generated with equal frequency conditioning on ILS of both loci? And there's a sort of a natural And there's a sort of a natural caveat here, which is, of course, if the trees at both ends are exactly the same, that's going to have different behavior than if the trees at the ends are different because there's different conditioning on recombination events between them. So we'll ignore that for now because that cases is easy and instead focus on the cases where we know that there had to be at least one recombination event between the two ends and we then have different trees. Have different trees, which can match in topology, but for illustration's sake, in this case, do not. So, in order to ask this question, we used a Markov model of the coalescent with recombination for three species with a pulsive introgression. This is very much based on the model used by Stackin and Pollock in 2006, where, similarly to them, we're taking individuals in the present from these different species, and we're looking at two physical. Species, and we're looking at two physically linked loci. So I have one A, B, and C and one alpha, beta, gamma, just for conversation's sake. But these aren't really ordered in any way, but it's just to denote that A and B can coalesce and alpha and beta can coalesce, but alpha and B are at different loci. And in our model, we have a single unidirectional pulse of introgression from species B into C, where any lineage, any given lineage has probability. Any given lineage has probability p of following this introgression bridge. And this introgression event happens at some time ti in the past, which is closer to the present than the most recent speciation event. So this introgression event always occur, sorry, always occurs at these terminal branches. So, yeah, with this setup, we now have six alleles that we're following at two loci. With a possible coalescent events at either. And if we then zoom in onto the terminal branch where sort of there's action happening, we can see that the setup gives us a variety of possible internal branch scenarios of varying interest. So, first, the alleles from species B, B, and beta, they can go into the ancestor of species A and B. Species A and B following the species tree topology, either still linked together physically or recombined onto different backgrounds. And shown here in blue and green. And of course, you can also have histories where there's many repeated bouts of re-annealing and splitting, but those aren't shown here because you can have very, very many of them, of course. Alternatively, you can have B or beta or both go through. Beta or both go through the introgression channel into spec. And I've just shown here in purple the case where they are remaining linked together, but then are introgressed. And in red, a case where a recombination breaks them apart, but only one of them follows the introgression branch. But of course, they could be split and both follow that bridge as well. And if we look at this now, there's sort of two. There's sort of two main types of scenarios we can imagine. Either B and beta both go together or they split up. And if they both go together, we have internal branches of the same type, but at different parts of the tree. And if they split up, we have two essentially identical internal branch scenarios. It turns out that if they split up, this model becomes very simple because we essentially have two single locus problems. So I'm going to focus just on the case where I'm going to focus just on the case where B and beta both assort into the same internal branch together. Now let's just choose arbitrarily that they followed the species tree, so neither of them introgressed. Now we have a sort of standard model where there are two loci and coalescence possible at either, but also recombination between them. So one possible scenario that can occur is recombination happens, splitting, in this case, Happens splitting, in this case, A and alpha onto different backgrounds, but B and beta remain link together. Then a coalescence event could occur, in this case, coalescing alpha and beta. And in this very specific setup, we then end up with A by itself and B linked to the ancestor of alpha and beta, the two sample alleles in the present. And as you can imagine, you can have coalescence of both or neither, and you can have many bouts of recombination. Can have many bouts of recombination at both or neither. So, now with the setup, we can ask this question: what do we expect to see for pairs of ILS trees? So, if we go back to our single locus gene tree topologies now, there are three of these, and each locus can have one. And we don't care about the ordering of the two loci, so we have six different unordered pairs. One example would be a species tree topology. Species tree topology linked to an integer tree topology. And I'll denote this by just the initials of the slash. So this would be species slash integression, which again, because we don't care about the order, is identical to integression slash species. So if there's no bias in the trees that ILS generates, we might expect to see something like this, where for any given tree topology pair ratio, Tree topology, pair ratio, any given recombination rate or distance between the two loci of interest, and any given introgression probability or chance of following that introgression channel, we just get a flat surface because this ratio is just one everywhere. But in fact, if you work it out, and this is for some particular choice of any and the times, just so that they're all equal in this case, you see that you get something that's very much not. That you get something that's very much not flat. So, in this case, again, we have the recombination distance between them. I don't know if you can see my pointer, but on this axis, we have this introgression probability. And on the vertical axis, we have the ratio between a species nuisance pairs and introgression nuisance pairs. So, if species tree topology matching trees show up in our pairs more frequently than introgression topology matching trees, Than introgression topology matching trees, we would expect that this ratio should be greater than one and vice versa. And so, what we see in specific is that for a low, but of course, non-zero recombination rate, there is this bias where this ratio is larger than one as the introgression probability gets closer to one and dips below one as the introgression probability approaches zero. So, something interesting to note here is that as Is that as the introgression probability approaches one? This means that if you don't condition on ILS, introgression trees become more common because this is becoming the dominant evolutionary history. But if you condition on ILS at both loci, what you instead see is that this ratio increases, which means that pairs involving introgression topology trees become less common. Become less common. So, this is sort of a bias in the double ILS trees against the experienced evolutionary history, the average experienced evolutionary history, I should say. So what's happening here? It turns out we can test what's going on by feeding in different starting scenarios into our Markov models of the different internal branches. And in doing this, we find that. And in doing this, we find that this phenomenon is a result of a suppression of the effective recombination rate in internal branches of the species network. So, what do I mean by that? Well, if we look at our toy scenario from earlier where we had recombination and coalescence, we actually would never see something like this in our double ILS sample because we are conditioning on no coalescent events occurring. And so, what's happening here is that if A and alpha split onto different If A and alpha split onto different backgrounds, there are now twice as many potential coalescent events that we need to avoid in order to observe double ILS. So when we condition on ILS, we effectively dampen the recombination rate and probability between the two loci. And as a result, we're more likely to see cases where the two species that were sequestered together remain on the same chromosome. Whereas C and gamma. Whereas C and gamma from species C, which have no such constraint, can freely recombine off onto different backgrounds. So, what this means is you're slightly enriched for scenarios like the one shown where A and alpha are linked together and B and beta are still linked together, but C and gamma are split off when you reach the grand ancestor. And as a result, C and gamma are more likely to participate in the first coalescent event in the ancestral population. The ancestral population. So, with a little bit of intuition, now we can look at this with fresh eyes and it sort of makes sense. Because when the introgression probability is very low, we're more likely to get this scenario where A and B are stuck together and C and gamma are free to split. But if the introgression probability is very high, A and alpha are more likely to are free, and B and C are more likely to be stuck together on their original backgrounds. And so in this way, And so, in this way, by conditioning on ILS, we induce this opposing bias against the topology that was experienced at those loci. And sort of, of course, in actually working out the model, we don't require ILS to occur. So, we're able to calculate things like all the possible frequencies of the different gene tree topology pairs as a function of. Topology pairs as a function of the interspeciation times, effective population size, recombination rate, and introgression probability. But I wanted to highlight sort of one fun kernel of intuition that we could gain from doing this work. And in addition, we were able to simulate the sort of scenario and use those to test if, well, maybe this deviation totally goes away if you don't know the true gene tree topologies, but instead can only. Topologies, but instead can only look at them through the lens of mutations. And of course, this does change the shape of the surface, but we were actually also able to show that the qualitative signal still remains. Cool. And so with that, I'm going to take a hard pivot for our last five minutes to talk about some stuff that I've been working on in my postdoc and at the end of my PhD, which is looking at stuff at the interface of genetics. At stuff at the interface of genetics and gender studies. And sort of the most obvious place where these two seemingly disparate fields come to intersect is in genetic studies of sex, gender, and sexuality. Because these studies naturally require the authors and researchers to make choices about how they define these traits, how they choose to study them, and in general, what aspects of them and what categories they're. Of them and what categories they're interested in pursuing. Sort of the most high-profile of these sorts of studies are studies of genetic bases for sexuality. There's been public fascination with the possibility of a gay gene or a biological basis for same-sex sexuality for long before the technology that existed to do the sorts of studies like the ones I've arbitrarily chosen here. But that fascinating. But that fascination has not dampened with time. And in fact, new tools, modern tools, and modern databases have allowed for new and more expansive looks or new and more expansive attempts to explain sexuality using biological data. One sort of natural critique that jumps out immediately is just like, what exactly do these analyses investigate? And we don't have time, unfortunately, to get into all the details. Time, unfortunately, to get into all the details of how exactly they operationalize sexuality, but in short, it's through surveyed responses about individuals' sexual encounters. And sort of at the surface level, it's already clear that there's a need for dialogue with queer studies and gender studies in this, because it's sort of well known and well-established in those fields. Well, established in those fields that things like sexual behavior, attraction, identity, and fantasy are not easily reducible to simple sexual dimorphism. And this is a quote from Stephanie Clare in Biological Sex and the Overrepresentation of Man, where she pulls this really evocative example from the sex variant study in the 1930s, where a participant describes her sexual experience and experience of attraction. Experience of attraction. And if you sort of read through this quote, you can see that there's a very particular A, like gender modality that's involved in this, but also a particular sort of casting of this as masculine and as an attraction to masculinity. And this is obviously not universal for queer experiences. And so the point that Claire makes that is sort of well studied in queer studies is just that. In queer studies, it's just that what we might sort of umbrella describe a same-sex sexual practice or sexual attraction in fact contains an amorphous, dynamic, and expansive set of behaviors, practices, and social customs. But something I'm also interested in in these studies getting beyond these sort of surface-level philosophical concerns is exactly how. Is exactly how modern genetic analysis technology is used to make claims about the ideology and the sort of correlation with gender and sex of these sorts of behaviors. So for example, this is taken from the Ghana et al. study that I splashed up earlier. They looked at genetic correlations using LDSC between their same-sex sexuality score and various other traits. Various other traits. I've just highlighted their risky behavior category and their physical trait category here. But in general, I think artifacts like this show the intense need for dialogue between these fields, because not only do these sort of choices about what traits were pre-selected to be analyzed inform how these results are taken up in society, but also bias what results are possible. You can't see a correlation between traits you don't study, for example. Study, for example. But they also show sort of essentialist and fundamental sort of philosophical claims about genetic bases for these traits in men and women, and that differences between them can and might be due to biological and in specific genetic differences in control. And I just want to highlight that myself and some co-authors recently published. Co-authors recently published a sort of review and critique of the sort of work in GLQ. And this idea that it might not be sex itself that generates differences in signals, differences in sex signals and data is not new. And in fact, it's something that people have shown happens in even biological data. So for example, early in the COVID pandemic, COVID pandemic, there were recorded differences in mortality between men and women. And people hypothesize that this might be due to some fundamental or essential biological difference. But as people have shown, in fact, if you dig into the data, many of these are due to gendered effects, like gender differences in healthcare participation, screening, likelihood to go to a doctor, have access to care, etc. And it's not just limited to those. Limited to those social sorts of commentary. This does have real effects on people and policy. For example, Ambien, a sleep drug that was the first drug that the FDA recommended sex differential dosage for based on this differences in sex efficacy shown. It turns out if you correct for participant weight, this effect totally goes away. And yet this sort of clumsy Clumsy sex-based analysis remains as one of the dominant narratives about this drug. And for more thoughts about sex contextualism and contextualist approaches to sex in general in biological research, I also just want to plug an upcoming piece by Maddie Pape and others. And just to finish off, specifically in sort of the high level, I'm interested in how claims of genetic sex differences. Claims of genetic sex differences are made, and the ways in which gender as a specialized and individualized environmental variable can interact with and affect the assumptions that are used in modern statistical technology that's used to analyze these large data sets. Great. And with that, thank you all for listening. Thanks very much, Mia. We have time for a couple of questions again. And I saw that, Francois, were you raising a hand or were you trying to clap? I was indeed trying to clap. Sorry. So questions. Okay, maybe I can maybe I can I can I can I can I can start. So talking about your the the the your first your first model with your with your with your trees so when you were when you were looking at the the ratios between the different occurrences so the the numbers there well you the the the the numbers there well you you you you you a lot of it was one and and then it it went up to to to to 1.1 or 0.9. So do these things will these things sort of multiply out so that if you have bigger trees, that the discrepancies would be potentially larger. That's an interesting question. I can't say something for sure. I can't say something for sure. My gut check is kind of no, because if ILIS occurs lower on the tree, but you're interested in a higher up assorting event, as long as those branches don't still exist, by the time you get all the way up there, it's the same problem as if ILS hadn't occurred. It's just based on the count of and where those branches are. That being said, that magnitude. That being said, that magnitude can change a lot as a function of the population size, the various other demographic parameters chosen. And also, one way in which this effect can multiply is, let's say you're looking at 100-linked loci. This, of course, has a similar bias in the sort of like n-fold-linked version of this problem. Okay, so as we have more the complexity of the genetic interactions as opposed to the tree size. Okay, great, thanks. I can see Noah. Sorry, yeah, no, following up on Mark's question, so I'm kind of curious about your thoughts about the, right? So, there's sort of a number of different directions one could try to explore. Try to extend the model whether it's kind of the finite state, finite states, sorry, finitely many loci with the Simonson-Churchill framework for recombination or larger tree sizes or sort of a more complex way of thinking about how the introgression works in time. And I'm curious, in your your in your work with the model you know which which of those uh kind of angles seem um most potentially interesting you know you know could producing could produce um you know additional unexpected phenomena yeah i think um that's a good question for me personally it's definitely um different models of how the integression occurs um the logic there is just sort of like at some level you can have two linked loci that can be You can have two linked loci, that can be like a real physical thing, but a single unidirectional instantaneous pulse of introgression is kind of the least real of the constructs. So I think, and also in terms of work that I'm more interested in doing now, like I'm definitely, I definitely see like a lot of potential in thinking about what happens when you smear out that introgression event or what happens when it can be bi-directional and so on. Okay, I think we've got to a little bit before beyond beyond eight o'clock now. So I think that's probably the time to call time. So I think as per the previous speaker, a nominated, nominal sort of round of applause given by me, hopefully. Given by me. Hopefully, you can actually hear the crapping. And where there will be, of course, I mean, this is one of a number of events in the modelling and theory in population biology programme. And so please do look out for others. Noah, do you know when the next one is? I've got March 13th on my list, but there might be something else. Something else. Talking about SLIM, so another event in our discussions of population genetics and population biology software. So the emails should be going up next week. Excellent. In that case, I'll call this meeting to a close and thank you all for coming along for two very interesting talks. And see you soon. See you soon.
