                    Scalar multiple of the standard metric on just the circle, plus a scalar multiple of the standard metric on the two-sphere. So there are singular orbits of this particular cohomogeneity one action, and you also need to make sure that your metric closes up smoothly at this end. The equations themselves that you get are these ones here. Now, I guess there's some complications here, but it doesn't seem to be overly complicated. Doesn't seem to be overly complicated. I'll make the claim that you cannot explicitly solve these equations. And in fact, I'll be maybe both glad, but also upset if someone tells me that actually you can solve these equations explicitly. So the idea is, well, what's happening here? If you think about this as a shooting problem, starting from your t equals zero end and shooting until the t equals capital T end, you've got Capital T end, you've got two different initial value problems to look at. On one end, you've just got one real parameter which controls the solution, and two other real parameters at the other end, which control the initial value problem from that end. And so the idea behind trying to find new, hopefully new gradient-shrinking reaches solitons would be to vary this one parameter at this end, evolve until some specified point, and then. Specified point and then do the same thing for the other two. And what you're going to ask is that this data smoothly lines up in the middle. So, roughly speaking, this is a problem of trying to find when a curve associated to this one real parameter intersects with a surface, which is controlled by these two real parameters here. So, this numerically, this is what this actually looks like here. So, these are four different So these are four different views of the same picture. So this red curve is what I suggested before, that curve determined by the one parameter, and the surface is the one governed by two parameters. Now, there are two interesting things to remark about this. One, there is actually an obvious intersection. So on the bottom right, it's around here, and on the top left, it's around here. Here, and on the top left, it's around here. This shouldn't be a surprise because this is exactly the round Einstein metric that everyone's well familiar with. It turns out that this round Einstein metric is invariant under the SO3 times SO2 action. But there's something also interesting going on here. And this is like an accumulation of points. How do we see this? Well, maybe on the top right, this is. On the top right, this is this accumulation here. Bottom right, it's this accumulation around here. So it seems that there is a sequence of almost intersections with unbounded Riemann curvature. Now, maybe promising that, you know, maybe we can look around here for new Ricci solitons. It turns out that there are no new Ricci solitons here. And the reason is through lots of painful And the reason is through lots of painful phase plane analysis, one can show that if there were to be, if there were to be a new Ricci soliton here, it would have to have non-negative Riemann curvature. And it's a result that goes all the way back to Hamilton that says that any Ricci soliton on a four manifold with positive Riemann curvature has to be the round sphere. So in the end, it turns out that there aren't any new ones to be found, at least not here. Be found, at least not here. But moreover, we can get this compactness result that I was after in much more specificity. I can actually bound the Riemann curvature of possible invariant solitons on this four sphere. Moreover, I have been spending a lot of time trying to find this constant explicitly. At the moment, the number is sitting around 10 to the power of 2000. That is a lot. Thousand. That is a large number, which I do not want. But in principle, if I could lower that number and also get a powerful enough computer to deal with numbers that big, I could prove what I suspect is true, namely that the round sphere is the only SO3 times SO2 invariant solison on the four-sphere. So I'm very confident that this is true. But just to wrap up, I want to bring your attention back to I want to bring your attention back to this sequence of almost Ricci solitons. It was suggested to me that this could possibly be indicative of a new ancient solution to the Ricci flow. What this new solution would look like would be a compact interpolation of the three-dimensional Bryant soliton times the circle, interpolating between that soliton and the 2D Gaussian shrinker. The 2D Gaussian shrinker times the 2-sphere. Now, I thought, great, new ancient solution, but of course, it's not that simple. Constructing new ancient solutions is very difficult in general, and it seems that most of the available results in this area concern classifying ancient solutions rather than producing new ones. In Perelman's Ricci Flow with Surgery paper, there was about a half a page where he constructed Was about a half a page where he constructed a new ancient solution. Of course, that became much larger when it was written up in textbooks. But in general, this is a difficult problem. And I'd be very interested to see if this is in fact a new ancient solution or if it's just something else. All right, I'll leave it there. Thanks very much for your attention. Thank you. Can we please thank the speaker? Excellent talk. Are there any questions?
