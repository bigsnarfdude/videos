Of three-dimensional mean convex domains with non-negative rich curvature. This is a joint work with Bo Ju. He is a PhD student in the University of Minnesota. Here is outline. We will start from the question and then state our result. After that, we will give a comparison between the mean convex domains and the manifold with positive scale curvature. And finally, we will sketch the idea of our proof. So here is a question raised by Professor Gurmoff. Say that if X is a mean convex domain with bounded uh uh positive mean convention bound, and then there exists a map from X to itself such that the image has dimension n minus 2. And for each point, the distance between the point and the image is bounded by a constant. And he also expected that the constant, the optimal constant is equal to The optimal constant is equal to 1. So here is a picture that is, here we just consider n equals 3, and then it is a mean convex domain, and then the contribution says that there exists a one-dimensional skeleton, and the manifold can be classed to the one-dimensional things, and each fiber has a diameter bump. So that's that's the conjecture. And uh here uh Here, Gormov raised this question because he wants to study the words width for manifolds, like the mean convex domains. So here, the words width is defined for any manifold or just metric spaces. So here if you have a number D and a k-dimensional polyhedral space and a map from M to the K-dimensional polyhedral space such that the pullback of the dimensional space is the space. such that the pullback of the diameter is bounded. Then we will say the Warren's width is bounded by D. And the optimal bound for uh of the uh the optimal bound will be defined as the Warrenson width, K width. K is the dimension of the polyhedral space. So you can consider the P n minus 2 that is the n minus 2 dimensional organism winds. So the Gromov's question says that if you have a minim If you have a mean convex domain in the Euclidean space, then the n minus 2-dimensional orange width is bounded by a constant. And here, of course, the definition of the Orange width does not require the it can be general for the hedge pK. But in the Gromor's question, he requires that the map is from X. And from x to itself. So there's a little bit different. Because Gurmouth wants to use the mean coach flow to study this kind of problem. So ideally, one can consider kind of mean coach flow and the flow will collapse x to the one-dimensional skeleton, for example. We consider n equals 3. And generally, this would be very difficult if you consider the mean coefficient flow because when you consider Flow because when you consider just the classical regular flow, then it would be very difficult to make the X collapse to the low-dimensional things at the same time. But when you consider the weak flow, after the first singularity, how to keep the low-dimensional things, it is also very difficult. So generally, this kind of thing is much more difficult than the question itself, I think. I think. So we are not going to use the flow to prove the bound. So we'll just give a proof of the orange winds directly for three-dimensional mean convex domains. So here we consider M, that is a three-dimensional mean convex domain in the manifold with non-negative rich curvature. And of course it is mean convex. And then the words width is bounded by a constant. So here the yeah. So here the yeah sorry so here M can be non-compact. So this is one of the difficulties. And another thing is that if M is a mean convex domain in the Euclidean space, then we will have a better upper bound. And generally we can consider a manifold that has non-negative rich curvature. So yeah and another thing is And another thing is that here the rich curvature non-negative is also sharp here because we can have an example that has zero scalar curvature. So if you want to consider this question for non-negative scalar curvature, it is impossible. So here you can consider the metric on the outside ball with radius 3 and it is a conformal metric and then as j up sorry as x goes to infinity this metric To infinity, this metric will have the end of this manifold with this metric will have end that is quite close to the Euclidean space. And for the three-dimensional Euclidean space, the one-dimensional World Width is unbounded. It is infinity. So this metric does not have a Williamson one-width bound. But we know that this metric will have scalar curvature equals zero, right? And all And also, here we have the boundary. The boundary is actually convex, not only the mean convex. And so the only thing is that the scalar curvature is equal to zero, and then the wind can be infinity. And another thing is that here the M cannot be empty, because when you consider the three-dimensional, yeah, if you just consider three-dimensional Euclidean space, then the word with is unbounded. And the rich curvature is equal to zero. Uh and the rich curvature is equal to zero and no boundary. And uh so here we have the contradiction that so sorry we have the constriction uh sorry we have the restriction that the boundary of M cannot be empty. And uh now we will give a comparison between the mean convex domains and the uh manifold with positive scale curvature. So here uh if you have uh have the scale curve positive scale curvature there is a famous conjecture there is a famous conjecture say that there exists a map from M to M minus two dimensional things such that the diameter the pullback of the diameter is bound and also the pullback of the area is bound. So here P has dimension n minus 2 so the pullback will be a surface will be surfaces and then you can consider the area and the diameter. So actually it says that roughly speaking the n minus sorry sorry n dimensional mean convex n-dimensional things with positive scalar curvature is actually m minus two-dimensional things with some bounded fiber. So that's the description of the positive scalar curvature. And this conjecture is widely open even for the three-dimensional things it is we only have partial results. So for three-dimensional case if For three-dimensional case, if M is simply connected, Group and Lawson proved that there exists such a map such that the pullback will have the diameter bound. So here they use the simply connected because they will consider the closed curve and the curve will bound a surface and they require that each closed curve will bound a surface. So they need the assumption that M should be simply connected. And another thing is there is a there is a result given by Markers and Navis so that if the manifold is a three-dimensional manifold with positive rich curvature and the scalar curvature is larger than or equal to for example 6 and then they obtain the optimal area bound that is the they construct a map from m to an interval and the pullback of the image sorry for The pullback will have the area bound 4Ï€ and the also use the Richie flow to get the rigidity for the optimal area bound. And recently, Nikomovich and Maximo considered this question for the closed three-dimensional manifolds. So it is solved for the closed three-dimensional manifolds. Actually, they can get more because they construct a map from M to one-dimensional things so that the poop things so that the pullback will have the diameter bound, also the area bound. At the same time, the GNC is bounded by 13. So it is true for three-dimensional closed manifold. And for others, it is only have partial results. And there are also some related results given by this. For example, in Jin Tianzhu and Chodu Shri and Gromov's paper, in some steps, the steps they construct the sphere outside a large ball and such a sphere has a diameter bound and also the area bond. So it is related results but not the answer to this kind of question. Here, Gourmoof considers the yeah Gurmouth says that the people always use the mean convex domains to consider the manifold with positive scalar curvature manifold. Positive scalar curvature manifold. But recently, there are more results for manifold with positive scalar curvature. So we can come back to consider the mean convex domains in the light of the scalar curvature. So this is the idea, and this is the original conjecture. Then Gromov considers the mean convex domains and then raises the first conjecture. And for each result, here you can consider the mean convex. Here you can consider the mean convex version. So that's the background of this result and this question. And we say that the positive scale curvature and the mean convex domains are quite similar, but there are special difficulties here. For example, when you consider the positive scale curvature, you can always for example if you have a closed manifold with positive scalar curvature, you can With positive scalar pressure, you can consider the bumpy metric. Then, by perturbing the metric slightly, every minimal surface will be non-degenerate. And then you can also have the scale curvature lower bound that is 6 minus epsilon. And these two lower bounds will be no difference because uh it is just a scaling. And if you don't want to get the optimal constant or the rigidity, so they are the same. The rigidity, so they are the same, right? But the things will be totally different here because when you consider the Euclidean space mean convex domain, or the mean convex domain is a manifold with non-negative reach curvature, if you perturb the metric, then you can only have the reach curvature larger than or equal to negative epsilon. So it is not the non-negative reach curvature anymore. And things will be totally different because we know that if you have the non-negative reach curvature, If you have the non-negative rich curvature, then if you consider a free boundary minimal surface with index less than or equal to 1, you will have the boundary, you can control the length of the boundary. But when you consider the rich curvature larger than or equal to negative epsilon, you can get nothing because then you will have the area term. For the non-negative rich curvature, you can you just drop off it, but then you you will have the area term and the we don't have any control to the area. We don't have any control to the area. There is no way to constrain your deformation so that the rate you will remain? I don't think that we have this kind of perturbing, so yeah. So things would be much more difficult. So here we cannot perturb the metric anymore. We cannot use the boundary metric theorem. This is one of the difficulties. And now we will give And now we will give some observation and sketch the idea of the proof. So we'll start from the Schumio's trick that if you have a three-dimensional manifold and if you have a positive scalar curvature lower bound and sigma is a stable minimum surface with boundary and then you can actually have the diameter radius boundary that is for each x in the interior of sigma the distance Sigma, the distance between x and the boundary of sigma is bounded by a constant. And for this kind of question, you have a lot of generalization. And here there is a kind of trivial generalization here. That is, if you consider the non-negative scalar curvature and consider the stable constant mean curvature surface, and then you will have the radius band. Because when you consider the Jacobi operation, Because when you consider the Jacobi operator, uh you can have this kind of form that is La plus plus one over two times the quantity of A square plus H square plus R square and then minus the Gauss curvature of sigma. And then the quantity in the red rectangle will play the role in Junior's trick. So the lower bound of this will have the same contribution. For example, in Shunya's trick, R is larger than or equal to 6, then this thing would be larger than or equal to 3. Would be larger than or equal to 3, and then you can play showing us trick. And the trivial generalization says that if you have the R it is larger than or equal to 0, and if you have the stable constant minker surface, and then you can also have a positive lower bound. And you can play Shunya's trick to have the distance upper bound for the radius bound for this kind of surface. And this is well known and trivial. Trivial. And we will use this to give our first observation: that is, if you consider the manifold, it is a mean-convex domain of the non-negative rich curvature manifold, and the boundary is now empty. And if you consider the sigma, that is embedded surface, not the minimal surface, or stable minimal surface, or the CMC surface. It is just the embedded surface, and the mean curvich is bounded pointwise from 1. And here you can also consider the mean curve. And uh here you can also consider the mean current bounded by less than or equal to one, but you you need to re require that the sigma does not touch the boundary. So here we just write the h is strictly less than one, and that is enough for us because we are considering the minimal case. And then in this case we can actually have that the distance from x to the boundary is bounded by 4 pi over 3 plus 2. Here we have the distance that's in the ambient many bot. In the ambient manipulator. This is different from the previous results. So we can sketch the idea here that is, if you have the mean convex boundary and if you have a sigma that has a point inside sigma and the p has a large distance from the boundary of sigma. So we can prove by contradiction. And in this case, we have And in this case, we can find a large ball and inside the ball, we don't have the boundary of sigma. And then we can consider the domain between the sigma and the boundary of n. And for this kind of domain, the domain will have three boundaries. The boundary inside the ball and the sigma and also the boundary on the boundary of the ball. And we only count the boundary inside. And we only count the boundary inside the ball that is different from sigma. So now we will consider the weighted area function now. The critical point to this area function now is CMC surface, which has been used by Xinjiou and John Zen Zhu to construct the CMC hype surface by min-max theory. And here we just use the minimizing of this functional. Then we will produce a constant mean curvature surface and it is also stable. curvature surface and it is also stable. And for this surface actually you can prove that there exists a point that is quite close to P and yeah it is a stable CMC surface and then we will have the distance upper bound for the gamma. So the boundary of gamma will have the large will have the small distance to P prime. It is from the generalization here. From the generalization here. But we know that the boundary of gamma can only be part of the boundary of the ball. So it is far away from P prime because it is far away from P. And P prime and P are quite close. So actually, we cannot have the boundary. So actually, gamma is closed from the diameter bound here. So once you have gamma that is closed, then you are That is closed, then you will have a closed, stable CMC surface in the manifold with non-negative rich curvature. This is impossible. So, actually, we don't have this kind of ball. So, for each point P inside the sigma, you will have the distance of a bar. So, here when you consider the mean curvature is used to use sigma and the boundary of M as a And we bound it of M as a barrier in this minimizing problem. So here we have the mean curvature bar, yeah, and then we can have the distance bound. And then we can use this to have some correlates. For example, if you have a sigma that is embedded surface and the mean curvature is bounded, then if sigma is a partial, sorry, if the boundary of sigma is a partial, sorry, if the boundary of sigma is bounded, then sigma would be bounded because the distance from x to the boundary would be would be bounded. And this would be used for minimal surface, the two-sided free boundary minimal surface with index less than or equal to one, then the boundary of sigma will be bounded. This has been proved by Ambrezo, Bozano, Carloso, and Sharp. And then use our result, the diameter of sigma will be bounded. And I think our lemma here will play the same role in the mean convex domains with showing also results in the positive scale curvature. So actually, yeah, we'll use this many times. Yeah, once you have this, you can play Goromov and the Lawson's trick because Goromov and the Lawson's paper, they use the two parts. One is their trick to const uh consider the To consider the distance, and another is to use the Shung-You's result. Once we have this kind of corresponding result, we can use the Gromov and Lawson's trick to consider the Warrenson-Wenwins. So, in Gromov and Lawson's paper, they require that each curve will above the surface. That is very important. And generally, it is not true. So, in Gromo in recommendation and maximum. In Likomovich and Maximo's paper, they decompose the manifold into small pieces and in each domain, each curve will bound the surface, and then they can use Gourmoff and Lawson's argument to bound the origin one width. And here we also use this idea to cut the manifold into small pieces and each piece, each closed curve will bound the surface. But here the difference is that we cannot use the boundary metric, so we make Bound metrical, so we may have uncountably many stable freeboarding remote surfaces. But we will have a special order and we can choose the freebonding remote surface carefully and actually we can also cut off it. And then if you so the things is that if you cut along the stable once, once there is a curve inside some domain that does not bound a surface That does not bound a surface, then actually you can use the minimizing problem to consider the duality of the curve that will produce a minimizing surface. And then this seems that have the contradiction. But the things will be more difficult if the manifold, for example, you will have a curve that the associated minimal surface will be Minimal surface will be one-sided. Then you cannot cut it. So we can only cut along the two-sided stable free bonded minimal surface. So sometimes after that, you will have a curve and the curve will have the duality and the duality will have the minimizing surface. The minimizing surface will be one-sided and it is stable, but we have no control to this kind of one-sided stable free-body minimal surface. So in this case, So in this case, we will use the min-max theory to construct a two-sided index, one free boundary minimal surface. And then such a two-sided surface will actually destroy the gamma. And then each closed curve will bound a surface. So this is the most difficult part. And in this lemma, we will use, actually in some steps, we will use level set flow. So here is a So here is the idea. So actually this domain can be non-compact. We don't have the general theory for to use the min-max theory to the non-compact manifold. So here we can only consider a sequence of compact domain that exhausts the n. And then we can also want to find a area minimizing surface that intersects gamma with algebraic intersection. The gamma with algebraic intersection number one. But the new boundary will not be mean-convex. So we need to perturb the new boundary so that the new boundary can be the barrier of the minimizing problem. But when you perturb it, you will have some part that has rich curvature larger than or equal to negative epsilon. So then you can have no control of the stable minimal surface or the index one minimal surface. That would be uh very That would be very so for this kind of case, we need to be very careful. And then once we still have the gamma that does not bound the surface, and then you can now with the new metric you can find a minimizing surface that can only be one-sided, and also the double cover of the sigma g would be unstable. Otherwise, we can cut it. So we have an unstable double cover and then we can perturb it slightly to produce a free boundary mean convex surface. And then from the mean convex surface we can use the level set flow to generate a domain. Yeah, actually you can use the level set of flow for free boundary inconvex surface. And you have a domain and the domain where you have the boundary Domain, we have the boundary. Each boundary would be stable for boundary minimal surface, or one-sided stable for boundary minimal surface that has stable double cover. This has been proved by Edeland, Hashofer, and Iwaki and Jonathan Ju. They generalize the results for closed case by Brown White. So the new boundary will be stable free boundary minimal hub surface, but the new boundary, we don't have any control to the We don't have any control to them because the new boundary may touch the perturbed area. And we don't have the non-negative reach curvature. But we know that the new boundary will have the area bound. That's the key point. If they are stable and they have the area bound, then we take the limit, then the new boundary will go to infinity. This means that when take the limit, the the the new domain produced by the level set flow will approach the original domain. The original domain. So, this is very important, and then we can apply the min-max theory to the new domain. And then we can produce actually, you can prove that the min-max minimal surface would be index one free boundary minimal surface, and the area is bounded. We don't have the diameter bound because the new minimal surface can touch the perturbed area. But we know that the new minimal surface will destroy the gamma, so it can. Destroy the gamma, so it cannot go to infinity as j goes to infinity. So, actually, when you take the limit, the new min-max minimal surface will converge to a compact minimal surface. So, actually, for large j, the min-max-minimal surface in tilde nj is also a minimal surface in n. And that's the desired index wide free boundary minimal surface. And we will cut it, cut along it and to Uh, cut align it and to uh play grow move and loss and trick. And finally, we can get the one soon response. So uh I'll stop here. Thank you. Thanks, Tad. Are there questions for first questions from the online audience? Questions from the imparted audience? So could you compare with this proof by Jevgen Ilikomrovich and David Maximo? So your proof is quite different than their proof, right? Uh yeah, their proof they they want to have the diameter bound and also the area bond and uh i i in their case i they are closed and they In the other case, they are closed and they can have the bumpy metric. And they only have finitely many stable minimal surface. And here we have a non-compact domain, and then we need to choose it carefully. And generally, I don't think it's easy to get the error bound here. I think the main difficulty was that you can't perturb the metric anymore. Right. Right. Okay, other questions? Okay, if not, let's thank Shichao again. Then we continue in a few minutes with Luban.
