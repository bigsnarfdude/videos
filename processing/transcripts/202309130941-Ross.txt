Triggered and thinking about these kinds of questions. And this is this is this is my kid. This is my kid Elliot. He plays baseball. And he is, I like to think of him as a meat robot. That's a very maternal way to think about your child. But that's basically what he is. He's a meat robot. And inside, so he's a machine. He's a machine made of meat. And inside of him are other machines, right, that are also made of meat. He doesn't have to think about these machines. Made of meat. He doesn't have to think about these machines. These machines just work. And then inside of those machines are these machines, the cell machines. We've been hearing a lot about the cell machines. And all of these things are coordinated automatically. And I think physics is the reason. I think that physics and cataphysics is the reason. But what's really cool about this is that these machines are built from other machines and so on and so on, all the way down. On and so on, all the way down. It swirls all the way down. Even this two-million dimer, which we've been hearing about, is a machine. And it has a lot of hallmarks of things that I think are really important in biology. It has broken symmetries. You can see it's already a dimer, right? It already has a length that's different than its width, right? It has broken symmetries in how it's decorated with its electrostatic and its hydrophobic patches. And all of that is, you know, uses this. But actually, I should say, I just want to remind everybody that. I just want to remind everybody that the formation is entropically driven, not energetically driven. The energy is used to destroy it. Okay, but that's just for fun. See, it's just to say, so there's entropy and energy scalting that's going on that's getting you all of these things. And this is how we build. This is not how we engineer. We don't know how to engineer this way. And so I think a lot of the stuff that a lot of the questions I'm interested in is: how do we learn from biology? How do we learn new physics from biology? Right? Because we don't understand. We don't understand how to create these things at this level and how to then get them to hierarchically manufacture themselves. Right? If we can figure that out, we're going to have a lot of very cool materials in the future. All right, I'm going to start with a quiz. How many of you have seen this quiz already? Yeah, okay. My collaborators, surprise, they've seen this already. Okay, so we're going to start with a quiz. I'm showing you four movies, and we're going to do, we're going to, we're going to see how good, you know, professor physicists are at this time. Or physicists are at this point. You're confident you can put it in front of your chest so that nobody else can see it. Okay, let's see the first one. Is this a movie from a live cell or a reconstituted system? Very confident. Okay, middle, this is one movie. Okay, middle, this is one movie, red, green, red, green, overlay, lifestyle or reconstituted. Okay, all right, let me do these last two together: lifestyle or reconstituted. Okay, lots of you, okay, you know what? You guys did really good. This is a self-reflective test that you do weight liking for yourself. All right, so in our lab, we've been studying a lot of different things, and since moving to Syracuse, we've moved even more. Movie, the Syracuse. We've moved even more into active matter, talking about active bass. But we've been studying for a long time microtubule self-organization with Ray and Mo and other people. We've been studying microtubule active networks. I started, as many of you remember me, when I was a postdoc and then was doing interstellar transport. There are still people who only know me for working on diamine. I haven't worked on dyne in like 16 years, but that's okay. We have been working on microtubule severing enzymes, which are a very cool way to control microtubules. Which are a very cool way to control microtubules. And then recently, we've been working on this idea of enzymes as active matter, creating designer active matter with enzymes. And then, of course, as everybody else, we have also gotten into liquid-liquid phase separation. And I'm going to tell you a story today that overlaps between microtubule self-organization and liquid-liquid phase separation. And which is a paper that most of what I'm telling you about just got published, but there was no, when I put in. There was no when I put in my title, it wasn't published, and I didn't have any gleam that it would get published at all. So that's it. All right, so these systems that we've been looking at are all bio-inspired. You realize, unlike most people, that these two systems here are actually a minimal reconstituted system of microtubules, cross-linkers, and kinesin. But what's really cool is they're kind of recreating some of the things that you actually see in a real cell with only three things, right? They're only microtubules, kinesin, motors, and quartz. Only microtubules, kinesin motors, and cross-linkers causing that activity to happen. This is from a paper that we published a long time ago with an undergraduate first author. If you're interested in looking at these pictures more, the majority of that paper is not authors. It was just this very cool thing that we saw that we were able to recreate a couple of times. So, again, just a reminder: we are, I'm going to talk today about microtubules. These are the stiffest of the cytoskeletal filaments. They're like, I call them the bone. They're like, I call them the bones of the cell. I once got invited to a biomechanics conference where people were literally studying bones. And I was like, these are the bones of the cell. And everybody burst out laughing. I was like, that's not funny. That's for real. These are the bones of the cell, right? And unlike the bones in your body, they can grow and shrink, which is part of how they are used in the cell and control the dynamics of what's going on. The system that we're going to be looking at today uses a cross-linking protein, which is from the MAPSIX DeFi. Which is from the MAP65 PRC1 family. I like the name MAPS65 because it tells you what it is: microtubule-associated protein that's 65 kildones. That's exactly what it is. But PRC1 is what they call it when you have it in mammalian cells. They're very similar. They have some differences in their KB values and their on-off rates. And then this movie I'm showing you has kinesin. What's really cool is in this movie, the kinesin is not up into the system like it is in like Zwatermere systems, right? This is actually just. Your systems, right? This is actually just a gliding assay. So, all of the added energy that's coming in is just coming from the surface. It's not up into the network at all. And it's just giving it these pushes that's giving it, you know, this extra fluctuation. That you're seeing that are helping the organization to move around. The system I'm going to talk to you about first is actually a system that only uses the cross-linkers, so no motor proteins in this one. And this is work that was done by a student who was an undergrad. Work that was done by a student who was an undergrad in my lab, Bianca Adozi, with a grad student who just graduated last year. Oh, I should update that. He's not doing a postdoc at Yale anymore. He's at NYU now, working with Alexandra. But this system, so this paper was published in Soft Matter quite a while ago. But this is the first system that we started looking at. And so the idea here is that we are just going to add tubulent dimers together with a microtubule cross-linker. Together with a microtubule cross-linker and then just figure out, look at what happens, right? So, I like to call this discovery-driven research. But basically, it turns out you can discover lots of things if you just throw a bunch of stuff together in a very careful and controlled way and then let it evolve over time. And so, what's happening is we are, I'm kind of giving away the punchline here, which is that these microtubules are kind of bundling. But what's unique about these bundles is that they're finite-sized and they're tapered at the end. You can see them nuclear. At the end, which you can see them nucleating and growing here. Just a few experimental, like for those our core experimentalists in here, just parameters. The surface coating is a pleuronic F127 black copolymer. So you have a cyanized glass, and the black copolymer is binding down like staples and making a polymer brush on the surface. There are some nerve polymers in solution, okay, or methacellulose to be exact. Because when we started this, we were using turf and we wanted everything to go into the surface. We can do it with spinning this too. We can do it with spinning those two. This one is being imaged with turf microscopy. The amount of tubulin is 13.2 micromolar. We are using one and we're calling, we use the amount of map we use as a binding ratio. So out of every 100 tubulin dimers, one and a half of them have something bound to it. So it's not very much, actually, of the cross-linker. And we're taking these movies at one minute piece between the frames. And the scale bar you're seeing there. The frames and the scale bar you're seeing there is 10 microns. So, so this the whole system though again is just grown together and then incubated at 37 to grow. Oh, I should say one other important thing. We're using GMP-CBP for this instead of GTP because we want the microtubules to actually control their size. Inside of a cell, there are motor proteins that can control their size, but we can't do that in this system. So, what happens is all the tubulin nucleotine grows and they fix, they only grow to a finite size and they don't fall. They only grow to a finite size and they don't fall apart. Okay, we actually did in this paper a whole phase diagram where we change both the concentration of the tubulin, so we increase the concentration of the tubulin, and we increase the amount of cross-linker. And you can get these different patterns out at low or no cross-linker. You just get a kind of pattern where locally they'll kind of bundle because we do have those, we do have crowding agents in there, and so that'll you'll get kind of local. Not you'll get kind of local bundles, but actually, all of these are very longer-scale bundles of these microtubules. And then, as you increase the amount of cross-linger, they condense and again into these finite-sized bundles that are tapered at the ends, which is one of the striking things. The other thing I'm listing here, along with the concentration, is the length of the microtubules. So, when you grow microtubules in the presence of GMP-CBP, every microtubule that nucleates grows and it comes Nucleates grows and it becomes a full microtubule of some length. The more tubulin you have, the faster the nucleation, which gives you more microtubules that are shorter. So this is kind of something that it's weird about the system, but because we're stabilizing it, it's like in Little League. Everyone's a winner, just like Mike did. Everybody gets a trophy. All these microtubules are winners. None of them fall apart so that there's free dimers to allow the actual winners to grow and grow. They just all grow. Okay, and then they all grow to Okay, and then they all grow to some short length. Okay. What's weird about these systems, and it's different than what we see. Oh, question? Yeah. On those, so there's a big drop between 3% and 10% of these in the oil concentration. And that one, like, 3%, 6 micron oil looks very different from everything else. Do you know why that is and what happened? Do you know what happens between 3% and 10%? Do you ever see that kind of clustering when you have higher appetite to a lot of people? Yeah, so we, you're right, we didn't do like kind of five and in between here, partly because we had already done this one and we're like, oh, okay, we're able to condense into these at different concentrations. And because sometimes we would see these. What these look like are, and in fact, this actually will go into what I'm going to say next, which is that when two of these come together, they don't merge. So what's happening here is that they're forming these kind of short finite bundles. Kind of short finite bundles, but they're not merging into a larger bundle, they're just getting stuck. And so it's like they're cross-linking locally there, but they're not condensing further. So they are not like how we heard yesterday from Jean-Bois about how cells are liquids. These are not liquids. That's what I'm going to show you next. And so, and part of it, I think, is because of the cross-linker and the way that the cross-linker binds. But so, if you do fluorescence recovery after fluorescence, But so, if you do fluorescence recovery after photo bleaching, which is the way that you can look for turnover of your molecules, you see that the microtubules don't turn over, but the cross-linker does. So, the cross-linker is very labile, but there's enough of it where it just holds the microtubules. And again, another example of how we do not engineer our system. So, we don't make our buildings where the mortar between the bricks is moving and changing, but the bricks themselves stay in place, right? That's what's happening here in this system. So, these are. Here in this system. So these are, despite the shape, which looks like a tactoid, a liquid crystal tactoid, and despite the fact that they are like kind of these, they're made out of mesogens that are longer than they are wide, like liquid crystals, they are not liquid. These are really, the microtubules themselves are stuck in place here. And so the follow-up papers have all been trying to get these systems to be more liquid because the spindle itself is fatter. It's a bipolar. These are not bipolar. These are not bipolar, they're homogeneous, right? So, meaning all of the mesogens point in the same direction, the poles are at infinity. Okay, right. So, my student, Suman, who's like awesome, was very excited about this and wanted to simulate it. So, there's this program, SeadSim. Are you familiar with Siddestone? All right, so it's like agent-based modeling, but it's already been pre-programmed with a bunch of stuff, so you just throw things in, and so experimentalists can use it. And so, my student was. And so my student was like, okay, what happens if we just put cross-linkers together with dimers and allow the dimers to nuclear? You can do all of this stuff inside of STEM. And here's what you get. Do you see tactoids? Are they finite size? No, and these were, these were, he programmed the cytosim to stop, like that they grow and stop at a certain size. But we don't ever see tactoids in this. Okay? Okay, so we were never ever able, like when we started like this, we're never able to get it. Yeah. So you have a fusion of the end of the microtubule? Yeah, because it's a cross-linkers. So the green are the cross-linkers. So wherever you're seeing green, it's binding and it can cross-link microtubules. The blue are the dimers that are free, and red are when once the dimers come into a microtubule, they turn right. Yeah. What happens if you change the concentration? What happens if you change the concentration of crossing for zero changes? Yeah, you still get this. So the it's it's not it so he tried all these different parameters inside of Sim and he wasn't able to get it. So what happens in science when we fail? Try it again. Try it again, and it's telling us something. Drink. Drink heavily. Which hopefully will inspire you to come up with a better solution for what's going on. Okay, so now, so one of the things that he did do was One of the things that he did do was he said, well, what if I just and I nucleate something where the microtubules are all kind of in the same spot and together? Oh, look, hey, you can get tactoids if you do that, right? So this is sometimes called multifarious or templated self-organization, right? So he basically just said, what if I put a little nucleating in the middle, like a little schmutch there, and it just nucleates off of it? And then he can get these. And so, but the thing is, is there's some, in this case, even, he's even symmetry broken. He's even symmetry broken. He's pre-aligned the microtubules. He's nucleated the microtubules with this. So if we set up the right initial conditions, we can get it to work. Okay, this is telling us something, right? Yeah? Does MAC65 biqual could be? It does seem to, yeah. Yeah. And I should remind you, it makes anti-parallel microtubules. Okay. So here's the answer: there is templated self-organization. There is templated self-organization because MAP65 can form droplets. We didn't know that until my student saw them one time and was like, Well, and then he started reading literature and he realized this was super hot. And so he decided to explore this. So his last paper, which just got published a few months ago or last month, is on this. So what he did is he took the MAP65. We have some that's GFP labeled, some small percent is doped in, or we can do it with 100%. In or we can do it with 100% unlabeled, and you can see that the MAP65 can form droplets. And that makes sense because there's an intrinsically disordered region, which is very common. And you also have this, you know, plus, minus, plus, minus, plus, minus charge distribution, which you often see in these systems when you get liquid-liquid phase separation. Okay. Now, nobody cares about this, right? Physicists know, we know, you put enough crowders into anything, you can get it to phase separate. Powders into anything you can get it to phase separate. Right? Pag and Dextran will phase separate. They don't, they're not special. There's nothing special about them. This one will phase separate without crowders. So first of all, none of this has any, this doesn't have, in fact, he started removing the crowders. Those first moviers I showed you, right, where we saw the nucleation growth, they had a little bit of crowder to keep everything on the surface. Completely removed that from the system, and we still get nice nucleation and growth. Critical concentration around 50 animals. Critical concentration around 50 nanomolar, which is getting to that physiological concentration. So we might get small ones. You can see that the size increases and the number of droplets increases with the amount. That's what you would expect. Oh, sorry, I didn't put it on here. If you add salt, you destroy this. I'm going to come back to that. So it doesn't like salt, so it's not induced by salt. Okay? And it's not, and it is, and it actually for the It actually, for the plant one, it doesn't, it likes cool. It will do this at four degrees C. Okay, so that makes sense. Plants are outside, so they have to be able to do things right at temperatures that are like this temperature. It'll do this at room temperature. If you heat it up too much, it'll destroy it. Okay, for the human one, it does this at 37. Okay, so he also did this with PRC1. He sees the same thing, the same effect with salt. The same effect with salt, and in that case, the heat is good for it. PRC1 likes it warm, mat from plants doesn't. You have to be more specific about what it means to add salt. What's the starting and ending island? Oh, yeah. So, we're doing this in our normal microtubule buffer. So, that's the other thing. Like, microtubules are this crappy PEM buffer, and it just has like 80 millimolar of pipes in it, and a little bit of divalent magnesium, like 2 millimolar. When we add salt, we're adding NaCl monovalent salt, and we're ACL monovalent salt, and we're adding it to, you know, he did a series, it's in the paper, he did a series with like 25, 50, 100, and you, you, it just starts, it looks like the opposite of this, right? Like you're like 25, he was like less, and 50 and that, and then they're gone. Yeah, after about 100, actually, yeah. Good question. Okay, so then, of course, like, how does this affect the organization, right? Like, add the tubula into it. Add the tubulin to it. So now what he's done is he's pre-made the droplets and now he's doped in the tubulin. This one, actually, again for the experimentalists, what we tried to do first is the thing you would expect, right? Make the droplets in an open chamber, right? Add the tubulin. That is terrible. It works. You get some, but then you get a bunch of droplets that don't have any tubulins because the tubulin is diffusing in and it gets sucked up by the first droplets it sees. So if you flip it around and have a bath of tubulin and then insert the droplets that Of tubulin and then insert the droplets that fall into the tubulin. Every single droplet will have this. Whereas if you try to do it the other way around, some droplets will have it and some won't because they're like not getting tubulin, right? Okay, so that was kind of peedy. I just add that in. We can do it where these droplets are in their liquid state, right? So, and then we add tubulin and GMP CVP, and we can grow these beautiful asters. These are Z-stacks that have been compressed into a single frame. So you actually have filament. So, you actually have filaments coming out at you. It's very three-dimensional. The droplets will also gel over time. If you leave them around for a couple of hours and you do fluorescence recovery after photo bleaching, they don't recover. Well, they do actually, but very minimally. It's very slow. It's still very viscous inside. But when you add the tubulin, in that case, you still get the asterisk form. There will be a higher concentration of the MAP65 in the middle. Of the MAT65 in the middle, but the esters will still form. And then if the droplets are very small, you get tactoids. And each one of these have finite sizes, basically bundles coming out of them, and they're tapered at the end, just like the individual tactoids are. If you add a droplet to a pre-mate microtubule, does it wet the surface? That's a good question. It will completely dissolve it. So basically, what we see here is that. What we see here is that, in fact, if you added a gel-ated droplet to a microtubule, it will eventually dissolve the gel and return the MAP65 back to solution. Yeah, that's yeah. So the gel case, do you basically make the goblets and then let them sit for like a day or something and then add them? Yeah. And is there like kind of a steady progression? Like that's it there too. I thought it would be too boring to take it out. So I can show you the data. So I can show you the data if you want to see. In these peptides, microtubules are going how from one pole to another or no, so in all of these pieces these microtubules should be relatively short because again we're using the MAP65. So I believe the length scale here is five microns, actually 10 microns. And so the microtubules in here, I believe, are six microns. So a full length one would be just over half of this. We don't know, I mean, I'd love to do EM on. We don't know. I mean, I'd love to do EM on these. I don't actually know what the structure is on the inside, right? Do you ever try this with cellulose? No, that's a good question. To see how the C-terminal tails might affect it in the charge of that. Yeah, I don't know the answer. Good question. There's some hints in other systems with the tails I think might include. Yeah. Question? Yeah. Maybe you already answered this, but then this is I already answered this, but in the small case, are these droplets like more spherical and then they become tactoids over time? They nucleate and grow microtubules that basically we okay, so here's our hypothesis. We think that basically, because these droplets form at four, we keep everything cold first, right? Every time you do microtubule experiments, you keep everything cold so you still dimers. Because microtubules are entropically driven, so the heat makes them form, right? Makes them form, right? It's not like actin where salt makes them form. It's the warmth that makes them form. And so we keep everything cold. Well, we didn't realize, but the MAP65 was already able to form small droplets at four degrees. Those small droplets, when the tubulin was added, would just suck up all the tubulin. So now you have this big pool. That's your templated growth. That's your multifarious templated growth. You've got a bunch of tubulin there, and now they start to grow. Tubule in there, and now they start to grow. Well, it's an antiparal cross-linker, so they're very quickly going to break symmetry. As they start growing in this little tiny confined area, they're going to very quickly break the symmetry and grow. When you have a much larger droplet, now you've got a bunch of ones manuclating, and they're each breaking symmetry locally, but they're big enough where they're not interacting with each other. Only in a small droplet will all the filaments that are starting to form from that droplet interact with each other and then form this parallel bundle. And it's finite. Bundle and it's finite because it's run out of tubulin. It's using the tubulin that's in the droplet to start and then it'll use up all the tubulin around it and then it's finite. Is Aster speech kind of protrusion as tactoid or it is it is doesn't it look like also that it is individual microtubules? No, they're definitely not individual microtubules. Be just uniform growth from the center, it could not look like disasters. Yeah. So it is more complex than infection. Yeah, yes. I think that's true. Yeah. Oh, climates. Okay. All right, so we did quantify this. So we purposely made, so at first when we saw this, we just noticed it, but then we purposely created using different amounts of MAP65, small drops, medium drops, and large drops, taking Z stacks and Taking Z stacks and very carefully counting all of the arms of the bundles, you can see that you now have small droplets, which are mostly just two, two arms, right? The tactoids. You get a few larger ones, but not very many. Medium droplets, more arms, and then the large droplets, more of the arms. And you can see that they scale as the droplet diameter squared, which is the radius squared. So that makes sense because they scale like the surface area. Like the surface area. So it's like you have enough surface area, you're going to get more arms nucleating out. Each arm takes up a certain amount of space. Okay, that still doesn't understand. Tell us why they're finite in diameter, which they are. They're finite. Why don't they keep going together? Why are they fine? So I think there's lots more to understand about this, but I think this is the mechanism for the creation of the tactoids themselves and the use things. Okay, so we tried to do, so here's the original. So here's the original movie with the broken symmetry, and then here's one where we just let them nucleate and grow locally. So this one was actually like purposely broken symmetry. And then this one, this is my student LS. So now you're getting multiple arms. Unfortunately, he forgot to turn off the length. So the micrometers are growing too long. They should be stopping, obviously. And he's doing a postdoc somewhere else. So it's very difficult for me to get him to come back into more, do more stimulation. Do more simulations. So, anybody who has been interested in doing more simulations with us, please love me. I think we know how it works. So, I told you this earlier, but I'm showing you again, if you increase the ionic strength, you reduce the number. So, oh, sorry, I was off by 100. So, even 100 here, you're seeing significantly reduced size of the droplets. And then at 300, there's very few droplets left. So, salt is destroying this phase transition. Drawing this phase transition. And one of my current students, Prashali, has been looking at the organization in the presence of salt. So this actually started as like an undergrad project, right, where we said, oh, we'll just give each student a different salt concentration to do. And then you can kind of create this giant project. So the microtubules you can see, they actually switch from tactoids to infinite bundles. So we can tell the difference between a finite tactoid. Between a finite tactoid and a very large-scale bundle. If you add more salt, well, this makes sense. We're now breaking up the ability to form the droplets to do the templated nucleation. So now all you're getting is nucleation and growth everywhere. You get the microtubules to stick together. They diffuse and stick together as bundles. And now it's much larger. And of course, if you go too high in the salt, you just get single filaments. You break all the ionic bonds or everything. We can see the same thing with PRC. PRC1, and we have a series of PRC1 constructs from Radica to Romanian where you can now change which parts are there. So if you get rid of this intrinsically disordered domain of PRC1, you get no droplets. So its intrinsically disordered domain is important for this. But this is going to allow us to test this model because now these different constructs have the different parts of the PRC1, which are the same parts that the MAP6U triad has. Parts of the maps C5 has. What we can see here is that the ones that can form droplets also form tactoids, and the ones that don't form bundles, right? And so this is all now starting to come together. We're trying to be very careful about this and actually figure out what the Kb value is for the binding constant basically for each one of these constructs and everything. And this is work that was being done by two undergrads. Herbert just graduated. Mia has graduated in 22, stayed with me for an extra year, and is now down at NC State in a PhD program. In a PhD program. This is also interesting because the idea of microtubule nucleation is obviously important for cells. In particular, in plants where MAP65 is found, they don't have traditional microtubule organizing centers. And so these condensates could serve as these organizing centers. And in fact, the MAP65 is important for helping to organize the microtubules both in the cell wall and during mitosis, the same way that PRC. Doing mitosis the same way that PRC1 is important for cell division in mammalian cells. And then finally, I just want to give a shout out to some work that another graduate student who's still working with me and still at UMass, so she's also working with Pat Westworth, is looking at, again, the same kinds of ideas, looking at PRC1, and now it's interactions with a kinesin that's important for cell division. And one of the things that we're seeing is that you knock down PRC1 and you significantly disrupt. PRC1 and you significantly disrupt not only the microtubule organization kind of during the end phases of mitosis, but also the location of this kinesin, which is really actually what's driving probably a lot of this organization. When you don't have the PRC1, you lose these anti-parallel overlapping microtubal bundles in anaphase. And so this paper just came out in MBOC just earlier this month. This month. And so I think that's all I have, and I hopefully I stayed on time. And I want to obviously thank the funding agencies and the students in my lab who actually do all of this science and make it happen. And thank you for listening. Keep asking about salt. Did you want to switch over to calcium instead of magnesium? Instead of magnesium. So you can't put calcium with microtubules because they won't form. But just for the drops, just really whatever. So, no, we didn't do any dilalin salts yet. That's a good idea. I just assumed that it would destroy everything much earlier, but that's not maybe not. But you have two millimeters of magnesium in the first place, but the drop-off is more, right? That's true. Yeah. What about Tau property? Because it also can underwrite trace direction. There will face separation. Only with crowding agents. So if it needs crowding agents to face separate. And so, but yeah, I mean, I think it would be, you know, I mean, I think it would be somewhat similar. I think the only difference is that... I have thought, maybe I'm wrong, that cow under glue phase separation benefit already on microtubules form a kind of liquid envelope on micro tube. So it might be something like that. Yeah, and there's other maps that people say are doing that as well. And yeah, I mean, it makes sense, right? If they bind together, if there's cooperative binding, if they have, they all do, right? Because they're all bundlers. Like tau is also a bundler, so it makes sense that it would bind to other tau molecules. So in that sense, and they're all intrinsically disordered, also. What is about this MAP65 variable biological tau? Yeah. Yeah. It's a plant cell map that organizes the microtubules in the cortex, which helps lay down the cell wall. So the microtubules are on the inside, actually treadmilling. So they grow on one end and they shrink on the other end. And they create, you know, kind of, they actually do active matter. You guys, they do active matter on the inside of a cell, like just like they were gliding, but it's not a gliding assay, it's a tremendous assay. And then they bump into each other and they align, and that alignment is what helps the alignment. And that alignment is what helps the alignment that's hooked through the cell wall into the cell membrane to create and lay down the cell wall, the cellulose on the outside. So it's kind of cool for real active matter inside of the glucose cell. And then also they're important for cell vision. Plant cells have this cool thing when they do cell vision. They don't have micruo organizing centers, and they don't, because they have a cell wall, right, they don't pinch the way that an animal cell pinches. Pinch the way that an animal cell pinches during telophase. Instead, what they do is they build membrane. So, this is a series of microtubules that come down from the top and the bottom from each of the daughter cells. And then kinesin motors come and translocate and bring vesicles, and those vesicles then fill in the membrane from the outside in. So, it's not a pinch, it's a build. They actually build the membrane, and that breaks off between the two cells. A very cool system. Very cool system. How specific so the the map droplets absorb the um absorb the tubulin and the micros go is how specific is that interaction? Like if you just would they would the droplets absorb like good markers in there? Is it very does it rely a lot on the actual interaction between the map and the tubulin or the disabled other stuff? I think it does because I think that the I think that it matters. I think that it matters that it's tubulent. We haven't tried adding other things. We haven't tried adding other things. Every time we've ever put three actin in with any droplet system, they immediately go into the droplets. So, and even things that we don't want them to interact, and they're just like in the droplets. So, it's possible that actin would go in just for some entropic reason that's not actually due to interactions. But the yeah, but the but yeah, and then maybe once it's at a high enough concentration above its critical concentration, I mean, that's the point, right? You've localized. I mean, that's the point, right? You've localized a lot of free tubulin into a small region. You've gone above the critical concentration, and now you can nucleate locally. It related to that, if you cripple the tubulin binding site that still allow them to make droplets, does anything happen? Yeah, so in our paper, again, I was short on time, so I cut it out, but in our paper, we actually just didn't add GMP-CBV, right? So we had two million dimers. Now, because it's not that it uses the GMP-CBV. The GMP CBP or the GTP to form, it's that you need that to create the proper confirmation so that you can form. You need to have something in that binding site, the E-site. And so you have, so anyways, if we just add the tubulin, but don't add any nucleotide, they go into the droplets. And if we can do FRAP and we see that the droplet and the tubulin actually turn over at a different rate. The tubulin actually turn over at different rates, presumably because of the interactions between them. But then when we make the microtubules and we do the frap again, if we started with liquid ones, everything's liquidy and it's fine, but the mat turns over now faster than the microtubule, just like we saw before. Microtubules are getting jammed and they're stuck. In fact, the microtubules at certain parts of the asters don't turn over at all. And now, but the MAP65 does, what's cool is if you start with the Does. What's cool is if you start with a gel-ated drop and you add the tubulin, free tubulin just goes like it can get into the middle too, but it's much slower because it's because of the viscoelasticity. So you get like a ring of tubulin on the outer edge, and you get the nucleation to come out from this ring. And that amount of tubulin should be high enough to actually nucleate and grow omega-tubules, and it is when you add nucleotide. And then that threat, the presence though, of that microtubules starts to basically decay. Now, the microtubule starts to basically decay and change the viscoelastic properties of the drop. So the drop goes from, you know, basically not recovering, being able to recover and frap, to being able to recover because now that MAPSOC5 has gotten loosened up by the fact that its binding partner is there. And that basically the tubulin will pull, like the microtubule will pull it out. So you can do simulations where the microtubules are pulling from the Where the microtubules are pulling from the same pool of tubuling? Yeah, that one where he didn't control the length? Yeah, I was just wondering if the mechanism imposes a constraint of each tubuling or each microtubuler individually, or if they're pulling from the same pool, they're depleting a store of dimers. Yeah, they're pulling from the same pool. I think the idea was that there was supposed to be a pool of cross-linkers, which would then have a pool of tubulin numbers, because there is an interaction. Of tubular nerves because there is an interaction between them and then allowing manipulation and growth to occur from there. So the idea of this one was you're supposed to set up a circle of cross-linkers with a lower concentration in the background. But I kept being like, we do this, change this, change that. I don't know how to use cytosome. Obviously, I just need to learn how to use cytosome. So I don't know who. So with these drop loads and the particular tactics, for example, what happens to those? What happens to the leftover at? Like, is it still a top level around the middle of the tactoid? Does it completely coat? It completely coats the microtubules. Actually, I don't think any, I can't imagine anybody in here said this to me as a reviewer, but I had a reviewer who basically was like, the MAP65 should not be on the microtubules that grow out. They wanted the microtubules to grow out of the condensate and then be bare. And I was like, that is unphysiological. I was like, that is unphysiological. If there's map 65 around and there's a microtubule, like if there's a map and there's a microtubule, that map should be on the microtubule, right? Like by definition, it has a high affinity for the microtubule, especially in this case where, you know, if they're, especially if they're anti-parallel cross-links, it's going to have a very high affinity for that. And there's going to be a high area of binding sites for it. And I could not convince this reviewer, and that's why we're not in KNAS, we're in KNAS, Texas system. Going back to this issue of size regulation, I remember work from like 15 years ago or so, from 100 years old, where they in act in with LFAP turn with triangular binding arrays where you have multi-process numbers, there's inherent strain in the system, and that actually limits how large it will grow. And the strain energy equals the binding energy you get back. I don't know if absence of five is Of absence 5 is too flexible, but that could be a very simple head to quickly. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. I don't think I understand it. Because what is this? I don't think I understand the Baucha system. It's fast enough. And so it's faster. Like long stocks flexibility. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I'd love I honestly I want to do the opposite. I want to s I want to loosen this up a little bit, although it would be cool to if we can control it in either direction. So are you talking about for the tactoids what's keeping it that size? Like or the size, the basically the cross-sectional areas. You always said it seems to be the same way. It does. It does seem to. So in Prashali stuff from a long time, actually. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Martin Learn's got some stuff about that. Do you think that it's probably like, I mean, it seems like it could be lots of things, right? You've got lots of microtubules. Maybe they're rotating, if they're tilted in any way, like as they're going around or something. You're going to get, you know, what is great gracing call it? Geometric frustration or whatever in the system. So that's the bounch thing. That's the bouch thing. Okay. Okay, Martin Lens. I'll look that up. So I just make one comment. I just take one time. It's very short. It's very short. Yeah. So, for you or for anyone else interested in using Cytosin, Francois wrote a really nice joke paper as part of my Cytospel tech collection that came out in April. It goes through the workflow of how to use Cytosin. The only reason why we can use it is because he will personally write back to you when you're having trouble. So Sumon has been in very close contact with him. Because he wanted to stop having to respond to everyone. He put together his joke paper. Together, this Joe paper. It's really nice to need to help. So we're relatively close to on time, so we'll try to start
