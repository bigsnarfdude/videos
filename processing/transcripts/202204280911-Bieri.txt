And what people have predicted mathematically, and we hope that this will be seen in the near future. So, this has been a really growing field of research. So, let me first celebrate, of course, LIGO, Virgo, and all our gravitational wave detectors. So we know, right, so the big breakthrough happened in 2015, where LIGO, for the first time, detected gravitational waves from a binary black hole mergers. And we have heard many interesting talks on waves. On waves and the data of these observations already. So, I would like to emphasize that I think this is really the beginning of something new, like the beginning when we looked, used telescopes to look at the sky, the beginning of now taking the pulse of the universe instead of electromagnetic waves. I think this is really the place where we need to more interact between math and physics and observation, because there's a lot of beautiful information stored in these equations. Stored in these equations, and we really need the geometry and let's say the Einstein equations to tell us what is in there. So, this is really a beautiful, I think, start of exploring the universe in collaboration. I couldn't resist. I also put in this nice picture of the event horizon telescope. So, we are somewhat getting closer to the riddles that black holes have in store for us. So, anyway, of course, the Einstein equations have been introduced. Let me maybe not. Equations have been introduced. Let me maybe not stay too long here, but just tell you that I will mainly focus on the Einstein vacuum equations, but because the effect I would like to talk about here, or the space-times I would like to talk about, and the effects that I found are manifest already in the Einstein vacuum. It's a really purely gravitational effect. But I can also add, let's say, neutrino radiation. So let's say if I want to model a large neutrino cloud. Model a large neutrino cloud, if you ask where do these things maybe occur out in space. So, most, let's say, binary, most studies so far for, for instance, when we look at the Anson equations, when we look at two black holes merging, so most studies of gravitational wave sources have been really devoted to binaries merging or maybe supernovae, etc. So, these are really compact objects and they have a certain decay behavior that basically. Behavior that basically is dominated by one over R. Now, you can ask: many of these black hole binaries or neutron star binaries are embedded in large neutrino clouds, or if you have, let's say, a source in a large neutrino cloud that extends over very, very long distances, you may not be able to just model that in the Einstein-Vacuum equations or something which is stationary outside of a compact set, but something which is much more extended. And that's the motivation for the The motivation for the type of space-times I'm going to introduce and show you here. So, maybe just a philosophical overview of what are my techniques that I'm using. So, I will look at asymptotically flat space-times, even though you can ask similar questions also then. How are things embedded in a cosmological space-time? But the nice thing, as we know, we have a nice way of reading off radiation at future null infinity for asymptotically flat space-times, which fall off. Flat space-times which fall off at a certain rate to Minkowski at infinity. So, I mean, I'm not doing metric perturbation, etc. I have a different, let's say, approach. So, what I really am interested in, I look at the initial value problem for the Einstein equations under certain, let's say, physical assumptions. And I take some open class of initial data and I want to produce some open class of solution space times. And I want to really look at what's the dynamic. I want to really look at what's the dynamics of those and so I solve the Einstein equations or at least get as much information out of that as possible. And then I want to extract from future null infinity the information. How does the geometry, the radiation field look like? So I want to read off then what's happening. And my main ingredient here will be the wow curvature. And our method is not depending on any gauge. So that's gauge invariant. So of course we So, of course, we appreciate gravitational waves. Let me just very briefly maybe set the stage for some of the notation I'm using. So, if you think here of the source, let's say two black holes, for instance, merging, which could be in a huge neutrino cloud, for instance, or any source. So, the source will go along its time-like curves. And of course, for a fraction of a second, typically send out gravitational waves, which go then along our null hypersurfaces. Our null hypersurfaces out to null infinity. And of course, at future null infinity, Scry plus, that's where we observe gravitational radiation. I mean, we're not really sitting at scry plus, but for all practical purposes, we can think that, of course, we're far away from the source that we can read off this information there. So, in terms of observations and memory, let me just briefly review a few things. Of course, when we look at LIGO, LIGO has three test masses. MIGO has three test masses, which are mirrors suspended by pendulums. So you can think here of three mirrors, and by laser interferometry, we measure the distances between these mirrors. And we have seen these beautiful pictures, right, of LIGO and Virgo when, let's say, gravitational wave packets travel through. So they will move. Well, they just show us the geodesics, right? So these are markers of the geodesic in space-time. They move for a fraction of a second. And we have seen these pictures and can. Seen these pictures and can read off already quite a lot of interesting information. Now, the next effect that has been predicted but not yet seen, and we hope that they will see it in the near future is memory. Now, these test masses here, just as in a simplified notation with M0, one, and two, so they will go through or they will observe a permanent change of a permanent displacement. So, they will move, but they will go back. So they will move, but they will go back to rest, but not at the place where they stayed, but this will be changed permanently. That's the memory effect, this permanent change that the wave leaves back when it travels through. So maybe to tell you a few things about the foliation of the foliations I'm using, just to tell you a little bit about my notation. So whatever my quantities, if my metric has a bar on top, that's the initial spatial metric on an initial space slide. On an initial space slice, k is going to be the second fundamental forum with respect to time when I embed my space log slice in the manifold. Phi is my lapse function here, and everything that has a bar on top is with respect to the space-like slice. So that's rich in the space-like slice. So I'm using here a maximal time foliation where the trace of k0. I can just write the equations for that. So I'm also using, let's say, two main volations. Also, using let's say two main foliations. One is the time function, which I don't further explain. And for the null hypersurfaces, you can think of u, that's going to be my u function. You can think of u as retarded time. So u is foliating with spacetime into outgoing null hypersurfaces. So here in this picture, we just have a schematic picture of incoming and outgoing null hypersurfaces. So when I mention some spheres or space manifolds which are diffeomorphic to spheres, so that's A diffeomorphic to spheres. So that's the intersection of a space-like slice with an outgoing null cone or null hypersurface. That's what I call STU. So, in terms of the frame that I'm going to introduce, so I use a null frame in the first place. So, L or E4 is going to denote outgoing null vector fields. L bar or E3 is going to be incoming null vector fields. So, I have GLL bar is equals to minus 2. Bar is equal to minus two. So here's just a schematic picture. When I'm sitting here on a local space-like surface, I can follow in the outgoing or the ingoing null directions. And I complement my vector fields here with the orthonormal field, which is tangential to the surface S, right? So tangential to surface S, and then I obtain my null frame. So that's what I'm mostly using in the next few minutes or in this talk. Or in this talk. So, with that, let me also introduce the notation for what we call the shears or what will be a news tensor later on. So, I look at the second fundamental forms with respect to the outgoing and incoming null directions. So, with respect to the outgoing, that's going to be my chi. With respect to the incoming, that's chi-bar. And if I take the traceless parts, these are the corresponding shears. So, shear outgoing is chi-hat, shear incoming, chi-bar hat. Um, the chi-bar hat was uh. The Kaibar hat is going to end up in my new standard in the end. So these scalars have typically nice limits at null infinity, and we can use them, of course, to talk about radiation. All right, so maybe I will, whenever we have space-times that decay like one over r, that we expect for mass, like black holes, et cetera, which are describe many of the sources that we study for gravitational waves. Study for gravitational waves. That's one thing. But here I would like to talk about more general space-times, which decay at the very slow rate. For that, let me cite in a very heuristic way one of my older theorems about Minkowski stability, the generalization of the Christo-Tulu-Kleinemann result. I'll give you the name, the formulas in the next slide, but let me just state very, very briefly. So, if you take asymptotically flat initial data and the asymptotic flatness is going to be described in the next slide. Described in the next slide, that for which the data, let's say the energies and some geometric components are small enough in weighted solar forms, we can prove, or I prove that there exists a global space-time that is asymptotically flat and obeys the Aston vacuum equations and also is causally geodesically complete. So, for that theorem, in order to ensure the existence, I had to assume, of course, smallness of the data. However, what Of the data. However, what shows up and what we can prove in a simple corollary is that now, what about large data? That's why I'm interested now in that. I want to talk about large data. So for large data, many of these, let's say, many of these theorems or decay properties towards infinity along null hypersurfaces are still valid. I mean, I have to explain what I mean by that, but some of these null outgoing null decay rates are... Outgoing null decay rates are independent of the smallness, so they say something when you plug in now large data. So, that's what I'm going to do now. So, here is what I call B or B space times in the future are space-times of the following type. So, the first two equations or formulas. So, we look at initial data of the type as in the upper half slide here, so which is asymptotically flat. Chibar and K are, of course, sufficiently smooth. Of course, sufficiently smooth. So they are the initial metric and second fundamental form. And now, as I go with r to infinity at space like infinity, I have a coordinate system where my metric looks like that. So the g bar ij is like delta ij plus some little o3 of r to the minus one half, and kij decays like r to the minus three halves. So to give you a comparison, the Christie-Duluk-Kleinemann result of Minkowski stability looked at space-times of the type six and seven below. So that's what we call strong. Low. So that's what we call strongly asymptotically flat, where the metric here has a leading part, which is one plus two m over r, m is the mass here, delta ij plus more derivatives here, and a decay of the remainder of r to the minus three halves, and the decay of r to the minus five half of the second fundamental form. So of course, when you have a one over r decay, so that's one thing, but as you see, I have a r to the minus one half, and the question is, what can we describe with this type of space-times and what will With this type of space-times, and what will be gravitational radiation or memory looking like? So, and it turns out that if you look at space-times of the Christopher Duber-Kleinemann type, or even more general, here are a few more initial data that I'm not going to talk about, but you can look at as well. So, for instance, in what I call A, so this will be asymptotic flatness where you have what I call here Mij. So, this is a term which is degreenous of homogeneous of degree minus one. So, for instance, Degree minus one. So, for instance, it could involve a non-isotropic mass term and some r to the minus one or a little bit more decay for the remainder. So, there's some recent, let's say, computations I've done for that that this kind of one can talk about as well. But anything that goes like one over r or better is one class for this talk. And everything that goes like one over r, but not quite one over r, but a little less, and down to r to the minus one half is the other side of this. Minus one half is the other side of this talk. So there's a threshold that one of R that where when you cross that, you open up a lot of new tools and a lot of new structures that are not there in memory or waves when you have a one over R decay. Okay, but I'm going to concentrate mainly on these decays, B and T, and let me maybe tell you a little bit more about what I mean by large data and what has been known. So we have the breakthrough result by Chris. A breakthrough result by Christitulo Klaneman of showing Minkowski stability in the beginning of the 90s. And I'm also talking about my generalization, which is the borderline case for the stability proofs that one can get in terms of decay. There have been many stability results so far, but I'm here interested in the borderline case, so I'm not going to discuss those. So there are the stability theorems, as I mentioned, and we have smallness assumptions in those theorems, but they really were needed to establish a global Really, we were needed to establish a global existence proof. So, if we plug in large data, so you can show by a small corollary, if you like, that still there exists a complete domain of dependence of, let's say, a complement of a sufficiently large compact subset in the initial hypersurface. So, with other words, we have a solution space-time where with this portion of future null infinity, which corresponds to all values of the retarded time u, which is not greater than a fixed constant. Than a fixed constant. So, with other words, for this portion of future null infinity, so this provides a very solid foundation to investigate the asymptotic behavior, gravitation, radiation, and also memory for these situations. So, that's what we are doing here. Okay, I also need to introduce a few more things. So, let me say one more thing. You may have asked, so what about energy defined for this kind of data? So, in the B space-times, like little O. the B space times like little o dk of r to the minus one half in the remainder we still have total finite energy and also linear momentum is well defined but the total ADM angle angular momentum is not defined so that diverges so what I called B star if I replace the little O of r to the minus one half in the remainder of the metric by a big o so that's for that we don't know anything so we that does not have yet um or still uh Or still finite energy, total energy. And there's no existence theorem known for this B star of space-times for which a development exists that could that includes a portion of future null infinity. So if you want to talk about those, so that's a bit more speculative, but we have some conjectures furnished with some supporting evidence. So that's a different question. So let me introduce here my decomposition of the wild tensor. I'm going to talk mainly now about Einstein-Matrix equation. Now, about the Einstein-Maxim situation and say a few more words about neutrinos at the end. So, if I now contract my wild tensor with the incoming direction twice, three is the incoming direction. A and B will be tangential to my local spheres, if you like, surfaces S, and four is the outgoing direction. So alpha bar is the leading order term that goes like one over R, beta bar, the next order, rho, sigma, beta, and alpha. But it's maybe easier to show you some of the results. Show you some of the results. So, if you look at the Christadelphi Kleinermann space-times, the D space-times here, so you get the decay behavior in the space-time manifold of this time. Let me explain briefly. So, here tau minus, by the way, is one plus u squared square root. So you can think of tau minus as being u. So, this alpha bar in the Christie Dulc-Kleinermann spacetime score is like one over r. If you are more familiar with Newman-Penrose, so that's the one over r part of. Pen row, so that's the one over r part of the wow curvature, and some u dk. The beta bar goes like one of r2, and then rho is what usually shows up in a mass aspect function that goes like one of r to the three. Then we have sigma, that's the magnet part, the dual, but the magnetic part of that, which has a little extra decay in u. And then the other alpha and beta go like r to the minus seven half. So in the, if you, in the Newman-Penrose picture, beta would have appealing like r to the minus four and alpha like r to the minus four. Minus four and alpha like r to the minus five, but you don't get that here. But the question, so this is a different discussion. I don't want to go into that right now. So now, of course, if you have a very, very slow decay, like what I call here the B situation, then you only get one over R and U decay for alpha bar, you get one over R squared for beta bar, and then everything else is swallowed in this R to the minus five halves. So I don't get the R to the minus three, for instance, for free. So now the question is, well, So now the question is: well, can we still extract information? And the answer is yes, there's a lot of information still hiding between these little arcs of minus five halves. And I want to show you some of these structures and how they affect gravitational radiation. Okay, so why does it happen? Because, I mean, it's kind of clear if you ask for a very slow decay of the data, there's only so much you can get out at null infinity, right? So, but there are still more structures that we can find underneath. We can find underneath. So, maybe a few more technical results. You don't need to remember all that, but just for the fun of it, the chi-hat is the shear with respect to the outgoing. That has only an r to the minus three half decay here. In any space-time that goes like one over r, it would be an r to the minus two decay. The chi-bar hat, so that's what makes up our news tensor later, is like one over r decay and some u decay. It's still integrable if you have the chi hat bar. If you have the chi hat bar squared, that's just integrable, then. So that's fine. Zeta is going to be the torsion, etc. All right, so maybe I'm not going to stay with that slide. Maybe just very briefly, so I'm going to work with the Blank equations. And just so what I want to say very briefly on the left-hand side here, when I have a slash, so this means I'm sitting locally on one of these surfaces STU. So this is the cover. So, this is the covariant derivative projected on this tangential to these surfaces S, like which are difforphic to spheres. So, I take a three-derivative here and project it down of the row. This is the electric part of the normal normal part of the electric part of the wild tensor, which shows up in the mass aspect function. So, I have some derivative on the left-hand side, of course, in the Bianch equation, which is related to some other curvature term, beta bar. Alpha bar is curvature, and then everything else. Curvature and then everything else, epsilon, zeta, are second fundamental form. Zeta is torsion, xi bar is another lower-order term here. And if you have stress-energy, then of course we have Ricci curvature showing up. So these are the two Bianca equations I will work with for the electric part of the Weil curvature and magnetic part of the Weil curvature I'll introduce in more detail in a moment. But so the Bianch equations will be what I will work. What I will work with. So, before I go there, so you may have noticed, right? So, this, let's say, the shear term, the chi-hat term, and also this r to the minus five have non-peeling curvature terms. They do not have limits at null infinity. So, that's a problem if you want to talk about radiation. But it's not a real problem because we can understand a bit more. So, let me explain here. This is an important slide, what is going on. So, it won't limit null infinity, even in this very Won't limits at null infinity, even in these very slow decaying space-times. So, I'm going to explain here at the example of chi-hab what happens. So, we look at, let's say, local at one of these surfaces, STU, and so I have, well, of course, well-behaved quantities on these surfaces. But now I'm sitting in a null hypersurface and take this out to null infinity. I have a constant u go out this long null hypersurface along. Null hypersurface along let time go to infinity. And so if I look at that, so I don't have, let's say, limits for many of these appreciated quantities, but the difference between two null hypersurfaces of corresponding values at corresponding time points is finite. So if I look, I'm sitting on such a sphere, if you like, let me call this SU inside one null hypersurface, I jump to a nearby null hypersurface. I jump to a nearby null hypersurface, let's say Cu0, and look at the value of this chi-hat, for instance, at Su0. So, this difference actually, when I go out to null infinity, this difference does tend to a limit. So, that's a good news. So, if I do that for chi-hat, so then I look at r squared times chi-hat, this is not going to take a limit because chi-hat, this became like r to the minus three halves. So, but now I do that, I take a value of the. That I take a value of this expression on one sphere on Cu and at the corresponding point at another sphere in the neighboring null hypersurface. So I take this out to null infinity and the difference has a finite limit, which is actually this object. So I take now the three derivatives. So the three derivatives is like also taking derivative with respect to u, if you like. So this is in the incoming three direction of chi hat. So I take the derivative of chi hat. So I take the derivative of chi-hat in that direction, and then I integrate from some finite u0 to u that I chose with respect to u prime. And this is the finite limit that I attain at null infinity when I do that. So that's good news because there's a lot of information there we can extract. Now, what I just showed you means also that the leading order portion of r to the minus three half in chi-hab is non-dynamical. So meaning it does not evolve with you. So, meaning it does not evolve with you. So, therefore, but the next order term we can reveal will be dynamical terms. I have to say more about that. And they tell us something about radiation, and we know something about attaining limits at null infinity. So, what I've showed you here for chi-hat is also true similarly for the curvature components, which are non-peeling in this situation. So, the leading order term, like this r to the minus five-half, decay, is non-dynamical, and so we don't. Dynamical, and so we don't have a limit at null infinity, but we take off these pieces, and then there are some dynamical terms and structures underneath. That's what we're going to do. Okay, here, maybe just very briefly. So from my older result, I know some of the behavior of, let's say, the leading order one over R curvature term, one over R squared. So I have limits of these at null infinity. And these limits, of course, depend on the angle on S2 and also on the U. On S2 and also on the U retarded time. So this will show up later. So we have some nice limits there. And maybe here, let me now turn to very briefly to the observational side before I go and show you all the detailed computations. What I want to tell you is about gravitational wave memory and I give you a very brief, maybe summary of what we know here. So of course, LIGO had this breakthrough in 2015 with the first detection of gravitational With the first detection of gravitational waves. And for that, Weiss, Thorne, and Barish got the Nobel Prize. And we hope to see many interesting more works and observations from all these observational facilities in the future. So here is, again, a schematic picture of what, let's say, the three test masses will do. They will, what I call here instantaneous displacements, that's what LIGO and Virgo have observed already. So for a have observed already. So for a fraction of a second, a wave packet comes through these LIGO or Virgo facility, and so they move, the geodesics move, so the test masses move. That's what we have seen already. But what is predicted, what I call here number two, is that there will be permanent displacements. So this is, of course, way too big, these arrows, but let's say you will have permanent displacements, like for instance here, one and two with respect to this arrangement. Pre- This arrangement pre-detection, so they will be permanently displaced. And actually, there are two types of memory. Well, there are many types of memory if you start digging deeper, but I would like to first introduce two types of memory. And this go back, these two types of memory, to the following three people. So, in 1974, Seldovich and Poljarev looked in a linearized version at this problem. And so, they find what we call nowadays. What we call nowadays ordinary memory. So, this was believed to be a small effect, and because it was in a linearized version, people call it linear, even though it has really nothing to do with linear and non-linear. So, then later on, Christadulo in 91, in the fully non-linear case, found another type of memory. And for a while, people thought that this is the linear and non-linear part of the same thing. But actually, Garfinkel and I showed that these are really two different sources. So they do the same thing, but these are two different types of memory. Different types of memory. Whereas the first, what we call ordinary memory, is due to a change of, this will be the row part or a curvature, an electric part of the curvature over time, if you want. So a change in that curvature part. So the null memory by Christodulo is really due to energy radiated away, which is based in the new stensor in the end. So these are two different effects. We call these ordinary and null. And null. And so there have been a lot of works. So here are some of the early works that people did in memory. And also, interesting enough, of course, now a lot of people are interested in memory analogs. And Abe Ashtikar was one of the people who early studied also infrared problems in quantum field theory, etc. So that's very interesting. And so here is a very incomplete list of people and works that have been done. People and works that have been done. I mean, there's a lot of work also by Bob Wald and Abiyanikar and many other people. And I'm not going to mention all of that. But so, in the Einstein case, if you add now other types of, let's say, electromagnetic fields or neutrinos, so with collaborators Yao and Chen and Garfinkel, we have shown that this adds to the memory effect, to the one that found by Christo Duru, the null memory. And with Garfinkel, we found a while ago that if we don't look at GR outside of GR, we have two. Outside of GR, we have two, let's say, analogs of these effects, even in electromagnetism, in Bureau Maxwell equations. So, test masses here observe a residual kick. So, there have been a lot of interest and a lot of beautiful works by many people. And I apologize if I don't cite everything, but I want to maybe keep the ball here on track by talking about what I'm interested in here in more general, let's say, space-times. Space-times. So let me introduce here another formula. So when I look at what I call here permanent displacement, that's a delta x. That's not a Laplace, just a delta. So now I'm thinking of, I want to measure this permanent displacement, right? I'm going to show you what this means from my point of view and then what it means in the detector. So in the detector, we have seen what it means. So this delta x is just this permanent displacement and at null infinity. So and what I call affinity. So and what I call here chi minus minus chi plus I'm introducing later. So these are corresponding limits of some derivatives of shears, etc., at null infinity. So if you were in a, let's say, space-time that decays like one over R, this is just, let's say, the shear, what I call chi-hat limits at null infinity. So there's a geometric object, and we're going to explore what's behind the right-hand side of this equation. So basically, the right-hand side tells me there's a geometric object I need to. Tells me there's a geometric object I need to understand, which is giving me basically the permanent displacement on the left-hand side. So, if you're in a space-time which decays like one over r in the metric, basically, so then the ordinary memory, which goes back to Solovich and Polnierev, is sourced by a component of the electric part of the wild tensor. The null memory, which goes back to Christodulo, is sourced to the energy per unit solid angle radiated to infinity. So, this includes also shear and if you adds for. Also, shear, and if you add stress-energy, then some stress-energy tensor that behaves accordingly will show up there. So, if you have a one-off RDK, that's a pretty at first-order kind of a simple picture. Of course, you can dig deeper, lower order than you have angular momentum, radiated way, and many other interesting things. So, but now I'm interested in more general space-times where I have a decay like r to the minus one half or between one half and one. So, then what happens, by the way, memory in terms. Memory in terms of one over R decay is electric, not magnetic. I'm going to explain that in a moment. But what happens if you have less decay, then suddenly magnetic memory shows up naturally in the Einstein vacuum equations. And also both the electric and the magnetic memory diverge at square root of retarded time. I also tell you what I mean by that. There's a lot of structures showing up suddenly when you cross that threshold. Maybe just to memorize what we mean by Maybe just to memorize what we mean by electric and memory and magnetic. So we know that in analogy to electromagnetism, we can also decompose our wild tensor into electric and magnetic parts. So here is how we do that. These the electric H geomagnetic part of the wild component. And if I want to, let's say, use the Jacobi equation to measure spatial separation of the geodesics in a LIBO experiment, then that would be 35. There's a wild curvature component from the electric part on the right-hand side. Electric part on the right-hand side, two derivatives here on the left. So I have to basically integrate twice to get the permanent change of the test masses. So in my notation, the normal, normal portion of the electric part of the bowel curvature is what I call rho. The normal normal component of the wild tensor, which is magnetic, I call sigma. So rho and sigma are the electric, respectively, magnetic parts in my notation. So as I said, So, as I said, if you have one over RTK, you have only electric parity memory. If you have there's no magnetic parity memory, but it only shows up when we go over that threshold of one over R. So having said that, maybe let me tell you also an interesting example by Satistandron and Wald. So they looked at a very unusual example, I would say, of stress energy, which is an expanding shell in linearized gravity. Linearized gravity, and they produced some ordinary magnetic memory with that. So, that's a really interesting example by Satistian Drone and Wald. And what we will do here is we will not look at some special, let's say, case. This, what we do comes out naturally of the Einstein vacuum equation. So it's a feature of gravity itself when we pass a certain threshold of decay properties. Also, I'd like to mention another work by Winnika and Madler. Work by Winnicore and Madler and Winnicor. So they have looked at all kinds of gravitational wave memory from different sources in a linearized setting. So, and one is really interesting also that many are interesting, but one that gives us some analog of magnetic memory. So, if you have, let's say, a homogeneous source-free gravitational wave coming in from past null infinity, right? So, from past null infinity, that will produce some magnetic memory as well. But if the way to think about it, so this has to be there already. This has to be there already in past null infinity, and basically you have to put it in by hand. So, what we are interested in is that, I mean, they also find that, I mean, of course, if you have no incoming radiation, then you don't have that. You have to plug it in by hand. So, what we are interested in is, let's say, a natural situation where this happens in the evolution and is not yet, let's say, contained in the initial data. So, what is new here? We look at magnetic. Here we look at magnetic, we obtain this magnetic memory as soon as we pass the threshold of decay. It shows up naturally in the pure Einstein equations. We can add neutrinos to these equations. And then, interesting enough, so there's terms, of course, from the neutrino cloud, which add to this electric and the magnetic memory. So, for the magnetic memory, we have in the borderline case B star is something interesting. There's the curl term showing up, but only there. But that's a different, interesting question. Different interesting question. Okay, so let me show how we derive that and what are the features and structures that we can find. So here we go back to the Bianchi equations for the electric part of the while curvature rho. So the Bianca equation for rho three, so this is the three derivative of the normal normal component of the electric part of while that's rho. And then on the right-hand side, let me just look at the highest order terms. I mean, the last few here are lower order. Few here are lower order, so I'm just looking at the highest order terms for this very slow decay space times. So I can show that the divergence of beta bar goes like R to minus three and some u decay, but then this chi hat times alpha bar has only r to the minus five half. So that's not good, but let's compute briefly. So with a short computation, we can show that this term breaks up into two terms. One is the chi-hat bar squared. So you may, this is what people usually call news here. This is what people usually call news here. Times this will go like r to the minus three and tau minus u to the minus one. Tau minus is like u, like retarded time, but I still have a problematic term, which is only like r to the minus five half. So I take this on the left-hand side. And then from our computations, I can show that, well, whatever is here on the right-hand side is well-behaved, has an r to the minus three decay and some new decay. And therefore, here on the left-hand side, this is also well-behaved. Now, if you have small data, it follows. If you have small data, it follows that each term row three and the derivative of the shears here behave nicely as well, have limits at null infinity. But now, if you plug in large data, that's not true anymore. If you plug in large data, I could have all kinds of r to the minus half and tau minus to the minus x behavior for each of those. But because I know that the right-hand side is well-behaved, even for large data, I know that this cancel out. So the left-hand side in total has an hand side in total has a nice decay of r to minus three and this lets us now take limits at null infinity so let's do that take the limit at null infinity in order to do that let me introduce for the left hand side here now i multiply this equation 37 with r to the 3 and go out to null infinity along one let's say null cone so for that i introduce some new notations on the left hand side i do exactly as i said i take r to the three multiply with the left hand side Multiply with the left-hand side, take the limit on a fixed null upper surface out to null infinity. I call this P3. I will integrate that later with respect to U. That's going to be P. And of course, P is now defined on S2 cross R at future null infinity up to some additive constant on S2. But later, when we take, I mean, the limits of this U going to minus and plus infinity, so this constant will cancel out. So we don't need to care about that. To care about that. All right, now I take the limit of this equation 37 on both sides, r to the 3 times that. Then on the left-hand side, I get exactly this p3 that I defined. On the right-hand side, each piece has a nice, well-defined limit as divergence of the beta bar component plus xi squared, which you better know probably as the new, so xi squared. All right, I also define now the following quantity because chi-hat itself does not have a limit at null infinity, but its derivative. Have a limit at null infinity, but its derivative does. So the derivative in the u-bar direction, so d du of chi-hat r squared times that has a nice limit. I call this chi 3. And again, I will integrate that with respect to u, and that will be my chi. So we see here I'm going to use some relations between the shears and the curvature terms from earlier on. So my beta bar is also equals to minus twice the divergence of the psi. Of the psi, and I know that the chi 3 is equal to minus the psi. So I use this, all these notions. And from my equation 40, that is my limiting equation at null infinity. I use this on the right-hand side. And so what I call 44 is here my new equation at null infinity. So I have a three-derivative here. So I'm going to integrate that now with respect to retarded time u, where u goes over all its parameters, all its values. Over all its parameters, all its values from minus to plus infinity. So, what that gives me is some value, which is a limit for u to minus infinity. Oh, by the way, this is u to minus infinity is what goes to the past and plus infinity, minus infinity here when u goes to minus infinity is actually my future. So, you may be confused. I chose a side convention for the retarded time, which is maybe unusual. So, minus goes to the future plus to the past, just to hopefully. Past just to hopefully not confuse you more. So, I have an integral basically, which is the difference between these limits p minus p plus, and I have an integral which is an integral over the news. This is finite. And then I have the, these are all, these are equations on the sphere s2 at null infinity. So, and I have this equation, this relative, this expression here, chi minus minus chi plus on the right. So, I have an equation for this object, which you remember comes directly into the Remember, it comes directly into the permanent displacement equation. So, this chi minus 1 is chi plus tells me about the permanent displacement, the memory effect of gravitational waves. So, there will be all kinds of new structures I'm going to show you in a moment in these terms. So, maybe I take another five minutes, if that's okay, to show you the magnetic memory. So, I will come back to that, but I can do exactly the same for the Pyrunck equation for the magnetic part of the curvature, which is sigma. So, for sigma. Curvature, which is sigma. So for sigma 3, I have an equation which gives me the curl beta bar plus other terms. I do the same thing. I look at the highest order terms just and take limits of that. So from this chi-hat star alpha bar, there's also one contribution which gives me a DDU of stress of shears. So that I take to the left-hand side. And again, each term for a large data on the left-hand side can have very bad behavior, but because I know. Bad behavior, but because I know that the curl beta bar on the right-hand side are well-behaved, I know that these cancel out, that the left-hand side is actually nice enough, has an r to the minus three behavior. Similarly, for this magnetic part, I can now take the limit at null infinity of this equation and I introduce q3 and q correspondingly for the left-hand side when I take the limit at null infinity. And now I can see already that basically from the behavior I know. From the behavior, I know from this row and from the sigma part that the left-hand side, when I want to take the limit, let's say from I look at some finite difference between Qu and Qu zero, and I let, let's say, one go to minus infinity, then this will grow like square root of u. So there is no finite, this will tell me there's no finite memory for these problems. But before I go there, I can integrate the, so I have this limiting. integrate the so I have this limiting equation number 50. So I have the magnetic part and the let's say shear part on the left hand side and curl beta bar part on the right. So I can do the same thing as before. I can relate beta bar to the shears and get equation 51. And then I integrate with respect to retarded time. And now let me tell you a little bit more about the structures in the remaining few minutes. What is behind that? So in this 52 equation and also in the one for electric And also in the one for electric parts. So, this is the magnetic memory. I get here. So, the right-hand side again is the permanent change here, chi-minus minus chi plus, which is in this equation related to the magnetic part of memory. So, what happens there now? So, there's an interesting feature. So, let me explain the behavior. So, I mean, there's very, very skew and g terms on the left-hand side. So, this is just there's a lot of interesting structures showing up, which are not there if you have one over RDK. If you have one over R dk, so what happens? Let's take a fix a point on the sphere S2 where this equation is actually at. Let's say fix a point at some retarded time value U0. I can evaluate Q at U0, which is perfectly finite and fine. Then I go to a neighboring sphere, let's say SU, and I evaluate Q at U for a corresponding point at this other sphere, just neighboring, but not far away. So that's all finite. So that's all finite. Now let me keep u0 fixed and I can take u and go to plus or minus infinity with u. Then what happens is that this difference q of u minus q of u 0 is no longer finite, but this will grow with the square root of u. So and a corresponding argument, of course, holds for the right-hand side, which gives me this displacement, the chi of u minus chi of u zero. When I make this go to infinity, let's say one parameter value of u, then this will grow. Parameter value of u, then this will grow with the square root of u. So, and now I have in this q terms here, I have growing portions which go at the square root of u of retarded time. And at r to the, let's say, like have here u to the beta, where betas between zero and one half. So I have diverging terms, which go back to the magnetic part of the curvature, which show up here in these q terms. And in addition, what I call here g, this will be finite terms which have contributions from the Which have contributions from the curvature part, but also, funny enough, from these shear parts. If you have any type of one over R decay, the shear parts never contribute to that. They are always going to zero for large absolute value of retarded time. So here you have a confinite contribution and also the energy radiated away. So my news term that I integrate here over you is finite. So they show up here. I mean, I don't have this here, but I have a news term in the electric portion. Use term in the electric portion. So let me maybe put these two things together. Energy radiated the way shows up in the electric part. In my magnetic part, I have these new structures. I mean, all of that on these slides is exactly zero if you have fall off like one over R or better. So any type of matter that falls off like one over R in the metric for this 53 is identically zero. So in the last maybe two minutes, I put everything. Maybe two minutes, I put everything together. So I have an equate, I have these equations on a sphere S2 at null infinity. And so let us, I can solve that by some Hodge theory. So let me now call C the divergence of this chi-minus minus chi plus. Again, this is the difference here gives us the permanent displacement, the memory. So I can now derive fully from the mathematical world and tell you what we hope to see in observations. So of course, I have the diversion of C, which is Laplacian of. diversion of c which is laplacium of this function phi and now i have the curl of c which is laplacium of the function psi so now this set of equations here at the bottom give me determine the chi minus minus chi plus exactly so i have a contribution here 55 of the curl of the diff of that which comes from the magnetic part of the mem of the wild curvature and 56 which comes from the um electric part of the mic wild curvature so magnetic part has this magnetic part of Magnetic part of the curvature in there, and for the electric part of the curvature, P is that plus this portion has also the new tensor, the energy which is radiated away. So, F in the last line is finite. So, summarizing, what do we get? We find new magnetic memory, which is only there if I go over the threshold of one over RDK. Suddenly, this panorama of new structures opening up that diverge at corresponding order. diverge at corresponding order and so if you have r to the minus one half decay it's diverging like square root of retarded time u. We find also that the electric memory is growing at the same order we find a lot of new structures in both magnetic and electric part of the memory and again to remember the magnetic part of the memory is identically zero for one over R dk but it opens up naturally in the Einstein vacuum equations if you have very slow decay. Now maybe just Now, maybe just one more slide. If you have, let's say, if you're putting neutrino clouds, so back to where is this happening, maybe in the universe, if you have very extended, for instance, neutrino clouds around some source, then you expect that this source is not exhibiting a one over R decay, but something which is less along the lines that I explained here, maybe r to the minus one half, maybe something in between that I have shown. So this is something that. I have shown. So, this is something that would model such a neutrino cloud. And we found if I plug in neutrinos on the right-hand side that I can model by a null fluid, for instance, we find in the electric portion a contribution that grows like square root of u as well to the electric memory. And in the magnetic case, in the absolute, let's say in what I call v star, which is like capital O of R to the minus one half, there's even a curl term adding to the magnetic memory. Add into the magnetic memory, but that's a very special case. So, finally, okay, I mean, there are a few questions. So, we have, we are now interested in looking at what are other sources which have this kind of behavior. So, I mentioned extended neutrino halos around maybe binaries, etc. An interesting question is also: what about dark matter? If you have maybe warm dark matter or dark matter that may behave in a certain way like that. So, another question that came up is. So, another question that came up is: we know that galaxies have a lot of, I mean, mainly called dark matter halos, and these halos extend to very large regions of the universe. So is it possible to model some of those also with this type of space-times? And so the question is, we have all this behavior of the rotational curves for galaxies that tell us it must be dark matter. So, one question is: can we apply some of this knowledge? Some of this knowledge to that. So that's ongoing research. We're checking some of that. Then there's a lot of interesting questions if you now start embedding your manifolds into some cosmological space-time. So of course, we have regions which have all kinds of different behavior. So I'd like to fit my data with cosmological backgrounds and see what happens there. And there's a lot of beautiful questions if you study other matter fields or intersection of gravitational waves that give you certain patterns, patterns that might speak. Patterns, patterns that might be incoming waves in some sense. So, what would be a notion of asymptotic flatness within a cosmological space-time that allows you that some stuff comes in? So, there's a lot of questions, I think, related to that, but I open the floor for questions. And thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much, Lydia, for this very enlightening talk. So, we have some time for questions. So, do anybody have a question for Lydia? I have a question, Lydia. Sure, hi, Yabay. Hi, Yavali. So, in the electromagnetic case, I mean, so first of all, it's a beautiful, very detailed mathematical, rigorous work here. But if you just consider Maxwell's case, where one can get by this. By these Maxwell fields in Minkowski space-time. One can get by much more with pedestrian methods. Then, what one finds is that in simple sources, the boundary conditions are perfectly normal, but like for example, you can have a sphere of charged sphere which is rotating. Okay. So, it is static in the beginning, and you give it some rotation, and it rotations emits the wave. Rotations, it emits the waves and then it comes to rest again. In that case, in fact, it's a magnetic dipole moment changes. So, in that case, in fact, there is a finite magnetic
