We are going to consider always C infinity where the C fields. So infinity is smooth. And this family has a property that if you have, there is some ODE in this parameter space, dp dt, also some x and p. This is an ODE. So a solution of this OE would be a time-dependent. A time-dependent divergence-free field. And I say that we say that sigma, the parameter space, the manifold sigma, and the vector field CX on sigma is an invariant manifold. Of the Euler equation in this in Mg if the vector field, the time-dependent vector field U of this solution corresponding to this curve in the parameter space is a solution of Euler. For long time T so solutions of the O give me solutions of the Earl equation. Other way to say is that the R equation becomes a finite dimensional OD in this sub-manifold of the space of divergence free fits. In other words, you can In other words, you can also state it in this way. So, simo x is an embedded manifold, you can find an embedding from the parameter space, the space of the free fields. So that for all points P in this manifold, the image of the flow of the vector phase of the adhesive variance. And the decent medium is a solution of work all day. So I'm interested in characterizing which parameter species, which manifolds, and which vector fields on them can I find as invariant manifolds of their equation. By the way, please interrupt me at any moment if you have some questions. So let me now give some examples of invariant manifolds that have already appeared in this conference. Now some of you can point some invariant manifolds that have already appeared. So one That have already appeared. So, one very easy case of an embarrassment manifold, the trivial one, is a steady state. You have a steady solution. Steady solutions are invariant manifolds which are points. A trivial invariant manifold. And then another very nice example of invariant manifold that has appeared, and I like it very much, in the talk of Albert Chen. Of Albert Chen, if you take M to be a surface, genus G, so a surface of genus bigger than one with no empty boundary. Then the space of the linear space where the affine space is the space. the linear space, well the affine space, really affine space of divergence-free velocity fields with constant vorticity is also a variable. So far, dimensional. It's a funny dimensional environment. And then, as we saw in his lecture, the dynamics on this affine space is rotation. So the vector fields, there are harmonic vector fields plus a graph per part that gives you the constant vorticity, they're just rotating. At an angular velocity, that depends on the constant of the vorticity. That's one example. Maybe I don't want to raise this definition yet. I put the definition there. Now, some theorems. So, other examples that you can find in some books are orbits, for example, of the equation that will be a circle, which is an immediate manifold. But then until now, until the theorems that I'm going to state, there were no more complicated examples, rotations, stabilization or biorecording, and fixed points. That's it. Now, let me stay in the student. So, fix. So fix this number n in a number n and a vector omega in Rn. Then, if you take your parameter space to be the n-dimensional terms and your vector field x and the parameter space to be as the linear vector field given by this vector, in the n. So Ï‰1. One theta one all the way to omega n plus theta n. So this path is an invariant manifold of all death. In, and now in which, for the equation in which manifold, okay? So in T2, this In T2. This was proved by Erwan Faux and Nicolas Crouses in 2012. So they proved that you can find that at the end of the day, what is this? This is an n-dimensional invariant torrent for the Euler equation, for the PD. So they proved, they constructed n-dimensional invariant torite for any n with any frequency, so not only quasi-periodic frequency, but just rational frequency. Frequency, but just rational frequencies too into. And then in the free torus, and in general, in any given dimensional torus, this was done by Enfiso, Alberto Enfiso, Aril Perata Salas, and myself in a recent preprint in 2022. So, in the case of the So, in the case of the n-dimensional equation, you can also find this n-dimensional invariant tonight. And by the way, let me stress that the question of finding invariant manifolds of the equation is interesting regardless of global existence theory. For example, you mentioned zero than two. You don't have a global solution. Well, you don't know if you have global solutions in general to the equation, but still you can ask whether you can find special finite-dimensional invariant invariant families. Invariant families. Even if outside these invariant families, the solutions might grow up. Let me give a proof of this theorem in the case of T three. Rather than a proof, an explicit construction that can be generalized and turned into a proof. I'm turning into a proof for this statement. To prove this theorem, what do I want to do? So I want to assign to any point in the n-dimensional torus, I want to assign some velocity field x, y, z velocity field. Velocity field, or divergence free field in T3. And I want that when I take a solution, theta 1 plus omega 1 t, theta n plus omega n t, is a solution of the linear flow and the dimensional terms, and one of the corresponding time-dependent velocity field. Here, that's what I said. So, this is a time dependent. The time dependence is in these parameters is a solution of oil. That's what I want to find. I want a way to assign angles to vector fields. To do that, To do that, we're going to draw the three-dimensional tones. My three dimensional terms, T3. My reference frame here is xyz. The first thing that I'm going to do to construct this vector field is draw n cylinders here in the torus and vertical cylinders. So I will draw one cylinder here, another cylinder. Another cylinder here. And this way, n cylinders in total. Go to the row three. You put any number of cylinders that you want. And I'm going to define a background velocity field. I'm going to call it omega. And it's going to be a shear flow. So it goes in the z direction and only depends in the x and y directions. And this shear flow is. And this C flow is anything. So, first of all, this function is going to be equal to my frequencies, omega i, in each cylinder. I'm going to call Ci this cylinders here. C1, C2. It's the number of cylinders in your big n. It's n, big n. Okay. So here I have the general n. So in each of the of each of these cylinders, the And of each of these fields, the velocity field at the peak is just constant in this direction and equal to omega 1, omega 2, omega 3, etc. And outside, I pick any other. Actually, it doesn't matter. So I interpolate smoothly. And with my background flow. Now, the second ingredient of the construction is you have to rely on a very strong result of Alexander Glavirov, 2018. He showed that there are exist compactly supported steady states of the earlier equation. Of the other equation without the so these are solutions to the stationary equation and they have compact spots. They are zero outside a compact region and when I will draw them And when I will draw them, because I will draw them there, so they are axisymmetric, they have like a ton shape and axisymmetric along the z axis. And the nice thing about having a compact with supported steady state in R3 is that, of course, this is invariant by translations and by scannings. So now I can take a copy of Gavrilo's solution, make it very little, put it here at any point. Here at any point, and this will be a steady state still. What I'm going to do is at these heights, so if this is my signal C1, at the height theta1, I'm going to place one of these compactly supported Gabriel solutions. Yeah. I'm going to draw it this way. This signifies one copy of this. One copy of this. Put it there, then at the height the tattoo given by the tornge, then the measure of torn say one torn bed. I put another and I do the same game in every city. So I height theta three, I have another one. So this way, if now I define the velocity field, Now I define the relative field. This velocity field u theta one theta n is going to be the sum from one to n of a copy of this Gabriel solution x y xyz minus the di plus my background shear. So that's my family of velocity fields. So you see I am embedding atomus because for each point in the tonnus I have one such velocity field. I'm just changing the height of these guys here. And now everything we have to check is that when these blocks, the height of this The height of these Gabriel solutions are moving linearly with these velocities. The resulting vector field, which is now time-dependent. So here Vt will be the sum from 1 to n of VI xyz minus theta y minus omega t plus the value function. Plus the value coefficient, we have to check that this solves the equation. And as an exercise, you can check it does by construction, by the fact that, well, I'm going to do a little calculation maybe to justify it. But say that this, you plug it into the equation, and that's a solution. So, in particular, this way you construct an This way you construct an n-dimensional invariant. And then see that these frequencies were completely arbitrary. Yeah, of course. You say only in P3 because you can also construct comparably supported solutions in any even dimension. And then you play the same game and you also construct invariant idea. And structural information. In all dimensions, it's not known. Yeah, you have a solution in R3. But the dynamics is they are what they call traveling waves. The dynamics is just going up. But yeah, you have special functional solutions in that. And this this construction can be modified in many ways. You don't have, for example, to take the signatures. You don't have, for example, to take the cylinders straight. You could turn it a little as long as they close, you could turn it a little bit, put several work together. In particular, it gives you also that these structures are dense near any shear flow, because you can approximate any shear flow, but one with some constant components, some small signals. So there are many constructions that you can make starting with this one. I don't know how much time they have left. Ten minutes. The key here is that when you derive this field with respect to time, the only dependence here, so what you get is terms like this. Tell us like this: the frequencies by the derivative in the z direction this velocity fits. Then, when you do the covariant derivative, this term here gets cancelled with this term. So, the covariant derivative of this path, in this direction, they can say this because They cancel this because where these velocities have support, these are precisely these constants. So they cancel out. Then you will get other terms like covariant derivatives of some gravitational solutions in the direction of others, but this is also zero because they have this gene support. Then the covariant derivatives in the same one gravitational solution with itself, that would be the grammar of a function because they are in steady state, so this goes into the pressure. Steady state, so this goes into the pressure. And then this, well, the shears, the derivative of the coordinate derivative of the shear in the direction of the shear is also zero because the kind of x, y, you are deriving in the same direction, it's a steady state, and so on. So everything else is zero. Yeah, and of course. And of course the derivative of the shear in the direction of the V i's is also zero, because the shear is constant where V i's are supported. Now let me state a couple of what else is known. Now we know that we can construct invariant to line. What else can we say about infinite dimension? Of infinite dimensional, finite dimensional manifolds in general. So now I'm going to state a negative result. This is in T2 is due to L Dindi asvera. And in T3, it's due to Kishimoto and Junem. So this was to. So this was 2014, this 2000. So they proved, it's a very interesting result, is that if you have a solution u of t of the linear equations supported on finitely many free remotes For a time for t in some interval, some as small as you want. So you have a solution that when you expand it in Fourier, it has only finished the non-zero Fourier coefficients. Then this solution must be Must be steady. So you cannot have non-steady solutions supported of finitely many Fourier coefficients for an open interval of time. And what does this imply in particular? That you cannot have no time-dimensional variable manifolds, or no triggering variant manifolds. Or no trigger, baron markers. Balance subspaces spanned by Fourier modes. So you take a collection of Fourier modes, and you consider the linear space, they expand, a finite collection. Linear space, they span, a finite collection of Fourier modes. This cannot be an invariant manifold of Dorier equations unless all the velocity fields space are steady state. Which is what happens if you have, for example, in the torus just taken functions of the replacement. And I have a question that I think is very interesting might be dual. Might be two hours is to prove a Lini-Sphericampus theorem in the two-sphere for spherical harmonics. So if you have a time-dependent solution supported on finitely many spherical harmonics for an amount of time, it must be a steady state. So it must be a... Excuse me, could you explain? So, why you cannot imagine a solution which is spent by three ear modes in some fine-dimensional substance? Free EM modes in some fine-dimensional subspace in all three modes. In all free emotes? Yeah, in all Fourier modes? So it would be a fine-dimensional subspace, but it would be a kind of. Ah, no. It can be a fine-dimensional subspace, but not spanned by a fully mode, spanned by all the bases. It has all full remotes? Yeah, it could have. Yeah, that's why I said span by fully modes. I think he meant that. Oh, sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I meant exactly that. Okay. I meant exactly that. So a fine dimension. Not in principle you could have a finite dimension. It's not known, I think. Also in principle um intuitively it shouldn't happen either. As long as you have some finite scale that your basis is resolving, you should get out of it. I will state that one last theorem. Here are the results now. Positive result for geometrical flavor. So you take a any closed manifold, so close, I mean compact without boundary. I mean compact without boundary and any vector field X in this closed manifold. Now fix an arbitrarily small number epsilon with some arbitrarily high integral. Okay? And there is a smooth vector field Y on this closed submanifold that satisfies it's arbitrarily close to this vector field x just started with in the CK realm. So you there is some vector field y that is a very small perturbation of x such that X such that the pair sigma with the vector field y is an invariant manifold of the equation. On some demanding manifold, that's where the cat. That's where the catch is NG. And this Riemannian manifold, so you can find any parameter space, any dynamics on the parameter space module of arbitrary small perturbation. You can find it as invariant set, that's invariant manifold of the equations, but on some remote manifold M with a metric G, and this manifold and this metric is not fixed a priori, but it depends Fixed a priority, but it depends on the data you studied with. So on sigma y. So at the expense of changing your manifold or changing your metric, you can find any invariant manifold with any dynamics, any structuralized stable dynamics inside the equations. And that's more or less. Ten minutes passed by. Any question or patron? I think in the 1990s, Boris Cooper Schmidt, Incognita, so it was under the names of Ilija Murimits and Slavi Raspoieni. He published a paper where he embedded just a standard It's just a standard rigid body equations, maybe even n-dimensional rigid body into the weather equation. Sorry, it is an invalid submanic. Okay, that's nice. And there are equations where in the towels or in which space? I think on the flat space. So I can find the other thing. Isn't DAO and that all quadratic that's in the old quadrature? Well, that's quadratic, so. Right, right. I mean, but it's not. Right, right. I mean, but it was much earlier than Paul thought. And the names of the authors are much better. It would be, of course, really interesting to prove an unrestricted theorem like this for a fixed human manual editorial with some metric that changes or something. So you were talking about the finite realm things that you do? I think for Uh I think for uh spherical harmonics, which is close to variable, so suppose you have like string function from some uh spherical harmonics and you make tibran here for you all of it. I think you get some unsteady uh but also like kind of uh closed uh like system where the of uh spherical anonymity spoke don't increase. Ah, would you like so so the first three uh like uh or four Three or four sprinkler monitors on chain field, just you can just take any other like I guess sprinkler harmonic mode and then you're just going to stay on that eigenvalue. So for example, like I mean those nodes are still going to corrate by the by the cheating field. So it's moving in the first, in the second eigen space. Yeah, for example. Or you can take any higher eigens. So I presented Michael Lussen and somebody else told me how they calculated these order easier sphere and then they found this. So that disproves the conjecture that I stated yesterday. I haven't checked the the calculation yet but but I I know the reference. So it's cont i it contradicts completely in the case of the torus then it's sort of on the torus if you admit a constant by the field then it's still true. It's like that's the role of the field. Ah okay that's another killing field so you are like moving the translating the stationary object. No like but if you translate the steady solution of Euler if it's a killing field it's okay. You can pick some uh You can pick some collionis bots for the routine. But certainly on the Taurus, if you just admit a change of. If you take harmonics, then yes, you assume pseudomine, for example. Sure. Yeah, pseudomine. Sorry, the next assumption. Yeah, so but I think the point is that the torus, the harmonic fields are the killing ones, but on a sphere, if you're not harmonic, you're killing. Solid by. I guess in 3D you can also do like the cylinder as your domain instead of the 3D. But we meant it, but it sort of relies on the top and the bottom being flat. Yeah, you have to have some recurrence. Uh so does it mean that uh you can take um any n-dimensional torus and put it to one half-dimensional a state solution and then move it by harmonic fields? Then you get the manifold that like in the in the n-dimensional torque, yeah. If you just uh translate it by if you have a state solution, you have a state solution and you just move it along with a costume, that's a time-dependent solution too, but it's not a translation. It can't get classic. It can't get higher it can't get closer periodic. I just want to make sure that your solution is it uh can we regard it as uh generalized mical flow? Generalized mical flow the the just in case the the one that I draw the one that tours yeah you could You could interpret it as a Mikao flow, because you could take several different cylinders in different directions and put a zero velocity outside, yeah, because it won't mess things up. So you could have one gorilla solution moving in this direction, one other moving in another direction, and start adding up this solution. What's known about the Gorilla? Is it possible that within that torus you have a region of solid body rotation? Did you build it like that? Do you build it like that? Inside, like just R E theta inside some core, and then you make it actually supported outside. Is it possible to build that? Because if so, then your result is true on any valid domain just in general. Yeah, so you want to do the same thing to do on your planet like the only question is if you put yeah okay, well then you can put several of them and then to make them contain different speed. And then to make them rotate at different speeds in different uh regions. Then you just put a little one inside that little thing, it goes around, put a little one inside that, it goes around so that's not a little bit. Not even inside, just uh different uh hats, and you will also also get a possibility. Well, I won't make sure that I won't have to worry about it.
