And studying Riemannian geometry, which is what my thesis within, with Wolfgang Ziller. And I learned a lot about geometry at Penn, but I also learned a lot about geometry at a workshop at Cornell University with David Henderson and met lots of people, including Donna Giama and Walter Whitley, and many more. And so, what I learned there was experiencing. But what I learned there was experiencing geometry. So I was learning the foundations of geometry, Riemannian geometry, as well as thinking a lot about experiencing it. So as I got to teaching myself, I worked a lot at trying to help my students engage with lots of conceptual ideas ranging from courses at the 1000 level up through we have a master's program too. So I do a lot of things in the scholarship. So, I do a lot of things in the scholarship of teaching and learning. That is to take a look at what the literature says or what past people have used. And I'll name some people as I go along on my talk, and then try and make it work for my own students. Think about what's not going well, what is going well, and how I can modify it. And a lot of what I'm showing today not only dates back to seeds that were planted in that Exploring Geometry workshop, experiencing geometry workshop, sorry. Geometry workshop, sorry, but also the CBMS Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences Statement on Active Learning. So, what I want to start with is an activity I've done with a variety of different levels, and that is walking or driving an anglesum. If we were together in person, I would have asked one of you to help me tape out. To help me tape out a with masking tape a nice large Euclidean triangle on the floor. And when I say large, I mean large. When I do this in my own classroom, it's as big as I can make it there. And so I lay out this Euclidean triangle, pick a vertex to begin with, and then note which way you're facing. In here at the bottom of my slide, I can see I'm pointed upward to the left a little bit from this corner of the triangle. Little bit from this corner of the triangle. In the context of doing this while driving, here I have a toy car. It's a paramedic car. My husband's a volunteer EMT. And so you can think about actually walking this, starting to walk this triangle where instead of that yellow figure there, you yourself are on the triangle. Or I could think about driving the car. And in fact, I talked. I taught in the online setting recently because of COVID. And so there I asked the students to, if they didn't have masking tape to tape it down on their floors, to make themselves a triangle on a piece of paper. It's not as big as the other one. And then use something like a car, something that has a front and a back so that they can tell which way they're facing. So I'm going to start walking this triangle to be able to walk the angle zone. I should mention that I got this from Walter Whitley and have tried a number of different ways. And I've tried a number of different ways to refine it over the years in ways to help my students engage. So, what I'm going to do is keep the center of my body on the boundary of the triangle. I get up to the top vertex here on my slide. And now, what I want to do is sweep out the first angle. To do that, I direct the students to make sure that they sweep out the angle inside the triangle and not the exterior angle. But almost always, I have a student that wants. Always, I have a student that wants to go the other way around, the outside or exterior angle of the triangle. And so, some of the instructions I give them is to be careful about that. And I give them a little hint about they might end up walking backwards after they do this sweep. So I can see that sweep gives us the first angle. I then come backwards and come down below to the bottom of the triangle and then. Triangle. And then by this point, if they haven't already figured out what sweeping the entire angle is, they start to usually get it that to sweep out the next angle, we have to turn again towards the base of the triangle here and sweep that out so that I stay in the triangle. And then they continue driver or walking along this and sweep out the last angle. And so, again, this works much better if we were physically. Better if we were physically in person and doing it with people actually trying it themselves while walking, but works pretty well to sketch out a triangle and use something like a car to do the sweeping. But the key here is I want them to do it themselves, not just to watch me do it. So I just came from an origami workshop, and I certainly went to a workshop. Joe, you were leading that workshop years ago. And so I also Up years ago. And so I also show the students folding an angle sum where you fold the sum of the angles being along a straight line. But one of the things they get from this experience is I asked them to think about they've done this sweeping out of the three angles. So to look at the difference between how they were pointed to begin with, my truck was pointed up. And then at the end of this, after I'd done the three sweeps, my truck was Sweeps, my truck is now pointed down, in fact, completely opposite angle. And if you're doing this with your body and/or you have an arm held out, you can see that you're turning, you're facing one way and you're then completely opposite direction. So, this is a really nice intrinsic exploration, and it helps them to process the angle sum in my 10/10 class. That's humanities, social sciences, and And elementary ed students, we aren't doing the proofs in that course. But if I do the same activity in my 3610 course, which is geometry, mostly aimed at future high school teachers, then we are looking at the proofs at the same time. We're looking at a variety of different ways to explore these. In the 10-10 class, we're looking at a segment on the geometry of the Earth and universe. And so, one of the things I'm And so, one of the things I'm talking about with them is what does flat mean? What does it mean to be Euclidean in a possible Euclidean universe? So, and Carl, thank you. I see you posted in the chat a bridges paper. For those of you that might have come in a little bit, I'm going to repost my links, which have these slides you can get to in various parts and more. Any questions or comments? Any questions or comments to begin with? Okay, next, stringing the Pythagorean theorem. And so here you see a globe, and I've got some string. This fall, as I was starting the 10-10 course, I managed to get them all a stress squish earth ball. And the rest of the course was on. And the rest of the course was online, and some strings. So they could still do this, but it works a little bit better with a bigger ball. And so, again, I talked to them about the fact that if I'm in a space, like I'm on the surface of this perfectly round planet, well, approximately round in this model anyways, then if I start at the North Pole, head down to the equator, head over a bit, and back up, that creates a spherical triangle. And I can think about walking. Think about walking so that I walk straight where I intrinsically feel straight. These are great circle paths, and I can measure my distance walking by using string. So I could start with my string and go down to the equator, mark off a point there, and then from there go over to some point on the equator and mark off another point. So, again, if with a larger ball, I have them actually. If with a larger ball, I have them actually tape a point A and a point B on the ball. We use masting tape because that approximates intrinsically straight paths pretty well if you don't let the masking tape buckle. And then they can put the string on top to do measurement. And so I can have my A and my B distance. And so from there, what I want them to do is to create a right triangle using the same side length. And this really benefits from more. And this really benefits from more than just me doing it. Again, if we were together in person or when I'm in my classroom in person, I have a volunteer come up to demonstrate and help, I would put this up on the board in front of me and then have the last person grab, making the right angle, grab down, and create my Euclidean length. And in my slide, you can see that as C flat, because for the Pythagorean theorem, A squared plus B squared is C flat squared. Plus B squared is C flat squared. And then the question is: what happens on the sphere? Well, they already can guess a little bit just from the fact that they can see the spherical triangle have sides that are bowing in. But the string argument, again, want to have more than just me doing it, works quite well to grab my Euclidean hypotenuse and then put it back on the sphere and see that back on the sphere, it actually goes past that North Pole. And so back. And so back on the sphere, I see that a squared plus b squared, that was c flat squared. Well, that's longer. That string, the flat hypotenuse is longer than the ball hypotenuse. And so this is a little bit complicated. And usually what I have to do with them is show them and then have them explore in groups with each other and then write out and explain what they did so that they can. Explain what they did so that they can process at the 1010 level, anyways. And again, at my 1010 course, they're not doing a proof, but at the 3000 level, we're doing, we've done Euclidean proofs already, and we're taking a look at a variety of things that happen in non-Euclidean geometry. I talked to them about that. This connects to my own Futurama theorem. Futurama is an animated science fiction cartoon. And so you'll see here the And so you see here the Greenwaldian theorem: A squared plus B squared is greater than C squared. And so Futurama is from 20th Century Fox Film Corporation. And so here you see this North Pole down to the equator over a bit and back up, a spherical triangle satisfying that spherical version of the Pythagorean theorem. So I did some work with the Futurama shows by helping. Drama shows by helping them put mathematics in the shows. And as a nod to me, they put that into the DVD movie itself. And there's actually 30 minutes of me on the DVD as a DVD extra talking about the mathematics and Futurama. So that's how I got from exploring things with students to my bright lights of tiny bit of fame. Theme. So, of course, I'm not the first person to explored spherical trigonometry. This certainly Menelos explored spherical trigonometry, and we have work from him that showed that. But things get named after people sometimes in funny ways, say Futurama writers name them after you. So, next, if you're a question or comment? Yeah, Sarah, this is Joe Arourke. So, Rook, I've never tried this, but just listening to you, I wonder if you could also do negative curvature. Yes, and so Dinah has these nice hyperbolic crochet models, and you can take the same string and lie it along those models. Of course, the models aren't as rigid as my sphere, or you can. sphere or you can um i have like an acrylic um and an acrylic saddle again it's not a perfect like hyperbolic geometry but it is more rigid and so yes you can do something similar in those geometries it's a good good comment and question and uh yeah so so um and and thank you um oh and thank you for amy for the comment and frank uh mentioned tob sibley um knows how to get saddle surfaces printed in plastic for Saddle surfaces printed in plastic for classroom uses. And so, but yeah, but those crochet models, you can do that, that too, actually. So what I've been talking about so far is things at the things I do in my liberal arts math class, but that I also do in my geometry at the 3000, the junior level class, although there we're doing it with proofs also. And I want So, and I want to switch gears for a bit to differential geometry. And so, I have used David Henderson's differential geometry book and along with maple files that he shared. And I had a student that went through differential geometry with me. And so, this is an undergrad, grad cross-listic course. We do curved surfaces and then we make our way into. Make our way into Einstein's field equations in a little bit as equations of curvature. So Matt had taken the differential geometry course with me and wanted to continue doing something at the next semester beyond that relating to visualization and programming. And he was very interested in different ways to visualize some of the things that we had done. And so in the In the link, again, I'm going to post it one more time. So, this is the link that says P5JS Hefner. You can get there yourself. What you'll see is an ability to put into a parametric version of a surface, define a curve on a surface. There are some presets in there that he programmed in that you can grab and also change colors and to. Colors and to have this cat moving along the surface. So I'm going to hit escape and go to download I did just in case my internet wasn't working fantastically. So you can animate this, you can get rid of the kitty or leave the kitty here, and you can go along this and change. And change some features as I go along. There's also this bit here that's curvature and torsion realized as sound waves. So he took a sine wave and a triangle wave, and it doesn't sound beautiful, but it is a very interesting, creative way of trying to do this. And so I'm going to play you a little bit of the sound. So, I really like the creativity, and he did a lot of work on this. I think like these are the kinds of things we really, and the students really need to be able to understand a space, whether it's from the inside. In fact, I'd like it if I could be the cat and actually have my camera view be the cat traveling along, right? A very intrinsic view. Very intrinsic view. This is mostly like extrinsic view. I'm looking at this all from the outside. But so Matt would be happy for you to play around with this and see how robust the system is because he's still working on early versions of this. So, and as I mentioned in the program itself, In the program itself, you can see that you can put in a parameterization of a curve and on a surface, and you can define the surface yourself or choose from a preset. You can define your values to go along and how fast you move and so on. So next, I want to talk a little bit about some GeoGebra activities and one that I brought for you today. Oh, and maybe I see a chat. Oh, and maybe I see a chat comment. Oh, thanks. Thanks, Frank. So what I would like everyone to do is to go to this GeoGebra if you have the ability to do that. And so it's a web link. And is in here somewhere. So I should mention that I had lots of things built into Sketchpad. And while Sketchpad is still being worked on, especially for Mac, I had received a message right before I started teaching about Sketchpad reaching the end of its life cycle. This is a dynamic geometry software program, so I switched all my stuff over to geometry. So, I switched all my stuff over to GeoGebra, and that was actually a really interesting task because it made me think a lot about what I could do in Sketchpad that I couldn't do in GeoGebra and vice versa. And so on the webpage I'll share with you in just a little bit, I actually have my full classes and all the activities I have there. So, this is just one activity from that 3000-level course. And so I found spherical harmonic GeoGebra. Geogebra applet from Hanu Korhonen, and I adapted that for this equilateral triangle construction. So, in the 3000-level class, what they've done is to prove how to construct an equilateral triangle in Euclidean geometry, a la Euclid's elements. They've also folded a flat Euclidean triangle previously. And then I asked them what happens on the sphere. What happens on the sphere? I asked them to explore this applet and to think about the proof. I asked them whether the proof holds true on the sphere or whether it doesn't. And if it doesn't, where does the proof go wrong? Which is a good, rich question to have them engage with the Euclidean proof. And I should mention, I mentioned Walter Whitley as where I got that walking, the triangle exploration from, the spherical, the From the spherical Pythagorean theorem with a string I did myself. This originally was from a spherical easel applet from David Austin and William Dickinson, but that program seems to be defunct. So anyways, if you haven't already tried dragging, before I go into that, let me remind you of the proof of Euclid's fourth postulate to create an. Euclid's fourth postulate to create an equilateral triangle, which is I start with two points and I want to create an equilateral triangle with that side length. And so I create a circle with center one point, radius, the distance between them. And I create a second circle with the center the other point and that same radius. And then in Euclid's elements, we are told: well, these two circles intersect. These two circles intersect. You can pick one of the intersection points, and then all radii of a circle are congruent. And I see the one circle has two of the radii, the other circle has the other radii and one of the other two. And then so by a transitive property, they're all congruent. And hence I get an equilateral triangle. So it looks like, at least to start, that it works on a sphere. And in fact, many of my students will initially think, yeah, Students will initially think, Yeah, this proof works fine on a sphere. What could go wrong? But then I ask them to drag and drag some more and drag some more. And these circles don't necessarily intersect. And so this is like a wow, aha moment for them. And also a moment where they're trying to really process the Euclidean proof. The Euclidean proof. And so they have to go back into it to think about what was the underlying assumption that was there and how did it break in spherical geometry. So this is some feedback from students in my most recent 1010 course, which was in the fall. So there I'm doing four segments, and I have percentages here of which were their favorite course segments. This is pretty standard where they either rate the geometry of the Earth and universe. Rate the geometry of the Earth and Universe segment first or second, typically. I wasn't sure what was going to happen with an all-online course in the fall during the time of COVID, but they still quite like that segment. And some comments from them, they love learning about higher dimensions and math beyond equations. This person said that they think the practicality paired with the puzzle solving aspect of the class was the best part of their experience, which is pretty amazing because they're mostly math phobic students coming into the course. Students coming into the course. And again, at this 10-10 level, I liked that we could work with each other and the visual representations slash working with hands-on things. I really liked how the course explored the real life and theoretical implications of mathematics. The content was so diverse and interesting that I constantly found myself surprised and inspired. And I didn't have any like negative comments in evaluations or surveying I did about these kinds of activities. Although generally I get the same kind of comments and frustrations that lots of people. And frustrations that lots of people do with any kind of hands-on or inquiry-based learning, which is sometimes they think it should be easier than it is, right? That they're having to work hard because they're having to engage themselves. And so I get those kind of comments. At the 3000 level, the 3610 course, again, I had some frustrations with inquiry-based learning, but mostly a lot of positive comments. I love the hands-on and interactive learning that was incorporated in the On interactive learning that was incorporated into this class. The active learning helped me understand topics better and helped me remember relationships and proofs better because I had that extra level of engagement. I just hope I can be as creative and fun in my classroom like you are in yours, which I take as the ultimate compliment from a future teacher. The physical hands-on activities help me understand what text couldn't show me. I love to use the IGS, Geogebra. It helps understand proofs better. I like the explorations best because it is easier to remember and experience. Best because it is easier to remember an experience rather than notes for me. So I was able to remember the information from explorations easier than I would have if it were just a PowerPoint. So on the webpage that I shared with you, again, it's also on the Slack, I have like slides and or the activities themselves at the top, but then I have my whole courses so that you can see them and go to them. And I've grabbed some of the specific labs and The specific labs and activities. I only talked about a tiny little bit of those today. And I really do want to thank the many people who have inspired me in my hands-on teaching activities. At the bottom of this page, I've linked to experiencing geometry, and Dinah put out a 2020 version of that. That's freely available. There's also 2004 instructor solutions. I've linked that to this page. If you haven't already read Walter Whitley's Mathematics with the Eye in Hand and the Lee's Mathematics with the Eye in Hand and the Decline and Rise of Geometry. Even though it's written a little while ago now, I think it's really a good, worthwhile read. And the spherical easel applet, as I said, I can't get to work anymore, but I did put a link there. So thank you for your time with me today. And I've got just a couple minutes to answer questions as the next person may be starting to set up. Yes, great. Is there any question for Sarah? Any questions, any comments? Yes, I see a. Oh, I see a thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, Sarah, I have a comment. I once asked John Conway how to adapt the walking proof to spherical triangles. Spherical triangles, and he suggested that you might want to do it in reference to a point in the sky. I didn't quite understand what he was talking about, but it seemed like he was saying that the larger, the further away this point in the sky is, the larger your circles are going to be. And then your angles will look more closely like, for example, right angles where they wouldn't be on the plane. So it seemed like an interesting. So it seemed like an interesting way to try and adapt that. Yeah, so yes, if I take this sphere versus the globe you saw me in my picture, which is back in my office, if I have a smaller radius than as a sphere, then that curvature is more tightly a part of that compared to a very big flat. Very big flatter looking sphere. So maybe that's what John was talking about. I don't know. I hadn't heard him talk. Yeah, I think so. And it might be, I don't know if Henry Siegerman is on, but it might be that he has some software where a walking proof could actually be done for other surfaces. Yeah, it's harder if you kind of just try that with your, with, with, try that like on something like this. try that like on something like this, you can't get the car on them the same way. But on my globe, I can do that the car on my globe is big enough to have the car wheels not get stuck. But thanks. That sounds interesting. Sarah, Veselin Jungic from Simon Fraser. On a practical side, if I may ask you a question, do you require your students to learn how to use GeoGebra? And if yes, And if yes, is there a learning curve or is there a resistance there? So I have step-by-step worksheets and I've linked those on the webpage. And so sometimes I am having them do what I showed you here, which is something simply like that I created. But yes, I actually am having them do things from scratch themselves at the, again, at that 3000 level. And yes, there can be. And yes, there can be some frustration as with anything, but I'm not having them learn that many features of GeoGebra. So, some of the more complicated things I'm giving them where, and so they don't have to learn that themselves. But yes, they create triangles and measure angles and do more with my help, usually in a lab setting. Thanks for that question. Thank you. Thank you. And yeah, I don't want to take time away from this. Yeah, I don't want to take time away from the next speaker, but I'm happy to answer questions in the chat or stack. Thank you, everybody. Thank you so much. Let's just prank. So thank you so much.
