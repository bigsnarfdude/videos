For the mission and giving allow me to introduce my recently research. And my talk today is about large purpose spectra for my harmonic operators with complex potential. Okay, here, now is the summaries of my talk. First, I will go through the introduction and motivation. I will introduce you the definition of You the definition of a pseudo-spectra that you already know. I know. And the next one is we consider this continuous potential and final one is for a general potential. Okay, so in my talk, L is a closed linear operator on a Himber space. And we define the result. And we define the reservant set as in a normal way. And the spectrum is the complement of the reservant set. So the definition of pseudo-spectrum that given epsilon positive, then the purpose is the union of the spectrum of the operator and the set of the resolvent value such that the norm of the resolvent larger than f. Of the reservoir larger than epsilon minus one. Here we assume that epsilon is very small, such that we are caring about the reservant value such we have the very large norm of the reservant. So, in general, we cannot describe a pseudo-spectrum explicitly because, first, it's not easy to catch. First, it's not easy to calculate the spectrum. And it's not easy to calculate the resolvent, of course. And even if you can calculate the reservant, it's not easy to calculate its norm. Okay, so why should we care about the purpose spectrum? First, we know that when L is self-joint or normal operator, we have a well-known form. We have a well-known formula. It says that the norm of the reservoir is equal to the inverse of the distance between the spectral parameter and the spectrum. It tells you that the norm of the reservoir is large if and only if the spectral parameter very close to the spectrum. So we have that in this case the purpose. But in this case, the purpose of spectrum can describe very explicitly. It is the epsilon neighborhood of the spectrum. But when L is non-selfoid and the picture is different, we can have a very non-trivial purple spectrum. And here is a well-known example for purple spectrum of non-cell charge harmonic oscillator. Harmonic oscillator. The dot here is the spectrum of the operator. They are the odd number and rotated by the angle pi over 4. And what is this curve? This curve is the level set. And you see that if we travel to infinity inside this region, we will have that the norm of the result. That the norm of the resolvent will increase is okay. And the second reason that we care about purpose spectrum because we know that we have purpose spectrum can be described by the union of the small perturbation of the original operator. So it tells you that the small perturbation of the operator does not mean. Does not mean small perturbation of the spectrum. Here you can see that there are a lot of values which belong to the spectrum. A purpose spectrum will stay very far away from the spectrum of the original operator. Okay, so what is this talked about? This talk about is the biharmonic operator, the fourth derivative here, plus with a Here plus with a complex potential v and in my talk, I consider the maximal domain, which is the domain where u belong to L2, and the action of L to U also belong to L2. Okay, now we start with a very simple model. V is i psi x size here is a psi function equal one where x is positive. equal one when x is positive and minus one when x negative and we can have an explicit domain is h4 of r okay we can show that l is a closed operator with a non-empty resolvent set and we can compute uh its numerical range is this pink strip and And for that, we deduce that L is a maximal sectorial operator. And we also compute the choice of L is this one. But the sign here is minus and the sine of the original operator is plus. But the domain is the same. So because L and L star is different, so it is non-sell chart. So, it is non-cell choice and is also non-normal. Okay, next one, I would like to talk about the spectrum of the operator, and I would like to compare the model for the solinger and biharmonic operator. For the soling operator, Henry and Pre Chiric in 2017, they saw that the spectrum of Sorenger operator. Solinger operator with I sine X here is an essential spectrum and it can be described by two lines I and minus I in the picture here. And for the bioharmonic, it is the same. The result is the same. The spectrum is also essentially spectrum and it is also two lines here. here and is reasonable for for this uh spectrum because you you see that if you turn off if you turn off the the the potential here and you only consider the free uh salinger or the free uh bioharmonic, then you will see that the spectrum is the positive line here. And when you pertuve by I and minus I, you will pertive the spectrum by a constant. The spectrum by a constant like this. Okay, so next one: I have about the resolvent estimate. Okay, I also give here the comparison between the solinger and biharmonic. The lower bow, you see that they are the same. They are the same. But the upper bow, they are the same. Pow they are the same instead of the constant number four for the soning girl and number eight for the biharmonic. And we have this estimate for the when the real part of Z is very large and imaginary part of that is between minus one and one. Okay, and you see here that when the real part of Z is very big. When the real part of Z is very big, and you also have the norm of the resolvent here is also very big. So we can describe the purpose factorly from this formula. Okay, how to prove them? First, the reservoir can be written in the kernel form like this one. I have the exact formula. I have the exact formula, but it's too complicated, so I don't put here. I just saw the idea. And the upper bound is obtained by the struct test. And the lower bound is obtained by choosing a nice function F0. And we have the lower bound is larger than this one. Okay, so the above method works because we can have an Because we can have an explicit formula for the resolvent. So, the question is: what about the operator that we cannot calculate the resolvent? What do you do? Okay, so here we deduce from the definition that lambda belongs to purple spectrum if and only if lambda belongs to the spectrum and lambda is the purple eigenvalue. It means that. Eigenvalue. It means that there is this function psi, such that we have this one is very small than epsilon multiplied the norm of psi. And we call size purpose mode. So what do you see from this definition? You see that we don't meet the resolvent here. We only consider the original operator and we don't have the resolve. We don't have the resolvant here. So, in the next talk, I will try to construct a pseudo-mode for the original operator. Okay, so the main question is, would return omega such that we can find a purse mode when lambda goes to infinity in omega. In 1999, Davies. In 1999, Davies realized that we can apply semi-classical methods to answer this question for non-self choice solid operator. And in 2004, Denkel, Joe Chen, and Zworski developed this map idea for pseudo-differential operator. And 20 years later, from the work of Davies, Greater Kick and Siegfried could answer the question from Could answer the question from non-self-charge cylinder directly without going through semi-classical regime. Furthermore, the semi-classical setting follows at a special consequence. And this year, we extended the method of British Rich and Siegfried to the relativistic mechanics I consider direct operator. Okay, so the method we use is we construct the Use we construct the pursuit mode by WKB analysis. That means that we're looking for pursued mode in the exponential form. Y n here, n here will be depending on the regularity of potential V. Okay, M psi lambda here is a function. M psi k here will satisfy a system of servable ODE. A system of solvable ODE. Okay, you see that from the first ODE to solve it is easy. You just take the fourth root of two sine and you have sine minus one. But notice that because the sine minus one depending on lambda, and that's psi zero computed by sine minus one. So you will have that the economic solution and the change. solution and the transport solution will depending on lambda and okay so uh what's new with this non-semi-classical wkb i i would like to compare first the parameter in the semi-classical the parameter h is a small positive number but for non-semi-classical lambda is a large complex Lambda is a large complex number. It contains two things. First, the modoon is large. And second, it contains the direction of Lambda. Okay, and second, as I told you that the economic and transport solution in semi-classical do not depending on H. But otherwise, for non-semi-classical, it depends on lambda. So it's very complicated to estimate uniformly. To estimate uniformly on lambda. And third, the purse mode in semi-classical always localize. And why the purse mode in non-semi-classical WKB is do not localize. And that's a pulse can be extended in some cases. And the final one: the potential in semi-classicals are always assumed very smooth. And the new And the new WKB here can cover the potential with low regularity, even discontinuous ones. Okay, so now we consider the result. The V here is the imaginary part of the potential, and I consider V from R to R and it have the synthetic. To take limit of V has a different sign at infinities. Okay, so for Soringer operator, Operatirik and Sergo in 2019, they can construct a pseudo-mote satisfy that can decay at this rate, where N is the regularity of V. Of V. So they show that this quantity will decay when lambda go to infinitive in the region parallel to the positive semi-A6, to this pink strip when lambda go to infinitive. And we will have this one decaying. And okay, now we have the same result for the bi-hammonic operator, but what is the difference? But what is the difference? First, the difference that you see that here for the sewing girl, you just need V belong to W M plus 1. But here you need more M plus 3 because the reason is because the fourth derivative here, they need more regularity of the potential when construct a pseudo-mode. And the second one is the decaying of. The decaying of solidarity here is bigger than this one. Here, m plus one over two, and here is m plus one over four. Okay, so now we would like to consider some example. First, I would like to consider about it as smooth potential. Vx is 20 at time x. We have that the That the synthetic at infinitive of v is minus one and one. So the theorem will give us that when we travel to infinity in this box, you will have pursued mode. You will have the decaying of the cosha here for the biohemmonic operator. And where is this box? This box this box this box uh is uh bounded by minus one and one and minus one and one here is uh is the limit uh at infinity of v okay so now uh if you consider vx is exponential here we also have the the opposite uh asymptotic sign minus one and and plus infinity. And plus infinitive, and you will have that the box is bigger. The box is from minus one to plus infinitive, and you will have a pseudo mode when you travel to infinitive in this box. And the method also works for polynomials, logarithmic functions, and super exponential functions. Okay, so. Okay, so next I would like to consider the decaying potential psi x over x power gamma. Obviously that when x go to positive and negative we have the opposite side but it does not satisfy the assumption because the limit is zero luckily that we also have can We also have, can construct a pseudo-mote my WKB, and we also have a decay, but the box is shrinking into a tunnel. And if you travel into this internal, to this tunnel to infinity, then you will also have a decay. And here I also give you the formula of the curves. Okay, so next one, I would like to consider the WKB around the turning point. What is the difference? In the previous slides, the WKB is performed around the zero point, the zero, because we consider on the total R. And right now, I would like to consider on A plus and the WKB will be considered. We will be considering around the turning point. What is the turning point? The turning point is the solution of the imaginary potential Vx beta equal to beta. And we consider when beta is very large, then this turning point is also moving. When beta is moving, x beta will be moving. That's why I say that normally. Normally, the pursuit mode in new WKB here does not localize. And by doing WKB analysis around the turning point, we can construct a region bounded by two curves, like the example of pymonic oscillator, and we get the pursuit mode. Okay, instead of stating here the theorem, I believe. Stating here the theorem, I prefer to give you an example. For example, for polynomial potential Ix power gamma on L2R plus, and gamma is positive. Then you can construct a pseudo-mode such that this one very small when lambda go to infinity in the cyan color region. Region in this picture. So, in the first picture, is when Vx is when gamma is smaller than one, and the right picture is for gamma is larger than one. So, the difference between them is when gamma is smaller than one, the purple spectral can vary close to the imaginary A6. In the opposite way, In the opposite, when m are larger than one, then the purse spectrum stays very away from the imaginary A6. And two scurves here can have the formula like this. And for the biharmonic, the power is four over five. And for the soling girl, the power is two over three. Okay, so and Okay, so and we also deal with the super exponential potential E power E power X on L to R plus. And we can also construct pursuit mode in this sign color. And when you travel to infinity in the sign color here, then you also have the decaying. The decaying of the quotient. It means that the norm of the reservant also increases when you travel in this region. And the difference between the polynomial and super-exponential potential is for super-exponential potential, the purpose spectrum stay very away, far away from the imaginary. From the imaginary I6.
