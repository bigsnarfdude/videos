Okay, so I'm very pleased to introduce our next speaker. Please introduce our next speaker, Sabine Ami, and he will talk about entire solutions of the anoisotropic infra-lollow system. Thank you very much, Lecomo, for the introduction. Thanks a lot for organizing this conference. Also, thanks to the anonymous person who left some bits of fancy Korean shock that I'm very happy to be using now. And also, I'm going to present some joint work with Michael Rashik. Joint work with Michael Raschik from Santa Ro and Panaiotis Myrnadis, who must be in Athens now, I think. On some solutions of PD, which I'm going to write down now. So my PD is the following. So you have minus Laplacian of U, and then the anisotropic part. Okay, so this is actually a system of PD here, the map U goes from R2 into R2, and I have a parameter delta, which is my anisotropy parameter, which is going to be between minus 1 and 1. And when delta equals 0, there is no anisotropy. Okay, so where does this equation come from? It comes from this Instruct Lander energy that we have seen already a few times. So basically solutions of this system, they are critical points of the following energy, E delta. So I'm going to restrict myself to domain because in all of R2, most of the time is the energy. Most of the time the energy will be infinite. So I have my usual red square and then the anisotropic part is just this Aussian Franc type thing where you can analyze differently splay and band. And okay, here I wrote. Band and okay, here I wrote it in a way that is not the way we've seen it written in all the talks this week. So let me write it in this different way. Okay, so I can rewrite this energy with the usual uh two elastic different elastic constants. Uh here, so this would be my splay elastic constant. Here, this would be my band elastic constant. I am in 2D, so there is no twist. And so, the only reason to write it like that is that that way I mean delta equals zero is really the isotropic case, and I want to think of delta as. Case and I want to think of deltas as a kind of perturbative parameter. And when I do this modification here, I lose some boundary terms that I did not write down. I mean, this is, I think Daniel already showed us this calculation that basically what you, I mean, you lose these boundary terms. But since I'm interested in solutions of the equation, this doesn't change critical points. Okay, so this is basically like a Basically, like the most simple phenomenology for a phase transition. So, U is in R2. So, here this potential wants you to take values into S1. So, you think of it as the most simple model of the transition between isotropic and pneumatic. And okay, here I have this one force here because basically I want to think about I want to think about this question as I have zoomed in at the scale of the defect core. So what it does when I zoom in at the scale of the defect core is basically I have my two terms in the energy. Basically they come with constants that are comparable. I am at the scale where I see really the competition between this grayton part, this elastic part, and this ordering part. Part and this ordering part, and this is also why now I think that I am in all of R2 because I think of the scale of the defect core as being very small. I have zoomed in and I see an entire solution. Okay, I think I'm writing much too big, so I will have to be erasing my word all the time. But the question I am asking and partially answering. Is the following very basic one. Do there exist solutions of this equation? So when I say entire solutions, I mean it's because they are defined in the whole plane. Entire solutions with a prescribed topological charge, which I'm doing. Which I'm going to call a degree, or maybe a winding number, which is my number D and Z. Okay, so this is my question. Very basic. It's really, I guess, a mathematician's question, because uh in physics I mean the objects just exist, right? But uh I I will try to convince you that it has also some tiny physical relevance. Tiny physical relevance to ask this question. So, maybe before going to that, let me just be slightly more precise about what I mean by the green-wending number, even though it's probably clear to everyone. So, I want to think about solutions that whose modulus, whose norm goes to one at infinity, so that when I am on a circle very far Very far from the origin, I can think of them as maps into S1 and then I can differentiate the two. So the way you impose that the modulus goes to one at infinity is just by saying that this potential energy is finite in the whole space, right? So this must be very small at infinity. And then you ask that the winding number around any uh big circle uh is this number t. Is this number to write. Okay. And the winding number is since you ante x value go into S1, you can define its phase and you just count the number of turns it makes when you go around once around the second point. Okay, so those are the basic objects, and my basic question here. And in some sense, you might think that, okay, existence of solutions is not, I mean, why should we care? In some sense, I mean, this is, I mean, this point that we are just. This is I mean this point that they are just that I'm zooming in at the scale of the defect core. So if there exists such an entire solution, then this is really my profile, and then to understand what the defect looks like, I just have to rescale this fixed profile. So in some sense, if there is no such solution, it's kind of saying that you change the scale, you see a different profile. So that would be something quite weird and it's kind of about understanding that kind of effect. The other reason I'm interested. The other reason I'm interested in is that it turns out that as soon as delta is not zero, this question becomes much more difficult than when delta is zero. So remember in Daniel's talk, there was this thing about the one-constant approximation. Usually you expect things to behave kind of similarly in the one-constant approximation, or even when the constants are a little bit different. And one thing I want to kind of convince you of here is. You of here is that as soon as you lose the isotropy, as soon as you have a non-zero delta, then many of the mathematical tools that you have to analyze these things, they're gone. And you need to do something else, and sometimes it's very hard to understand it. All right. So let me start with the isotropic case, then the one constant case. Where basically we understand quite well how to answer that question. So what I call isotropic case is really what was called, in one talk, the one constant approximation. It's just I take the variable zero. Then my equation is this. Okay. So again, u from R2 into R2. So you see, I mean, this is a system of PDEs, right? But really, if you just look at the part with the derivatives, it's not really a system, and it's diagonal. It's the Laplacian of the first component and the Laplacian of the second component. This structure we lose as soon as delta is non-zero. This is a large part of the difficulty. But we have this diagonal structure. Uh but we have this diagonal structure and now it just so happens that you can use a radial ansat to look for solutions like that. You take any number D and then you look for a solution in this radial form, this symmetric form so u of r e to the i theta in the form f of r times e to the i d. times e to the i d theta. So all the, so those are my polar coordinates, the radius and the angle. And I put all the topology in the angular coordinate and then this is just to solve the P D. So here basically we have to think that profile F of R it is between 0 and 1 it is 0 at 0. It is zero at zero to have something smooth because it is singular, and it goes to one at infinity, kind of like that, monotonically. F of zero is zero, f of infinity is one. And basically, I mean, once you realize that you can look for solutions like that, what you have to solve is not a P D anymore, it's just an OD for this radio profile. Right, so you have this you reduce everything to this one D problem. Everything to this 1D problem. And this 1D problem has been studied, so it's still not completely fragile because you are in this infinite line, so there are some issues with the brightness, but it's not that bad. And this has been understood in the 90s. So, okay, see that this one. Simply does this work by Hervé and Hervé, and simultaneously by Chen, Elliott, and Xi. Okay, if you want the complete name later, I can back to you. Hervé and Hervé and Chen Elotting. And G, and this is Pelotin from E. It was in 1994. So they studied this 1D problem with two different metals. They proved that such an object exists. object exists. By the way, even in this isotropic case, there is still a famous, okay, at least to some people, open question which is are those the only solutions? Do there exist non-retail solutions? Okay, so this is something many very good people have tried to prove and they've failed so far, as far as I know. So just to tell you that, I mean, looking for non-radial solutions of these equations, this is something that usually is very hard. And what I'm going to tell you in a second is that we will have to find non-radial solutions of our system. But we have some structure to help us, of course. Of course. Alright, so that's those are my the 3D solutions in the isotropic case. Now what if you are with a non-zero data? Just one question. Um my data is simple. Um So, I mean, this is the time when uh of uh this BBH book, Metriel Resistance, which was mentioned already a few times. And so, people wanted to understand this Ginzburg-Lange equation, which is when delta equals zero is what people were calling the Ginsburg-Lander equation at the time. And so, one of the things we want to do, again, as I said, is zooming on a singularity, and you zoom in in the singularity, and you see an entire solution of this equation. So, that's why people. Solution of this equation, so that's why people wanted to understand that. That was actually a series of articles in the 90s about this equation. Sorry, but this is appropriate for the superconductor case. Right. Right, so this is exactly about the superconductor case. It's just not the loop of this case. Yeah, I mean, at the end, the way I look at it is like. I mean the way I look at it is like it's just kind of this paradigm of a phenomenological model where you have this kind of transition from between isotropic and S1 values, some kind of orientational ordering. But there, yeah, I mean I don't think this is the actual right thing for the superconductor, right? You have the effect of the magnetic field and this gauge model, right? So it's more of a toy model as I see. But it's a surface toy model. And the energy, the energy, the magnetic magnetic field surface. I guess it depends how you see it. But you're right. I'm telling you something about a model that is appropriate for specific liquidity. Appropriate for specific liquid crystal situations. Although I think, I mean, I've seen papers where exactly those equations are used to model some thin films of liquid crystals, but I'm not an expert on the modeling things. Okay, so what we really want to understand today is this anisotropic case where delta is non-zero. Uh is non-zero, still with absolute value uh less than one. And okay, the first thing you try, obviously, is you try your radio lensats, right? Uh, what happens to the radio lens? Well, sometimes it works, but not very often. So radial solutions, when I say radial solutions, I mean that's like that, exist only. If the decree is one, and okay, I could have, of course, here I chose a special value of the initial, I mean somehow of the phase at angle of zero, but I could have added a constant phase here. And you can find a register only if the degree is one and this theta zero is equal to zero module. equal to zero modulo pi over two. Somehow you break this symmetry of this of this rotation. But most importantly you can do this only for degree one. As soon as you have a different degree then you put these ad sets into the equation and you see that it will never be a solution. I guess unless maybe everything is zero. So, the main point I want to make here is that we cannot reduce our question to a OD problem, to a 1D problem, as soon as the degree is different from 1. So, we have to do something else. And the fact that this question is still open tells you that, okay, maybe it's not, I mean, at least we mathematicians were having trouble. We are having troubles dealing with that kind of questions. And of course, I think probably the most relevant physical case, okay, maybe I'm wrong, but I think it's the degree minus one. Because in some sense, I mean, you expect to see the effects of the V1 and minus one, and the other ones that will probably not be stable. So here, the really annoying part is that you can do the V1, but not. The annoying part is that you can do the B1 but not the B minus 1. But you would like to at least be able to say something about the W minus 1 case. So let me state a theorem. Okay, maybe enough space here to state. So that's with Mike and Plana Jotis. It's actually not that recent, it was published two years ago. Okay, so Okay, so we can do doubly minus one and actually all other negative doubles. But what we're really happy about is that it includes this. And we need delta to be a bit small. So there is an explicit threshold depending on the degree below which, if the anisotropy is below that threshold, then we are able to prove. And we are able to prove the existence of solutions. So if the degree is less than or minus one and the anisotropy is not too big, then there exists solutions with the VT. So solutions in that system I wrote before and which hasn't erased. And which has been erased. And when I say solutions of double-d, I mean they satisfy this condition, which implies that I can define the double D, and it's actually that prescribed number. Okay, that's the statement, and now I want to spend the remaining 20 minutes including questions. Okay, so I guess the remaining 10 minutes telling you a little bit about. Minutes telling you a little bit about the ideas of the proof of that model. And okay, telling you about the edges, about the proof of that result, and also maybe giving you a little bit more insight about why this regular at that works for the Greek one and That works for degree one and fails for other degrees. Okay, so first let me make a very simple comment is that basically the degree condition implies that the energy in the whole space will have to be infinite. Okay, which means that you won't be able to just find a critical point by saying I minimize the energy. Okay, if I'm minimizing and everything has an infinite value, this won't help. So basically what you do is very natural. Instead of minimizing the energy in the whole space, you want to minimize in a finite disk, right? So basically you want to minimize the energy. The energy in the disk of Regis R and you want to see what happens when R goes to infinity. So basically that's the plan. What can go wrong when you do that? What can go wrong is that basically you lose the information about the topology. And you may lose it. What's hard is to make sure that you still have your degree condition. Somehow the fact that Somehow, the fact that you're in infinite space, something like may escape to infinity and then you lose all topology. So that's really the issue. The question is: when I do that, do I conserve the degree? The degree that I had imposed here, by the way, by with some boundary conditions on this finite device. Um and of course if you have a radial Anzat, your degree is built into the Anzat. Is built into the ANZAT. So that's not an issue. You minimize over your radial ANZATs and you have JoW. There's basically nothing else to do. Here, that's another story. So the proof is basically in two steps. The first is to find, so what saved us in the isotropic case that we have this symmetry, right? We could minimize with this radial and that in this case. This radial answer, and this gave us the topology. So, the game here is to also find a symmetry condition that will impose some constraints on the topology. So, this is really the first step, minimization in a symmetric class, which will not be regal, which imposes not exactly, does not Not exactly, it does not fix the degree, but it does impose a restriction on it, which is the following: the degree of U must be some number capital D, which could be D, but could be also D plus any integer multiple of 2 times 1 minus D. And you will see in a minute how. And you will see in a minute how this pops up. But somehow, okay, this is what you get. So you don't know that degree is z, but you know it's one of these integers which are not all integers. So you already have a little bit more information. Also, one thing that you can check is when d is less than or equal to minus one, zero is never here, right? So at least you still are topologically non-trivial, which is already. Reveal, which is already, I guess, something good to know. That's the first step. And then the second step is to rule out all these other possibilities, basically. Sorry, I said something wrong. No, sorry, I I said something wrong before. We still have a lot of time. Really? Okay. Well, I will stop when you tell me to stop. Okay, the second step would be, and this is where we use that delta should be small. So basically, by the first step, we obtain some interval. By the first step, we obtain some entire solutions, and that have some topological information, but not exactly the one we want. But what we do know is they have some minimizing property in our symmetric class. And then what you want to do is to use the fact that they are minimizing to deduce that, in fact, the absolute value of this degree should be minimizing in here. Because, I mean, basically, degrees with a higher absolute value, you think that it costs more energy. Absolute value, you think that it costs more energy. And it happens that in this class, when B is less than or equal to minus one, the minimizing the one with minimizing absolute values is actually different. So that's what makes the proof more. So for that personal, you want to use minimality to show that the degree that you have should be minimal within this class. You have should be minimal within this class. You should have a minimal absolute value with respect to everyone else in the class. And then it's just like a quick calculation to show that, in fact, the minimizer of the absolute value within the class is supported. So that's the proof basically. And if you give me a few more minutes, I will just tell you a little bit about this first step. I mean, what symmetries do we impose? This is really like the... Here there is a lot of analysis, but here this is basically algebra. We just look at the symmetries of our equations and we understand what we could or could not impose. So that's step one. Symmetries. Symmetries. Okay, so obviously these equations have some physical motivation, so they must have some invariance, some frame invariance. And frame invariance is in this 2D concept context is you take a rotation, any rotation, you rotate your coordinates, and then if you rotate backwards. And then, if you rotate backwards your field with the same rotation, this leaves everything inviolate, the energy and the equation. Okay, this is frame invariance. There is another invariance in the equation, which is you could just multiply your flow by minus one. This is also easy, so you could have everything invariant. And kind of the catch here is that for delta zero, you actually have many more significant. You actually have many more CMFs. And this is what made it possible to look for radial solutions. Because for delta equals zero, you could also decide to rotate only the variable, or you could decide to rotate only the image. And those would be symmetries of your equations. And in some sense, I mean, this is kind of a In some sense, I mean, this is kind of a. I don't know if there is a physical reason why it should be those symmetries, right? In general, I mean, this is the actual frame invariance, and this is really much more symmetry. And this is what made it possible to look for these radial solutions there. So, okay, in our case, we have delta non-zero, so we just have these symmetries to play with. And out of these symmetries, we want to impose some inverse. Impose some invariance with respect to them that implies some topological condition. Or maybe let me first give an example of invariance. You could say, Okay, let me look at all the solutions that are invariant with respect to all this transformation, right? All this transformation, right? And this is exactly being radially symmetric of the V1. So this is the special role of the W1 that you see here. Variance under U max 2 minus AI alpha U to the I alpha Z for all alpha in R implies basically that u of R e i theta. That q of r e i theta is equal to f r e to e i theta. Okay, for some complex value, f may be a fool. But the point is, here you see your special role of the degree worker up here. And if you have all these other things to play with, you can also impose this regional symmetry with other degrees, but this is something you cannot do when you have numbers. 17 minutes. Really? Because we start the day. But okay. So every time I will ask, I will get 20 minutes more. No, no, no. Anyway, we just need five more minutes. But if you say one of the common paper. Well, I could do that probably. Certainly not. This is your thinking, maybe. Now, let me just give you this symmetric class that we use. So, here what we want to use is a finite group of symmetries, which is very natural, which has just one generator generated by Generated by, or basically, I will do a composition of these two things. So I will take minus e to the minus i pi over 1 minus t u of to be i pi over 1 minus t times z. Okay, so what did I do here? I chose a special angle alpha. angle alpha pi over 1 minus d and I compose it also with this multiplication by minus 1. And it just so happens that, so basically what's going on here? I have this angle right, pi over 1 minus d which is positive because d is negative. And if I know my solution in this If I know my solution in this wedge here, then I use the symmetry and I can just know what it looks like in the whole space, right? So I have this fundamental domain of the symmetry group. And so that's one thing. And in fact, if you do this and you try to understand what the phase does, you realize that if u is metric, so if it's invariant under that thing, then Um then exactly what I said. The degree of u is equal to d modulo two times one minus d. Okay, and maybe just one more small picture. I mean I said the case which is the most interesting is degree d equal to minus one, then in that case one minus d is just 1 minus d is just 2. So in that case, I'm really looking at a four-fold symmetry, right? Okay? You know the solution here, then you know it everywhere. And if I take more negative degrees, then it is n-fold symmetry for the relevant n. Okay, and basically, okay, from then, then it's, so this is the algebraic part. Then you use some known methods of this inspiration. Of this Inspoglando theory to show that you have a minimizer in the whole space, local minimizer, an entire solution within that symmetry constraint. Probably Jacquel Mo has done something related to that. So this is how you complete step one of obtaining a solution which has this partial topological constraint, and then you do a lot more analysis to actually show what I said that. To actually show what I said, that the degree of U must minimize its absolute value among all the possible degrees. And that's, I mean, there you need a little bit more dirty estimates that I won't show you. And then you're done. You have your theorem. And okay. Maybe let me just mention quickly because if you give me one minute. Because we left many questions open, this is what I wanted to mention. One open question is, okay, in fact, this symmetric solution we have all the time, right? We don't need delta to be small. So the natural question is what happens to the symmetric solution if delta is not small? So again, our small is completely explicit, is that maybe for the V minus one, it's delta less than, I don't know, one-third or something like that. So it's not a perturbative argument, it's really quantitative, but still we don't know if the symmetric solution could do some weirder stuff. I I mean uh my conjecture would be that it doesn't at least in maybe minus one. I don't know how to show it. I don't know how to show it. Okay, and then it's related to, of course, to answering my question when delta is in the whole range of possible deltas. And maybe let me just mention another open question is can we answer the question for higher positive degrees? Which maybe are not physically relevant, but still for a mathematician it's a little bit annoying that we cannot do that. That we cannot do that. And I'll stop here. Thank you very much for this talk. Are there any questions? Leanne has had a question. Can you give us at least a little idea of where you need this constraint and the delta to be able to get your question? This is the next five minutes of my talk. No, I have time to be quick. So, what's the idea there? We want to say that having a degree with too high modulus, it costs too much energy, right? So, there are two steps. Basically, we want to say first that since we are minimizing... Okay, first there is always a lower bound of the energy. Right? E delta of U in a ball of radius R. You know that for the classical. Register. You know that for the classical Hinsburg lander, if you have degree D, you're gonna pay D squared times the logarithm of R for your degree D, right? And here, I mean, if I consider like a perturbative setting, I have to pay minus delta just to go back to the classical lower one. So basically, here I'm doing nothing. I'm just saying this one is larger than some factor times the isotropic one, then I draw. Theisotropic one, then I use the lower bound and the isotropic one. So this is just using very fast stuff. And then the part where you really do something is to show an upper bound, which is basically saying, okay, here again you pay a little bit of anisotropy and you divide on what we have. What we have okay so this is what it looks like basically what what is it saying if I impose some symmetry and I know I am minimizing within my symmetric class then I can write down that my energy is less than the energy of any symmetric competitor and what am I doing here? Basically I have with the symmetry constant Basically, I have, with the symmetry constraint, I have to put one defect of W with D somewhere. Okay, this is why I paid this D square here. But in fact, the other defects that maybe I have, by the way, this capital D, this thing, maybe it will not be that. The other defects that I may have, I mean, I just choose to put them kind of far away and make them escape to infinity somehow. And that way, I pay, this is much less than capital D squared when D is. D squared when D is not equal to, when capital D is not equal to small D. That way I pay much less energy. But of course, when I do that, when I say that, I lost all the time this minus delta plus 3 delta. So this is why I need delta to be smaller. But again, this is just, then you write that this has to be smaller than this. And you just, it's just an algebraic equation that you can solve and see that if delta is small enough with an explicit expression in terms of. Explicit expression in terms of G, then capital D has to be equal to this one. I'm wondering what do the transitions look like in the magnitude of u going from sort of zero up to one? Is there anything known about that in this case? You mean I have like uh the degree defect at the center to the view right there. You have the magnitude of view right there. Right, okay. From zero out to one. So it is smooth because I have a PDE that gives me smoothness, right? It goes to one at infinity kind of uniformly, but not as uniformly as in the regional case. It won't be radial. I don't know if I'm answering your question. Does it always stay less than one? That's not even clear. Clear. No, no, it's not clear in that case. It stays probably less than one plus some constant times delta, but I don't think we can show that it stays less than one. But I also cannot show that it doesn't. But do you have an expectation on that? No, this is one of the very annoying things with this anisotropic setting. Is when it's isotropic, showing that the solution is less than one, it's basically a one-nine. Solution is less than one, it's basically a one-line argument. And in the anisotropy case, I don't think anyone has any idea how to do this sharp bound, point-wise bound. I have a question, and just a very stupid one, but I'm pretty sure you have thought about it. Instead of considering the radial answers, one could consider, say, a different answer in which you prescribe the angular dependence. Describe the angular dependence, which is one which has obeyed on a curve, which is not a circle. Then extend it up to infinity to construct a series of unsettled. Yeah, right. We want to do some other kind of separation of variables, but not with respect to this rate of symmetry. Uh we've tried a little bit to have this, I mean, one-dimensional answers, but really I believe actually But really, I believe actually it's not possible. Actually, the solution will never be one damage. So, I mean, okay, we've tried and we've not succeeded. Maybe it's just because we were not smart enough. But I think one really has to go through these really 2D solutions. This is my belief ration of the time. The idea would just consider to leave the curve unknown and just minimize on the profile of the curve. That works. I mean, I don't know. You must have done You must have done but you still need to send it to infinity, right? The you s simply take a homogeneity. So there is only one curve which is actually a normal. And you minimize the energy and this kind of retraction argument. Right, but I think if I understood what you meant, what you mean correctly, unless you end up with something with a 1D symmetry, this does not really This does not really take care of our issue that we don't know how to send those things to infinity. I mean, we don't know how to conserve the topological constraint when we send these finite objects to infinity. You prescribe the fate of the curve. Well, that's what we do here. But when you send it to infinity, you don't know what goes on with your limit solution. Maybe something escaped to infinity and you need to see it somehow. Because I mean, what we do when we minimize in the finite domain is really prescribing something very nice, the nicest possible thing on the curve. Nicest possible thing on the curve, which in our case is a single circle, but somehow it doesn't help at all. It helps a little bit to prove the existence in the symmetric case, but that's all it does for us. Just one very simple question. Why is it called, and it's just a terminology question because I'm not familiar at all. What's the Bordec solution like? I guess just because you have this I guess just because you have this winding number, so I guess it's an analogy with the fluid dynamics where you really have vertices. It's really the fact that you have a winding number. And I mean the symmetries you were going to work with, or you had to kind of like figure it out a little bit. No, I mean we played around a little bit with the symmetries until we found that that one had this nice feature. Very well. So I suppose we should run up to speak a little bit.
