Today, I'm going to be talking about some work that I did with Matt Lapa. It's in this preprint that we posted, I guess, this summer. And basically, the main subject of this talk and our paper is a phenomenon that occurs in certain gapped many-body systems, which we want to try to understand better. Want to try to understand better. And so, what is this phenomenon? It's basically the fact that some gapped many body systems have a property that they have some number of nearly degenerate ground states. And so here's supposed to be like a plot of the energy spectrum of one of these types of systems. I'll give some examples soon. And so they have, this is the spectrum. You'll have lots of states up here. You'll have a gap. And then below the gap, you have a number, you have a collection. Below the gap, you have a number, you have a collection, usually a finite number of nearly degenerate ground states. And importantly, in these systems, the splitting between these ground states is exponentially small in the system size. L is supposed to be like the, say, linear system size of your system. And so some many-body systems have this sort of exponentially exact or nearly exact ground state degeneracy. And furthermore, in these systems, this is a kind of robust. In these systems, this is a kind of robust phenomenon. So it doesn't require fine-tuning parameters. If you perturb the system a little bit, you'll still see it. Okay, so you'll still see this nearly exact degeneracy. And so what are some examples of these systems? So I have here sort of four of maybe the most well-known examples. So one class of examples are 2D topological phases, phases with anion excitation. Phases with anion excitations. And so, if you take such a system and you define it in a torus geometry, it's believed in general and proven in many cases that you will find some finite number of degenerate ground states, and the splitting between them again will be exponentially small in the system size. Another example, well-known example, is if you take any two-dimensional topological phase that has non-abelian anion excitations, then again, as long as those you're dealing with some. You're dealing with some ground. I'm just thinking about here of a ground state that contains some number of anions trapped in some positions in space. As long as those anions are separated by some large distance L, again, you'll find some degeneracy that's exponentially small in their separation. A third example are one, it's one-dimensional systems, these so-called one-dimensional topological superconductors, first really pointed out by Alexei Kateev. And if you take these sort of superconducting wires with open boundaries. Superconducting wires with open boundary conditions, again, you get a ground state degeneracy, which is exponentially small in the as ground state splitting, which is exponentially small in the length of the wires. And a final example, really the oldest example, are systems that have symmetry breaking and discrete symmetry breaking. So in these systems, again, you get some degeneracy. So I should mention, by the way, that this degeneracy is actually of practice. Is actually of practical interest, especially the first three examples, because it can maybe be potentially used for quantum computing or quantum memory, having these nearly degenerate ground states. They have potential practical applications. So people are, I think, interested in really realizing a system that has this kind of protected or this kind of exponentially small splitting. So, what is the question that we're thinking about? We're thinking about. So, the main question is basically: if you look at the arguments, rigorous arguments, at least, maybe really any arguments for why you expect to see this robust exponentially small splitting. These arguments are really for systems with short-range interactions. So, here by short-range, I mean finite range or maybe exponentially, maybe we could allow interactions with some kind of exponential tail. Interactions with some kind of exponential tails. But those are kind of the class of systems where one can really prove that you'll get this behavior. And the question we want to think about is what about long-range interactions? Does this degeneracy occur in such systems? And can we prove it? And here by long range, the canonical example will be sort of power law interactions. So I'm thinking about, you know, So, I'm thinking about some kind of power law like a Coulomb interaction, for example. Can this degeneracy persist in these systems? Because the sort of previous arguments really don't apply to these power law systems. Now, you might ask, why should one worry about long range interactions? There are a couple of reasons. So, one reason is that they're relevant to many experimental systems. So, for example, in that slide I showed us a minute ago with I showed us a minute ago with, you know, I said 2D topological phases are one of the most well-known systems that have these degeneracy. Well, the most well-known realization of 2D topological phases is fractional quantum Hall systems. And typically in a fractional quantum Hall system, you have a Coulomb interaction, which is a power law interaction. And also topological superconductors, another very important experimental candidate system will typically have a kind of a long-range Coulomb interaction. So in many systems, So, in many systems where we really want to find this kind of degeneracy, we actually will have long-range interactions. So, it's important to understand: will those long-range interactions mess it up, or will this nice degeneracy persist? The other reason I think to think about this question is just kind of conceptual, which is just, you know, we know topological phenomena like degeneracy and statistics require some Require some level of locality. Locality is certainly important at some level, but how much locality is really necessary? Is it enough for it to just be few body, for interactions to be few body, or do they actually have to be local in space? And if they have to be local in space, how local do they have to be? So that's another reason I think it's kind of interesting to think about this. Okay, so now this problem about Now, this problem about thinking about this degeneracy, the simplest context where we can kind of pose the question is as a stability question. So, that's kind of the way I'm going to discuss in this talk. And here by stability problem, the setup will be very similar to what Bruno was talking about earlier today. So, basically, we want to think of some situation like this. Let's imagine this sort of the simplest situation where we can pose this question. Suppose we have some H naught, which is some nice example. Some H0, which is some nice, exactly solvable Hamiltonian. Typically, it would be commuting, frustration-free, have all the as many nice properties as you want. And it would also be some kind of short-range, say finite range Hamiltonian, and it'll have some kind of exact ground state degeneracy. Okay, so H naught might be like the Tor code model, for example. And then the question we want to ask is: we want to imagine adding some generic interaction, V. Interaction V, which may have short-range and long-range parts. And then Lambda here is supposed to be some coupling constant or something. And so in this context, the question becomes, what happens when we turn on Lambda, non-zero Lambda? When Lambda is zero, we have this nice exact ground state degeneracy. But can one prove that when you turn on a finite lambda, that the ground state degeneracy, the splitting is exponentially small in the system size? Small in the system size. So, okay, so this is kind of the question. So, what happens when we turn on lambda not equals zero? And there's kind of two questions that one needs to answer. One is, does the gap stay open? And here by open, of course, I mean open in the limit of arbitrarily large system size. For any finite system size, the gap will stay open for small lambda, but I'm interested in whether the gap stays open for arbitrary lambda. In whether the gap stays open for arbitrarily large system size. So, does the gap stay open? And then, also, and this is the real question that we're interested here, is does the ground state splitting, is it exponentially small in system size? So these are the questions we want to answer. And in this talk, I really want to emphasize I'm mostly interested in the second question. So, we will answer the first question, but to some extent, there are already some. To some extent, there are already some previous results that show gaps stay open in systems with long-range interactions. But what hasn't been, as far as I know, really discussed is what happens to the ground state splitting. So I'm mostly going to be interested in question number two, but of course, we also have to answer question one to even really pose question two. So again, so this is the question. And again, there's two classes of Vs you could think about: short-range Vs and long-range Vs. And in the short-range V, this kind of stability. And in the short-range V, this kind of stability question has really been answered and proven that you can prove that the gap stays open and the splitting is exponentially small in many cases. I have some of the references listed here, but it's proven for many classes of H0. They're typically frustration-free, but many classes of frustration-free H0, these questions have been proven. But for long-range V, basically, as far as I know, at least the second question, there's Far as I know, at least the second question, there's really, we don't know anything about this. So that's kind of what we want to understand is that's what I want to talk about. Okay, so what I want to do before I talk about the long range or explain our result, I want to first kind of review some of the arguments for this, particularly this arguments for this exponentially small split. This exponentially small splitting in the case of short-range interactions. And then I'll try to explain why some of those arguments run into difficulties in long-range interactions and then how we overcome them. Okay, so to explain the arguments in the short-range case, I'm going to just focus on a simple example, which is a one-dimensional, so it's a one-dimensional, it's the transverse field icing model. But what is it for people who aren't familiar with that? But what is it for people who aren't familiar with that? It's just a, I'm thinking about a one-dimensional spin chain of some finite length L, spin one half chain. And there's two terms. So the unperturbed Hamiltonian just has this Ising interaction, sigma Z, sigma Z. Here sigma is the Pauli spin operator. And then the perturbation V is just going to be this, what people call the transverse field. It's sigma X. And so this is the transverse field icing model. the transverse field icing model and of course this model this is a model for a um um a um yeah a model for a system with it symmetry breaking right so it has an icing symmetry which is this product of um sigma x uh so this commutes with our hamiltonian um okay so um let's first before we talk about um the first thing we have to understand is the ground The first thing we have to understand is the ground states of H0. So, H naught, of course, has two exactly degenerate ground states. And I've written them here. So, up arrow means the sigma z equals plus one state, spin up. So, the two states are these plus and minus sort of cat states. They're a superposition of the up, up, up, up, up state and the down, down, down, down, down state with either plus or minus sign. And you may wonder why did I write these weird combinations and not just up, up, up, and down, down, down? Of course, I could have chosen those also. Down, of course, I could have chosen those also as degenerate ground states, but these two states are better to work with because they have a nice symmetry quantum number. So, plus is in what we might call within the sector with s equals plus one. So, I'm going to denote that by H plus. So, that's the subspace of states which are even, even parity under this symmetry. And minus is in the subspace, the odd parity subspace, the space with s equals minus one. So, these are two states. With s equals minus one. So these are two states that are better to work with because once we turn on our perturbation, of course, they're the states that will get selected. The ground states will look like plus and minus and not like up, up, up and down, down, down. Okay, so these are our two states. And then our question is, what happens when we turn on lambda not equals zero? How do these states split? So what I'm going to review are two arguments for kind of estimating the size of that splitting or proving a bound on the size of the splitting. So the first approach. The splitting. So the first approach is based on quasi-adiabatic continuation. It was already kind of explained in this original paper on quasi-adiabatic continuation. And so for this approach, we're going to actually assume the energy gap stays open. I'm just at least the way I'm going to phrase it. We're going to assume the energy gap stays open. And then given that, we'd like to try to come up with some argument about how big the splitting is. So if we assume the energy gap stays open, then our picture will look something like this. So this is supposed to be the energy spectrum. Something like this. So, this is supposed to be the energy spectrum as a function of lambda. So, when lambda is zero, we have these two degenerate states, and there's a gap. The green is supposed to be like the states above the gap. And as we turn on lambda, they're going to split in some way, but by our assumption, they stay below the gap. And the two states they split into, I'm going to call plus lambda and minus lambda. So, our goal is to understand this splitting between plus and minus. So, to do that, we're going to use quasi-adiabatic continuation. Quasi-adiabatic continuation. And according to quasi-adiabatic continuation, assuming the gap stays open, there's a unitary U lambda with two properties. So the first property is that this U Lambda basically takes you from the unperturbed states to the perturbed states. It transforms plus and minus to these plus minus lambdas. So it takes you from the state here to the two states here. The second property, which is crucial, is that this u lambda is locality preserving. So what do I mean by that? Well, if you What do I mean by that? Well, if you consider how it acts on operators by conjugation, if you start with some local operator, like a single site spin operator, and you conjugate by u lambda, this operator will be basically local. It will be super polynomially local. What I mean by that is it'll be local up to some error, which decays faster than any polynomial. The tails will decay faster than any polynomial. So it takes local operators to operate. So, it takes local operators to operators that are local up to superpolynomial tails. And it also takes the ground states to the perturbed ground states. Okay, so, and I should say this, these superpolynomial tails are derived from Lieb-Robinson bounds, as Bruno kind of discussed, I think, a little bit earlier. Okay, so because this U lambda, the reason it comes from a sleeve-Robinson bound is this U lambda is written as the time evolution of some. Written as the time evolution of some local Hamiltonian. So using the Robinson bounds, you then know that it preserves locality. Okay, so now how do we use this to estimate the gap? Well, basically, we just compute the energy splitting of our perturbed, our perturbed state. So u lambda, remember, this is the energy splitting because u lambda times plus is just plus lambda. So this is that energy difference between the plus lambda state and the minus lambda state. Lambda state. And now to compute this energy difference, we note that the plus state, if you take this difference and you write plus, remember plus was a superposition of up and down, right? So if you plug that in here, you're going to get all the up, up, up states, you're going to get some cancellations. And your only term you're going to get is this cross term that involves up, up, up, and down, down, down. So one has to estimate this matrix. has to estimate this matrix element. But now is where this locality comes in because h is a sum of local operators and u lambda is a is locality preserving. So this is a sum of super polynomially local operators. So each term in here is local only acts on a few spins. But since it only acts on a few spins, it can't generate a matrix element between down, down, down, and up, up, up. The only operators that can generate a matrix element, they have to act on all the spins. So this thing is going to vanish. So, this thing is gonna vanish, it's gonna be exactly zero up to some super polynomial tails, you know, involving operators that act on all the spins. So, in this way, you get this an energy splitting, which it's not exponential, but it's super polynomially small. If you sort of upgrade this argument a little bit, you can make this exponential, but this is the same idea. So this is the basic idea of the argument. It shows that the splitting has to be smaller than any polynomial in L. Smaller than any polynomial in L. Okay, so this is the argument based on quasi-adiabatic continuation. Now, you might ask, what happens if you try to generalize this to the case where V is, say, a power law? So the main thing that goes wrong there, or maybe I shouldn't say go wrong, but the main thing that happens there is that now if you try to ask what this u lambda is, so let's again assume the gap stays open. Assume the gap stays open. Okay, so we can still do quasi-adiabatic continuation. We can still define a u lambda. But the problem now is that this u lambda, it will no longer have super polynomial tails. It will have polynomial tails. So if you take some local operator, O, the best, and this is the best you can hope for. So the best you can get is that it will take a local operator to an operator which has polynomial tails. And for sufficiently, yeah, so in some cases, one can prove. Yes, so in some cases, one can prove you get polynomial tails, but that's basically the best you can get. And since you have polynomial tails, that means that when you repeat that argument before, this thing will also have these sort of power law tails. So it will have, and so then that means that the best you can get in terms of the splitting bound is something that's power law. But we really want the real question here is whether the splitting is exponential. That's what we're interested in. That's the thing that would be interesting from a practical perspective as well. Practical perspective as well. And so you can see that quasi-adiabatic continuation doesn't really let you answer the question of, it gives you a weaker bound, only a power law bound. Michael, can I ask a quick question? So when you say that the best thing you can get is that the evolved O is polynomially local, I mean, I agree, but isn't it also true that it's, I mean, it's a sum of terms that are still not arbitrary polynomials? Not arbitrary body, but few body? Well, that, yeah, that's a very good question. We were confused, we wondered about this, right? So, can one prove that this operator u lambda only acts on a few spins and can't act on many spins? And I don't know, maybe someone can correct me, but I don't see a way to prove, to rule out the possibility that it acts on many spins. In fact, one can come up with problems. Fact, one can come up with protocols. Um, well, okay, I should maybe we can discuss a little bit afterwards, but there, I'm not even sure whether, in general, it's true. I'm not even sure whether, not only is a question whether you can prove it, I'm not even sure if it's true that this thing can't have an action on many spins with some polynomial tail. But I agree with you. My initial instinct, my initial intuition was that it can only act on a few spins. It can only act on a few spins. Even if it's not local in space, it can only act on a few spins. But I'm not aware of any argument for that. And now I'm starting to even doubt whether it's true. Does that answer your question? Yes, thank you very much. Yeah. No, but I think it's a crucial question. I'd be very interested to know if people know results that would give you some bound like that on not on the locality. It's like a Lee Robinson bound, but not on locality and space, but on. Not on locality and space, but on locality and operator space, sort of. And I don't know if there's a result that's strong, a result that would allow one to prove something like this. That would be, maybe that would be, if it existed, that would be great. But I'm not even sure it's true. So I'm not sure. Anyway, we can discuss it. So, certainly, in terms of results that are out there, as far as I know, there's no way to get better than a power law bound from this. And I should say in this paper, they do. Say in this paper, they do claim, I believe they do claim they can prove a power law bound for power law, some power law interactions. And it's basically, they don't use exactly this argument, but at the root of it, this is the reason why they only get a power law bound because they're using Lee Robinson with power law interactions. Okay, so this is one approach. The other approach for trying to estimate this splitting is basically perturbation theory. So the idea here is. So, the idea here is something like this. Imagine we were doing, we just did like naively just did Schrodinger perturbation theory, let's say. And then we could ask at what order in perturbation theory will we get a splitting between our two states? And the claim is that you're not going to get any splitting at all until you reach Lth order in perturbation theory. And the reason is that each order in perturbation theory, you get one power of v. But again, to kind of generate this matrix element between To generate this matrix element between up and down, you're going to need L v's. So basically, it's easy to see only at L-ford in perturbation theory do you get splitting. And so that at least naively suggests that your splitting will be of order lambda to the L. And then that's an exponential bound because it's exponential in L, right? Now, this is all fine, well, and good, but of course, to make this rigorous, you need to show that basically your perturbation theory converges and that has. Theory converges and that has some finite radius of convergence in the limit L goes to infinity, right? So, this is the crucial thing. One needs this finite radius of convergence. And if one has that, then you can basically make this type of argument rigorous. Now, to get this finite radius of convergence, at least one way to do it is to use a polymer expansion, also called a cluster expansion. And so, some of these papers use these expansions, and in some cases, they commented. Cases they commented on this splitting, the bound on the splitting. Okay, so that's great. So that's another way you can do it for short-range interactions. Now, the question is, can you do this for long-range interactions? And the answer, basically, the answer is yes. So, and that's what we're going to discuss. I'm going to discuss is that you can basically, this perturbation theory argument does seem to generalize, although there's some technical difficulties in developing this polymer expansion, cluster expansion with long-range. Cluster expansion with long-range interactions. There's some difficulty, I think they're actually fundamental difficulties. They're not just technical. So I'll explain them, but you can overcome those difficulties. And that's basically what I'm going to talk about. So the main result is that I'm going to describe an exponential splitting bound that exists for a large class of V. And the V's we'll consider are pretty generic. They can have short range part, they have short range part, and a long range part. The H naughts, I'm going to. Long range part. The H naughts I'm going to consider are not as general as I would like. So our result really only holds for symmetry breaking Hamiltonians. So that's the case where we can prove something. Okay, so that's our result. And what I'm going to try to do is explain our result in kind of a simple example. And at the end, I'll explain how it works more generally. But I think it's useful to start with kind of a prototypical example. So the kind of prototypical example we're going to think about. Kind of prototypical example we're going to think about is again kind of an icing model. So H naught is this one-dimensional icing model, finite chain. And now, but the V's we're going to talk about are going to have two pieces. One part is the usual transverse field piece, and the other is this a long range piece. Okay, so it's going to have long range sigma x, sigma x interactions. And f is some function which is going to characterize how long range these interactions are. And our result, of course, is going to, we're going to have to impose. Course, we're going to have to impose some requirements on f. So, not every f can we prove something. So, the requirement that we have to impose is something we call the summability condition, which is that if you take all the inter you have if you sum f all the interactions between some site J and all the other sites and take the absolute values, that's bounded by some constant, C naught. So the sum of all the interactions between one fixed spin and all the other spins is. Spins is bounded. Okay, and C naught, of course, is independent of L, the size of your system. So, what does this mean in practice? It means, for example, one can, the result I'm going to tell you applies to power laws as long as the power is greater than one, because you need this sum to not diverge. So it doesn't apply for one over R actually. Alpha has to be strictly greater than one for this to hold. Now, why do we need this summability condition? We need this summability condition? So, it's really related to something, which is that this summability condition guarantees that our perturbation, the operator norm of our perturbation, is at most C naught times L. Because, I mean, you just take the operator norm of this. For each spin, you get a C naught and then they're L of them. So you get, it kind of guarantees that the operator norm of V is extensive and not super extensive. So if you had V, which So if you had V, which went like one over R or one over smaller power, the operator norm of V would actually be, would grow faster than L. And because of that, as maybe I could comment later, you can get instabilities. So this is actually a crucial condition. If you violate this condition, it's easy to come up with counterexamples because the norm of V would be vastly larger than the norm of H naught. And so it's easy to construct examples where turning on V immediately, you immediately Immediately, you immediately get a transition to another phase. So, this is the condition we need, and it's essential. If you get rid of it, there's no way this result could hold in generality. So, okay, so with that, what's our statement? So, our statement is basically what you would expect. So, we say that there exists some lambda naught such that for our lambda smaller than lambda naught, everything works. So, the perturbed Hamiltonian has a unique ground state. Hamiltonian has unique ground state, unique ground state within each sector. So remember, there are these two sectors with plus parity and minus parity, has a unique ground state in each sector and a finite energy gap in those sectors. And the splitting between the two sectors, that's what we call the ground state splitting, is exponentially small in the system size. So that's our result. And now, so yeah, and so this is like the splitting between the plus state and the minus state. Splitting between the plus state and the minus state that we were discussing earlier. It's the ground state in the plus sector and the ground state in the minus sector. So, this is our result. And at least in this case, I'll describe a more general result at the end. So, what I want to do now is explain to you how the idea of the proof, how we prove this result. So, the idea of the proof is it's similar. As I said, it's going to be based on one of these polymer expansions, also. Polymer expansions, also known as cluster expansions. So it's similar in some ways to what Bruno was talking about with these loops, the loops and the space-time. So the basic idea is basically we're going to first try to understand, as he was doing, we're going to try to understand this partition function, e to the minus beta h, and then we're going to take the limit beta goes to infinity, and that way we'll get some statement about ground states. So we can define two parts. So we can define two partition functions in these two sectors, h plus and h minus, in this way. So it's just a trace over all the states in H plus or H minus. And we can also define our kind of unperturbed partition function, which is the same thing, but it's traced of e to the minus beta H naught. And this one doesn't depend on plus and minus. So that's why I don't have, it's easy to see the unperturbed state doesn't care whether you're in the plus or minus sector. So I just have a single Z naught, not a Z naught. Single Z naught, not a Z naught plus or minus. Okay, and then the basic idea is that you can, and this is kind of basic same idea as in time-dependent perturbation theory. You can write the partition function of your perturbed model as the partition function of your unperturbed model times some kind of sum over, you could call them, they're like diagrams. Like these are these, these, I'll explain what these are in a second, but you're going to kind of sum over all the possible instead. Operator insertions, where these v's can appear in different places in space-time. If you expand out, basically, if you expand out this e to the minus beta h in an appropriate expansion in v, you'll get a sum over terms with 1v, 2v's, 3v's, whatever. And the v's can appear at different points in space-time. So you get some of these sort of diagrams. And these x's are going to kind of describe where the v's are in space-time, and w is kind of the W is kind of the weight associated with that contribution that comes from that particular part of our expansion. So let me just say a little bit more about what this, what X's are and what these things look like. So a typical support set would look like this. So remember, we're working in space-time here. So beta is sort of our time direction, and L is our space direction. And so what are these support sets? They're basically collections. Support sets, they're basically collections of plaquette. They're geometrical objects that encapsulate where the Vs are acting in space-time. And they can be built out of various elements. So there's plaquettes. These are just regular plaquettes in, I should say we discretize time so that you break up beta into little pieces with some scale tau here. And then a plaquette is like a space-time plaquette, like this. A box is like something that's box is like something that's centered on a vertical bond and then dash lines these is this is really the most important new ingredient these things describe um whenever the the long range interactions so every time you have a dashed line that kind of describes a point in space-time where you act with two with a sigma x sigma x and the dashed line just tells you how they're pair off so i mean the details won't matter so much but the main point is that we're going to be summing over diagrams that kind of look like this and the crucial new element that comes with long range And the crucial new element that comes with long-range interactions is that we have these dotted lines that can go arbitrarily far distant in space. But they always go at the same point in time because these describe two perturbations that act at a particular point in time. So they're always at equal time, but they can be spaced, they can go arbitrary and distant in space. So these are what our support sets are. And so we're going to kind of be summing over them. Now, a crucial point about these. point about these support sets and their weights is that they have a factorization property, which is that here's suppose you take a support set, you can divide it into what we might call connected components. So what are the connected components? They're just pieces that aren't connected by anything, by doubted lines or anything. So for example, if X consisted of these diagrams, you would split into three pieces, chi one, chi two, and chi three. And these would be the connected components. These would be the connected components. And the crucial property of this model, which is very common in these types of situations, is that you have a factorization property. So the weight of this diagram, this support set, is a product of the weights of each of the connected components. And because of that, that factorization means you can do this polymer expansion. So what is a polymer expansion? It's just an expansion that lets you get the log of the partition function, or if you like, the free energy. And ideas, instead of And ideas instead of the polymers, the polymers are these connected components, these connected support sets. And so basically, the polymer expansion lets you write the log of the free energy, the log of the partition function as a sum over polymers, over the connected pieces, whereas the usual partition function is kind of a sum over the disconnected pieces. So it's just you kind of go from disconnected to connected, and you go from the partition function to the log of the partition function. The log of the partition function. So, because we have factorization, we can write down this cluster expansion. And then, the crucial thing, this is really the crucial issue, is we need to show this expansion converges. And this is not so easy to show because of these dotted lines, our polymers. We have to kind of do a sum over these polymers, but we have way more polymers than you normally have because they kind of can be connected to very distant points in space. So, to prove that the So, to prove that the expansion converges, the crucial thing you have to prove is a bound that looks something like this. So, you need to show you pick some point in space-time like V, and then you want to sum over all the connected polymers, all the connected support sets that contain V. So, that's what this sum is, to sum their weights. And you want to show that that sum is, let's say, less than one. Okay. And so you want to, now you can get some intuition for why a bound like this is the relevant thing. Why a bound like this is the relevant thing that you're interested in. The reason is that it's kind of, you can think of this as kind of the classic thing when people are energy versus entropy. So this thing, this sum is like, there's two contributions to this sum, right? So the first contribution are the weights. That's like the energetic cost of these configurations. And then the number of these configurations, that's like the entropy. Entropy of the configurations. And so, this is like the usual argument that people give with, like, say, the Ising model. You want to prove that the ordered phase is that the system is ordered. And you say, oh, we have to compare. We have to count all the possible domain walls. Those are like our support sets, the domain walls that go through some point. And we want to ask, there's a large number of those domain walls. That's the entropy, but they come at a cost, which is, you know, But they come at a cost, which is their Boltzmann weight. And if the energy dominates over the entropy, then the domain walls remain small and the system is ordered. But if it's the other way around, it disorders. So it's the same question here. Showing this is less than one is like showing that the energy dominates over the entropy. These support sets don't proliferate. And so we're in the same phase. In any case, this is the In any case, this is the crucial bound, and so one has to figure this out. And this is going to be hard because in the case of the icing model, you would just be summing over like one of these pieces, like something like this. But because of long-range interactions, we have to sum over these more complicated things with these dotted lines. And so, okay, so let me just quickly show you, give you a sense of how you get that estimate. So, how you could prove a bound like that. So, first of all, what do these weights look like? So, you can prove the weights, they have So, you can prove the weights. They have two pieces. The first piece is like lambda to the chi. So, that's just says chi is just the sort of the size of your support set, the number of plaquettes and boxes. So, this first piece just is the usual thing. It just says the large, it's a penalty for a support set being big. The second piece, this is kind of the new thing that you get in systems with long-range interactions, is we have these dashed lines. And so, this is the contribution each time you have a dashed line. Each time you have a dashed line, you have a factor of lambda because you have an insertion of your, you know, there's a lambda in front of your v. So the dashed lines correspond to interactions. So they always come with the lambda. And there's an F of R. And so this is the, if you erase the second factor, this would be like a standard cluster expansion for a short range model, but it's the second factor that makes it a little different. And so now, just to try to do that estimate, let's just think about like a simple case, the simplest case. Imagine I'm trying. Simplest case, imagine I'm trying to sum over this support sets that contain one dashed line like this. So you might worry that that dashed line is going to cause a big problem because we can put the second piece, the second gamma two piece anywhere in space. But what I want to just show you is that because of the summability condition, everything stays finite. So if you want to imagine we try to sum over all of these guys, sum over their weights. Imagine V is contained, let's say here, where my dot is. You need to sum over all of these guys. We need to sum over all of these guys. So each one of these guys comes with a factor of lambda to the gamma one plus gamma two. That's this first piece. And then the second piece, we get a factor of lambda times f of r, where r is the distance. But we want to sum over all of them. So we have to sum over all the displacements. And you might worry that sum is going to give you some huge factor. And so you're not going to be less than one. It's going to be greater than one. But because of our summability condition, the sum of f of r is just bounded by. Of f of r is just bounded by c naught. So this whole thing remains bounded. So you can see, at least in this simple case, for lambda sufficiently small, this is not going to be a big thing. Of course, you have to prove something much more complicated with many more dashed lines, and you have to treat much more complicated situations. But this gives you a hint that as long as you have some ability, this problem will be under control and the expansion will converge. Okay, so I realize it's just a sketch, but I just wanted to give you a flavor. A sketch, but I just wanted to give you a flavor that these dashed lines cause a combinatoric problem in terms of having many more polymers you have to sum over, but this problem is under control as long as you have this summability condition. Okay, so I guess that gives you the sketch of the argument. Once you prove that it converges, then as I said, having this splitting be exponential just follows just by the usual argument. Folllows just by the usual arguments. So, I just want to briefly tell you how our result generalizes, just so you get a better sense of what it means. So, here's one way you can generalize our results. So, we can go from our, I stated that a result in the one-dimensional case, we can generalize it to D-dimensions. And I, first, I explained it in the case of two-body interactions. You can generalize it to K-body interactions. So, here's kind of a more general class of models one can make a statement about. So, H naught will still. Statement about. So H naught will still be this Ising model, but now it's in D dimensions. V is going to be some sum of terms. This is our interaction with some spatially dependent coefficients. So we don't need translational symmetry. Each VR is a translation of a, they're translations. So T is supposed to denote translation. They're all translations of some V naught. What is V naught? So V naught is like all the interactions involving a particular site. Involving a particular site, zero. And it can be pretty much a generic K-body term. So it's a sum over Vy's, where each Y is some subset of K-sites, and Vy is supported on those K-sites. So this is kind of a generic K-body interaction where Y is kind of the denotes the sites where the interaction is acting. So V-naught can kind of be a sum of K-body interactions. Of k-body interactions acting as long as they act at the point zero, and then this is just the translations of those interactions in space. Now, we, of course, we have to make a requirement, like our summability condition. Vy can't be arbitrary. So, again, the requirement is we want to sum over these are all the interactions containing zero. Maybe I should have made that explicit. So, again, these are kind of all the interactions containing a particular point in space, and their norm has to be bounded. Again, this is important because this guarantees the operator norm of the whole perturbation. Guarantees the operator norm of the whole perhubation is extensive. And there's another requirement, which is also important, which I want to mention, which is that there's a symmetry requirement, which is that, of course, we require these VYs to be invariant under the symmetry, the Ising symmetry, but we actually require something stronger. We require that they're invariant under the Ising symmetry on each connected component of Y. So they commute with SYI, where SYI is the product of sigma X. Is the product of sigma x's within a connected component? This is this means that kind of, and what this means in practice is that, for example, our result does not apply to long-range sigma z, sigma z interactions, right? Because sigma z, these would be the two connected components, r and r prime, right? If they're far separated in space. And, you know, sigma z does not commute with sigma x, right? So basically, each part of our long-range interaction has to be separately. Has to be separately ising symmetric. It's stronger statement than just saying the whole, not only does the whole V have to be ising symmetric, but kind of each part has to be ising symmetric. So if you have something like this where the whole thing is ising symmetric, but the individual pieces are not, then our result does not apply. Actually, there's a good reason it doesn't apply. So it turns out long-range sigma Z, Sigma Z interactions can cause instabilities, even in the simple Ising model case. I could say more about. There's an I could say more about that, but there are instabilities that occur here, even if you obey all our conditions, our summability conditions. So it's kind of important that you have a sigma x. So that's also natural from, well, I could explain, but it's actually somewhat natural to focus on interactions of this type. All the, this is closer in spirit to the topologically ordered systems, which is the ones we're really interested in proving the Improving this property of. But anyway, this is an important point. So let me just finish with some questions. So I think there are two big questions that I have. So one is, can we generalize this kind of result to topologically ordered models? Because we just did these symmetry breaking models. So there's two cases one could think about: the one-dimensional topological superconductors. In that case, actually, we can do it. In fact, our result immediately. In fact, our result immediately generalized, you can easily extend our result to topological superconductors by just doing a Jordan-Wigner transformation. So we can prove that one-dimensional topological superconductors have a degeneracy which is stable against long-range interactions of a particular type, in particular density-density interactions. So this one we can kind of do, but maybe when we go to, let's say, the Tor code, which would be really interesting, I don't know how to. Would be really interesting. I don't know how to, at the moment, a generalize our approach. It seems like it should be possible, but there's some questions there. So that's a question. The other question I have is, we prove that we have this nice exponentially small splitting if the summability condition holds. But in general, in many systems of interest, this condition is violated. In particular, the Coulomb interaction violates this condition in any dimension. This condition in any dimension. And so we would be very important to understand what happens when this condition is violated. In some cases, you can get an instability. And so that we know, where the gap just closes immediately. But the real question I have is, in some cases, maybe the gap doesn't close. And if that's the case, what happens? Like, if the gap stays open, what kind of splitting will you get? Will it be polynomial or exponential? And I think that's an important question. And I think that's an important question because that applies to many physical systems of interest, like quantum Hall systems and so on, where we believe this gap stays open, but I don't think we really have a sharp argument for what happens to the splitting. So that's an important question, I think. So, anyway, I think I will stop there. Thanks for your attention.
