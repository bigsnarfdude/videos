I mean after two years of COVID it's really a pleasure to see people and talk face to face. So okay, um I think when I was invited some several months ago now, we were working with David on not self-adjoint problems, but then I betrayed him, so I'm involved in this, but uh I mean there is a lot of spectral theory, of course, but it's lurking in the background, so I will not explicitly talk about Explicitly talk about spectral actual spectral problems, but you know, this is one of the main applications of the theory. Okay, I have this. I will talk about several results some students or former students. In particular, the main result is with Angelon Zano, PhD students presently in Rome. Students presently in Rome. The results with Luca Fanelli, Federal Vechevest, and Beadro Cassan. And don't look at the 40 here because I will skip most of the slides, of course. Okay, so I don't know how many here. Most of you probably are familiar with scattering theory, but just a recap to see what's the problem, what it's all about. I like to present it like this. Essentially, you have two flows. Essentially, you have two flows. One is easy and one is difficult. One is more complicated. Two flows, which means, for instance, this is the historical first scattering problem. So, for instance, the free flow for the Schrodinger equation and the flow for the Schrodinger equation with the potential. So, in this kind of problem, you already have solved the equations. So, this is behind you. This is behind you. You have global solutions, two global flows, and you want to compare them. So let us focus on this classical example. So you can work in different spaces, but probably the best one is H1, the energy space for Schrodinger. And so you want to compare these two flows, the syntactic behavior of these two flows. Are they similar or they diverge at infinity? I will not spend one word on that. I will not spend one word on the physics because I mean I have no time, but this is an important problem, even for physics. Okay, let me write small O to mean any quantity which goes to zero as time goes to infinity. So, one could try to represent the easy flow in terms of the difficult flow, okay? So, Okay, so we are looking for expansions of this form. So, this is the, for instance, the Free Schooling equation. You want to represent it as a perturbation, asymptotic perturbation of the perturbed flow. This looks like a difficult thing to do, but this is actually an easy problem. Because somehow you know everything about the behavior at infinity of this. You know that it is small in some sense. Small in some sense. So you're basically trying to solve a problem with small data at infinity. So actually, this is the easy problem. To state it precisely, given an initial data, data of phi, you are looking for initial data for the perturbed flow such that at infinity, plus infinity or minus infinity, they behave in the same way. Or you can do the opposite. You can try to represent the You can try to represent the difficult flow using the easy flow. Same problem. It looks symmetric, but it is not symmetric, actually, because you have a lot of information on the easy flow and not so many information on the simple flow. For instance, you don't know that it is small at infinity, for instance. So if you can prove this, you are proving something very strong on the asymptotic behavior of some difficult problem. Okay? So, indeed, in scattering theory, these two properties have different names, even if they look symmetric. This is the existence of the wave operator. This is called the existence of the wave operator. The wave operator is the map from phi to phi plus. So you have two wave operators, to phi plus or to phi minus, of course. And the solution, if you can solve this, you say that you have asymptotic completeness. You have asymptotic completeness. Keep in mind, this is typically easy. This is typically something that you, when you construct the flows, you almost have this. While doing this is the hard problem. By the way, so if you have a a solution uh of the difficult global solution and you know that at infinity it resembles uh a free solution, then you say that the solution scatters. Then you say that the solution scatters. This is a standard terminology, okay? So you're interested in proving that the solution for your difficult equation scatters. This is the main question. Okay, of course I will not spend, I have no precious minute to discuss the extent of the theory, which is, I mean, there is a huge literature on this. The classical case is a potential scattering, but since probably genius. But since probably Gini Brenda, one of the main problems in non-linear dispersive equation is comparing the free flow with the non-linear flow. So for instance, the easy flow is always the same and dd is the represent the solution of the semi-linear Schrodinger equation. This is one of one now classical problem, but started in the 80s century. And here the sign determines Sign determines the behavior of the equation, of course. The focusing equation, in some sense, is more difficult. You have Rohab for some kind of energies, initial energies. The focusing equation, you don't have Rohab, it's much more stable. But you can prove scattering also for the focusing equation, provided the initial energy satisfies some balance. Anyway, so we focus on the focusing equation. Equation. So this is the theory is essentially complete, essentially, because okay, maybe I will assume something, but okay, you have global existence, so the flow is well defined. In this range, gamma is the exponent here, so gamma is the order of the non-linearity. If gamma is H1 supercritical, so in this range, in one or two dimensions, for any power, you have a global existence. Existence. Why for scattering you need gamma to be not too small? Okay? I mean, it is known that for smaller gamma you run into problems. You need additional samples on the data, or you have nothing at all. But in this range, you have scattering for this. So, the solutions, the global solutions of the semi-linear equation scatter. At infinity, they resemble free waves. Waves. And so if you have strict inequality here, then this is not too difficult. The theory is completely standard. You have scattering also when you have equality, in the critical case, but this was a much harder problem and took several years to solve. Some group groups of the notations. Okay? Anyway. So I don't know. So, let me skip the general stuff. So, what is the problem I'm interested in now? Is to compare. So, A is an elliptic operator and so variable coefficients. And the two problems, the easy flow is the linear flow, and the difficult flow is the nonlinear flow, okay? I would like to prove scattering, that's the solution of this problem is scattering. The solution of this problem is catal. Of course, so think of any self-adjoint operator. You could put in, I mean, a posteriori, here you could compare this problem also to the, you could put also Laplace operator here, but this is another step. So let us focus on this more difficult problem. Okay, the tools, the ingredients you need are, first of all, you should know very well the dispersing. All you should know very well the dispersive properties of the linear flow, and of course, after that, you need to solve globally the non-linear equation. The first problem, so what do I mean by dispersion for the linear flows? This is a summary of the main properties of Schrodinger flow, the free Schrodinger flow. There are several estimates. This list is not exhaustive, but I mean, all But I mean, all the useful estimates are here. First of all, you have, starting from the explicit representation of the solution, the kernel, you have a point-wise decay. So, Lp in terms of LP prime with a sharp decay rate of the L P norm for P larger than 2. From this, there is a standard procedure to prove now this kind of estimates. If you're not familiar with this, this is LR norm X, and then you compute. X and then you compute the L P norm in time. Here I put also the okay, from Stricker's estimate, combining them with just a sobo F embedding, you get a very rich set of estimates. And these are dream estimates to solve globally the nonlinear equation because this is already a global space, it's time, global time and space. So if you manage to do a fixed point in this space, You have fixed a point in this space, you have solved the equation, basically. So, it's really some difficult problem become trivial, well, not trivial, but much easier using Stricker's estimates or Stricker's novel F estimates. Of course, this is for the flow without the forcing term, but there are corresponding by duality, you get corresponding estimates also if you have a right-hand side. I have no time to discuss. And I also mentioned splutting estimates. I also mentioned spooting estimates, which are in some sense more fundamental. This holds for very general operators. While precaut estimates are more difficult to prove and point-wise decay is something lucky that you get only when you have very precise information on your very, so this is a summary. Ideally, one would like to have everything here, but sometimes this is. Here, but sometimes this is too much to hope for. Maybe, okay, I skip some history and because I worked a lot on this problem of proving dispersive estimates and three-car estimates for equations with variable coefficients. Maybe let me focus on the case I will discuss here, which is a 1D case. I mean, there exists a lot of estimates by now, with variable coefficients, with potential, of course, with the magnetic potentials, and so on. Let me hope. And so on. Let me focus on this. So, from now on, the space dimension is one. So, A is just a scalar function. And so, this is a general elliptic operator in 1D on the line. Of course, I assume that A is equally positive. And so, for instance, with Luca Fanelli, we proved some years ago that this is a sufficient set of assumptions. So, you see, of course, cursivity of A. Of course, coercivity of A, then some might decay expressed in that P form of A and a couple of derivatives. These are not sharp, but it is not clear how better you can do. For instance, if you have some additional structure, for instance, if you have only the divergence part, Burke and Planchon, they can prove stricter estimates, but not pointwise decay, for um coefficients in d V. Coefficients in dv, just dv. So, this is a very strong result. But for instance, it is not clear how to modify the result. Even adding a potential D, it is not clear how to do it. I can do it for all potentials, for instance, with some signature of the initial data, but anyway, so this is a sufficient set of assumptions. Please notice that in these assumptions, A is large, it's not a perturbation of a constant function, okay? Okay, so Uh okay. So uh under this assumption uh we can prove uh pointwise decay. So the the full uh set of estimates that you have seen in the in the in the slide for the three uh Schrodinger equation is valid for this for the flow associated to A. Okay? So we have set the information for the linear part is good. Now, once you have Strichert's estimates, you have a good theory. You have a good theory in the intercritical range for the focusing semi-linear equation. So, also the theory of global existence for this equation in H1 is you have to do something, but essentially you reproduce what is known because the essential tool, if you have the essential tool, you can do. It's not difficult to reproduce the theory. So, we have a rules. We have a good linear flow F of T and good non-linear flow D of T. The flows are, they exist, they have well- good properties. So notice that P and R will be two indices which will be fixed and depend on the power gamma. This is slightly technical, but believe me, so you can choose the indices such that. So, you can choose the indices such that everything works. So, this is just to show how easy it is to implement a fixed point with some clever choice of the indices. Anyway, so now back to the fundamental problem I would like to discuss. Now, we have a global solution with some initial data in H1, and we want to prove that it scatters. So, that given Scatters. So that given this solution, we can find the initial data for three waves such that the difference in each one tends to zero at plus infinity or at minus infinity. The data will be different, of course. Okay? Why? The easy problem, this is contained here, says that given any free wave, I can construct a non-linear solution which resembles the free wave at infinity. This is the existence, the easy problem, the existence of the wave variable. Existence of the European Union. So now, this theorem says essentially that the easy problem can be solved. But this follows when you construct this non-linear flow, essentially you build the tool to solve this. So this is almost included in this part of the field. So under the previous assumption, if gamma is larger than phi, which is the condition one, gamma larger than one plus four over n, then the Then the nonlinear flow is well defined. By the way, there are several scattering criteria. So it is sufficient to prove that U belongs to one of these spaces, like PLR, with that choice of PLR, and you prove that it scatters. So essentially, the goal, the final goal, will be to prove that all solutions, all non-linear solutions belong to this space. Space. Another thing that you know, if the initial data are small enough, the solution scatters, this is also immediate from the theory, and the easy problem can be solved. Okay? Okay, so now we are in a good position to start. Okay, this is part of the proof essentially and says that one, so I hope it is clear that the goal is to prove that we have a global The goal is to prove that we have a global solution of the Monero problem. We would like to prove that it is in LPLR. If we know that, we know that it's scatters and we are done. And one way to do this is to approximate. So this is also an easy result, somehow, just a Grand Wall estimate. If you can construct a solution. Oh, by the way, I should have mentioned, but I'm going very fast. This is an integral form of the equation, of course. Since we would like Of course. Since we would like to work out with the LP functions, then it's better not to use a Laplace operator. So this is precisely an equivalent form of the semi-linear equation. This is the semi-equation plus some perturbation. So suppose you can construct a solution of the perturbed equation with g small enough, then the solution with the same data of the With the same data of the knock-perturbed equation scatters. So if this is in LPLR, also U is in LPLR. So this is one way to prove scattering. Approximate the solution you're interested in with a scattering solution, which is not an exact solution, but an approximate solution. Anyway, so okay, so since essentially say Essentially, say very roughly speaking, what you have to prove is a solution of the non-linear equation, and you would like to prove an a priori estimate for it. So, if you manage to do this, you're done, because you just want to prove that it is in L P L R. And so, there is a long history of attempts to do this. The first ones were really hard. I mean, they really tried to prove some a priori estimate for the solution, non-linear bounds, which is Solution, non-linear bounds. This is a version of Barabat's estimated Linus Rau. Quite an intricate proof. This doesn't work in dimension one or two. It had to be modified by McKanishi. But anyway, so I'm talking about the free Laplace, of course. This this is the historically how they proved the the scattering for the uh for the uh equation with constant coefficients. Okay? With constant coefficients. The method was simplified somehow by Colliander, Keming, Stafidani, Takok, and Tao, and proving some quadratic estimate. But always the goal is you have a solution of the non-inear problem, you have to bound it, to prove that it satisfies some global bound. And also, this works only in large dimensions. We apply this method to the fully variable coefficient. Fully variable coefficient case with the Biadroka sample some years ago. So we looked scattering in dimension, but it only works in dimension larger than three, very small. But let us focus on dimension one. So now, since a few years, I mean there is this beautiful how can I say it? It's a general framework to prove scattering, which was found by Kennig and Merr some years ago. Merz and years ago, and it has been applied to wave equations, Glen-Gordon, James, and wave maps. And I would like to give you very, very quickly an idea how it works, but I think I don't have much time. But anyway, let me say that this works very nicely for costat coefficient equation. And the main goal here is to understand what is essential in this approach so that it can be. Approach so that it can be adapted to variable coefficient scales. So anisotropic scales. Okay, this is the result. So these are the assumptions which are necessary to get a good dispersive property of the linear flow. And okay, I need to assume something more. And let me tell you that this is still a work in progress. Is still work in progress, so I'm 100% sure I can improve this. I need only the final step of the but we are still working on it. Anyway, so we need some recursivity on the potential and so this is really the painful assumption. So now to do this we need to assume that we are close to one. So it's somehow close to a constant, a perturbation of a constant, the Of a constant, the mean coefficient. Okay, anyway, under these additional assumptions, we have asymptotic completeness. So, all solutions of the nonlinear problem scatter. And I think I can manage to give you a rough idea. This is a really beautiful method. And so, essentially, there are three steps. A linear profile decompositions, which leads to the construction of a critical solution. To the construction of a critical solution, and then you prove that this critical solution cannot exist. So it's a long and technical proof by contradiction. I don't know if you are familiar with the concentration compactness method of Lyons. So the idea is the following. Take any bounded sequence in H1. Bounded sequence in a 12. If you know by chance that the supports are contained in a fixed ball, then you have compact unbinding, right, in 12 P. You can extract a sub-sequence which converges. But in general, you're not in this case. Apparently, you can say nothing about this sequence. You could split in several ways and move to infinity and so on. Actually, by strategic, you can find the sub-sequence with some orderly behavior somehow. Behavior somehow. So essentially, the idea is the solution, you can start a sub-sequence where you can locate, you can find some bumps. Maybe there is one bump which concentrates at one point, or there is a bump which goes to infinity, or another bump which goes closing to infinity in a different direction, and so on. So you can regularize your significance. You regularize your sequence, Bn, and look for a maximum. There must be a maximum somewhere. If the maximum goes to zero, then it is flattening out, it's dispersing. If you can find a sequence of maxima, then you follow it, okay? And some mass is there. Okay, you have found the first one, you subtract it, and you repeat. Then you take regularize, take the maximum, another maximum. Of course, the maximum should diverge, grow apart because. Grow apart because otherwise you could put them together. So finally, you represent your solution, your sequence, your sub-sequence, in this way. So you have some bumps and some electors, okay? Some bumps which go away from each other and the H1O splits orthogonally between the bumps. Actually, it's not difficult what you get in the mood for this kind of decomposition. Of decomposition. Now, the idea is to do the same for the solutions of the linear Schrodinger equation. This is due to Kerani. So now you have also time, you have a sequence of initial data, and so a sequence of free waves with bounded initial energy. And then you find the bumps, which can be also at different times, not only at different locations in the space, only. Starting from this decomposition, you can do the same for the nonlinear equations. And I should just say the crucial point is that, so the argument, the contradiction is you know that for small data you have scattering, so you can take the maximal end. Take the maximal energy such that below that energy you have scattering. Then you take initial data with the H1 norm above this critical energy, then you note scatter, and decompose the corresponding solutions. Okay, maybe it's a little bit of time. It it it's a bit uh complicated it's a beautiful idea, but uh Complete it's a beautiful idea, but okay, let me try to say this. The idea is: so you have these solutions which do not scatter, but the energies go to this critical energy. Now, if you apply the previous decomposition, if you have two bumps or more than one bump, then the energy must split. So the energy of these species is below eclipsical, so they scatter. Eclipse. So they scatter. And so this is impossible. The solution would scatter because you have a sum of solutions with scatter. So you have only one bump. If you have only one bump, if you apply the same result to any sequence of time, you see that also the solution must be the the the solution flow must be compact in time, and this is impossible since your problem is dispersive, okay? Since your problem is this perceived, okay? You uh yeah. I I told you the entire proof only uh could communicate the main idea, but since this is an impossible solution, the absurd comes from assuming that this critical level of the energy exists, so this must be plus infinity. So this is essentially the idea. Maybe I stop here. Thank you. Maybe I stopped behind. Thank you. Still time for a short question. Comment, remark? You don't have any non-charging condition, is that because you have a smallness assumption or? Yeah, but in the end, you should have some, maybe not non-trapping, but I would say I think I can do it with some sign condition. It with some sign condition on A. I mean, the negative part of the derivative should be small, something like that. One-sided condition. Definitely, you should have someone talking about. Yeah. Any further questions? Other participants? No, let's find the speaker again.
