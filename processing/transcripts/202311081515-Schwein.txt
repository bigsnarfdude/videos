My talk won't directly interact with Arthur packets, but there will be this theme of studying the geometry of the space of L parameters. And I think this is very much kind of of the same flavor. Okay, so this is joint work with Peter Dillery. So, what I want to talk about today is the super hospital support map in the local language. Hospital support map in the local language program. So, Peter and I, building on the work of Ober Musari and Soloveld, have some kind of way of thinking about this, some sort of slight modification of earlier work, which at this point is well known, and I'll review this. What I think is in some sense most interesting about our work is this kind of reformulation of the generalized Springer correspondence, which shows up. So, hopefully, you can take away at least a Hopefully, you can take away at least a conceptual understanding of what the generalized Schringer correspondence is doing. Okay, so let me just first summarize the picture. So we have our non-Archimedean local fields, characteristic zero or p, and a connected reductive group. Connected reductive group. It's just connected because in the second half of the talk, we'll be looking at disconnected groups. All right, so what's the idea of this supercuspital support map? I think the main statement probably goes back to Bernstein and Zalovinsky. So I have. I have an irreducible admissible representation of my group. And the first statement here is that I can find it in the parabolic conduction of a super cuspital, which is not so surprising. So I can find a levee and a supercospital of the levee. Whose parabolic induction contains the representation I started with? All right, so this essentially follows from the definition of supercospidality as being those things whose non-trivial Jackie modules are all zero with some mild induction. So this is really purely formal. What's more interesting. Um, what's more interesting is that this pair m sigma is unique up to conjugacy, and this takes some more work to show. So m sigma is unique up to gf conjugacy. And here, the proof uses this geometrical lemma, which Which we saw mentioned in the previous talk. So essentially, the way the proof of part two goes is: you imagine I had two different pairs M sigma and two different parabolic inductions. And to compare them, I would look at the space of Homs between the two parabolic inductions. And by a junction of parabolic induction and parabolic restriction, that's the same as saying something about the restriction. Saying something about the restriction of an induction, and then you want to say something about this. So the geometrical lemma gives a description of some description of the restriction of an induction. I'll return to this point later, which is why I'm emphasizing it. So that part two is much harder to prove than part one. Okay. So then the supercuspital support. So then the supercuspital support is just this pair M sigma taken up to GF conjugacy. So it turns out I won't exactly explain how this works, but if you organize all of these conjugacy classes of pairs Of pairs into a set which I'll call omega g. This actually has the structure of a variety. It's called the Bernstein variety. And it's a very simple variety. It has countably many connected components. And each of these is basically a quotient of a complex torus by a finite group. So this is a Finite group. So, this is a very simple kind of combinatorial object. Okay. So, let's start drawing a picture and see how this might fit into the local England's correspondence. The local England's correspondence. So the map I just defined gives me a map from irreducible and missile representations of G to the Bernstein variety, so this S C map. And on the other hand, as we saw in Alexander's talk, which in many ways is a series. Sanders talk, which in many ways this is a sequel to, these representations of G should be parametrized by L parameters. So we should have, and in many cases, we do have a local England correspondence. Now, to actually get a bijection, of course, we need to use some kind of enhancement. So let me put a dot here. Let's refer to the enhancements. So, what could dot be? Well, we saw a lot of this in Alexander's talk. So, we have these sort of pure inner forms due to Vogen. There's a closely related. Closely related version of this due to Arthur, which is slightly different. And then, as we saw in Alexander's talk, we have the basic isocrystal version, or alternatively, the full iso crystal version. The enhancement I'll focus on is in the title, so these rigid inner forms. So these are due to Coletha in characteristic zero and Dillary in positive characteristic. So I won't have so much to say about the precise definition of rigid forms because at this point this is well known. Let me just say that they depend on a finite central subgroup of G. G which is Z, and that'll show up later. Okay, so we have this notion of enhancements. So as we saw in Alexander's talk, part of this story is you group together various forms of G. So perhaps it would be cleanest to say here that G is quasi-split, but in any case, But in any case, this set of representations that we look at should also take this enhancement into account because we're looking at different inner twists of various kinds. So we have these enhancements here as well. Okay, so let's complete the square. So the Langlands philosophy predicts That this supercuspital support map should have an analog on the Galois side. So we should be able to use a different color here. We should be able to make some version of the Bernstein variety on the Galois side. The Gala side, together with a version of the supercuspital support map, and this should furthermore have some local language correspondence. All right, so we should expect something like this to be true. And it was sort of shown by Albert Musaka and Soloveld that such a structure does exist. So let me briefly mention the history here. All right, so these three people constructed both the Delphi analog of the Bernstein variety. The Bernstein variety and this cuspidal support map in Arthur's enhancements. Yeah, Arthur's enhancements. And let me also add that they parametrized the fibers of this map. So I won't have so much to say about this, but if you're interested in studying all irreducible representations, not just supercuspitals, this map gives you a reduction to supercuspitals, but if you want to understand everything, you should understand what are the fibers of this map. In other words, what are the constituents of a parabolic conduction? Of course, we're all very interested in this question. So on the Galois side, they were able to completely. Able to completely describe the fibers as irreducible representations of a certain twisted group algebra. So that's an important part of this story, but I won't have much to say about it. Okay. So, more recently, Martin Solaveld's sort of So, sort of notice that the same constructions really work just as well in this rigid setting. So I'll say more about this, but there's not so much a priori one has to change. So he constructed these rigid versions. Here it was important that this group Z was in the center of the derived subgroup. The derived subgroup. So let me comment on this hypothesis. So, one sort of motif in this story of having different enhancements is the question of which inner forms can you actually get. So, like one defect of pure inner forms is if G is simply connected, then you actually can't get any other inner forms besides G itself because the Gaelic homology is trivial. Homology is trivial. So, an advantage of these rigid forms is if z is big enough, including if it equals the center of the derived subgroup, then you actually do get every inner form. So, already this level of generality is enough to get every sort of inner form for various reasons, which I'll come to momentarily. Peter and I wanted. Peter and I wanted to see how to do this in general. And this is what we accomplished. So let me say a few words about this. Thanks. All right, so here's the main sort of thing we looked at that sort of took us into a very interesting rabbit hole. So, before stating the theorem, let me just make a remark. So, this super cuspital support map is independent of two choices that come up in the enhanced local. In the enhanced local language correspondence. So the first is, I didn't record this in the notation, but this right, so this enhanced local England's correspondence that I wrote down really depends on a choice of Whitaker datum, which is sort of related to endoscopy. So if you change the If you change the Whitaker data, this has the effect of really parametrizing the L packets. And it's well understood how this works in terms of the finite group or the group whose representations parametrize the L package or like twisting by a character, so it's a very simple procedure, but nonetheless, there is some dependence there. And the second sort of artificial dependence that comes up. Comes up is the facts which to some extent we saw in Alexander's talk, which is that this cohomological data that comes into the enhanced correspondence. So, in his talk, it was BG basic, and in Bogan's perspective, it would be these classes in H1 and FG. It can happen. Fg, it can happen that even if you're just interested in like some chatic group like GLN, you could have various different like host cycles which enrich it to some kind of enhanced inner form. And from the point of view of the representation theory of the group, this is completely artificial. So the supercuspital support map doesn't depend on any of these sort of fine points. And so, right, so it's independent of one and two. And if you think about what this means, this forces some kind of compatibility of this supercosmital support map for L parameters. So let me not say exactly what compatible means, but it would exactly It would exactly be the thing you would need so that if you sort of went this way around the diagram instead of going this way, your answer should not depend on the rigidification of G or the choice of Whittaker datum, provided you use the same Whittaker datum for both. Now that I've returned here, maybe it's worth saying this bottom arrow. This bottom arrow, really in the end, is also the local Languen's correspondence, but for super cuspitals of levees. So this is, there's nothing sort of mysterious there. All right, so All right. So we want this compatibility condition, which is quite natural. And the issue is when we dug into the construction of this supercuspital support map of Albert, Musauri, and Solovelt, it was kind of hard for us to understand what was going on because this construction uses the Springer correspondence, which I'll come to. Which I'll come to, but one perspective on the Springer correspondence is parametrizing some objects in terms of representations of like your representations of vile group, something of this flavor. And somehow in this setting, it's a bit hard to get your hands on exactly which file group you're working with. And there's also this co-cycle floating around. So it takes quite a bit of sort of. Sort of bookkeeping, like to actually keep track of how things are changing when you twist by a central character or something like this. So we ended up kind of finding a different way to think about this by just combining various things in the literature. So the sort of key input. Let's reformulate the generalized Springer correspondence. I'll say a lot more about what that is in the second part of this talk. And here, our main inspiration was this series of papers by Akar Henderson. Juto and Ries. So they were studying the modular Springer correspondence, but the main ideas were the same, many of them, as well as this wonderful textbook that has recently appeared by Akpar on Priver Sheet. So, this was quite helpful to me. I learned a lot from it. Okay, so I'll come to this in a second. I'll come to this in a second. Let me comment a bit also on why one would be interested in this because I guess if you haven't worked with all these enhancements, it just seems a bit like we're sort of doing many variations on the same problem, but maybe it's just some matter of taste. So let me just give. So let me just give two applications sort of in sketch. All right, so the first is you should be able to use this map to. To use this map to work backwards and construct local language correspondences. So the essential idea is if I want to make this local language correspondence, As long as I have a local language correspondence for super cuspitals, so if I understand this part of the diagram, and if I have a good handle on the fibers of both of these maps, then I can sort of go the other way around the square to get the top bijection. So, this idea I think is what motivated a lot of earlier work on studying this hospital support map for L parameters. Hospital support map for L parameters. And it's recently been implemented in some cases by Ober and Shu. So here they were building on sort of Coleta's very explicit construction of, I guess, non-singular supercuspital L packets. So that's a case where we do. So that's a case where we do have the bottom part of this diagram, and then you can try to go backwards. And right, so this, I guess, nothing I've said that this step currently uses rigid interforms, I guess where rigid interforms come in is they're like nicer in many ways for endoscopy. So I think the local language correspondences you would get would be sort of better adapted to many applications. So this is one motivation. So, this is one motivation. A future motivation, which is again related to Alexander's talk, is to study the isocrystal version of this problem. And I mean, the ultimate goal would be to give a version of this story that works. I guess for something like the whole stack of L parameters and coherent sheaves on this. So, in the iso crystal version, as Alexander mentioned, this is very close to this work of Barg Schultz on geometrization. And on the other hand, Kaleta has given a comparison of the rigid and isocritical. The rigid and isocrystal formulations. And critically, for this, you need this finite group Z to be very, very large, in particular, bigger than the center of the derived subgroup. So one thing that motivated Peter and I to do this project was to understand what was happening in this sort of general case where Z is large, and in the future, we're going to try to. In the future, we're going to try to use this to say something about the iso-crystal enhancement, and then hopefully eventually relate it back to farctionals. I think this is probably going to be quite difficult. Okay. So before I turn to the Springer correspondence, let me just say a little bit about how this map is defined. How this map is defined, and we'll sort of naturally see why this springer correspondence comes up. All right, so the Springer correspondence is going to be something about equivariant perverse sheaves on the nilpotent cone. And the story I'm about to tell is probably familiar to a lot of you, but I thought it would be useful to just spell out for those who haven't. Just spell out for those who haven't seen it before. So to make this map, we start with an enhanced L parameter. So the main question here is, what do I mean by enhancement? Well, in the rigid world, an enhancement is of the following form. So So let me write this out first. All right, so we have this centralizer group, which appeared in Alexander's talk. So this should be familiar to everyone. This plus here is taking Z into account. So if I have a subgroup of G hats, I can just take its, well. Um here. So this projection, right, so Z gives me an isogeny from G to G mod Z. And then if I dualize this, I get an isogeny from G mod Z hat onto G hat. So this plus notation is just taking the Taking the pre-image in this cover. So it's fiber products. So I take my usual centralizer and I lift it to this cover, which is a very mild operation. And then I take the components group of this and erupt. So just erupts of some finite group. So this is the recipe. And right, so out of this, we want to get something that looks like an equivariance sheaf on a nilpotent colon. So how does this work? Well, we sort of break this centralizer up into two steps. Right, so maybe here I should, it's quite important that the model of the L parameter I'm working with is the one. The model of L parameter I'm working with is the one that uses SL2. So this is a as opposed to the semi-direct product with GA model. Right, so essentially the point is if I want to take the centralizer of both of these things, I can just take the centralizer of first the v parts and then the SL2 part. This is really the main point. So let me take the centralizer and The centralizer in G hats of B restricted to the V group. This is a disconnected, typically disconnected productive group. And let me also take the unipotent elements I get from this SL2. This SLL2. Okay, so the point is the centralizer that shows up here, so CG hat of phi plus, this is just the same as first taking the centralized, so first taking H, so the centralizer of the sort of vague group part of the parameter, and then taking. And then taking the further centralizer of B and I guess of the unipotent part. And actually, I guess to make this correct, I should take maximal reductive quotient. Typically, this is not a reductive group. So, if I had taken the centralized of SL2, it would have been. In any case, these two things have the same pi zero, so there's really no difference which one you work for for this application. All right, so now the point is, um, row is a Rho is a representation of pi zero of this group. And I can think about that alternatively as an H equivariant local system on the homogeneous space OU phi, which is the H orbits. The age orbit of Uphi. So this is just a null potent orbit. And an equivariant local system, whatever this is, is going to be the same as a representation of pi zero of the centralizer of a base point in this space. So this is exactly what I have. And let me be careful. Here I should add a plus. I should add a plus. Yes. So this plus construction is very robust. So taking this centralizer and then adding a plus is the same as first plusing H and then taking the centralizer. So it's really quite mild going to this rigid setting. Okay, so now I have this. So I'm very nearly there. The next thing, of course, is to take the intersection column. The intersection cohomology complex. So let me call this local system L rho. And now I have an H plus equivariance perverse sheaf on the nil potent kind of H or equivalently H plus. This NH is the NH is the middle code cone. All right. So I've done a bunch of shenanigans, but I've ended up with some like sheaf theoretic object. The next step in the construction is to apply the generalized Springer correspondence. So here's where we'll leave this. Here's where we'll leave this story, but essentially I'll get a similar object for a Levy subgroup of H, and then I can use this to go back and get a Levy subgroup and L Levy subgroup of the dual group, as well as some similar enhancement row. So there's from here there's some procedure to go back. And this generalized Springer correspondence, whatever it does, produces a similar object, but for a Levy subgroup. That's sort of the shape of the construction. So let me now turn to the generalized Springer correspondence. Are there any questions for us? Well, they'll be the same because H plus is a cover of H. Yeah, that's a good question. Yeah, so the null potent cone only depends on the isogeny class of it. Right, so maybe it's worth saying, so where this sort of plus comes in is right here. So this nilpotent cone is not going to, it's going to be the same for H and H plus, but I have sort of extra equivariance once I add the plus, because now this larger group. Because now this larger group is acting, so the isotropy group will be bigger. Yeah, so things are very, very disconnected, and that's that's part of this story. All right. So, in the second section, we're just going to completely forget about. We're just going to completely forget about piadic groups and just do something with complex reductive groups. So this is a bit extreme, but I mean, as we've sort of seen, like in this ABD story, for instance, it's really good to have like a solid understanding of various geometric questions. So I find it kind of nice that you can cut off this part of this story and just get a very classical sort of thing that doesn't use so much. Doesn't use so much stuff about chaotic fields. So here I'll take a reductive group and it could be disconnected. That's really critical. So this H is, I guess, it'll be what I called H plus over there, and typically these don't have to be connected. Typically, these don't have to be connected. So, what are we trying to do? Well, at the beginning, I talked about this parabolic induction story where I have sort of various classes of objects for gene, its Levy subgroups, and I want to sort of reduce to some cosmetal object using parabolic induction and parabolic restriction. And that's exactly what. Restriction. And that's exactly what I'm going to do here, just in this slightly different setting of equivariant sheaves. So the goal is to develop an analog of this super cuspital support map I talked about at the beginning. But now for this, this equivariant, this category of equivariant perverse sheaves. Of equivariant perverse sheaves. And let me say that this is really all just a reformulation of earlier work. So I guess, well, I should probably put an even earlier name on here. So, one originally has the Springer correspondence, which gives you sort of the principal series in this story. So, this goes back to work of Springer and So, this goes back to work of Springer in, I think, the 70s. Lustig took another crack at it in the 80s and got sort of the full picture, which is where the word generalized comes in. And then in their earlier work on this, Albert-Musaui and Solavelds extended it to the disconnected case. So they should certainly be cited as well. But at the same time, like. But at the same time, like the way the theory was developed, to me at least, it was a bit unclear. Like it was not so clear that the story here is really sort of formally identical to the super cuspital support story. And that's sort of what I want to convince you of today. But if you look in Lipschig's papers, you see some definitions in terms of banishing of certain cohomologies of something. And to me, anyway, it wasn't so clear what all of that meant. All right, so what was the first thing we did when we defined supercuspital support? We had to make sense of parabolic induction and the Jacquet module, or I'll just call it parabolic restriction. Okay, so what are we, what's the sort of thing we're looking for? Well, If I have a levy subgroup, so there will be a parabolic as well, of course. Maybe it's worth saying for me in this disconnected setting, parabolic just means the sort of maximally general thing it could mean. So I just mean that G mod P is proper, or equivalently, the identity component. The identity component of P is a parabolic subgroup. All right, so what do we want? So we want restriction and induction functors, which should be adjoints. So restriction should take An equivariance perverse sheaf on the nil potent colon for the whole group, and give me something similar for the levy. And in fact, one can do this on the whole derived category. So, if you recall, a perversion. So, if you recall, a perverse sheaf is some kind of sort of abelian combinatorially flavored objects, but these perverse sheaves live in this larger derived category, which has a bit more of a homotopical flavor. And this has a T structure, and the perverse sheaves are the heart of this T structure. So it's often useful, like in the development of theory, for instance, to work in this larger category. So we should have, right, we should have these two functions. Right, you should have these two functors. This is the flavor things should take. So here's how you can define them. So in the end, the definition is very simple. It just goes by a correspondence. So let me write this out and then comment on it. Comment on it. So, one perspective I found helpful in sort of getting my bearings here was to work with quotient stacks. So, that's what I mean by this bar. And I want to assure everyone who's scared of stocks that these things are at this point quite well understood how they work. Well, understood how they work. Like, for me, this is essentially just a way of keeping track of some equivariance, some like representation essentially on a sheaf that lives over this space. So it's further more relatively easy to compute fiber products and so on. So these things are not so horrible. Maybe it's also worth saying in this disconnected setting, there's sort of an additional complication. So for perverse sheaves, For perverse sheaves, to have an equivariant structure for a connected group is a property, not an extra datum. So if H is connected, a sheep is either H equivalent, a reverse sheep is either H equivariant or it's not. But when H is disconnected, epivariance becomes a condition that you have to keep track of. So when we started looking into this disconnected story, it quickly became clear. Story, it quickly became clear that keeping track of this equivariant structure by hand was kind of horrifying and difficult. And this stack language just does it for you automatically. So it really is a nice way of packaging things. All right. So, okay, so we have this correspondence. So, I mean, how do I think about this? Well, like, the point that I have a map here is just saying that I have a map from the nil potent cone of P to the nil potent cone of M. To the null potent of m. So this is just given by this sort of natural projection from P to M, which I'm calling R. And the fact that I can mod up by M and P here just reflects the fact that this map is equivariance for the projection from P to M. So this notation is just a way of packaging a certain like equivariant map between spaces with actions on them. So it's really a very classical thing. And we also have a map from the And we also have a map from the parabolic to the whole group, which turns out to be proper. Okay, so we have this. So this is how you define these functors. So for parabolic induction, you do the usual thing. So you pull back, you start, pull back, and you shriek, push forward using I, and then for the restriction, you do. And then for the restriction, you do the opposite thing. So you switch I and R essentially. So I guess implicit here is that one has like a six functor formalism in this setting. You have to be a bit careful with it. But this is one thing that's nicely explained in this book of a car, how this all works. Okay, so we have this definition and And so, in sort of representation theory of piadic groups, parabolic induction, well, I guess parabolic or like sort of the general restriction functor has a right adjoint and a left adjoint, which are different. So, you have induction and compact induction. But in this setting, basically, because of the decomposition theorem, the two adjoints are the same. So, it turns out that these are actually. It turns out that these are actually by adjoints, and they're exact for the perverse T structure. So everything is fine with perverse sheaves between P and H? G and H, yes. So here So here so this H is like H plus from section one. Yes, okay, yeah. I have to apologize. I'll probably accidentally be writing G, and this should always be H in the section. Yeah. Thank you for catching that. Thank you for catching that. Ah, that's a good question. So, does one have like this lemma whose name I'm forgetting with parabolic induction with respect to the opposite parabolic? Yeah, so in this setting, it's not Yeah, yeah, that's right. So I think in the end we were able to show this without proving this full, this second, that's right, this second adjointness lemma in this setting. Yeah, I should think about this more. So for one thing, I think you'd have to think a little about what an opposite parabolic. Have to think a little about what an opposite parabolic should be in this setting because you have the components group now, so that takes a little bit of thought, maybe. Yeah, we should talk about it after. That's a good question. Yeah, so you see many of the same structures. Okay, so this is parabolic conduction. Okay, so we can almost say what does custom mean? But here again, we have to be a little careful because our group is disconnected, and you can get a different notion of cuspital or cuspital support depending on which parabolic subgroups you test against. So, in this AMS work, well, let me not get ahead of myself. I'll fix a set of parabolics closed under H conjugation. And there's one more very minor condition which I won't say, which maybe will come up a bit later. And So, with respect to this class, we say that a perverse sheaf is hospital if the usual condition holds. So, if the restriction of the sheep is zero for all proper all proper parabolics in this class. All proper parabolics in this class. So maybe it's worth saying here. So for in the setting of section one, you need to take P to be the set of, I guess I'll call these quasi, let me say it like this. Parabolics of Of quasi-levy subgroups. And quasi-Levy, if I recall correctly, means that M is the centralizer of its connected center. So this is a property that's not generally satisfied by a disconnected Levy subgroup. So this isolates some class. And you can sort of play around with different choices. We're going to play around with different choices of CALP and they give you a slightly different theory. Okay, so this is all kind of dry and formal. What's really interesting is the second part. So let's just imitate what we did at the beginning of the talk. So how do we define cospital support? So what it should be is I take my equivariant perverse sheaf and I take the age conjugacy class of pairs of levees and a similar object for the levee. With the property that my sheep embeds into the parabolic induction. Okay, so one can just sort of write down the same definition. But then the issue is it's not clear that this is well defined. So at the beginning of the talk, I said for p-adic groups, here one has to use the geometrical lemma. So you have to basically compare two different parabolic inductions. Inductions. And in the paodic setting, the proof is actually quite difficult. So the only proofs I've been able to find sort of write down some like horrifying commutative diagram and then check that like five squares separately commute. And then you see that the whole thing commutes. But it's also conceptual. So for this, so We need some version of the geometrical lemma. And what I want to finish this talk by explaining is how the geometrical lemma in this setting is really just a statement about geometry. It's just some statement about the geometry of these stacks, which actually only minimally uses anything about. Anything about constructible sheaves. And you can sort of just see a lot of it by doing some calculations. Okay, so let's remember roughly what this says. So I have Two parabolics. So Q is N times unipotent radical of Q and P is M times unipotent radical of P. All right, so the lemma says if I First, do induction and then I do restriction. This is going to be the same as doing the other order, so restriction and then induction, but then you have to sort of do this in all possible ways. So the shape of it is something like this, and I apologize for how complicated this is. And I apologize for how complicated this is to write down. Let me not record the parabolic here just to make the notation a bit lighter. So in the end, what one does is you're summing over the vial group or some double cosets of it, and you transfer your right, so I'm starting with something on M. So I first transfer it to this vial conjugate of M. It to this vile conjugate of m. So I have to use W to do that. So I restrict from M to from the viocontic of M to the intersection with the other levy, and then I go back up. And one can also work out which parabolic subgroups to use by intersecting P and Q or conjugates of them appropriately. Conjugates of them appropriately. All right, so this is the statement. And so the proof of this that I want to sketch just uses sort of the geometry of this correspondence I wrote down to define parabolic induction and. To define parabolic induction and restriction. So let me just draw a big picture that shows how this looks. All right, so basically. All right, so basically, we're starting here, so we have this equivalent nil potent cone for M. And to do parabolic induction, we pull and push along this correspondence. So this is parabolic conduction, and then to go back, we do the same thing for the other parabolic. All right, so the way these sort of six functors work, when you do two pull pushes, that's the same as pulling and pushing along the like fiber product of the correspondence. So here I can put x, which is some other quotient stack, it turns out. And I can take the two projections and And doing restriction followed by induction will be the same as pulling and pushing along these projections. All right, so that's sort of the easier side of this story. So the left-hand side, for the right-hand side, somehow I need this vial group to show up. So I need to sort of see the geometry of these orbits. And we can immediately see this from this diagram. We can immediately see this from this diagram. So, in the bottom part of this square, I can just forget the spaces I'm dividing out by. So, this maps to point mod H, point mod P, point mod Q. And this simpler thing down here also has a fiber product, which, if you sort of understand how to compute these. Compute these is just going to be essentially a double coset space. So the point is this thing x that computes this correspondence has a natural map to this space. So x maps to h mod q mod p. On the other hand, On the other hand, by the Burha decomposition, this is just stratified by Burha cells relative to PNQ. So this is a stratification, and I can just pull it back to this correspondence. So out of this, I get The stratification of this correspondence. All right. So there's one last step. So without writing everything out, let me just say to sort of get all the way to this side, one would need to do the same thing for restriction followed by induction. So essentially, you would have to like rewrite. To like rewrite this diagram, but where you're sort of shrinking the size of the group instead of enlarging it, and you'll get something again. So you can similarly construct something I'll call yw. YW for each term on the right-hand side. And then the key that makes the lemma true is again just a geometrical comparison. So once you understand the way these things look, you can just write down a map between the strata on X and the Between the strata on X and the strata on Y, this is compatible with the projections. And in some sense, this map, like it has contractible fibers. So I won't exactly make that, well, I'll make it precise in some sense. What's sort of nice about this map is if I pull back and push forward along it, Pull back and push forward along, and I just get the thing I started with. So there's some sort of contractability, there's some sort of unipotent groups hiding behind everything. All right, so somehow only at the very end, you have to use anything about constructable sheaves, and maybe this proof has something to say about other. Maybe this proof has something to say about other six-functor formalisms or other settings of the geometrical lemma. All right, I'll stop there. Thank you.
