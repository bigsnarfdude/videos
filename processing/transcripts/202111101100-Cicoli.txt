I think that so the first I mean when Flager did this plot I think he ignored the papers that I wrote on reheating for this model where you get the number of default bits which is something Which is something quite precise between 52 and 53. But the other thing that is done here is that, you know, in fiber inflation, you have a starvisty-like potential with the plateau. And then at a certain point, there are two actions. You cannot have this plateau which goes on forever. So at some point, there is a stiffening region. And there is a parameter controlling this stiffening region, which I think in this plot has been set to zero. In a way, similar. In a way, similar forever. And so, what you should do actually is to keep this parameter and fix the number of info links close to 52, 53. Then, what you will have is that this violet line will shrink, but then it will move a bit on the right. And on top of that, what you should do, and this is what we did. What you should do, and this is what we did. Uh, what I did in a paper with Leonardo and Valentino: when you study the heating, what happens is that you also produce some ultra-like axions. These are the axionic partners of the inflaton, and they contribute to the effective number of neutrino-like species. So, this means that you should superimpose your predictions not to lambda CDM plus. Lambda C D M plus R plus sensitive scalar ratio, but to Lambda C D M plus R plus delta N F and because there is a positive correlation between delta and F and the spectral index a bit and in the end what happens is that the best fit gives an S which is around 0.97, so a bit more to the right, and R is 0.7. R is 0.007. Thank you. Thank you. Interesting. So I will stop sharing, I think, so you can start. So this ends the discussion. Thanks a lot to Fernando and Shamit for their great talks. And I'll hand it over to whoever's chairing next. I think that's me. So it's a pleasure to continue this really interesting. This really interesting session. So, our next speaker is Michele Ciccoli from Bologna, and he will give us his insights into Decitta versus quintessence, which sinks in the swampland. Yeah. So let's see if we can make you bigger in everyone's screen. I mean, as I said, otherwise I would use the tabloid. Otherwise, I would use the tablet. So, right now, I am seeing you just as you know, one of very many participants. Put it into the speaker mode. Oh, that's me. That's me. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. So I go to view speaker mode. How does it work? Okay. And then I guess, wait, okay. So I can, is everyone happy with that? I can, I can see quite well. I don't see land. I don't see land from swap. I don't see land from swampland. Yeah, and it's and the other problem is, of course, that whenever anyone else speaks, and we see but that's okay, we can mute ourselves. But we just need to pin the video. It's easy. I mean, you pin Michael, and then he's there forever as a main speaker. Thank you. The feature pin. Yes, you have to pin. Michael, there's no problem. You just need to, I mean, you could zoom out. You just need to, I mean, you could zoom out a little bit further, but otherwise, it's perfect. But Artu, can you see the screen? I can see everything, of course. I can only not see the land of swampland. You need to zoom it out a little bit further. Okay, that's good. Or you can write only until the P of swampland and then we will see everything. Exactly. Yeah, that's okay. This would be good. Yeah, to the right of P of swamp land, I cannot see. So if you write until there, So, if you write until there, here there's nothing, yeah. We stop here. Yeah, you can put a line or something there, and then the line where it looks better after the paper line, a vertical line down, and then yeah. Exactly. The curly bracket, basically after the error, yes, yes, well, after the peak, but a little better, after the peak, okay. That's it. Very good. Very good. Like this? Great, perfect. Great, great. Perfect. Okay, so let me start by thanking the organizers for the invitation. I would have really liked to come to Oaxaca. So I was there, I think, three years ago or something like that. And it was very nice, really like that. And so I want to try to give this Blackboard presentation because I'm missing this. Presentation because I'm missing these nice presentations on blackboards. And let me also say that what I'm going to focus on is based on discussions, actually, not even papers, which I started with Cesar Buniera, Tony Padilla from Nottingham, Francisco Pedro from Bologna, which will hopefully link to a paper. And then the second one with Max Brink. Second one with Max Gringman and Francisco, who are both in Bologna, and Divid Petro, who is in Palo. So, let me say that during my career, I always work on trying to build explicit models of the sitter with more direct stabilization, where I always try to compute things explicitly. So, in a certain sense, I sympathize a lot with the presentations of cat. Presentations of Catholic Shamit and Hernando and their point of view. But today I want to take a different approach. So I want to take the Swampland approach and I want to somehow be peaky in the sense that roughly speaking, if something is not under full parametric control, Not under full parametric control, then we might like to conjecture that this thing does not exist. And as you know, this has been used a lot to constrain the situation structures. And nowadays, there are some people you hear often claims where they say that maybe there is no decister in strain theory and strain theory Theory and string theory predicts instead of a dynamical dark energy state today, so like a quintessence state. And so what I would like to do today, I would really like to analyze quintessence model building from this Wompa point of view to see if quintessence model building is really in better computational shape, let's say. Shape, let's say, with respect to the seed therapy. I think it's important also to take this point of view because if you say I don't like the seed therapy for some issues, then if you follow the same logic and that leads you to dislike, say, quintessence even more, then somehow you are in trouble because our universe is Undergoing a period of accelerating expansion. So we should be able to describe acceleration in a way compatible with functional gravity. So maybe the starting point might not be completely the right one. So in doing this, let me first of all quickly review the swarm plant approach to the sector. To the sichter. And this is the following. You know, the difficulty to realize that the sicter and string theory has led to the sichter conjecture by Aubier et al. And this simply boils down to B phi greater or equal than C m plus B. Now this thing is. M plant B. Now this thing is pretty famous, where C is positive and is something of order one. Now, very quickly we realized that this thing was a bit too strong because you could also view out the haze potential, which has got a decision maximum. And on top of that, people also pointed out that minima, which are Minima, which are, or let's say, effective theories, which allow for supersymmetric anti-decisitor vacuum like KLT. For example, when you go to large field values, they develop at the sitter maximum because of alpha prime corrections. So, this would also allow us to theories which have supersymmetric antidecites. Symmetric antidecisor background. So people formulated a refined conjecture where they put this constraint or V Pi phi minus C tilde over m plan squared times V. Squared times B. So this is allowing now for the sitter maximum where this sitter is positive and it is something of order one. Now, as already pointed out before, there are even counterexamples to these conjectures. I've been working on them. And there is no reverse. And there is no inverse proof. However, there is strong evidence in favor of this conjecture in the boundary of modular space, in the region where, so let's say there is strong evidence, in the region where you would have parametric control over your effects. Control over your effective Ethereum, so if you want in the semi-classical approximation, so there is a strong evidence in any parametric control regime. This was derived in the same paper. Derived in the same paper of the refined simple conjecture by Oburi Tal. And the idea is the following: you know that there are two expansions in string theory. And one is the string loop expansion. This is controlled by the string coupling, which is Which is given by the dilaton. So one over the real part of the axial dilaton S. The second one is the alpha prime expansion, so alpha prime corrections. And this is controlled by one over the dimension less volume to the one-third. Because if you want, this is alpha prime divided by the dimension full volume to the one-third. To the one-third. So, the semi-classical regime, so when you go to the boundary, the multiplayer space is the one where you go, let's say, to infinity with both of them. And there is evidence here mainly coming from a combination of the distance conjecture, which will tell you that you have many light states coming in in your effectiveness theory. For example, here there is a figure. For example, here the compatification sorry, these are going to zero, right? So these things are going to zero in a second between KES the point. So this is the compatibility limit. And for example, you have many KK modes which become white. And then this has been combined with entropy considerations, like saying that you get an entropy which is larger than the one allowed by. Than the one allowed by the sitter. And this is confirmed by the fact that all the potentials we able to drive always feature running away to large dilaton or large void. So this means that if the single markua are there, they should be in the back of the modular space. So, can we see in a body of modular space? And you say that if the answer is yes, then there is the issue. There is the issue. This has been raised in a paper by the drawing and BAFA, but it might be shortly. This is the TCC conjecture where you are avoiding the fact that sublime wavelets Wavelength gets stretched during a period of accelerated expansion outside the horizon. But in a certain sense, it is true that observationally we need only one effort or so of dark energy. So in the end, you should not compare the lifetime of these guys to the age of the universe because we need only one efforting. And the second thing is that, of course. Of course, if you have a distinct minimum in the biofuel modulus piece, you need to check your approximations. Because it might still be that even if you don't have a parametric control, you still have good control, because still the parameters like the volume and the dilaton are big enough. And the dilaton are big enough to trust your effective theory. So the approximations are not such that you can make them as good as you like, but still they are good enough. In the end, we know that in standard gauge theories and the standard model, we have small parameters, trust perturbation theory, or even in cosmology, we know that cosmological perturbation theory works very well. And so let's say why. So a symbol, small parameters, which allow you to try to effective period. And as we've seen already in KKLT, you have W0, which is much less than 1. And in large volume, you have 1 over the volume, which goes like e to the minus 1 over. E to the minus one over Gs, this is also much less than one when Gs is in the perturbative regime. And this is the situation where we are in a BS. And just say that recently there's been also, I had to say, some progress in computing Pertupative corrections in particular, and also non-perturbative corrections to the superpotential. But let's say that there's been progress in computing quantum effects. For example, we know. For example, we know a fact a different order, like alpha prime squared, the string squared, just to mention some of them at order alpha prime cubed, at order alpha prime cubed, G string squared, at order alpha prime to the fourth, g string square, and or even alpha prime q at this. Of prime q at, let's say, higher f times order. So, let me say f to the fourth. So, people computed these things, some of them just for toroidal background, middle generalization to Cardios. But it is not true that we know nothing, so we know cellular of this effect, and then you can check if indeed the next order is modular with respect to the one that you are already considering to moderate organization. Organization. And let me also mention here that Fernando talked about Burgess and then also with Balandro Savelli and Andreas Schackner. So actually what you can do, you can use the two scaling symmetries of the 10-dimensional theory to work out the volume and the dilaton dependence. The dilatant dependence of any correction at any order in G string and alpha prime, just by knowing that each of these two modules controls these expansions. So one can also use, let's say, 10D symmetries. So in that paper, we used scaling variance plus SUSY. SUSY plus shift symmetry and we've been able to write down a generic order, let's say alpha prime to the n, g string to the n correction to v At order, we say f term to the 2r, and just to tell you this thing goes by b and r. So there is a factor a n and r and then there is one over the real part of the vehicle. dilatant to some power n plus r minus m divided by two then there is a w0 to the two r and this is divided by the volume two two plus m divided by three plus two r two thirds r minus one so you see you can increase the So you see, you can at least for an average correction, you can work out that this is the dependence on the dilatone and the volume. And the dependence on all the other monster line is in this fine so that you cannot determine. But at least some progress can be made. So now let me say that if I keep being skeptical and I do not trust these constructions, then I should have to do that. Then I should ask myself the question: is quite X sensing a better shape? So let me say, is string theory predicting using this more broad perspective dynamical Dark energy. So, first of all, let's also look at the parametric regime at the boundary of the modular space. So, let's check at the boundary of the modular space. Because this is a region where one is supposed to have full computational control. Full computational control, and I think this is the region where this evidence that there are no decisions to mark flow up, but there are running ways for the dilatone and the volume. So one can check if these running weights are good enough to give good access. So let me start with the volume. I will focus for concreteness of type 2B, but one can do the same thing. Same thing for type 2A or epherotic, and you get qualitatively similar results, i.e., a negative answer. So in this case, there is A that is minus 3 log of T plus T bar. And then what you have is that you look at the kinetic Lagrangian. So the kinetic Lagrangian is T plus P bar. t plus t bar squared d mu uh t d mu t bar and let me call t as tau plus i theta and let me ignore the for the time being the the action so this thing becomes just three divided by four tau squared d tau squared so if you can only normalize you get tau which is e L, which is e to the square root of 2 divided by 35. So now you want to use phi as your quick passive speed. Let's look at the scalar potential. So the scalar potential now So, the scalar potentials, I'm considering the standard type of weight with only F3 and H3 fluxes. So, I have the reality with the spectrum is equal to zero. I have no scale cancellation. So, this guy is e to the k du, where you are the compensation of line mod squared plus ds w mod squared. And then you see. And then you see that if I you see that this thing will go like one over tau cubed if I fix the compression of y and the philaton in a minimum which is not supersymmetric and that would generate a three level right away. But I could also fix s and u in a way such that the corresponding F terms are zero and then I have a function. And then I have a flat direction for T, which will be lifted by subliminic directions. So I think that a way to write this down in a model-independent way is to write it as V0, V, where V is the volume, so V is tau to the three odds, to the two plus V. And then you can substitute the value of tau here. Of tau here in terms of the canonical enormous view. So then you would get that p is v0 to the minus lambda pi, and you get the lambda is per root of six one plus p divided by two. And then you can go and check epsilon, so one half v phi over v squared, and this thing becomes This thing becomes simply lambda squared divided by two. And so it is three one plus p divided by two, where this p clearly is positive. And then you see that this thing is greater than one. So you can never get acceleration. What about the dilatone? So if you try with the dilatone, If you try with the dilatone, it works in a similar way. So you do it with the dilatone. In this case, K is minus the log of S plus S bar. And let me write S as little S plus I C naught. Then you have the canonical normalization. The canonical normalization becomes s e to the square root of 2 chi. It's simple. And then you can take your superpotential as c1 as a function of u plus s c2 as a function of u. You can compute what is the dilatant dependence of the scalar potential at three level. So e now of e to the k. Now with e to the k s s bar d s w d s bar w bar and you take for example you consider a situation where the compost structure of line are fixed supersymmetrically and you can see what is the scaling of this guy when you send the dilaton say S the real part to infinity and this guy becomes This guy becomes d0 times s. So it is d0 e to the square root of 2 chi. And then you can compute in this case what is the value of epsilon. And you find that epsilon is exactly equal to 1. So even in this case, it doesn't work. So similarly to the deceit case, also quintessence doesn't work. Quintessence does not work in any parametrically controlled regime of string theory when you are at the boundary of modular space. There is one character that we tried recently in a series of papers with Francisco and El Tibeteto, and in a similar spirit to what Bon has discussed. And this is the fact that in this case, actually, you don't have John. case actually you don't have just the s or for example for t you don't have just pound but you have also the corresponding axiom and and the combined field space is curved so there is an underlying curved field space and and because of that one can have a known geodesic evolution where in a certain sense Where, in a certain sense, the kinetic coupling between tau and theta can generate an effective potential that is stopping the drunken rate. And effectively is slowing the quintessence still down. And in theory, one in this way could get acceleration also for slip potentials. And one can check if this mechanism works in the case of the dilatone and the volume mode. And the body mode. So the idea is the following. So look at non-geolistic motion in field space. Roughly speaking, the idea is that. Speaking, the idea is that you have in the kinetic terms, there is also a term that goes like this, right? Y over tau squared du theta du theta. These are the kinetic terms for the action. Now, when I can only normalize, this guy becomes 3/4 e to the minus 2 square root of 2/3 pi. And then I say that the actual. And then they say that the axiom, there is a theta dot squared, so the axiom is moving. Then you see that if the axiom is moving, then in practice, what happens technically, let's say this is the potential for pi, and this is my runway, I have this extra contribution that gives me a kind of time-dependent extra contribution which can Somehow slow down and stop this guy file. You can check if this dynamics works and the answer is no. Because what happens is the following: you can look at these systems as dynamical systems and check the fixed point. And check the fixed point. And for example, if you take in general a killer potential which is minus p log of x plus x bar, and then you have a killer potential, sorry, a scalar potential, which is just e to the k v tilde zero. So it is only given by the e to the k piece. The k piece. So, in a certain sense, this would become my v0 e to the minus lambda pi, as we see earlier. And the kinetic arrangement contains this piece, which can be written as E to the 2C phi theta dot squared. square when this c is equal to square root of two over p. So once I fix this p, then you have everything because also this lambda is given in terms of p and then you can look at the fixed point in the plane where this is lambda and this is c and you get something elastic like this. And we're giving a region where you have a scaling solution where, let's say, phi is tracking the evolution of, for example, matter that you have in the period of matter domination before dark energy. This will be the standard period of geodesic evolution where actually this eat a lot of things. Where actually this eta logo becomes zero, and then there's a region of no geodesic evolution and the fixed point lying along a line like this, where you will have here the situation P equals three, here the situation P equals two, and you get here the situation P equals one. P equals one. So p equal three is the volume mode, p equal one is the dilaton, p equal two is something else. And but then you see that the volume mode is only in the scaling scrupula. So it is going to track the matter background. So little omega, the equation state parameter is zero in this case. It is not minus good. This thing is at the boundary. This thing is at the boundary between xi and non-codes and might work, but in the case of the duaton, but when you check the trajectories in terms of the equation of state parameter and capital omega, what you get is the following. So let's say you have literal omega, so this is the So, this is the equation of state parameter that we would like to have close to minus one for dark energy. This is capital omega. Fine, this is the one that we would like to have around 0.7 to 70 percent of dark energy. So, what you have is the following. So, let's say one and then let's say here you have zero. And then say here's zero. So this would be the situation when p is equal to two, the one that is not that interesting. Then there is one here where p is equal to three, as I said in the scaling solution. Then the one with p equals one is up here and corresponds exactly to the value. Correspond exactly to the boundary between acceleration and your acceleration because omega is minus one third. And interestingly, when you look at the evolution of the system, because you have a fixed point, so when you look at the trajectories, there are trajectories which in general look like this. So do something like that. There are other trajectories which do something like that for this. Something like that for this, and do something like this for this one. And here it is interesting because there is a region here, which is 0.7, because you might say, well, I'm not leaving that at the fixed point, but in the end, I only need one folding of repeats. So I might be in a transient. So when the system is approaching the fixed point and I'm there, where capital O again And there, where capital omega is 0.7, so I am in this region. But when you check at the value of little omega here, this becomes minus 0.7. So it's far away from minus 1. So this means that even allowing for this multi-field dynamics at the boundary of the modular space, it's not one. Even if you allow for transient regimes. Now, the question is: at this point, so if I want to build a quintessence model as an alternative to the sitter, I should also go to the part of modular space. So then the same control issues of the sitter are shared by quintessence. But on top of that, quintessence constructions have additional phenomenological properties. Have additional phenomenological problems. And I want now to mention these phonological problems which are well known. And then I will add another one that has not been probably appreciated enough in the case of dark energy. So let's say You need to do with that sense also in bar of modular space. And they say known challenges. There are known challenges. And to review this, I will use a nice paper recently written by Yatur et al. By Yatur et al. that mentioned all these issues. And let me first mention some requirements. These are the following. So the first one is that the quitaxis field and fine is very high. So it has to have a mass, which is below the half-white. Which is below the Hapl constant B, and this comes just from the row, right? Eta goes like B fin divided by E. This is M phi squared divided by H not squared. This is something that is around one or less. And this is tiny. So 10 to the minus time is 60. Sorry, 10 to the minus 60 and 1. And one. So here we are around 10 to the minus 32 electron. So this field has to be extremely light. And then the main question is, what about radiative corrections? How can you preserve such a low mass when your loop corrections coming in? And the other problem is. And the other problem is field forces. For example, we know that there are bounds from field forces. If I have a field which tackles with Pikachu's trend, so one over one, then its mass has to be larger than medium at the mass, roughly speaking. And here we are 30 orders of magnitude below. The second thing is that you need to have That you need to have m sol, you need to combine this with m so greater or equal than 1e. So this is set to minus 15 and plot. And of course, then you ask the question, can I have a potential that is allowing for both things? And on top of that, when I have loops with super partners running in the loop, how can I? How can I be sure that they do not leave these L5? The third thing is that you need to have also KK modes and KK, which are larger than 1 MeV, 1 milli atom, because of some millimeter tests of Newtonian gravity. And on top of that, you want also, after three days, four or five. There is four, not five, and um, so you want also to have a handy volume mode, so you want to have a volume mode which might or might not correspond to fight, they might be different fields, but you want also this time to be larger than one milli electron mod to avoid the field forces. And finally, let me put also a fifth constraint, you want the Constraint, you want the string scale to be larger than one TV. You see, once you put all these constraints together, it's not easy actually to satisfy them and get an effective future which is under control with this small value of one. Let me maybe dwell a bit more on this. So let me talk about a brief about the slide boiling problem. So for example, as I said, the street scale was like a time scale that divided by square root of the volume. And you want these to be larger than 1. Larger than 1 TV. So this means that your volume should not be larger than something of order 10 to the third, instant. Now assume that I have a potential, B, where there is a meeting order piece that depends on the volume and stabilizes the volume at A vacuum which might be in cost. And now let's say that the subject in order the sum, I generate the potential for phi and v. Of course, the potential for the potential sphere, which I am assuming to be different from the volume, otherwise I always get down to the cosmological constant scale for the flask. Constant scale for the flask. This has to couple to the volume because of binary scaling to go to for the natural eyes energy. And now what happens is that if I look at the ratio, the mass of the volume divided by the mass of fine squared, this thing goes roughly speaking as eight divided by the sub and And so I can write, well, let me write it down differently. Maybe let me write it down the mass of the volume as a mass of time. And let me take the square root here. Let me do it like this. And but now I know that this guy is of order. is of order the this guy is design is of order h naught so I get that I get this thing then I want the volume let's say to be larger than one mi electron volt so I want this to be larger than 10 to the minus 30 That 10 to the minus 30 and plan. I know what is this, this is 10 to the minus 60 and plum. So then from this, I work out what has to be the ratio in the hierarchy between the leading order potential, the sublight of the volume, and the sub-leading one for the quintessence field. And what I get, I get, remember that the volume cannot be bigger than. It cannot be bigger than 10 to the 13. So, what I would get, I get that V lead divided by the sum has to be greater or equal than 10 to the 60. So you can see it is a huge hierarchy that I have to generate. Otherwise, things will not work. Will not work. Scales do not come out right. So, this is telling you what? Well, this is telling you that if I have a leading order, some sort of shift symmetry that is keeping the crystals field light, the symmetry-breaking parameter which generates the quintessence potential should be tiny. Otherwise, you have Be tiny, otherwise, you never get this huge height. So, if you're trying to do quintessence with the succession, where in general, there could be some kind of effective non-compact shift symmetry because of the underlying non-scale, but this is broken by perturbative effects. And perturbative effects do not give this hierarchy. To give this hierarchy, you would need a huge volume, but that volume would be bigger than that. Volume, but that volume would be bigger than 10 to the 30, and then you would have the steam scale you don't want to. So, the way out here, I guess, is to consider instead axials, where indeed you have that symmetry breaking effect, can be tiny because of non-perturbative corrections. So, let me see. This cannot be achieved, cannot be achieved with. With the Council interactions. For example, let's say that we need, let me just give you an example. So we need is the alpha prime Q correction that has been computed by Becker-Backer Artillery. This is one over body Q. And let's say that these sublimating. Because it is true that this depends just on the road molecule. Now, this of leaving, let's say that this is one of these computation, this alpha prime cube terms at order f to the fourth, which had been recently computed by, relatively recently, by Jan Louis and Alexander Bastal. So, these quantities, they go like one of the... So these quantities they go like one over volume to the element of the Earth. And they in general depend on all the multiple. So then what you have is that the league divided by the sum. In this case, we do like volume to the two-thirds. And you want this to be, as I said, this hierarchy, 10 to the 60. 10 to the 60. But then this tells me that the volume should be bigger than 10 to the 90. But then it doesn't work because we have the student scale, which is much less below 180. This is what I said before, just in words. So in this sense, Saxon So this saxion quidessence looks much better. So in this case, we say axiom in that sense is better well because I will add that. because I will add that this D sum in this case it's generated only at lower tuberculos level so we go like e to the minus e power so e to the minus volume to the two-thirds and so I can I can have that V8 divided by V sub now this was like e to the volume to the two-thirds divided by volume cube Divided by volume Q, and this can be much greater than 10 to the 16 for the volume that is below 10 to the third, clearly because of the exponential. Plus the fact that the axial being a superscalar automatically has no problem, so no issue with fifth forces. Forces and radiative stability of its mass. So, in this sense, this looks as a better time. Let me now mention another issue, which in general is another fee issue that in general is used for inflation. And let's say, let me call it a new challenge. At least it was new for me, maybe it is rather new for other people. And this is the candlestick in the problem. And, you know, the candlestick in the problem tells you that this has already been mentioned today, so I will be very quick. So let's say that you have your potential and this potential has, again, is a function of volume, and this has got an input. And this has got an eigen maybe with a barrier. And the same when you consider KKT here, you have V, or this barrier was like the gravity normal mass squared. Then you have the contribution from inflation, sigma D, where sigma is my inflaton and D is the volume, the door is capable. And this is the volume that always tackles the inflaton, for example, by A to the K in front of the supergravity F term scalar potential. But this is true more in general, so you need to do the detail because of the value scaling. So if the inflation scale now, let's say that I sit here, and so if I sit there, then this potential would be zero, and this would give me H inflation squared. So if this energy So, if this energy is larger than the barrier, I'm getting a rather rate. So, what I have to impose is that age inflation is below the guaranteed mass. And something similar happens also in the large volume scenarios. Now, there are a way out of this that I've been already discussing. Of this that I've been already discussed, like high-state SUSY, which in the end might still be fine with some tuning to get the correct Higgs mass, sequestering, even if sequestering helps a bit and not completely. And another possibility is to have the volume which evolves, that the volume is the input of itself. On itself, but even in that case, it's very hard to make it work. I've been always working, I mean, I also worked on these constructions, and the idea is that you have a potential, roughly speaking, like this, where there is a kind of infection point at small damage or volume, where the gravitational mass is large, and then this relaxes to a minimum where the gravitino mass here becomes small. Here becomes small. But the problem is that these models are rather confined because you need to generate an inflection point here. So you need to include several contributions, group 2 D terms, anti-grace, and so on. And in general, even that you have a small volume, besides being tuned and contrived, it's not clear if you can trust your effect. Effectively theory in this reach. The other possibility, as you know, is the race track. Where you know, it's the race track when you have a double exponential and you have mean costing and you have a potential like this, where in this supersymmetric mean cost of minimum, this is when you have a range struct. So there is A. So there is A e to the minus A t plus B e to the minus B t. In this case, the barrier is detapped from the galactic mass because the garatino mass is zero here. But now let's try to apply this problem to quintessence. So if you If you apply this to quite access, so the KDL program for quite access, this will tell you what? So this will tell you that now your total potential should be written in this way. It's a potential in order that fixes the volume. There will be an extra contribution from There will be an extra contribution from the influence, sigma, and that is something in order you generate the potential for the quintessence field phi. Now, this means that this guy goes like H inflation squared, this guy goes like H not square. Now, the fact that you have no AI problem for inflation means that V, as we've seen, so V phi V is much less than V sigma V. And the sigma B because it's not as much as H inflation. And because of the Carlos-Linda program, you want also this to be below the buyer against the compatification, which is of the same size, let's say OB. So this is telling you that there has to be really a huge priority between the potential for the volume and For the volume and the volume for the quintessence field, not just from the considerations we've seen before, but also to avoid any decompatification from the inflationary energy density. So, more precisely, you can estimate these and you can get that V phi B has to be equal. Rex or equal that you can plug in this case, then you get H naught divided by H inflation squared times the volume. Then you can plug in the value of H naught and you can plug your favorite volume for value for each inflation, and you can get again. A bound which can be even worse than the one you seeking for. So you have this relation and for example H inflation is something that has to be between 10 to the minus 4 and 1. This is from the non-observation of tension modes. And then I guess the lower And then I guess the lower bank, the best I could find in the literature was one Gb. But in theory, as long as big bank nucleosynthesis work, inflation could be okay. And if you require TV heating, in the case of a very efficient TV heating, where this is just H inflation times a plan above one MeV. One Mb, then you will get a distinct which 10 to the minus 42 and 1. Notice, however, that data overall, so these are the density perturbations during inflation. During inflation, V is given by eta inflation squared, roughly speaking, divided by epsilon. And we know that this k is 10 to the minus 10, roughly speaking. So this means that if I combine this with the De Sitter conjecture, because now we're taking the point of view where I believe in this projector, so if I have epsilon, which is not bigger than scientific order point one, Let's say from the refined CPA conjecture, then this will give me H inflation as a lower bound that is 10 to the minus 5 or 10 to the minus 6 in plugins. So you don't go down to this extra small value because then it would correspond to a super, super small x. But now if I let's say if I Now, if I say if I stick to this bound, so I'm very, very conservative, so I take the 10 to the minus 42, here I would get what? I would get 10 to the minus 36 V volume. So still, I get 36 orders of magnitude of IRT. Whereas if I consider 10 to the minus 6, so I really want to So I really want to take the small plug point of view. Then in that case, I would get, in the other situation, I would get 10 to the minus 108. So it would really need a huge hierarchy between these guys. So then what would be the picture to get desired? The picture to get the desired. So the picture would be the following one. Susha, can I get five more minutes? Yeah, yeah, you started a little bit late, so. Okay, thank you. So let's say the picture, if you want to avoid all these problems, roughly speaking, is the same. It is the following. At least in order. In order, in tensions, you have your potential, the functional volume has a SUSY mean costing vacuum with The reason why I write on Susie is because if this is non-Susie, then for me, it's qualitatively the same as the sitter. And at that point, one should dislike this from the Zornbland perspective. So, Susani Koski went. So, Susan Cosky win an axonic power actually to get this fire. So, immediately, this does mean that case like this, so vacuum which would be allowed by or situation like this, so vacuum this kind of would be allowed by the desitter conjecture, they would not work for pites. So, let's say that. So they say that. So if I have a green order, this potential that has a SUSY, that has a SUSY antidepresster, then when I consider the additional energy coming from quintessence, because of the hierarchy in scales, this can never bring me up to something positive. So this also should this cannot work. This cannot work. Or if I have something like this, which could be, for example, KKLT, so this could be the SUSY anti-decision minimum, and this would be a design maximum. And I could try to do hip top here, right? So let's say that I try to do hip top with tests here. This will also not work because this barrier will not be. This barrier would not be big enough to prevent any destabilization because of the Causion in the problem. Because this would then be of the order of the cosmological constant today. And then when you add the inflationary energy, this becomes running. So these two things do not work because of the coverage in the problem and the And the light volume as well. So, really, we see two things that could be allowed by the supercontractor, but in a quintessence model building perspective did not work. Now, second point is that. Second point is that you generate the sum as a function of phi and the volume is generated by subdominant contributions. So, already I already mentioned in the pie. I already mentioned in the pie, so let's say that this could be generated with pertupative corrections for saxians. But in general, these are an error, as we see before, small enough. They will always be too big. They will be too big, and so you will have a light volume problem. A light volume problem, you will have attachments in the problem, even for models that, for example, will just look like this. So, for models where you don't really need to stabilize this pi, you might also generate just a randomly as submitting order for pi. But this thing would also not work, even if it would be allowed by the system contractor again. I have also written our model. I don't have now time to go through it, but it will be the paper, where you can generate by a fiber modulus this kind of runway, which would have also the right lambda, so it's different from the volume mode, but you could have the right lambda to get acceleration, but then you never get stability of the volume once you add on top of. Volume once you add on top of it, the inflationary energy density. So, also running ways are bad. So, when you hear people say that, okay, you can do quick tests with a running wave because they can emerge naturally, it doesn't seem that they work easily. So, this means that what we should do is to consider non-perturbative corrections. To consider non-perturbative corrections, non-perturbative corrections for axions. And this is good because there is no calculated problem in this case, because you could get the right hierarchy. There would be no fit force problem, no. will be no feet force problem no light volume problem let me say that however one should focus again if you take the this one product perspective on the four accent Since when you have models where FA is transplanted, sorry, this would be intention with the weak gravity projector. So if you don't want to be intentional with the weak gravity projector, you should build these models with the action close to the maximum. To the maximum, so where FA is below L1, and then you place yourself close to the maximum. One thing that you have to be careful is that at leading order, you have to leave only one flat direction, which is the axiom. The corresponding saction should be lifted. For example, if you try the example I gave you earlier, so if you try the rextra, so if you try the rextra. The registrar. So, if you try the registrar, which is Susie Likhoski, even if you might say, okay, I like it because it's super symmetric, but you know that there is tuning, there is also some model building issue to get this double exponential. But in that case, what happens is that at least in order, so when you consider only the The yeah, when you consider only three-level effects, you have both the axion and the corresponding saxion, which are flat. So, when you develop a potential for the axion, you develop a potential for the saxion. And you can check in that case that when you try to displace the axion away from its minimum, and you want to put it on top of the maximum, you will destabilize the volume. You will destabilize the volume energy. So, you really have to be careful that you have also to create a height. How could this work? Well, it could work. Let me say, ideas. I want to very briefly mention these ideas. Very briefly mention these ideas and then maybe tell you what the problem is if you buy these ideas with Axe on TikTok. So, Mike, I just let you know that you're eating into the discussion time now, so it's 6.13 now. Okay, so let me just make sure this and then respond. So, the ideas would be, for example, to have a supercontext shot that depends on D by non-geometric or geometric fluxes in type 2A, but again, it's designed. But again, is this under control? Are there back reaction effects? The second possibility is to consider a G moduli. Because when you have G moduli, you could get, let's say, something like a race track. So you get supersymmetric vacuum. And when you have someone is oriented for the odd moduli, then still be flat at that order of approximation, and then they can be lifted in that subliminal order. In the subidimotor. And the second possibility is to do an MPS with an upheaval and in this case use the volume axiom. Of course, all these issues might I mean all these models might have some uh control issues as well, but I guess this will be the procedure to get uh working with SS models. Uh, working with SSM. But the last thing I want really to mention is that but had to be the maximum to get to make it work. So, but how close I want to mention this because this is important for the final conclusion. Conclusion. So, how close is maximum? So, you just take the standard axiom potential that is labeled at sublimin order. So, we have the standard cosine of phi, this mechanically anomalized axiom, divided by the corresponding decay constant. And you can check that you can compute delta phi zero. So, this is the minimal The minimal sorry, this is the maximal distance from the maximum that is allowed, still having an acceleration. Okay, so this is the maximal distance. So this is the maximal distance from maximum compatible with acceleration and with And with omega, which is minus one, and capital omega, which is 0.7. You can check this, and you can find the delta formula, which is the following. You get the log of delta pi zero, which is C zero plus C one, the log of F A plus C two, the log of F A squared. F A squared, but these are more than one numbers. And the interesting thing is that you find that when F A is point one and one, this becomes delta phi naught becomes of order 10 to the minus 4 and 5. So you need to be pretty close to the maximum. Whereas when F A correlated counts 10 to the minus 2 and 1, you can check that B. You can check that this thing becomes tiny, super tiny immediately, 10 to the minus 32 millibar. But this is very important because then you should ask yourself what happens during inflation. So now during inflation, there is quantum diffusion. So during inflation, these guys are flat. And quantum diffusion tends to move that away. So if you choose your initial condition very carefully, you choose your initial condition very carefully to be extremely close to the maximum quantum diffusion will tend to kick you away so during reflection during inflation what you have is that quantum diffusion will give you a key delta phi for their h inflation and you want this guy to be smaller than delta phi zero because Then the point is zero because you don't want to go away from the maximum. But then immediately you see that if FA is already 10 to the minus 2 and 1, the inflation energy has to be below 10 to the minus 22. So if you're not satisfying this thing, this is mean electromote. So if the inflation scale is above mean electromote, there is no way to do VTOC axis to test this because. Axiom places because the inflationary energy we fill with but then you should ask yourself again if I take this one plan perspective which value of F A should I consider? So when you compute F A to the kinetic Lagrangian, as we've seen before in the simplest case, it's like one over tau squared d nu theta d nu theta. theta d mu theta and this is setting minus a squared so as a equals by m twan divided by tau so this is m1 divided by volume to the two terms and let's say that you want to to trust your uh effective ethereum so this thing as to as let's say is below at least At least of order 10 to the minus 2 and one if the volume is larger or at least 10 to the 3, for example. So immediately this tells you that H inflation has to be below one equal epidemic to make this whole thing work. So, conclusion and then a stop. So, if I take the point of view of the dissipative conjectures, of repeat sense is not in better shape than the sister. Okay, let me stop here. Okay, let me stop here. Okay, thank you so much for your very interesting talk. We have some time for questions and comments. Fernando and then Artu. Yes, very nice talk, Mika. Very good to see it on the blackboard. So you concluded, essentially, that if you take the CTA conjecture, The conjecture seriously, then you don't get quintessence to work. But many of the arguments you were using, I think, can you take out the assumption of the sample conjecture from the C-Theer and still extract information? Yes, yes, this is a good question because let's say that I don't care about these conjectures, you click those and find that. It goes and find that there is dynamic advantage. So, the issues with this kind of leader problem applied to vitas, the required hierarchy from field forces and radiative instability, this whole thing will still be true. So, I think it is also, I mean, it is still true that you should find a leading order any costly solution, which could also be non-supreismatic. Which could also be non-supersymmetric, doesn't need to be supersymmetric. And you need to generate the potential for the quidescence field that something would work. And to get this huge hierarchy, the only way I see that could work naturally is via some axon. But then if you do it with the axon, you have this issue with the hip top. Issue with the hip top that is completely unstable because of quantum diffusion, then for me, the thing that would work better would be some kind of alignment, some kind of axion inflation where you get an effective transplant decay constant. This would be my like the Niles-Pelosi story, yeah? What's that? You think it's a model, an inflation model like the Niles Pelosi? Yes, something like this. This would be probably the thing that looks more promising from this analysis. Because when you try it with the volume of LID, with Saxons in general, it's very hard to get this hierarchy. Good, good, thank you. Thanks. Artu? So, yes, basically, my comment or question goes the same direction. So, namely, in a standard model, you have a large F-germ, right? You have to have an F-germ and you have to F-germ energy, which is huge. And you anyway somehow need to fine-tune that to zero. So, I don't know how to make that zero except through fine tuning. I can use no scale, but no scale is not good enough, you discuss based on corrections. Enough to discuss based on corrections. So if I have this fine-tuning my background, then of course I can make quintessence by having a large f-axion, that I agree, that's a good procedure. But then I violate the swampland conjecture because if I can fine-tune that minimum to zero, I could also fine-tune it to be a bit above zero, and then it would violate. So I think if you don't care about swampland, then Fernando is right. I simply take a fine-tuned model with Venus motion constant. With Vening's motion constant, and hope that I can construct a slightly transplanted axion, and that would do the job. I totally agree, yes. Okay, okay, good. Thank you. I mean, my perspective, because you know, I sympathize with this kind of modern fielder point of view. But, you know, when I sometimes get invited to conferences where the audience is not made. Where the audience is not made of experts in string theory, and I had to give a few talks on cosmology. I start maybe talking about constructions to get the seat there with key brains, anti-brains, whatever. Then there are people who say, oh, but these things do not work. And the prediction string theory, we heard that it is quintessence. So, but what I want to do, okay, let's take the same. Let's take the same point of view and see if indeed the quintessence is fully under control. But it is not, it's even worse. So, the idea, I mean, my point of view is that if you dislike the sitter, then following the same logic, you should dislike quintessence even more. But given that our universe is accelerated today, it means that the starting point somehow has to be wrong. So, in the end, I agree that. I agree that probably there is no solution where you have food control, but this just means that you have to make your hands dirty and do computations in the bulk of modular space. That's an alternative conclusion that the string theory doesn't describe the universe. Are there further questions or comments? Yvonne. So, no, maybe I just want to comment that so we have some proceedings with Susha, Bruno, and Divia, where we analyzed a huge class of runaways. We showed that it doesn't work. Also, we also did this kind of hilltop thing also with Jesenia. And yeah, more or less all what you said is there. What you said, it's there, so just to mention. But in the yeah, in this review, in these proceedings, we have tables, and you can really see that for many, many classes of very stringy-oriented models, you don't get this runaway quintessence, it's just not happening. So, we have a lot of models there. Okay, I'm not sure. But I I had it in my mind. Sorry if I may. I didn't quite catch what you said, Yvonne. Do you agree with this conclusion that is written there that with essence is not in better shape than DS or not? I I kind of understood the contrary. To the contrary, no, no, no, I agree with you. Okay, I just said, yeah, we have this in our two papers. Well, one paper, but you did obtain quintessence or not? Yes, the hilltop, but then we discussed precisely what Michele is discussing about how far, but with a sacrifice, not with this axiom, but again, you can discuss. But again, you can discuss how far away the hilltop you can be. And yeah, we discussed this with the paper with Jessenia. That was in the press with the hilltop to trust the effective decay, you want to go to large volume. Large volume means that you decrease the decay constant. But when you decrease the decay constant, it means that you. Constantly needs to be closer and closer and closer and closer to the maximum acceleration. But then you want to make it yeah for the axion, yeah. We we did with this axion yeah no, I agree. Thanks. Thank you. We have um a couple of minutes. We have a couple of minutes. Does anyone want to make any final comments or questions? I'd like to organize another conference again in Mexico. We can future in person. Me too, me too. I actually, can I just have one naive question? So it seemed that your constraints on the hilltop, both Saxion and Axiom. Both saxion and axion coming from inflation. So it seems like you're kind of assuming that everything's there at the same time during inflation, the quintessence field is sitting there already at its maximum. And I mean, could it not be that, you know, dramatic things are happening by the end of inflation and then things kind of resettle again? And so those constraints that come from both the infoton and both the infoton and and the ax and the quintessence together might might you might be able to evade them no so what do you have exactly in mind i i i i don't have anything concrete in mind it just it seems it seems uh that one wouldn't have to assume though that the that the i mean am i right that you're you're assuming that right that you're you're assuming that during inflation the quintessence field is sitting there already at its maximum at its maximum but that's what i'm saying is that even so if i do not assume that the guy is there at the maximum then uh there is no quintessence later on if i assume that it is there at the maximum then quantum diffusion during inflation will kick me out so maybe i have to make it more concrete so for example More concrete. So, for example, I think Susha is right. Your potential could significantly change between inflation and later. So, imagine the axial sector is significantly changed, both its F and the height of the potential. That's conceivable because it depends on other moduli. And then you could have been in a situation when the minimum during inflation, there's a steep minimum at the point when you later get a maximum. You see, somehow the sine of the cosine flips, basically. During inflation, you have a high. During inflation, you have a high strong positive cosine with a minimum, and that coefficient changes after inflation, and you get a maximum, a shallow maximum later by moduli motion. That's conceivable. I mean, I'm not sure I would like to work on such models, but logically I cannot exclude. Right, I mean, you have only to check if this is not. Destroying all the hierarchies that you need, right? Because I had in mind that to preserve these huge hierarchies, that you need to get the right inflation scale and cosmological constant scale. Somehow the potential for the inflaton, sorry, the potential for the quitescent speed was not affected by the inflationary dynamics. But yeah. I agree that you're prejudiced about this. I'm just saying that logically, I cannot. I'm just saying that logically I cannot exclude that somebody builds an inflation model of this sort. No, I agree, I agree. I mean, for example, I know you could try to do some kind of, you know, in the KK we thought about that. You have the anti-deceptor minimum and then you have the deceptor maximum. So let's say that inflationary energy is the status. Say that the inflationary energy is destabilizing you, so it's pushing you the uh anti-decision minimum up, so there is a run away. Maybe then inflation stops before you overshoot the maximum and then you just end up at the maximum. Something like this. No, no, I meant two different fields. I meant the inflaton, the inflation proceeds using the modulus, which enters the prefactor of the code. Pre-factor of the cosines of the condescension field. Okay, it is a different. That's what I was. I think that's what Sush had in mind, to be precise. Yeah, for example, yeah, it seems that there would be ways out of that. But in any case, I agree with your conclusion about Zuzy. I think the strongest point of these models, of these quintessence-tide models, is the quintessence field is compact, right? You don't need to stabilize. In the end, if you end up with quintessence matrix. Made from an axion in a compact space, then you could have lifted up. So then you could have been, yeah, then the swampland is invalidated unless there's some conspiracy. I mean, I think swampland people would now say, oh, but there's some conspiracy that you know precisely this uplift that you would need to turn this into into the sitter will not work. But I do not believe in that very much. I do not believe in that very much. No, and the other thing that worries me is that if you have a coupling between the quites and speed and the infraton, you know, the requirement of getting the right inflation scale from the density perturbations might lift the mass of the quintessence field. But I mean, it looks hard from the model building point of view, at least. No, the quintessence is still an axion. The axion mass has not changed. I mean, the prefix. Mass is not changed. I mean, the pre-factor can be depending on other model line. That doesn't affect the loop, the loops will be prevented by the shift symmetry. You see, I mean, the idea is that the inflaton enters the non-perturbative, the coefficient of the non-perturbative term, which is still exponential in some other modulus, which is large. And you're saying this will not enter into the The scale of the potential, Jackson? I don't think so. So imagine inflation is the infrotone is a complex structure modulus, which somehow appears in the coefficient like a of z multiplying e to the minus t. And t has a large real part, making this tiny, and an axion. And now the z modulus. Uh, the Z modulus can be the influx one and can lead to an arbitrary change almost of the cosine governing the C-form quotes field. Okay, I think I think probably I think probably we've overrun and it's getting late for some of us. The blackboard was beautiful, by the way. The blackboard was excellent. I liked it actually more than the usual Zoom. Very good, very good. You know, being lazy in writing is life is good. Okay, so let's thank Miki. Okay, so let's thank Mike again and all the speakers for today.
