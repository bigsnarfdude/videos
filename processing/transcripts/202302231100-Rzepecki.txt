It's a very nice place. First time in Canada actually. Nice place to kind of strange people. And overall the conference has been very nice for us. Okay, overall the conference has been really nice and I really like being here. So this is basically a report on joint work in progress at CRISPR. So there will be not too many strong results, just some basic observations about what Rotendi groups look like. What Grottendy groups look like in the context of Halli semi-groups. Okay. First, in order to explain what a Grottendy group is, let me just look at some general things. So if S is an abelian semi-group, we satisfy the cancellation law, meaning that if we have two elements which end up the same after multiplied by something, then they're actually the same. Then we can always embed it into a group by just. Embedded into a group by just artificially adding a neutral element, necessary, and then adding other artificially universals if necessary. And this always gives us a group in which S embeds. So if S is still abelian but does not satisfy cancellation well, then what we can do is we can just force cancellation well by identifying some elements, and then we can embed the resulting quotient semi-group into a group. And as it's not the And as it's not abelian, then this is not quite so simple. Namely, even if it is cancellative on two sides, because it's a semi-group, we have two kinds of cancellativity, given that we have cancellativity on both sides, it will still may not be able to embed into the group. So it's not as simple. There's no finite set of conditions that we have to force. And after we do that, we get something that bands into groups. So it's a bit different than the case of the building groups. The construction is not so simple. Yeah, so the underlying reason is that the universal theory of groups is not finitely axiomatizable, unlike the universal theory of abelian groups. However, by abstract nonsense, we can show there always is a universal homomorphism from any semi-group into a group. So either it can be constructed in the standard way, we just consider all homomorphisms into groups basically and diagonalized, or we can just explicitly give a percentage of the group. Or we can just explicitly give a presentation of a group into which we can embed as. Okay, so this is. Yeah, so we have embedding is not anyway. So we have an echimorphism of semi-groups. Universal ecomorphism. And this allows us to make a definition. So, given a semigroup, we have something that we call the Grothendieck group of the semi-group, which is a group along Which is a group, along with an associated homomorphism. With the property that every homomorphism from this semi-group to a group factors through it unique, right? So, if we have, whenever we have this homomorphism from the semi-group to the grotto group, and whenever we have some other G, where there's a unique for each homomorphism here, there's a unique homomorphism here, which makes this commute. Which makes this commut. So, as I said before, this always exists. So, just to give you some simple examples, what it looks like in general, so if we take a group of natural numbers, the Grotten D group is just a group of integers. If we take any group and take a sub-semigroup, which generates G as a group, then the Grotendy group is a whole. So, in this case, this is an embedded, but for example, if we just take the power set of any set. For example, if we just take the power set of any set and consider the semi-group of intersection, well, the Grotendy group is trivial, basically, because we can always intersect everything with the empty set. And this ensures that in the Grotendy group, there will be an element which absorbs every element. But the only group with this property that has such an element is the triple group. But we're not interested so much in absolute semi-groups. We're interested in ally semigroups. Interested in allie semi-groups. But for now, let me talk about general compact houses of left topological semi-groups. So these are groups in which multiplication on the left is continuous. So sometimes this is called right topological semi-groups. Somehow model theory use this convention. Okay, in particular, LIS groups are of this kind. LIS semi-groups are of this kind. And in general, even if it's not an Ellis group, just something like this, there are always minimal left ideals. At least there are always minimal left ideals, and there are always compact principal ideals, and they are disjoint unions of groups, which are called Ellis groups. It's just like a little mirror stock. And they're always all isomorphic as groups. But in general, they're not closed and they're not topological groups. So multiplication is not continuous with the induced topology. Okay. Yeah, so. Yeah, so in general, if you have a minimal left ideal, then from the fact that minimal left ideals are disjunctive groups, it's not too hard to deduce that, well, if we take any element of a minimal ideal and they the whole group and multiply on the right by this element, then we get the minimal ideal. And if we then multiply on the left, we get an LS group. So as soon as we find an element of minimal ideal, in a sense, it's very easy to find an LS group. So in particular, So, in particular, if we take for you the identity of the Ellis group, then we can consider a map. And if you consider the canonical homomorphism from the semi-group to the group, then if you look at the image of the LS group, which is U times S times U, this is the same because it's a homomorphism as the image of U times S, that takes the image of the whole S times the image of U, but the image of U is, well, so this is just. So, this is just phi of s, because phi of u is an identity. Because a semi-group homomorphic takes idempotent elements to idempotent elements, and in a group there's only one idempotent element, which is the identity. So, the image of the L's group is the same as the image of the whole semi-group. So, it follows that if you consider the restriction of the canonical homomorphism to the L's group, well then the range is the same. The range is the same. So, in particular, since Um is a group, well, then the restriction of a semi-group homomorphism is a group homomorphism. So, the image of phi restricted to Um is a group. The range, and so the same is true about the range of S because it's the same thing. And using the fact that, well, from universality, it follows that the image of S generates the graph and the group. So, in fact, The Growth ND group. So, in fact, this map from UN to the GraphNet group is a subjective group homology. Okay, so in summary, the Ellis group is a subgroup of our semigroup with the property that the restriction of the universal homomorphism to it restricts the semigroup, well, subjective semi-group homomorphism onto the growth index. Yeah, okay, I yeah, this is what I said. Okay, I repeated myself, sorry. Yeah, and I think about a year ago, in your seminar, Pyot asked, well, we're not really discussing the Grottendy group. We're discussing the Ellis group in the context of Lushovsky's paper, but he asked whether the Elling's group actually is the Grottendy group. So, in other words, So, in other words, whether, so we have this canonical homomorphism from the Elders group, the Grothendieck group. So, this question basically is asking whether the restriction, this homomorphism is actually an isomorphism. So, in general, it's not true. So, it may be that the Grotendig group is trivial, but the Elise group is not. You mean the definable group action or yeah, he asked this in context of model theoretic things, but model theoretically can be done to define it. Definable group? For example. What? No, it's not. Wait, second. That's fine. There's usually two cases, right? Definable group or automorphism group. Yes, so I mean there are examples in both cases. Also abstracts. There's a six element semi-group which you can find. So eight, eight, eight. Okay. Uh okay. Okay. Um yeah so so so so so so we have some simple simple fair fairly straightforward theorem that allows us to characterize when the Grafeng group actually is equal to the semi-group in terms of idempotence, basically. So we have several conditions. So one condition is that the Grauffiny group is the Ellis group. Well the second condition is that the map government The second condition is that the map going from the semi-group to the wait, so I said before that the L is group in general is the same as U times S times U. So we have a map going from S to the L is group, which takes an element F to an element UFU. Okay, and it's not difficult to see that if when we pass the grottenic group, then F and UFU always go to the Because we just multiply by the products, which go to the identity. So the equivalence of one f2 is pretty straightforward. So the fact that the Grotten group is the LIS group, by which I mean that the canonical map from the Ellis group to the Grotten D group is an isomorphism, is equivalent to saying that this map is actually a group homomorphism, a semi-homomorphism, sorry. Okay, we have several other conditions. Okay, we have several other conditions, namely that for each eigenpotent, so u is a fixed eigenpotent in this minimal ideal. So I say that for each other eigenpotent in this minimal ideal, and every minimal eigenpotent, which is equivalent to u, so if you don't know what it is, maybe you don't care so much, but I should just say, so v is equivalent to u when u times v equals 3. So this is an equivalence relation with the cost of. So, this is an equivalent relation of the class of minimal item potents, by which I mean idempotents in minimum ideals. And so, if it's true that for each item potent in this minimum ideal, every minimum idempotent equivalent to this chosen one, the product, is simply U, then it's also true that the Gratony group is the Ellis group and the compressor is also true. And more generally, if this is equivalent to saying that the product Equivalent to saying that the product of any two minimal eigenpotents is itself eigenpotence. And there are some other conditions which are not equivalent, but are but imply them, namely that the map from the Ellis group, semi-group to the minimum ideal, which is multiplication of the right by an eigenpotent, is homomorphic, or an equivalent condition that for each eigenpotent any element, what we get in the, so if we have any other So if we have any other eigenpotent, so if u is a fixed item potentially here, and we have another idem potent here, so the last condition says that what we get if we multiply something on the right by one of these idempotents, does not matter which idempotent we choose. This is always the same for every F. Okay, so in particular, this always is true whenever the minimal The minimal ideal is either group or if it's unique, if it's the unique minimal ideal. So it follows that in any counterexample, we need to have a minimal ideal which is not a group, and also we need to have more than one minimal ideal. Okay? So I think this fair sayfo implies that any counterexample has to have at least eight elements. Okay, so not that I understand the Grotten Group group better, well, so since the Grotenti group is an epimorphic image of the Ellis group, so to understand it as a group at least, it's enough to understand the character of this natural homomorphism, which actually is underlying of the Prieb's theorem. So I should just say. So, I should just say that the kernel does not really depend on the ideal group. Namely, if we have two ideal groups, two LDS groups, UM and DN, then one can show that you can set the maps here, so there is an isomorphism here, which makes this diagram complete. So, this carrier does not really depend on the choice of the Alex group in a sense. So, the general problem is understanding this kernel for when S is some semi-group, maybe some naturally occurring semi-group we're interested in, such as those which we have in model theory. So, related to the theorem that I stated, we have a description of this kernel as a normal subgroup of the Alice group, sorry. So, just some some some So, just some philosophical remark that the kernel can be thought. So, I said before that the fact that the Ellis group is the Grotency group is equivalent to saying that the map which takes F in the Ellis semi-group to UFU is a homomorphism. So, we can think that the kernel somehow measures how badly this is not a homomorphism. Okay, so if the kernel is trivial, well, then this is actually homomorphic, and if it's large, we can think it's very much. If it's large, we can think it's very much what the whole move is. Okay? So, okay, so there's a lemma that I can actually prove. It's not so difficult to show. I mean, there's some computation involved, as you will see in a while. But one description of the kernel is just simply the normal subgroup of the LV's group, which is generated as a normal group by elements of this form. Okay, so basically, the point. Okay, so basically the point is that we want whenever we see something like this, u times f1 times u times f2 times u, we can erase the u. That's that's it. Thank you. See? Okay, and this is just straightforward computation. So if we consider, yeah, so what we want to show, first we want to show that this is actually contained in the kernel. So in other words, we want to take any element of this form. In other words, we want to take any element of this form and see that it goes to identity. And this is straightforward computation. So, because it's a homomorphism, well, we can just, so u goes to identity, well, F1 goes to whatever it goes to, and this one goes to the inverse of the image of this, because it's a homomorphism, it's a group homomorphism, reserves inversions. So, this is the same as a product of these three elements. Well, then we can see what's the image of this one. So, again, u goes to the U One. So again, u goes to identity. F1 goes to what it goes to, f2 goes to also what it goes to. And then we go get this. And then, well, this is this is simple. Very simple. So this implies that if this group N, this normal subgroup generated by these elements, is contained in the kernel. So we actually have an induced epimorphism from this quotient to the Graphene group. And in the other direction, if we consider the map from the LIS semi-group to this quotient, which is To this quotient, which is, well, the map that we had before only composed with dividing by n, then it's not hard to see that this is a semi-group homomorphism. So this is just straightforward computation again. So we take f1 and f2 look at their images. So I'm just expanding the definition. So because n is a normal subgroup, we just erase it because it's here. So now, because of the definition of n, Because of the definition of n, we can erase this u in the middle, and then this goes to the same place as psi of f1, f2. So this actually is a Hoseme-Guppomo motion. So because of universality of the Grotendy group, we have a map of the Grottendy group to the quotient, which makes the relevant diagram commute, and then it's not difficult to see that it's actually inverse to this map that we have here by well, by universality the quotient. Well, by universality, the course. Right. And so having this, by manipulating ident, we can get the following corollary. So firstly, the kernel is generated as a normal subgroup by elements of this specific form. So it's a bit simpler than before. So we have u times f times u multiplied by the inverse of u. multiplied by the inverse of u times f times u prime. So this inverse happens in the LS group. So just to u times f times u prime, so u prime is in minimal ideem put it in the minimum ideal. So this is in u times s times u prime, and this is the minimum ideal. So if you take any element for the minimum ideal, multiply the whole of the left. ideal multiply the whole of the left by the whole semi-group we actually get the minimum ideal so this is this is actually in the LIS group so it makes sense to take an inverse well then we can we can we can change change this a little bit based on some some some some some some general transformations so so we have a bit simpler form of the general elements of the kernel and we can simplify And we can simplify it even a little bit more just by considering elements of the form uf u prime, where f is sufficiently nice. So only for some x we take elements of this form, these are all elements of our group, and we take the normal subgroup generated by those, that this is the grotto kernel. Yeah, so I should just say that in all these descriptions, this is the description of the kernel as an. This is the description of the character as a normal subgroup. So, this is not, we don't have actual description as a subgroup. We don't know, well, there's no nice description of what it looks like as a subgroup. I mean, we can always close it under conjugation, but it's not an formula. Okay, so this is just about Okay, so this is just what was in the previous slide. So, as a corollary, we conclude that if you take two compact left topological semigroups and we have a sub-semigroup, which contains all minimal ideals, that the gross end-groups are the same. I mean, if it does not contain all the minimal ideals, then it's obviously false. It's not very difficult to see. But if we have all minimum ideals of the big one are already contained in the small one, well, then the One, well, then the groups are the same. So, in particular, if S has only finitely many minimal ideals, and we take the union of all elements of minimal ideals, well, this is a finite union of closed subsets, so it's a compact of topological semi-group, and the gravity group is the same. So, in general, so even if they're not finitely many, but this happens to be closed, well, then also the same conclusion is true. Is true. Well, actually, the conclusion is true, even if it's not close, but then it's not compact. Okay, so with Argemast, we actually are interested in not arbitrary semi-groups, we're interested in semi-groups that come from model theory. So, something that, yeah, I think it appeared in Ludomir's talk. So, if we consider any group definable in a model, we can consider the In the model, we can consider the semi-group of finitely satisfiable types in M consisting of, yeah. So this has a natural semi-group structure, and it actually is another semigroup of itself as a G-flow. And it's well known that in general, we have a subjective semi-group homomorphism, which goes from this semigroup to the quotient of G star by G star with three zeros. So G star with three zeros. zeros. So G star with three zeros is the smallest M invariant subgroup of G star of bounded such that the quotient is bounded. And G star is the interpretation of G in the Monster model. So by universality, so this is a semi-group homomorphism from this semi-group to a group. So we have a unique homomorphism from the growth and the group to this quotient. And in fact, we have a sequence of homomorphism. Because this is a factor of homomorphism from UM, sorry, from the Ellis group to this. And this allows us to actually get a sequence of homomorphisms that goes from the Ellis group to this potentially group and to this function of G star by G star with three zeros. And this leads us to new variants of Navaski's conjecture. So for those who don't know, some time ago, Ludomir conjectured that. Some time ago, Ludemir conjectured, I think, that if, for in this case, if you consider the map from Um to G star or G star 0, 0, maybe N I D, so then it doesn't depend on a set of parameters. Then she asks whether this map is an isomorphism. So counterexamples were found very quickly, I think. Conno, maybe? Yeah, I think Con Sana would be like. Uh yeah, I think I think on Sam and Pilate has already done that. Uh so this is not true. Uh and and then and then well in fact this factors through a quotient of this by a smaller number of components. So there are examples when each of these is not the nice of all, really. So in general, So, in general, this is not true, but still, it's interesting to ask when this is true. And so, this observation actually allows us to plug in another thing here. So, we have another object in this chain of groups. So, then again, we can ask whether. Again, we can ask whether this or this is an isomorphism. So we have examples where this is not an isomorphism. About this, what we don't know. But I think either the answer would be interesting. So if we knew that this is actually an isomorphism, then it would give us a new description of this object. And if we knew that this isn't, then this gives us a new object instead. Okay? So in particular, So, in particular, if we show that one of these two maps is not an isomorphism, well, then it follows that this map is not an isomorphism, and also this one. Conversely, whenever this map is an isomorphism, then one of these two, then both of these have to be an isomorphism. Okay. So, for example, if we have two minimal eigenportants in this semi-group, oh, there shouldn't be just the semi group. We need? That's just something not the question. On many more identons, such that the product is not idempotent, well, then this is not an isompotent. Because then this is not injective. Just a remark that this is somehow another theoretic object in terms of the line subsets. And this is defined purely in terms of the right structure of the In terms of the structure of the LSPEM. It's a bit different in nature. So that's why you say that even if we do show that this is always an isomorphism, this is somehow interesting information about this object as well. Okay. How much time do I have? Twenty minutes, yeah. Eighty. Okay. 18. Okay. Yeah, so yeah, so this is one of the two variants that Arthur mentioned. The other variant is when we consider actions of automophanes groups of models on type spaces. So this also gives us LE semi-groups. I mean, they don't have quite neat description, quite as neat description as in case of finitely satisfiable types, but they still exist by general theory that Putin. General theory that Tutumi was describing. And there were actually studies. So, in particular, if we consider the monster model of the theory, we may consider the Ellis group associated with the action of the automosis group of the monster model on the space of types of the model. So I can erase something. The context here is that So the context here is that we consider amongst the model C, a tuple C, this is a large tube long tuple which enumerates all of C. And then we have S C C, which is just the space of types. What we can say is the type of C prime over C where C prime Or, in other words, component types over the monster model extending the type of this tuple over here this. So, this is a compact habital space on which the automorphism group acts. So it makes sense to consider its LIS semigroup. And it was shown by Khrushchev, by Ludomir, and Pier Simo that the LIS group of this flow does not actually depend on the choice of the monster model. So it's a canonical object associated with the theory. I think even less is necessary, something like LED zeros saturated, homogeneous or something. Can I ask for an example of an example of like what's the Alice group of some if there's if there's like an easy example no sorry I guess stable examples in stable case group of automobiles with ACL yeah yeah so in stable case this is just this is just the the Yeah, so in particular, if you consider the algebraic composed fields, this is just a colour. Obsolete colours. Okay. And so as before, we have a semi-group homomorphism, which goes from the LD semi-group to the Galois group, which is, as I've mentioned before, so the Galois group, the theory is a quotient of the automorphism group. Of the automorphism group of a mass, the model by the group of strong automorphisms, of Lascar's strong automorphisms. So, in case of discrete pool for some logic, this is just a group generated by stabilizers of models. There you are, or in other words, it's a group of all automorphisms which preserve Lascar equivalents. And and this again, this does not depend on the choice of the monster model. And this does not depend on the choice of the monster model. And we have a semi-group homomorphism going from the LIS semi-group to the Galois group. And again, this is a group. So it follows that we actually factor through the Grottending group of this large semi-group. Okay, so again, we have a sequence of homomorphisms as before from the Ellis group, the Grottendig group, this large semi-group. Semi-group, the Gala group. And again, we can ask whether this or this is an isomorphism. That's one thing. But also being these two objects are canonical objects associated with the theory. This one, on the face of it, is defined in terms of a particular monster model. So ideally, we would like to maybe have that this is also something. Would like to maybe have that this is also something that does not depend on the monster model, but we don't know this yet. Okay, but definitely the size of this does not depend, it is bounded uniformly, independently of the monster model, because it cannot be bigger than this, simply. Uh i and as before, th this is coded by a s by a subgroup, for a normal subgroup of this group, about which we know even that it contains the kernel of of this map. The kernel of this map. So it's contained in the kernel of this map. It contains the kernel. So this implies that at least we can consider something, like consider all possible kernels of this homomorphism and take the intersections of this kernel system. This definitely gives us something that's not dependent on the monster model. But yeah, I think probably there's only one here, but we don't. Only one, yeah, but we don't know this actually. So, this seems like it also gives us a new object, or at least a new description of the gull. There are also different variants of the Grotendie group constructions. So, before I defined the Grotendie group as universal homomorphism from a semi-group into a group, but when the semi-group has a topology, then we can Group has a topology, then we can, we can, some other as a structure, we can consider some particular kinds of homomorphisms, for example, or continuous homomorphism. So, if S has a topology, we consider all homomorphisms to topological groups or some class of groups, for example, house of groups. So, for instance, let us write for the topological grotendic group, which is the universal homomorphism from S to. From S to Hausdorff topological group. So again, this is well defined by the same abstract constant case before. And then if you consider, if you go back to the definable group case, then the quotient of G star by G star with two zeros, not three, this is a Habs of topological group. And the homomorphism here is actually continuous. So again, we have a corresponding sequence of group happiness. Corresponding sequence of group map involvements going from the LS group to the topological Grotenti group, going to the portion of G star by G star 00. And it makes sense if or when the maps that appear here are actually isomorphism, isn't it? So here, for example, we've shown that if all types in this space are definable over m, so for example, g is definable in some non-minimal expansion, so if m is just some minimal expansion of the reason. If M is just a moment of expansion of the reals, what this function, this function function is, is an isomorphism. But even if we just consider the standard Grothendieck group, it still makes sense to consider what kind of topology is induced on the Grothendieck group from, well, the different things we could take to induce the topology. Okay? So if we consider just the case with. So, if we consider just the case whether the homomorphism is rejective, as in the case of LD semigroups. Well, then we have at least three a priori different potential quotient topologies. So first, we have this map from S to the Grotentic group of S. We can just take the quotient topology from S. But then we also have this map from UM to the Grotentic group. And the UM has, well, okay. So in case of LE semi-groups, it has. In case of LE semigroups, it has associated so-called tau topology, which is a compact T1 topology which is in general not Hausdorff, but which makes this separately continuous, multiplication separately continuous. So we can try to induce that topology by this map. And we can also just take the stats fixed topology. This is this is not so not completely well defined because the stats fixed topology may may depend on the choice of the m the Ellis group. So I said before that the Ellis groups are all isomorphic as abstract groups. Groups are all isomorphic as abstract groups, but they're not logically isomorphic. I'm not sure there are examples when they aren't, but I think there aren't. Yeah, so in each case, for each of these topologies, we can ask what are the properties of the topology of the grotto group that we get. For example, to what extent the multiplication is continuous, or inversion. And we can ask whether the topology is Hausdorff of T1. And this may be also interesting. So for example, if this ends up being how Ends up being Hausdorff and the multiplication separately continues, then this is actually the same as the topological process. Okay, so this is map here in the bottom right is always a nice map. Here in the bottom right is always an isomorphism? This one? Yeah. Yeah, I'm not sure. I would say it was more likely to be than not to be, but I don't know. Yeah, I don't think so. Any other questions? Maybe under some restrictions. Yeah, but some restrictions, then definitely. Of course. As I said, it makes sense to ask when it's a maximum. Maybe Thomas didn't mention that some kind of motivation behind all of this is that this Ellis group UM or its canonical Hausdorff quotients, they were used to present G by G with three zeros or Lascar-Garlois group as quotients of a compact Hausdorff group. And then it was used to borrow cardinalities, to approximate applications, to approximate subgroups, and so on, these kinds of things. So here the idea is. So here the idea is that the Grotentik group or some topological variant of this Grotenby group may be used maybe as an alternative object to do that and maybe much smaller one in some situations. So maybe for example with countable language situations it could be Polish or some variants of it. So it may be a better tool to present those modern theoretic objects as portions of the compact object. So this is at least my observation. Any other questions as well as so let's thank Domach against lunch and we resume at two. I've got watching the safety or something.
