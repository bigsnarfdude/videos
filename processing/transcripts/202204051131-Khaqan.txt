I was going to talk about what is moonshine. Awesome. Thank you. I want to take the moment to thank the organizers first for this really lovely workshop. This is my first time at Ban and it is so beautiful here. I'm trying already to figure out how to come back. So the title of my talk is What is Moonshine? As you can see, and the correct answer is that, like, no one really knows. Like, the correct answer is that we still. Like the correct answer is that we still don't know a lot about moonshine, especially about the conceptual origins of moonshine. So instead of giving you like a definition and examples, I'm going to tell you a story, if I can make this word. I'm going to tell you a story. So the first and main part of my talk is going to be talking about monsters moving China. I will tell you the story of monsters from China. Then I will give you one other example of Moon China. You one other example of Moon Chang. This will literally be a slide. I will give you a glimpse just to give you a second example. Because once you, if you are hearing the monstrous Moon Chang story for the first time, what usually happens, which I expect to happen, is that it looks just so wild. It looks like it must be a coincidence. How could this thing be true? But once you have a second example, then it feels less wild. And then you should think, oh, maybe we have a lot more examples, right? Maybe we have a lot more examples, right? As soon as you have, there are two examples. Why aren't there so many more? So that opens up this door to a list of other examples. My third section of my talk is also just going to be a list of things to Google, basically. And then eventually, if I get time, I will talk to you about what I have done with Moonshine in my work. Okay, so let's begin. As always is the case. If you want to ask questions, Is the case if you want to ask questions? People in the room, it's probably easier for you to ask questions. But people over Zoom, I'm not ignoring you, please ask questions. I might ask you questions, so pay attention. Okay, so Monstrous Moonshine is the original example of Moonshine, and the story begins at the classification of finite simple groups, which says that almost all finite simple groups fit neatly into three infinite families. You have the cyclic groups, the alternate Have the cyclic groups, the alternative groups, the final groups of flea type, and there are 26 groups that don't, there are 26 exceptions to this rule, which are, they're just very weird to us, and we want to understand them better. They're called the sporadic simple groups. And here's a picture I stole from Wikipedia of the sporadic simple groups. And the one that we're interested in in this part of this talk is the one at the top. This is the monster group. So in this picture, the lines are... So, in this picture, the lines are subgroup and subquotient structure. So, the monster group not only is the largest of these, it is connected to so many of these. And it is a really large group. It has order of 10 to the 53 elements. So, it was, you know, difficult to study when it was first discovered or conjectured to exist. So, when you have a problem like that, you should look at the representation theory of the object. Representation theory of the object you're studying. Because representation theory in like one sentence tries to reduce your problems in abstract algebra to problems in linear algebra, which is a lot easier. So maybe looking at representations of the monster is the correct mode here. So here's a picture of the character table of the monster group. It is not a complete picture by any measure. There are 194 columns and 194 rows. So I've just picked. 94 rows. So I've just picked the top corner, top left corner of this. So this is the first few columns in the first few rows. And I will come back to this picture. This is just here for you to see for a second. And I will come back to this picture. So the main character of the story of Monstrous Moonshine is the Monster Group, and there's another character, which is the J function, which is a Majora form. So if you remember what a Majora form is, I'm going to remind you. Is, I mean, I remind you, so remember that the group SL2Z, which is traceless 2x2 matrices, acts on the upper half plane, which is complex numbers whose imaginary part is positive, under this action. So if there's an element ABCD in SL2Z, it acts on tau to give you A tau plus B over C tau plus C. And if you get bored in this talk, you should check that if I do this action under SL2Z, this lands back in H. So you actually have something that still has a measuring. Have something that still has imaginary part positive. So here's an action result 2z on the upper half plane, and a modular function of level 1 is just a function that is invariant in this action. Actually, I think that this definition is not exactly right. There's also a growth condition. We want the modular function to not have essential singularities, basically. But basically, something that is invariant under this action is a modular function. And the j function is. And the j function is in some ways the nicest modular form. And don't hate me if you like a better modular form better. But basically, the elliptic modular invariant of the j function is the simplest non-constant modular function in the sense that every other modular function of level one is a rational function of j. So you can build the rest of them out of the j function. And being modular means that you can, so you have So you have a Q series, and okay, so I might use the board for a second. So notice that the element 1101 lives in SL2C because the determinant is 1, right? So what that means is that... Ah, sorry. There aren't. That's okay. So, anyway, the point is that if I take A to B 1, B to B 1, C. If I take a to be 1, b to be 1, c to be 0, and d to be 1, this action is tau goes to tau plus 1. So in particular, modular functions are periodic in tau. They're periodic by f of tau is the same as f of tau plus 1, right? So I can write, if I let q equal e to the 2 pi i tau, I can write a q series for j of tau. And like, if you're not convinced by that, just believe that there's a q series for modular functions. Believe that there is a Q series for Mazura functions and there is one for J of tau, and it's this one. And the reason I'm like focusing on the Q series is because now, you know, the two characters in our story meet. I have the character table of the monster group here, and I have the Q series of the J function here. And if you've never heard the story before, which I don't know if any of you have never heard this story before, I want you to take a minute to just like stare at these two objects and see if you. Two objects and see if you notice anything, if you notice any connections, anything, and please feel free to tell me what you notice. Some large numbers, are they similar? The coefficient of Q is the first thing in 1A. Yeah, very good. Okay, so this is what happened with John Mackay. This is what he noticed. He noticed that 1960 4. Is that 19684, the coefficient of Q, is not 19683, but it's so close, right? It is so close to 19683. And 19683 and 4 are like large enough numbers that if they're appearing in two different contexts, you should wonder if those two things are related, right? It's not like 8. 8 appears over there. I don't know. It's a large enough number that you should consider that maybe things are related. Okay, this maybe wasn't as convincing to mathematicians of that time. At that time. So John Thompson said: actually, it's not just this connection. It's not that 19684 is 19683 plus 1. It's actually that, look at the second coefficient. Okay, I'm mad at mental math, but I'm going to do this like mod 10 basically. If you add the first three numbers, you'll get 6 plus 3 plus 1, that is 0, and like do the mental math. You'll actually get this coefficient out of the first 3 in that column. Okay, that's. Okay, that's interesting. And now, if you were me, you would be like, oh, maybe the third one is just the first four added up together, right? Here's where it feels. Because let's do this mod 10 again. So I have 6 plus 6, which is 12, plus 3 is 15, plus 1 is 16. So I should have a 6 mod 10, but this is a 0 mod 10. Oh no. Again, now if you were me, I would give up at this point. I would be like, oh, that was a coincidence. Okay, let's go home. But not if you were John Thompson. If you were John Thompson. So he thinks that actually it's not that this number is exactly the sum of the first four, but it is a linear combination of the first four. In particular, if I take 1 times 1 plus 19683 times 1, no, 2, 1 times 2 plus 19683 times 2 plus the third number times 1 plus the fourth number times 1, I will get this equation. Okay, so now that's a lot of evidence that maybe the monster group talks to the z function. Maybe the monster group talks to the J function somehow, right? There's more. It gets weirder. I have just looked at the first column of the character table. There are 194 of these. I can look at any other column if I want. And if you do this for, let's say, the second column or the third column, so you start writing down another function. You say it is q to the minus 1 plus some number times q, and the sum number is the sum of the first four. Is the sum of the first two elements in this column, so 276 for 2B, plus the sum of the first three, so negative 2048 or something for 2B. And so on. You use the same formula that you got g of tau from for 2b, and you ask, is this a modular form? So it turns out it is. So the same way The same way that you got j function out of 1A, you can get another function out of 2B, which a priori is just a Q-series. The fact that this Q-series is a Q-series of a modular form is already a big thing. And then it is a very particular modular form. It is special kind of in the same way that the J function is. Okay, and I'll tell you what that means. So, John Thompson was much smarter than I am, and basically Smarter than I am, and basically at this point conjectured this. He said that the monster group, the monster assemble group, which in 1979 we did not have a construction for, the first construction was in 1981. So at this point, it is conjectural that it exists, right? He said that that is intimately related to the j function, and not only just to the j function, but in fact, a whole list of functions, 194 functions, which are all modern functions. Which are all modular forums of a very particular type. They are modular forums, but they're also normalized hot modules for gene zero subgroups of SL2R. That's a mouthful. I'll tell you what that is, but let me read out what this conjecture is. He says that actually there's a third object in this connection. There's a monster module. There's a vector space that the monster group acts on whose graded dimension is J of tau, and each of whose graded dimension And each of whose graded traces is a normalized hot module for unc or subgroup of SL2R. This conjecture is cool because now it's a theorem, it is now proven by Porchers in 1992, and it was building on work by Franklin Haskin Nerman and Conrad Norman and probably other people who are not Atkins, Smith and Fong, other people who can't fit on this site, but it is now a theorem, and this is what we call monsters to try. Moonshine apparently is a British slang for unity, like foolishness. So the first time when people heard, mathematicians heard of just this, like, there is a number 19683, and it's the same as 19684, maybe, they thought that it was just foolish. They thought that group theory theorists could just like, you know, come up with this really foolish thing, but it is cool that it is a theorem. And here is more cool stuff about this. So I'm not going to. Stuff about this. So I'm not going to define what a normalized hop module is just because 20-minute top technical definition, but here's something that is true about the normalized hop module, is that if I give you a genus zero group, which is, you know, why do I call it a genus zero subgroup? It's because the sort of surface associated to it is genus zero. If I give you a genus zero group, I can give you an isomer. I can give you an isomorphism, which is this function. And for gamma, there is a unique T gamma. You can normalize it for genus zero groups, if gamma is genus zero. And for gamma being SL2Z, T gamma is G of tau. So you basically, given all of these groups that are associated to the elements of the monster group, you can write down each of these normalized functions. Each of these normalized functions exactly. So you can get the traces of G on the monster module V natural in the last conjecture exactly just by knowing what groups are associated with TM. So we call this the genus zero property of monstrous moonshine, that each of the Mackay-Thompson series of monstrous moonshine is uniquely determined. Is uniquely determined by its behavior at the cusp. So if I tell you this behavior that it is at infinity is this, and it has no other poles on H hat, I know exactly what the entire series is. We call this the Gina Zero property of MoonChrine because it is, okay, one, it is the most mysterious part of MoonChrine, I think. Because when you hear Gina Zero, you expect there to be something. To be something geometric, right? You want something genus zero to appear. But we don't really still know why the genus zero, why do all these groups turn out to be genus zero? We don't know. There's no consensus on that. So it is kind of the most mysterious part of Monsters Moonshine. And in some sense, what makes this moonshine currently is this GNZ apology. Okay, so that's one big example of moonshine. Big example Mujai, that's most of what I'm going to talk about in Monsters Mujai. And I'm going to now pose the question of, like, is this a coincidence? Right? And I gave you a spoiler that there's actually more examples than the Monster Boo. But I want to like reiterate that it won't be that weird for you to think that this is a coincidence. A lot of people did for a long time. Why? Because the monster group, remember, is the largest of the sporadic simple groups. The largest of the sporadic simple groups. It's the largest of the things that don't fit into the things we understand. The normalized hot modules, I haven't given you a lot about them, but they are special in the world of modular forms. Just like picking a random modular form and expecting it to be a normalized hot module is kind of foolish, right? It's very rare that it turns out to be our normalized hot module. And I have told you nothing about the third object, but it is a word-in-the-algebra. And conjecturally, it is the unique thing that does blah blah blah in the Word and separate algebra theory. So it is also special in the world of VOAs. So you might think that this is just like a coincidence of a cosmos. You might think, oh, there's a special group, special function, special VOA. They just happen to all be like unique enough that they matched in the correct way. Okay, so at this point, you might think, okay, maybe this is a coincidence. Might think, okay, maybe this is a coincidence. So, in order to convince you that it is not, I have to give you a second example of Mochai. And here's my second example. It's going to be Conway Mochai, which was proven by John Duncan and Sandra McCrain in 2014. So, I've jumped way far ahead in time. Remember that Worcester's paper was 1992. And so, I'm not going chronologically, it's basically an I'm just gonna read this out to you. There existed in Just kind of read this out to you. There exists an infinite-dimensional conv0 module whose greater dimension is this function that I wrote down for, I wrote a j function and then I said you can get another modular form by using 2b. This is its graded dimension. And each of its Mackay-Thompson series is still a normalized hot module for as units of group of pussy bar. So this, I stated it so that it looks very similar to the monster protector. Similar to the monster protector. You should think that this is just another, because I haven't given you a definition for moonshine, I've given you a feel for what moonshine is. Here's something that looks very similar to the original Thompson conjecture. So I claim that this is another example of moonshine. Why am I claiming this? Well, the group that appears here is not simple, but it is very close to being this radical simple group, and I'll tell you that in a second. In particular, the function In particular, the functions that appear are exactly the functions that they are also normalized hop modules for a zeno-zero subgroup. And again, I haven't told you anything about the VOA, but the VOA is again, it's a theorem in the case of the super V supernatural, is that it is a unique thing and that satisfies all these properties in VOA theory. And the Conra group is Conra zero is not. Conv zero is not a sporadic symbol group, but actually, if you take convo zero and you mod out by its center, you get convo one. So it's like very close to being a sporadic symbol group as well. Okay, so hopefully, looking at that theorem, you might think, oh, that's a second example of Moon Chain. And at this point, you should be like, why aren't there infinitely many? Why aren't there way more than two examples, right? Okay, so I have jumped around in time, but historically, what happened? In time, but historically, what happened is that Forsters proved Monster's Moonshine in 1992. People were working on Moonshine, there was like generalized moonshine, so subgroups of the monster, sub-quotients of the monster, so on. But really, I think the interest was that, okay, there's maybe we can take monstrous moonshine and apply it to like other groups and subgroups and so on. In 2010 is when we got all of this like moonshine. We got all of this like moonshine that is not necessarily related to the monster, moonshine of other flavors. And I'm going to give you one example of this. So, 2011, actually, there was these three mathematicians, Igushi Guru and Tanchikama, who observed that the elliptic genus of a K3 surface. So these people cared about physics, right? And elliptic genus of a K3 surface is a thing that physicists fear about. It is this function. For us, it is a Jacobian. It is this function, for us it is a Jacobi forum of a certain weighting level and so on. It's this function that's really complicated looking, but they thought that it looked like it was related to the largest Matthew group, M24, which is again a sparrow exempt group, in a way that felt like moonshine to them. Again, we're just going on vibes here. We don't have a definition. So we kind of are like, oh, maybe this is moonshine? I don't know. So I'm going to give you, depending on how much time I have, just to. Just to give you a flavor of why they thought that this was giant. So the red part of this is actually a Mach modular form, H of tau, and it has this Q series. And here's the character table of the Matthew group. And H of tau is this Q series. And yeah, I'm so sorry that I'm going to go over time, but I want people to look at this and give me like. Like, look at this and give me ideas. Why do these feel related? Do these feel related? And go on. Oh, man. 39 plus 231 is 462. Yes, very good. Okay, so 45 plus 45 is 90. 231 plus 231 is 462. 462. 1540 is like 77 something. 770. Very good. 4554 also will appear. It will be 227. 2277. That's this one. Okay, it only appears once, but okay. 11592, please divide on your own, will also appear in here. Okay, so two-series character table relationship, maybe this is moonshine. So here is the theorem. Here is the theorem that was written by Gannon in 2012, which says that there exists an infinite-dimensional created M24 module, such that for each of these g and M24, the Mackay-Thompson series is a Mach modular form for some subgroup of SL2R, and H of E of tau is actually the one that we just saw. Okay, again, I've written this to look a lot like the previous two conjecture and theorems that I wrote down. There are a few. Tell, there are a few caveats here. One, these are Machmajur forms. These are Machmajur forms. Okay, so the first caveat is that the proof of this isn't constructed. So the first two that I told you, Monster Moonshine and Conway Moonshine, we actually physically have a V natural and a V supernatural, which have vertex operator algebra structure, super vertex operator algebra structure, so on. Here, this is just like there exists. Here, this is just like a there exists one. This is an existence theorem. There isn't a proof yet. But this is like a smaller caveat. You might think maybe we can write one. We just haven't gotten there yet. The bigger caveat is that the gamma G's that appear are not all genus zero. And even if they were, there is no natural sense in which a mock modular form could be a hot module for a genus zero template. So if your entire faith in Moonshine is based on the genus zero property, this should shake This should shake your belief a little. You should think, maybe this is going to try and maybe it isn't. And I want to say that there are other results that exist for the 23 onro groups, which are all kind of of this flavor, where we don't have things that could naturally be hot modules for genus 0 subgroups. So in particular, we have to kind of look at an analog of the genus 0 property. Instead of saying the groups that appear are all genus 0. That appears are all genus zero, you know, you could discard vacuum moonshine. You could just be like, oh, that's not moonshine at all. I'm just going to be like very purist. Or you could find something that is slightly more general and you can look at this version of the genus zero property, which is that each of these Makaya Thompson series is uniquely determined now amongst Mach Major Forums by its behavior at the cusps. And that, I think, is like a really incredible thing that it works out also for Mark Mazura forums. It works out also for Bopmonster forms. Okay, I am very over time, but here's some things to Google basically. If you want to know more about examples of moonshine, look at Matthew Moonshine, Amril Moonshine, Thomas Moonshine, and Maria Moonshine. And I can finish or I can talk. I can just give you the theorem. I think here's the theorem. So it's similar, right? It's you take the Thomson groove, which is another sort of Which is another sporadic simple group. So, previous picture. Here's, so this was Monster, this is Conway. Where's Thompson? Here's Thalpson. It is another sporadic simple group. You take F of tau, which is this time of weakly holomorphic modular form. So it is modular, but it's now of weight 3/2. So for monster and convey and all of that, you have weight 0 things. And the theorem is that there exists an infinite. And the theorem is that there exists an infinite-dimensional Thompson module whose graded dimension is 6f of tau, and each of whose Mackay-Conson series satisfies this analogous version of the genus zero property. It is uniquely determined by its behavior in the class. Okay, I'm going to stop here. Thank you so much. Okay, any questions? Very complicated topics and very clear talks. I love it. Any questions? Oh, yes. Yes. Is all this behavior restricted to the sporadic groups? No. Great question. So the let's see, other Mochai. So I said for the Matthew group, I said after that with similar results. Similar results exist for the 23 umbrella groups, not necessarily sporadic. I think, like, maybe don't quote me on this, but literally one of them is like C2 or something. So, not necessarily all sporadic. And it is a good question and something that I think people who do moonshine want to know. At least I would be really happy to know, one, something like what groups appear in moonshine, and what groups uh exhibit this phenomenon. Exhibit this phenomenon. Or even simpler, if I give you a group, what functions could appear on the number theory side? If I give you a function, is it a trace, is it a greater dimension of moonshine for some group? And, you know, like what is the essence of this theory would be fun to know, but we don't. Questions? Any from online? Yeah, people resume. Sorry for ignoring you so much. I'm sorry for ignoring you so much. Oh, it's okay. I'm watching. Okay. Hope there are no more questions. Listen, Marty again. So, this is for the Tuesday talks, everybody. And now it's time for lunch. Oh my goodness. Okay. Let's stop the recording. Oh, that's going to be nice.
