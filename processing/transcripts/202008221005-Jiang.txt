X1 is a polynomial. Okay, so you define this jargon function. It is only defined for x and y in a unit circle. But since it's a polynomial, so in fact, you could define it on the whole C2. And if you write this, if you multiply this out, it becomes a bi-quadratic polynomial, which means if you act as a partner. If you view x as a parameter, then it's a coordratic in y. If you view y as a parameter, then this is a coordratic in x. And this is an important observation. We define some useful numerics. The partial discriminant is what you get when you view x as a parameter and y as a parameter, then you get the usual discriminant for quadratics. For quadratics, B minus 4AC. And we also define Eisenstein invariants for generic quadratic functions. This is a, we write this in this form, but 4B, 6C, 4D, they are for convenient reasons. And this D and F related to these quadratic functions, they are called Eisenstein invariants because they are related to actions and series. Series and Eisenstein series. If you go along the y, the imaginary axis and Eisenstein invariance will approach Riemann zeta function. So let's get back to our kernel qxy. This is a polynomial in C2. So it cuts one dimension. One dimension, it's a curve in say two, it's a complex curve. And if you look at its real part, if you look at its real part, it's a closed curve. And we define two, no, not we, some others, define two maps, the vertical switch and the horizontal switch. If you see it in the real, in the real plan, then the vertical switch is keeping x constant and Keeping x constant, and you draw a vertical line, and that line will intersect the curve q in two real points. And the vertical switch is simply the map from the first intersection to the second intersection. And horizontal switch is similar. You draw a horizontal line and it intersects the curve in real plan by two points, and you switch those two intersections. Switch those two intersections. And their composition is a well-known map in discrete community, in discrete dynamic system community called QRD map, named after three person, three people. This is a delta. We know these switches, they are switches, so they have order too. They are involutions. If you do it twice, it means you. It means you do nothing, but their composition, however, is much more interesting. So, a Russian mathematician Malyshev introduced a group generated by these two evolutions, and he calls it a Galois group. And the reason he named it a Galois is because he defined this not as us, we define. us we define very explicitly as the switches on the curves but he defined as the transformation on the function field which are completely equivalent because q as a complex curve its function field can also be viewed as a complex curve by some algebra method called evaluation so we focus on the subgroup h0 generated by the q H0 generated by the QRT map. And this subgroup can be finite order and can have infinite order. And why it's always important, because the solution of our kernel equation can be found. If h0 has infinite order, then this spi x Pi x will never have a simple expression. You cannot solve it. You cannot have a formula for it. Maybe you can have an integral representation for it. But in a paper, it is proved that if that h0 is infinite order, that pi xy cannot even be represented as a solution of any differential equations. And uh And our interest here is to study the financial structure of H0. The strategy for this study is to do coordinate exchange, coordinate transformation. We suppose those PIGs are rational numbers. For some reasons, first reason is that we are going to apply the theorem from number theory. The theorem from number theory, and that theorem applies only to rationals. And for a second reason, rationals are what you can actually get in real life, in computer, in combinatorial setting. We need two quadrant transformations. First, we map this Q map this q defined by that backward polynomial to a c quotient lattice and then we map this c quotient lattice to an elliptic curve and to use that theorem in number three columnarzu theorem we need to make sure this e c is an elated curve over rationals it is not It is not at all clear that this EC can be defined rationally because both j and j prime minus one they are defined analogically. So even you start with a rational q with rational coefficients p i j, it is not obvious at all that this e will also have rational coefficients. And moreover, to define a unique curve to To define an ellipse curve to be rational, you have to have a rational point on it, otherwise, it is empty. So, this strategy we need to prove that E C have rational coefficients. So, let's look at this Q, this Q, that by quadratic, and some phase invariance. This is kind of like a Hamiltonian of a dynamical system. If it's a Hamiltonian, system. If it's a Hamiltonian, so we can define Hamiltonian vector field. This is Hamiltonian vector field. And we found it is not vanishing anywhere by direct computation. And if you have a vector field, then you can have a differential from it. And this is a pairing between differential and vector fields. It lack of pairing between any due. lack of pairing between any dual space and vector space and the lattice namda the lattice here is generated by this integral the integral of two bases and the integrand is a differential determined by the Hamiltonian vector field this map has a name called Abel-Jakob map Abel-Jakob map. It maps Q to the. So if you view Q as an algebraic curve, then this guy is called Jacobi or Jacobin Taurus. But since we have only an algebraic record of genus 1, which is Taurus, and for Taurus, Jacobin is also a Taurus. So left-hand side is a Taurus, right-hand side. Side is the torus, right-hand side is the torus, they are isomorphic, not only topologically, but also complex analytically. And this map is actually well defined, but it depends on the choice of your point P0 and this gamma i, and those two bases for the homologic group, and if you view them as curves, they start. them as curves they start at p0 but the dependence on the p0 can be eliminated by a transformation action on your lattice and so you can fix omega one you can fix one of them by choose a p0 and the the integral can be made so for example you can fix omega one two one You can fix omega 1 to 1. You can do that. And you only left omega 2 as a free parameter. And the second map also has a name called uniformization. This is like a projection from the universal covering of this curve to this curve. And this is accomplished by Verstlaus function. By a Versailles function. Versile function is defined analytically, and its derivatives is also defined analytically. It's a basic training analysis to see, okay, this series converges uniformly, absolutely, in any compact set, not touching the lattice. So you can exchange the summation. Exchange the summation and differentiation, and you get formulas for its derivative. We also define two modular invariants, G2 and G3. And if you are familiar with the theory called automorphic forms, then you immediately recognize these two Eisenstein coefficients in the Eisenstein series. So both the Abel-Jacob and the uniformization map are analytical. However, their composition can be given in a polynomial. And that's a very astonishing fact. So the modular invariance is defined as a summation, a transcendental summation, and it a priori depends on the named. Priori depends on the lambda, but this can be shown just equal to Eichenstein invariant for the partial discriminance of the bioquadratic curve. And that is a miracle, but there isn't any miracle in maths, actually. This is called modular invariance, and it is related to Eichenstein's series. And this D is defined, is called Eisenstein's series. Defined is called Eichenstein invariance, and since they are all named after Eichenstein, so they should equal, and in fact, they are equal. So, what's the conclusion here? So, if Q is a rational bicoordial polynomial, then E also has coefficients over Q. So, we finish half of our stuff. The second ingredient is to look at how that QRT. Look at how that QRT map transforms under our change of coordinate. First of all, under the Abe-Jacob map, the QRT map transforms into a map on this quotient, on this C-quotient lattice as just an addition modular lattice. modular that that is so it's like uh in number theory if you're working in modular p then you have your have a addition structure in that module p group and same as here this is a lattice a two-dimension stuff but the idea is the same and moreover this uniformization map transform this addition also This addition also into an addition, and this addition we write as delta two stars. This is an addition on the EDTB curve. And the UDB curve is an abelian variety, so it has an abelian group structure on it. And if you write that abstract UDB curve in a coordinate, in your coordinate, in a coordinate, and in a very special coordinate called Verstlass normal form. Called Verslas normal form, then that addition can have a very nice geometric picture, which is a quad tangent construction. Because this is a cubic curve, a line will intersect in three roots if you count roots properly. And so it because it intersects in three roots, so you have two, and you naturally define the addition of them as a third one. But in fact, you need to also further do a To do a reflection with regard to the x-axis. So you have an addition on the UDPD curve as well. And that's very interesting. So the QRI map induces an addition on the UDPD curve. And we are really interested in this omega 3. Is that a rational point on the UDP curve or not? And the answer turns out yes. And here is a formula for the is a formula for the coordinate of omega 3 and i found this formula in reference one which is a great book on discrete dynamical system but i did a little bit research on this omega 3 i want to know who was the first one to discover this formula and the first results show that the german fubinus Studied it in his study on bioquadratic curves. But then I found it's just a folklore, it may not be true. Maybe Isaac Newton had known this thing in his study of the classification of ideas curves over rationals. So these things somehow was known by Newton. That is really astonishing to me because normally people only know Newton for... Normally, people only know Newton for his physics. Maybe some people know some numerical stuff of Newton, but he also studied the classification of curves over R. Now, this is clearly a polynomial. So, if all those P's are rational, then we have a rational point. So that subgroup H0 is isomorphic to the group generated by omega 3. And since omega 3 is a rational point, it is a subgroup of the E over Q. And a very celebrated theorem of Masur says for an elliptic over Q, its torsion part can. Its torsion part can only have two possibilities, and one is this, the other one is this. And from this, you may know: okay, H0 can at most have order 12. And if you multiply the involution part, we know H at most can have order at most 24. If it has finite order at all, obviously it can have infinite order. It can have infinite order. And there's kind of a dichotomy here. And remember that Q, that curve Q, you define that vertical switch and horizontal switch, and if you iterate their composition, you get a dynamical system. And if that delta QRT map has a periodic, then it will visit a finite number of points forever. Number of points forever and it just follows its trajectory, it comes over and again. But if it has infinite order, then you may ask, okay, so now it will visit infinitely many points. Is that trajectory dense in the Q? Because of course you can visit the subset of Q. There is a possibility, but the theorem A possibility, but the theorem of Well shows that's not the case. So you have a dichotomy, either you are periodic or you visit this trajectory, which means you are erodic. And so the proof is finished, but this work also has some other implications. For example, can we have an explicit criteria for H to have final order For H2 have final order, and these criteria for order 4 and 6 have been included, have been found decades ago. But their method was to use some algebraic method, especially they want to show, okay, certain functions become linearly dependent in some function field. And their computation is rather long. Rather long, but since now we view them as an additionally dipped curve, so we get results instantly. Because, for example, if the omega 3 is order 2, so H has order 4, and if the UDB curve is in the VS telephone, we know it can only be on the x-axis. So that means its y-coordinate is 0, which means that that p is. Which means that that p is zero. And point only you can have order three if it if it's halting vanishes. So we by direct computation, we get this. And if you compare, no, I didn't include the compare. There, the existing criteria for order six is rather complicated. It's a big determinant with With some cofactors as its content. And we can also get criteria for general, not only for four and six, we can work for arbitrary m. And for that, we need division polynomials. And you can find those division polynomials from any textbook on elliptic curves. And they are called division polynomials. And they are called division polynomials because if you have m divides n, then you have phi m divides phi n in this polynomial ring. And xy, as a point only to be curve, has order dividing, not exactly n, but only a factor of n, even only if it vanishes this polynomial. But for our case, we'd like to work with. Our case, we'd like to work with the Eisenstein invariants, those modular invariants. So, we need to do a quarter transform. Those formulas, I believe they have been known for at least decades, if not decades, maybe centuries, but it's very hard to find. You can easily find this, but after a simple change of coordinates, you also have this. So, the criteria for the Criteria for the group having certain order is by requiring this x, y vanishes those polynomials. And using those division polynomials, we can give the criteria for h to have order 8. And this is a simple polynomial. x and y are coordinates for omega 3, and d are Aschenstein invariants. They are all determined by the coefficient. All determined by the coefficients of the transition matrix Pij. And let's compare our solution to the criteria, the existing criteria. The existing criteria is a vanish over this determinant. And this determinant, each element has a form of a big polynomial. And those each Polynomial and those each delta are some cofactors of the matrix P. So if you really want to write this out, it will occupy your whole screen. So that's all. And the first reference is a valuable reference on discrete integral system. And after the author finished the book script, he passed away, which is quite a loss. And the second reference, Fau Yue. And the second reference, Favoure in Nagorodosky, and also another Russian Malyshev, they were the pioneer in this kind of work to find the group structure and algebra solutions in random works and they applied in queuing systems. Thank you very much, Richard. Pardon? Any questions? Okay, I have one question, one comment for you. Yeah. You see, when the group, so you show the group size, when the group size is six and eight, one only for conditions. Yes. And the use setting is for the random work with a rational transition problem. Transition probabilities. Yes. And the same result, of course, equivalent result, and different methods got equivalent result. And by Fayell, it's Manish in the famous Yellowbook, right? Yeah. Interesting to see, their result does not have this rational. Transition probability restriction, right? Yeah. But the result is actually the same, right? Yes. Yeah. And it's interesting. So in more general case, is that possible still true the conditions for the orders of the Gao group for the rational model could be the same as for Same as for the channel. Yeah, it is definitely true because to use restless polynomial, I don't have to require my coefficient to be Q. But to get the bound here, I need to work in Q. For the rest of us division polynomials, for reals, it also works fine. Okay. Okay. And one comment. And one comment, excuse me, I also feel that it's unbelievable even back to Newton time, this fact was actually learned. But another kind of feels strange because Newton actually learned as a mathematician first. But probably most people. But probably most people knew Newton as a physicist. Yeah, I knew Newton was a great mathematician, and I was also very shocked to learn. I don't know if it's true because it's a historical scholar to decide if it's true or not. These formulas was known by Newton. Of course, not in this form, but Newton studied the effect of this omega-3. Very nice talk. Very nice talk. Any other questions or comments? Yeah, I have a question. Yep, go ahead, Bob. So, Rashaw, it's perhaps naive, but early on you mentioned the boundary conditions and that you wouldn't be going into those. Yes. Is that you don't need to or you didn't have time? Have you looked at them? The boundary conditions describe how the random overview reaches the boundaries. It reflects or is absorbed or. Or absorb, or maybe other conditions, but this is they are very important because the whole equation depends on them. But for the for this queue, the kernel, this is kind of independent of those parts. So they are very important because without them so without boundary condition, you are not in fact restricted in the quarter plan. Restricted in the quarter plan. You can go anywhere. So, have you looked at them? Yeah. They have similar expressions for this queue, but with those PIJ replaced by the prescription of the transition probability at boundaries. So, are you a logistic question? Are you going to share your presentation so that Burrs can? Presentation so that Burrs can post it. Okay, yeah, someone didn't ask me. Yes, sure.
