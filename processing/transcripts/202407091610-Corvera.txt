So if you want to know when do vascular networks with intrinsic redundancy outperform those without? So I am going to talk about redundancy that we are born with, like not as a product of adaptation. So first of all, yeah, so it's revealing this the rebellion of the object. Okay. So two of my three collaborators. So, two of my collaborators in this work are also in this room. So, she's Almetorz. She's currently at Villanova University, but she did this as part of her PhD work with me. Rui Travasso from Condra Portugal is also here. And also, Ignacio Pabu Navarraga from Barcelona is our collaborator in his work. Not the question of waiting. Not the question of waiting, you know, sometimes it does. Okay, intrinsic redundancy provides alternative ways for a process to occur, but it is energetically very expensive. You need to create more vessels and that costs energy. However, it is present in many natural systems, so this suggests that the benefits outweigh the cost. So here I just found this pretty, and with looks, it's high resolution. And with looks, it's high-resolution micro-angiography of a mouse ear, for example. So, intrinsic redundancy in fluid networks occurs in many natural systems, for example, the helium of trees that transport the sap, the lymphatic vessel networks of mammals that transport the lymph. And for mammals, the degree of intrinsic redundancy is particularly relevant in vascular diseases. So, I'll just give you Diseases. So, I'll just give you two examples for this introduction. One is that what the authors call natural bypasses in the coronary arteries that irrigate the heart can save lives. In patients that are lucky enough to have them, what does that mean? It's that there are anatomical variations of the coronary arteries, and some people are actually have the coronaries without collateral vessels, and others. Vessels and others have vessels that are forming loops that connect to another branch. And then, if there is an occlusion of the coronary artery, this patient will get an infarct and this one will not get an infarct. And these bypasses will save the life of this second patient. So, another important part is the redundancy in the Redundancy in the blood cerebrovascular arterial system. So the circle of Willis, which is shown here with high-tech imaginology, and the picture is here, right? It's like at the base of the brain, and it's a circular system that ensures adequate blood flow if one part of the system becomes occluded. Part of the system becomes occluded or narrow. It has alternative paths. There are also anatomical variations that some people do not have it the whole. You don't know if you have it complete or not. That's a mystery until you get blockage, right? And sorry. I will first give you as a a reminder also. A reminder also, something that is called generalized Darcy's law. Darcy's law has been mentioned already three times in this meeting. So, for a steady state, if I have a tube, a porous media, a heli-show cell, and I have a pressure gradient, flow is proportional to pressure gradient. And this proportionality constant is inverse of viscosity, the area of the cross-sectional. The area of the cross-sectional area, and K is the permeability that depends only on the confining geometry. However, when the fluid is flowing in a pulsata wheel, then the flow is again linearly related to pressure gradient, but in Fourier domain. And this is what we call a generalized Darcy's law, and this is what we call a dynamic permeability. Dynamic permeability depends on confining geometry, flow parameters, and frequency. And it is somehow a measurement of the resistance to flow. So I'll give you examples to tell you how can you interpret this. So basically when you have, since this is in frequency domain and we do put pressure in time domain, so we will have to go through this series of steps. Steps. Oh my god. So, you first have to transform the pressure gradient in time to a frequency domain. Then, you use your generalized Darcy's law to get the flow in frequency domain, and then you inverse for your transfer. But, for example, if you put For example, if you put a one mole cosine, then you get this answer for flow in time domain. And the relevant thing here is that flow, the flow amplitude, is determined by the modulus of the dynamic permeability. So if I see when the dynamic permeability is high or low, I can have an idea of how much the flow will fluctuate, right? So, for instance, for a viscous fluid, For instance, for a viscous fluid in a tube, there is a monotonic decay with frequency of this permeability. And then, if you test putting a pressure gradient at two different frequencies, the one that has a higher permeability will have a larger amplitude for the flow. When you do this for viscoelastic fluids, fluids that have not only viscoelastic fluid Fluids that have not only viscosity but elasticity to them, then this has a non-monothermic behavior. But again, the highest permeability will give you the largest flow amplitude in time domain. So in that sense, a larger models of the dynamic permeability is similar to having a lower viscosity. Okay, this is like just for a single tube. Now, when it comes to networks, It comes to networks, there is an equivalent of the dynamic permeability that is called the network response function. And we are able to write for simple networks, for symmetric networks, a linear relationship again in Fourier domain, between frequency and pressure gradient across the network. And then this response depends on all the vessels of the network. The vessels of the network, right? On the fluid parameters and on frequency. And we can say the same: the larger the magnitude of the modulus of this response function given a pressure gradient, the larger the flow that irrigates the tissue. As an example, for a bifurcating three-light network, this is the shape of this response. This response, you can only always take an electrical analogy and add like resistances in series parallel or use curve loss if you have loops. So you again have to do this path. You impose a time-dependent pressure gradient, you go to Fourier domain, you use your generalized Darcy's law, and here Generalize Darcy's law, and here it's all the information of your network, your fluid confined in the network. You then obtain flow in Fourier domain and the inverse Fourier transform to get flow in time domain and you get the similar expression that we had before for a tube, but now it's for a network. So for a one-mole pressure gradient, this flow amplitude is proportional by the Is proportional to the modulus of this network response function. So before I start with the talk subject, I will just give you two examples. If I take just a tree-like network and I block partially at some bifurcation level half of the vessels, and I Vessels and I partially block them, not totally block them. Then I can see that this response is going to decrease flow always. So here it's normalized by the unobstructed network. So the unobstructed network has a one response in this graphic. So if you obstruct by 30%, 60%, of 90%, or 90%, this will 90%, this will largely decrease flow. For instance, I show you here like flow in time domain also for one mode pressure drop. Each time I go to time domain, I'm putting just one cosine in time mode. So you can see that the unobstructed network, which are the black dots, basically Basically, it's if I put the at level N8, I mean the bifurcation level number 8. So I put the obstruction here. Basically, it is same as the unobstructed network, but if I obstruct vessels very early here, then the flow of the network seriously diminishes. So, obstructions. So, obstructions at the external level cause a much larger reduction in flow compared to obstructions at internal levels, even if I'm all the time blocking half of these levels. So we can, I just put this as an example, we can get analytical expressions in certain limits that take into account the network structure, in this case a bifurcating network, the geometrical place in which the obstruction occurs, the degree of obstruction. The degree of obstruction. I mean, we would like to work with these things. You can also do these things numerically. And in the other hand, if I put bypasses, if I put the bypass, then I will get basically the opposite effect of obstruction. So flow will increase. So here it is, number one will be my network without bypasses. Bypasses, okay. And if I add bypasses, this S1, S2, S3 means how many levels am I jumping with the bypass. So if it's like a big jump, like takes you from very external levels to very internal levels, this will increase much more the flow. So a redundancy in external levels causes a much larger flow. Causes a much larger flow than a redundancy in internal levels, and the more levels skipped by the bypasses, the larger the flow increment. But now I go back, well, I will go to the topic of my talk. If I can. Okay. So it is intuitive then that intrinsic intrinsic redundancy make robust networks, right? But Make robust networks, right? But one can envision other topologies that have identical resistances to flow. For instance, like wider vessels, right? So our question is, why and when is it better to have redundancy, right? And can we have a quantitative index to determine when redundancy outperforms a network with wider vessels? So for that, So, for that, we are going to create two networks. I'll tell you the rules. So, first, I will have a non-redundant tree-like network shown in red. By addition of bypasses in green, redundancy is introduced. And bypasses will have the same dimension of this circumvented level. Obstructions in half of the conduits are at certain bifurcation levels. At certain bifurcation levels, are represented by crosses. We do not necessarily put the crosses and the bypasses in the same level, but this is when redundancy works better. And this choice of obstructing the network has been chosen in order to highlight the topological place n in which obstructions occur, and also because then we can solve things analytically. So, our model for the three networks is like we will compare two networks, one redundant, and redundant I mean it has this bypasses that gives me loops and alternative flowing paths, and one non-redundant with thicker vessels. Okay, so we call these two equivalent networks for them flow at the given pressure. For them, flow at the given pressure drop has exactly the same energetic cost per unit time. So that means I am choosing a frequency and an amplitude of the pressure. So I'm choosing a frequency and then I adjust the vessels to make them thinner and thinner until the responses are the same for two networks. So and then we will study two types of networks. The two types of networks. One that is equal vessel networks, because it's very common in microfluidics. Up to my knowledge, half an hour ago, some Meris networks were good for particular types of the mammalian vascular networks. So, this is like a general thing. So, we did this for networks of equal vessels and mergers. Of equal vessels and marine networks. Since these ones are mostly using microfluidics, we decided to use a constant pressure gradient here. For these ones, we put the dog's heart rate. So it is to see how sensitive these things are to frequency and to network modeling, geometry. So basically, I think I, yeah. So here we have at the left At the left, Mary and at the right, equal convicts network. So, here the equivalent unobstructed networks is shown in one. And we are plotting this response as a function of the level in which this redundancy and obstruction occur. So, you can see here that if we obstruct at a certain bifurcation level by 70%, By 70%, a non-redundant network, I have a very high decrease in this response that corresponds to like over 40% inflow. I'll show you later. But if we have a redundant network with 70% obstructions, we basically, it's like we don't have obstruction, right? Like the response is pretty much as the unobstructed. As the unobstructed network, except for when it's occluded and the bypasses are in very inner levels. We can see that there is, of course, dependence on if it's Mary or it's equal convux, but the numbers are very similar. It's just that here the decreases in the inner levels and in equal convux is at the early levels, and also here the decrease in the equal convex levels. In the calconics levels, when you obstruct the decrease in flow, it is much larger if you put this outside, and here it's much larger in very slow if you put it inside the net. So details vary time. So this again, if you are not used to seeing this, you can see it in flow versus time. So I just chose 25 and a pressure of 8.5 K. Of 8.5 kilopascals, and I mean, you have to choose a pressure drop and 1.5 Hertz, and then you can see that basically flow in the unobstructed network and in the redundant network with 75% obstruction is basically the same. So the important quantity it will be introduced here. Be introduced here. So, here I have the response of the non-redundant network as a function of the percentage of obstructed area at a given bifurcation level. So, let's say I will obstruct my network at level 3 or 4. I choose. Okay? So, I start with the two unobstructed networks are equivalent, right? Networks are equivalent, right? The redundant and the non-redundant have this response as in the unobstructed network. 19 minutes. I put my chronometer. It's okay. Sorry. So here I have the response of the redundant network when it's occluded at 100% in behalf of the levels. Okay, so this will be another curve that. Will be another curve that just smoothly goes from here to here, and I put this reference. So I am going to say that this, I propose this F EC, which is a criterion to measure the robustness of a network with intrinsic redundancy, because it gives me a relative measure of the network tolerance against oblusions. So when the percentage of obstructed area Percentage of obstructed area is above this FF, having redundancy is more convenient in terms of flow than having wider vessels. Surprisingly, if I have little blockage, then having wider vessels is preferable. So the lower this measure of resilience or robustness of the network, the larger the advantage redundancy gives. advantage redundancy gives. So this has been chosen in a worst case scenario in which I am comparing with total obstructions in redundant networks, but if I put of course less obstruction it's even better. So this depends on this measurement depends on the structure, underlying structure of the network. So for a network For a network of equal conduits, this is basically independent of where this happens. And for a network in which there is a dependence on the area in each bifurcating level, it's more complex and you have to interpret this with care. And finally, I just want to finish with the idea that redundancy is also a shield against larger gradients that normally. Gradients that normally causes many dysfunctional vascular behavior. When you have an unobstructed, non-redundant network and a redundant network with obstruction, this apparently doesn't help because it's creating gradients of shear. But in the presence of obstructions, if you have an unobstructed network, this will create huge Huge, this is compared to the non-redundant, this creates huge shear gradients that are very damaging for the vasculature. So having this apparent disadvantage in the absence of obstructions gives a large benefit and shields the network against large shear gradients in the presence of obstructions. Thank you very much. Obstructions. Thank you very much. Can you tell us a little bit more how you got the Kai? So you have, when you were sewing, when you went to the Fungia space, and you said in, you know, Fourier space is exactly like a regular space. So what what is sky in your case? What is the In your case, what is the generalized diaspora law? Well, depends for, I only show it to you for unobstructed networks. You know, since for each vessel, you still have this target flow for each vessel. So you can basically treat your networks of like resistances. Like resistances, right? Like you add in series or in parallel, depending on how they work. So I have for unobstructed networks without bypasses, this is the expression for the CAG. If I put bypasses, it's a bit more complicated because in each loop, I have to ask for the loss in which it nodes very. Loss in which it knows there is a conservation of flow or intensity of current, if you want to see the electrical analogy. And of course, if you see the pressure drop along a loop, it has to come to zero, right? Where is the omega dependence? That's what I don't say immediately. In this one. In this one. Okay, I will show you one example. Yeah, yeah, okay. Because you also need to. Fine, fine, fine, fine. Sorry, I have not understood because. Sorry, I have not understood you, but I have this preference. So they are frequency-dependent. For example, if I do a Hildichaud cell, I have this time term. If I go to frequency domain, this becomes an algebraic equation of frequency. So here I have a differential equation in space and time. And here I only have a differential equation in space, algebraic equation in time. So this is very easy to solve. So for instance, for the Hughley show, this So for instance for the Huey show this is the expression for the for this permeability. For a tube it has some vessel functions that are solution of the cylinders but basically and then for the network you just add individual vessels depending on how is your connected. So I could have shared picking, shared, picking, whatever I want and just I would just change the. No, because if you have share this is sorry This is, sorry, the diverse stocks equation have to be linear. So, if you have shear thinning or shear thickening, no, but there are linear viscoelastic fluid viscoelastic fluids that do work on that, you know. And including blood at certain, you know, shear small amplitude shears, you can get the G prime, G double prime of rheology and just plug it into this theory. And just plug it into this theory, and it will work. Last three questions. Shall maybe get Kenny or Jenya. I don't see Brienne. So while we wait, I will make a While we wait, I will make another quasi-announcement. So I discussed it with a couple of people. At 6:30, we'll meet at the reception of dinner, so we're going to have an early dinner and then maybe walk down to the waterfall and then back. And then, probably, we're going to stop by the town on our way back for a little bit of recreation show. If anyone wants to join. So, if anyone wants to join, I mean, I'm going. If anyone wants to join, 6:30 at the dinner reception.
