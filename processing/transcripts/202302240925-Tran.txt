Okay, so it's always a little bit tricky. Okay, so let me start by talking about this reduct classification problem. Classification problem. So let me first remind you definition of product. So if M and N prime are one soft structure with the same underlying set M, we were saying that M is a reduct of M prime, or equivalently, we're saying that M prime is an expansion of M if every subset that is definable in M together with parameters is also definable in M prime. And we were saying that the two structures are definable. That the two structures are definitely equivalent if one is the reduct of the other. So, the problem we are interested in is to try to classify the reduct of the field of complex number up to definably equivalence. And to some extent, we also want to try to answer the same kind of question. Let's say for some sub collections of product of M, where M is a certain structure of interest. Is a certain structure of interest. And my goal today is to prove a certain result, which hopefully will convince you that the problem like this, it can be solved up to some gap like trivial noise, which I will tell you what trivial noise is about. And well, a lot of the tools that we are going to use is just stability theory, but there is some. But there is some, let me call it neo-neostability aspect. So I hope that on average it could be a talk about neostability. So let me just jump in and tell you directly one of our results. And this is one of the situations where we have a complete We have a complete classification. So we are still, we are almost finishing the paper, and hopefully, we would put up the print soon. So I'm trying to look at the type of product of the field complex number together with just one binary polynomial. And our results saying that such reduction is definably equivalent. Is definitely equivalent to exactly one of the following structures. So, first of all, it's possible that we have the full field structure. So, defy exactly on the same definable set with the field. It is also possible that we will have a vector space over a subfield that is generated by at most two elements. And another possibility. And another possibility is we will have the complex number as a set together with a cap twisted multiplication. And by twisted multiplication, I defy it as x twisted multiplied by b of y to be x minus b multiplied by y minus b plus b. And so in the situation that b is equal to zero, this is just simply the usual multiplication. Just simply the usual modification, but it is possible for us to have this graph structure as well. Another possibility is we have just an expansion of the complex number together with a monomial function mapping from x to ux, where u is a non-constant and unary polynomial with the degree greater or equal to two. equal to two. Another one we can get is we can get complex number with two linear map. So Ax plus B, X going to Ax plus B, where A and B are constant with A different from zero, and X going to X minus B over A, right? And the last one we can get is we can get just the trivial structure. Just the trivial structure of complex number. And moreover, so since it's already a long slide, so I wouldn't like to add more information, but we also know that none of these six case are definably equivalent. And for example, in case two, so the classification. The classification up to definably equivalent is completely being characterized by what subfield we have, right? And in case three, we know that any two different B will define two different two structure, okay, like we give definably non-equivalent two structure, okay. And okay, so the reason in five we are having this is because. Are having this is because uh quick so it is possible to have to squat the position of these two maps, but other than that, we have on the example not definably equivalent to one another. So another result that we get is when we do not have one polynomial, but we have multiple polynomial functions with possibly as many variables as we want. Many variables that we want, and in this, if we take p to be a collection of such polynomial functions, then we can say that a complex number with this collection is definably equivalent to one of the following thing. So the first three examples are exactly what you have seen on the last page. So we have exactly the same example, but So, the fourth example is not just a single example, but it's a collection of reducts. So, where you are having the complex number and then expand this by a collection of univariate polynomial functions. So, one can see that in some way on the 3K 456 in the earlier page. In the earlier page, on collapse into one case, right? So we do not have as fine classification as in the earlier page. And in some way, there's just too many univary polynomial functions, and it's hard to tell them apart. So perhaps it's a less fine classification. Okay. Okay, so you can see on this red letter over here, and NLM stands for non-locally modular case. And this in both this case two and three, we have structure that are non-trivial and locally modular. And in fork, we are getting a trivial structure in the sense of geometric stability theory. In the sense of geometric stability theory. So, some examples that is not on the list include, for example, if you take complex number and then you look at two ternary relation, the first ternary relation is x squared plus y square equal to z square, and the second one is x squared, y square equal to z square. So, if one think about it for a second, one can see that this does not belong to the list because Not belong to the list because this example could be non-locally modular, right? But it is not the same as the view of complex number because you can get many automorphisms, right? So for instance, any map that squid picks a point, X, right, and then take a map that squitching X and minus X, this could give us an out. X, this could give us an automorphism of this structure, right? But clearly, such a map doesn't fit additional multiplication. So, additional multiplication is not defined in structure one, right? And okay, so in some way, you can think of this as some gap like two cover of example one over here, right? But also, we see even more examples than that. See even more examples than that. And another example is you have the same reduction of the field complex number, but on top of that, you also get adding the map going from x to 1 over x. And okay, so this is a proper expansion of this to cover. And the reason is because if you take an automotive, so there's An automorph, so there's so if you're looking at the automorphism of the first structure, right, any map sending x to negative x could be an automorphism, right? But if you also have the map x to 1 over x, there could be fewer automorphism because any map that sends two to negative two must also send one half to negative one half. Okay, so this is just to saying that. Okay, so this is just to saying that you get another expansion which is different from these two covers, but by adding a certain cap unary function, right? And so, okay, we believe that eventually the expected classification for the general reduction will have the following form. So we will have a list of examples, standard examples like this. Standard example like this, and perhaps one more example that comes from elliptic curve. And then, on the general example, could be comes from the cover of the standard example together with some noise that comes from unary function, which we call trivial noise, because unary function one can think of it as just defining a trivial structure in the sense of a geometric. In the sense of geometric stability theory. Okay, so maybe I could pause for a second and ask if there's any question from the audience. I have a question. Is there an alternating readux? Like one is a readux of another and so on. Sorry, sorry, please say it again. Stand up under the microphone. Produce the turn. So, my question is: What is the order between the reductions? If one contains the other, one is a reduct of the other, and so on. Oh, yes. So, certainly, so in this case, you would not, so for example, in so certainly two and three are reduction of one, right? And two and three. And two and three, none of these are reduct of one another. And for four, this is the reduct of one, but not the reduct of two and three, right? So we do have other results in the paper that we do know quite classify the relationship of one is the reduction of another, but that is a bit too long. So I choose not to include it here. Yeah, but we do know that. Yeah, but we do know that that cav result. Yes. Okay. So I hope it's sufficiently clear. Okay. So let me tell you about the idea of the proof. But perhaps before that, let me just tell you perhaps some conceptual. So if one think about it, right? So there are still relatively There are still relatively few reductions, right? If you imagine that looking at reduct, you can put different kinds of different kinds of polynomials, but still we only have few reduct. And there is really, I want to say that there's a conceptual reason for this to happen. And that conceptual reason is that the groups and the field structure, these are pretty robust. These are pretty robust, and then things that resemble group are, in fact, related to actual group, right? And this principle is, of course, very central to geometric stability theory. L-square outside model theory as well. So, an example of this is the Freman theorem in additive combinatorics, which In additive combinatrix, which says that if you have a subset of the integer such that if you are looking at the sum set, okay, the set of a1 plus a2 and a2 is in a, and if you the sum set is smaller than k times the psi of a, where k is a fixed constant, right? Then a could be closely related to a generalized arithmetic progression. Okay, so there are several terms over here. So, there are several terms over here, which if you have not seen before, maybe it's you don't need to worry too much about it. So, for example, generalized arithmetic progression, you can just think of it as a progression. But the point I'm trying to make over here is that, so if you are taking something like, okay, so when a plus a is smaller than the size of i, right, so you can showing that a must be a subgroup, right? Um, and under this, this. And under this garb behavior that is similar to a group, a group, somehow you are forced to have an object that is pretty similar, like arithmetic progression. So arithmetic progression, you can think of it as a subgroup of Z, but you are just taking the neighborhood around zero, right? Right, um, and I mean that one of the points that I want to make today is that I want to make a case that it is often useful to think of these phenomena as, okay, okay, this name is just for fun, but I think that they can be seen at instant of neostability theory as well. Um, and you will see later that our proof is just adding details to this idea. Okay, so that is. This idea. Okay, so that is not to say that it is trivial. Okay, so with that, let me get to the proof. So from now on, we will let P to be a collection of possibly multivariate polynomial function. So the first observation is that C together with this collection P, it could be a reduct of the field complex number. So in particular, it's strongly minimal, right? And we can use on the tunes. Right, and we can use all the tools that we love about geometric stability to attack this problem. Sorry. And okay, so I probably Ben have gave this definition yesterday, but let me just mention it again. So when you have a strongly minimal structure, and then if you have a subset of m square with dimension one, and such that And such that all projections to m are finite to one, we will call this a non-trivial plane curve. And we will say that the definable family of plane curve is faithful if any two different curves, it could have finitely many points in common. And for such a family, we could call the Molyrang of the dimension of the family. So the following fact was. Following fact, quotes by Khrushchev, even though I heard that some version of it was also studied earlier by Zuber. So, if one have a strongly minimal structure and we look at the set of possible dimension of faithful definable family of strongly mini definable family of non-trivial plane curve, then you have just three possibilities. Just three possibilities. The first possibility is when the structure looks like, just like the set, the infinite, just the set quid equality. Then the only plane curve are just the only non-trivial plane curve are coming from is just x equal to x, x equal to y, right? And actually, that's only finitely many of them. Actually, there's only finitely many of them. And the second case is when M it looks like complex number together with addition. So here you can look at, so you can have a higher dimensional family, right? Namely, you can look at the equation A Z is equal to X plus B for a. To x plus b for a various b, right? And you could have an infinite one-dimensional family. And the last situation is when you have the field, right? Let's say like the field of complex number. And over here, you can look at curve of Heiger degree, right? And then because of that, you can get a Heiger dimension. And for the purpose of today's talk, I would like to focus more later on on the Focus more later on on the case. Okay, so using this result, we can take the structure C quid B and then put into the three cases, either the trivial case, the non-trivial locally modular case, or the non-locally modular case. And for the purpose of today's talk, I would focus more on the case in the middle, non-trivial locally modular case, but in some way the most in most. But in some way, the most difficult and interesting case is the non-locally modular case, which we need to use many of the restricted trichotomy conjecture that is recently proved. But I'm sure Ben is at a conference. So if you are interested about the third case, you can ask him about it, even though I also mentioned a few things. All right. So let us just first. So, let us just first very quickly go through the trivial case. So, in the trivial case, we know that well, definable subset essentially just come from unary and binary relation, right? And using that, if we know that this extension is a trivial reduct, we cannot have a polynomial that Have a polynomial that are non-constant on both polynomial, in both variables. So, because of that, on function in this collection, P must be unary. And conversely, if on the function in the collection P unary, it is more or less an exercise in quantify elimination to showing that the structure that you get is trivial. So, this case is relatively easy. Relatively easy. So, the non-trivial load colleague modular case, the tunes from geometric stability also bring us certain distance, right? So, it tells us that the structure can be related very much to abelian groups. And the precise version of that is that, well, you can find a definable strongly minimal abelian group such that you have a That you have a finite to finite projection, a finite to finite relationship between the original structure and G, right? And moreover, you know that, okay, so this, the induced structure on the group is not too much more than the pure group, right? So you know that induced structure from M, every definable subset is just a finite Boolean combination of coset of definable subsets. Of coset of definable subgroup of Gn. Okay, so the challenge is somehow to use this information to deduce how function in the group P must look like. And so it is relatively straightforward to reduce to the case that P only has two variables, right? So you need to do two things. So first of all, you want to say that if you have a polynomial. That if you have a polynomial that is non-constant in both variables, then you want to force that polynomial, it's either a linear polynomial or a twisted polynomial. And that could tell us that the locally modular locally modular reduct is just either case one or case two of our earlier theorem. But perhaps there can be many polynomials. Can be many polynomials, so in this case, you need to show that if you take two different polynomials, then they need to look very similar. And what we would do is we would use a detour through additive combinatorics. So what we will do is that we will study the combinatorial behavior of the polynomial mu P when you apply it to finite set. And then use local modularity, we conclude that P. We concluded P must be very abelian group-like. And then we apply fact in combinatorics to recover information about P. And for two, we will play the same gap game, but for both P and Q. So let us focus on one, just a single polynomial. So for that, I need to give some further definition. So if you have S and T are set, and you have S and t are set, and you have a function from s squared to t is a function. We were saying that the function p, it has symmetric small expansion. If you can choose a very large set n, such that if you look at the image of p i i, the image of i and i under p, right, this is not too large, right? So just a little bit larger than n, namely n to the power one plus epsilon. n to the pub one plus epsilon and the typical example that one should think of it is uh if you're looking at the pxy is just x plus y right so this has more expansion from c to c because if you choose a very long arithmetic progression uh so if you take an arithmetic progression and you add it to itself the size just grows by two times so that is still very small and um Very small. And the idea is that if you take an R5 map in a Belient group, they could have symmetric small expansion. But if you take some other polynomial, then you will not have such phenomenon. Okay. And such idea is obtained in a result by in collaboration by Ching, Roy, and myself. So this saying that if you So, this saying that if you have a polynomial with small symmetric expansion, then the polynomial you need to look either close to addition or close to multiplication. Okay, let us just keep it this way for now. Maybe one thing I want to mention is that this result we prove using tunes from ominality, right? So, I use model theory to prove. So, I use model theory to prove this combinatorics result, and then it's now a nice circle that we now can use this combinatorics result to prove some result from model theory. So, okay, so let, so we plan our plan is to use that gap result. So, take a polynomial which is definable in M, a non-trivial and locally modular reduction of this. So, you had a group G, right? Had a group G, right? Okay, so and so, okay, so maybe to make life simple, let us just imagine that this G is just addition, right? Then the polynomial P could I see, so it looked like I'm pretty behind my time. So let me just mention. Let me just mention. So, our idea is we want to prove that this has really small extension, right? And because just imagine that this proof G is very much close to just complex number with addition, then you can view an example with more expansion in this group. And that example, it could translate to the fact that the polynomial P. The polynomial P itself has very small expansion. And because of that, we would be able to get that the polynomial P is just equal to have the additive form or the multiplicative form, right? And actually, this must hold for own definable polynomial. Okay, and if we need to play around a little bit more, and then we could be able to deduce that. We could be able to deduce that p is either a linear map or a twisted monomial. Okay, so this is how we are handling the locally modular case. So in the last minute, let me mention what happened to the non-locally modular case. And so the idea is to use Zuber trichotomic conjecture, which allow us to relate the non-local. Allow us to relate the non-locally modular case to a pure field, right? And it was recently shown by Ben Castle, microbiota, that the Zuburg conjecture hold whenever the structure, the strongly minimal set is interpreted in the view of complex number, right? Right, um, and this um is the new technical ingredient uh that allow us to be able to classify um non-locally modular structure. Um, and to carry out this proof, it requires uh also quite a bit of effort. Um, so one thing that I want to mention is that um the trichotomy conjecture is not enough. The trichotomy conjecture is not enough because if it's potentially, you only get only a cover of the field complex number, right? So in order to, so there need to be extra work to show that this is actually the full complex number itself, right? And then the idea is that, so you first tag to build. So, you first start to build something like a map from C to N, and you are trying to argue that this map is injective. And okay, so from then you could be able to show that you can defy both addition and multiplication. All right, so thanks very much. And I would end here. Thanks, Wat. We have some questions. I have a question. Yes, I speak public. Me, can you hear me? Yes. What happens if you allow rational functions? What happened if you allow rational functions? I think that we would have one extra case. And that extra case comes from the fact that in In rational function, you have one extra case for this. So you can think of addition, multiplication as coming from addition and then applying the exponential map. So there's another case that comes from the actang map. So in principle, we would be able to solve it too. But yeah, we have not done that. Yes. We'll get also energetic curve. We'll get also elliptic curve, yeah. Uh, no, in the multiplication, that is still not elliptic curve. So, even in rational function, uh, we don't get elliptic curve. But uh, if we're allowing cover, then there could be new example that elliptic curve coming later. All right. So, uh, okay, David, quick question. Yeah. Okay. Uh, yes, uh, so quick question is, um, you mentioned the classification up to trivial. The classification up to trivial noise, or you know, these cases that you maybe don't cover. What's in the trivial noise, or what makes it trivial? So, so eventually, what we will get is so quick, the goal is to characterize, so every search structure, there could be a covering map to some standard example, right? And such structure for such structure, you can also define the maximum trivial substructure. Trivial substructure. Okay. Right. So that could class, that could give the noise, further noise classification for the structure. Okay, thanks. All right. So thanks a lot. Let's think then again. And we'll start up again in three minutes.
