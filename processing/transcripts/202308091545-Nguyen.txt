Now I will start. Okay, thank you. Yeah. So in this talk, I will discuss about the non-local local of the cosine linear evolution equation. This is the system. U here can be the vector and from R D to R M and the A is the linear distance of. The linear differentiable if we fit this perimeter, we fit this coefficient and this operator order s and another order is less than s here. Okay, and this means when we check the Fourier in this variable, then we will obtain the Fourier mental layer A and with A, something like C of power F. Something like C of F. Yeah. Okay, for example, A layer minus one plus U square multiplied Laplace U. Yeah, DD associated to S equal for 2 and L equal zero. And L and N, Capture N is the nonlinear districtable operator of U and with the DP cheaply less than S. So this equation has. Yes, yeah. So this equation has the coefficient linear system. It means the linear in the longest in the highest order derivative. And if we connect in linear, if this operator, it is local, some local. And non-local, it means we need to know the information of you on the host on the host bay to the Uh, on host by to define this operator, we can determine this operator. Okay, this is the standard definition, okay. And um, let me uh discuss some some discuss some example. The first symbol is example is the NASA equation. This is the solution u in R D to R D and O D to O D and you satisfy the symptom of D plus one equation. The first equation, this is the network equation and this is the stop operator and plus the non-linearity term here. And because we have u, u, it is the n d common and and p it is present. And p it present, we have another perimeter, and we need to have another condition. Okay, so this is the Nevsky equation, and we can give projection and then we will obtain the semi-linear evolution equation. This is the linear and equal, yeah, the right-hand side is the non-linearity term. non-linearity term okay and we can easily check this problem it is by eti the basic by minus one infinity infinity and for the next equation i want to mention it the 2d 2d must gas with the surface tension this is the the one important model of the fee battery problem yeah in the fluid really the non-local very non-local non-local, very non-local evolution equation, ut and equal the single inter total of this operator. This equation is quite complicated and the chemical practice and delta alpha here defined by standard way is finite different. And for this equation, if we look This equation, if we look at just fundamental, then we can obtain the following operator: d f t and this operator equals minus d power 3 of f over the one of the f square power 3 over 2 and and this one is defined by this one defied by This one defined by standard way, it is the Fourier emitted DA. And when we take the Fourier, and then we obtain the symbol C of power T. And for this problem, we did a non-local coaster linear evolution equation. And we can easily check this equation of this equation is the leadship spike. Okay, I mean, rigid society initial data. Recall associated to initial data associated to the lipstick because we need this one it is finite. We need to find finite and we can easy to check this equation have the lip chip critical. So and next equation I want to mention it is the Tim Fum equation, it is some of the important equation in the pulse medium. medium and it is the dd in term of u and and the pi la plus is of the exponential of minus la plus u and la plot is defined by standard way and we can easy to check we can rewrite this equation by by this term this is the main term this is the main term and so we can we can check if we can if if we want to to study this question To study this equation, list we need this coefficient published from below and above. And this means, and moreover, we can easily check this equation have the political spy either. We need a second derivative of u e infinity. You mean political spy e the infinity w to infinity. And each question is the local. Equation is the local Cauchy evolution equation. And next equation, this is the equation in the geometry, this is the mean curvature flow in the craft K. And this is the symptom, which is the F here, it is the M component. And we have the evolution, it is derivative in terms of F j. In terms of FJ and equal A magic A multiply secondly, has some multiply derivative of F J and magic A A depend on derivative F E D phi values. And we can check the magic A D positive, this positive and shown by identity and identity. identity and identity over this okay and so we can see this one did in local Gaussian evolution equation and and of course we can easily do to check leap chip lip spacio for this problem and and for the more complicated equation we we we have the um yeah we have homo homo And we have homogeneous lambda equation. It is very complicated, really important equation in the kindergarten theory. And we have a dedicated F here. We can see the homogenous, this means the solution independent in this might only depend on velocity and and the F here equals the diversion of the this operator this chi complicated and we when with kernel A like potential match like this matches here and we can rewrite this equation like look like this okay and this is the risk operator this is the matches and this this function collusion with f and multi-play range f this is the Chip like them f this is something like local coefficient in the evolution equation, but the coefficient is local, yeah, and and this is the much complicated. So and then for this problem, we can easy to check initial data of this equation the base of spy D minus D minus gamma minus two. Yeah, and for this case, we can express gamma plus two positive. Gamma plus two positive when gamma plus two is positive, and we can expect the equation of the global websites. And if we consider for the full problem, we have here, yeah, we have the derivative in S of F and we have the transpose term. And for this question, it's not in the form of the problem one we mentioned, but One we mentioned, but we have the one way to do with this case. We can discuss about this later. And for this problem, we can easily check if this spike is the critical absorption to this problem. This is the best by subject to in S for this index. And for V, we have this index. Yeah. This is how for any alpha. For any answer, okay. So, um, to study, uh, uh, yeah, um, non-local local question linear evolution equation, we have uh we will miss some several difficulty. Uh, yeah, normally it is strongly non-local, local, and the generate problem like muscar equation or equation or other minkature flow it is the degenerate problem and and and if we we only use the conservation law such as energy momentum that not that that is to which to even to look for the existence of this solution and if we consider the higher If we consider the higher order, something like the Pyla Platt equation or the must get with the survey tension, that is the third order. And we cannot apply the maximum principles. And here we have the several tools. And further, we can use the tool like the Joxie Nasmos theorem. Yeah, theorem to get the Honda HMS for the if we have the nice structure, if uniformly at least or variables second order with the rough coefficient. But of course, we can extend this one for the fractional k of order s and with at the between zero and two. But in general, this idea doesn't work for the general. This idea doesn't work for the general parabolistic equation and for system and for the equation with a higher derivative. And the second one is so the HMS. If we want to do this, we need the coefficient level enough. And for the energy, we need to keep the singular wave. And it is suitable for the degeneracy of the problem. And yeah, for the separate problem, people usually use the energy methods. And for this talk, I will introduce the new methods, L5T theory, to study webinars for the non-linear evolution equation in the In the resource space. Okay, so we view a star for the solder triptimus. Yeah, we can see the further standard equation, okay, diversion of A multiplied F and equal diversion of F and with A did the matches, positive matches. And if A is constant, and then it's easy to Constant and then it's easy to the range of u in on in CA can be controlled by F in CA and multi-apply this constant. And this constant applied when A conversion to integer. And this achievement can determine when the K the coefficient K A here not non-constant, non-constant match. Non-constant matches. Exactly, we can drop the following equality: U in C C 1A, and can be joined F in C 1A, and we plus some lower term, U in U in infinity, and we need the coefficient A is C A. This estimate is optimal, okay? And this coefficient is optimal, yeah. And to obtain this. Yeah. And to obtain this inequality, we can apply the standard method like the fishing method. And this is some preferences we can see in the book of Chulin Geo, the famous paper of Akmong and Nidibas. Okay, so and what Okay, so and what how about for the parabolist equation? So for the parallel equation, we have here we have derivative of u minus Laplacian of U equal divergent F. So for this problem, usually the right-hand side only depends on the non-negative term, depend on solution. And we only know the data for initial data. And so And so we need to design for the suitable HMS for some kind of solar type. And we can drop this one. We can drop this one. Yeah, we can drop this one. We can drop the range of U in CA and multiply the suitable way in time. And this one can be controlled by, can be can be. Can be controlled by the stems by associated for term and for the initial data, for initial data. Yeah, for initial data, this is the optimal. And then in particular, we can obtain if we assume initial data in phi T and then we can obtain solution u also infinity in time and in S, and U in C one plot A. C1 plus A relative in S and multi-apply way here. And this term is important. And this is something like smooth effect. If we consider, yeah, if we just the data infinity and then for the positive time, we can guess the solution dt, the C infinity. We can obtain C1 plus A. And of course, these estimates can be available for. This estimates can be available for when we replay A1 plus A by M plot A for any M. And of course, we need to replay this. And this is the suitable axiom to apply for the evolution equation. And this is some kind of solder type associated to the parallelic equation. Equation. And this estimate can extend to the general K when we replay the Laplace operator by the general operator like minus diversion of magic A multiplied and u and we can obtain the same atchimas like this. Okay. So we can extend And thus HMS for the general to for the general non-local variables equation UT and plus LSU and LSU is the operator with fully multiplayer of A and with A something like C of power F and different the term for the the right on the right hand side and we can obtain this result we can obtain this this result yeah we can obtain this is a result and moreover we can do first general k with the with the operator l here can be um the coefficient it is changing coefficient we can have a lambda here with the lambda it is cheap yeah so uh with the So with the atimus, we can obtain, we can apply, we can apply to get the web distance for the semi-linear evolution equation. For example, for the functional network equation, ut of d up gamma with gamma between one and two, and this is the b the low rate projection. low rate projection. Yeah. Yeah. And we can easily graph this equation have variable variables in the base of one minus gamma infinity infinity. We only in this case for gamma between zero and one. Of course we can do for the gamma equal one and gamma equal two. We cannot We cannot apply because there is resolve nettle equation with the gamma equal to the strong e-power for this bike. And we also apply for the qg and this equation. I will not dig the semi-linear. I will not mention this. Okay. So and another application is the mean culture flow. So yeah, yeah, each question we we mentioned we mentioned before. And with initial data here and like we discussed LIPCIP is the political spaces. Of course, so level S1 plus DO2 is also political spaces associated to this problem. And we apply And we apply the HMS I mentioned before, we can obtain the local web outitness with the critical data at Euro in C1. And we can exist the time T, the problem have the units solution from Euro to capital T and we have an F certify. Yeah, certify indeed norm it finite. It is a lip chip norm infinity and it is smooth effector. We need human chip like a suitable weighty. And of course we can deploy it well this this way by smooth norm. And moreover, if we assume leap chip norm small enough and we can prove this problem have global resistance. Global resistance. And not that for this problem, when M equals one, and this problem have the global resistance without any harmonious assumption. Because yeah, this for the one to case that is possible because we have the several tools to do like the Zoxy method, what we can do because the Zoxy method can apply further for For the scalar function, we cannot apply for the system k. And I believe for the bit m greater than 2, and this equation should be the finite time log with last data. And not thus, we can extend this result when we only need for the literal. Uh for the lead norm, uh lead chip norm uh uh finite and and and the best subs by uh v1 infinity infinity uh multi-platiness uh small. Yeah. Somehow we we all need a lipkeep and lipkeep norm small, but we we need the method norm small. Yeah. We we just need the lipkeep uh uh norm is finite to conjoin this coeffici this coefficient. Yeah. Coefficient, yeah. So the drop it, it not very complicated. I want to mention here, I defy the coefficient A, A phi equal this. And then we can rewrite the equation by this one: derivative in time of F minus A phi, second derivative of F and equal here. equal here and it we can look at this term like lower term and and and and and we know because in this solid it is lip chip and then we can construct the function phi it is smooth and and and go to to uh to to f yellow in the lip chip norm and uh to to estimate f we only uh estimate the f still tau f tilde equal f minus uh phi equal to f minus phi and then we we try to write our equation in f ta and apply the dip to the both side and apply our hmm to obtain the result because we have the divergent form here in the right hand side and then we can obtain yeah really the uh the the way how we can apply the the hms we uh yeah i i discussed uh before and uh And we also apply the same method to show the web genus for the VMA flow. This is a very complicated case equation. This is the test order of the evolution equation. And this is the surface diffusion flow. Yeah. And Tim Fim. And team film flow and team film team film flow, we need the Laplace of U Laplace of U belong to leave infinity or continuous. So and this is the non-local cosine linear evolution equation. This is the 2D muscat risk survey tension. The visual attention. Yeah, it is. We can see the two fluids and we can see the two domains. And in each domain, we have the solution U satisfied the Dacian law. And between the interface, we have the pressure zone equal mean curvature. And for this question, And for this equation, this equation can be solved if we can find the information of the interface. And this equation is equivalent to the equation of the interface F and we will tend this equation. So we only consider this equation. And for this equation, we can draw with the initial eta leap jip and Initially, it taught it leap chip and C1, C1, and then we can drop local variable distance. And so to do this, we apply the mass gas visual extension. In this form, somehow we can fix in coefficient. We have this one, the main term, when 5, we play 5 by F and we can mark this one. We can mark the this one. Yeah. But we deploy f by phi and then we have this form. And then we put this term in the right-hand side and this is the mentality non-reity term. And because phi here is smooth, and then we can apply our method, our inequality to get the reality of this equation. Then we can obtain. Equation, then we can obtain the local web distance. Yeah, and when we obtain, when we write this form, and then we apply the DP to both side, and then we will obtain the divergent form, yeah, divergent from the random side like diversion of some false stone. Then we can apply, yeah. So when our XMAS can apply for the Can apply for the more complicated equation like the 2D basket. Did the vector and did the alpha vector and in the spy it on the Uh, in the spy ET on the tauverse, and uh and this is derivative in alpha of the g here, the fundamental solution of the stock equation in R2. And and and S here, something like circle, something like the curves, yeah, yeah. And to study this problem, we uh we because chi here and uh chi of uh g of delta s here we need to to define uh verify of this operator and we need this uh assumption uh actual assumption it means we need to assume uh the curve f not uh interaction yeah uh intersection sorry intersection that means uh we assume uh the lim uh in s and m S and alpha of the delta, the distance of s of s s minus yeah, this is the okay, and divide alpha, this is cheaply positive for any s and alpha. And this is alpha, the norm of alpha defied by the norm on the periodis. Yeah, defined by standard right here. And we can check this problem how. This problem has the curriculum spiky method by our lip. And before to study this problem, we need to neuralize this problem. We need to know what is the main term of this equation. So when we take derivative of lower values of the delta of S here, then we can obtain behavior of this 181 over answer. This one is the one our answer, and then we obtain this operator. And after that, we and then we assume A here cheaply positive, and this one is something like the parallelist equation with the parallelist system with this guy, the swarrow of And then we can obtain this result. We can obtain this result. Yeah. We can obtain the result webinar. And we can obtain the result for the 2D basket. For the 2D basket, the high complicated. And we have obtained the same result. And so our method can apply. So, our method can apply for general evolution equation. And moreover, we can apply for the kinetic type evolution equation like Bostman and Boston and Landau for the equation like this for general. And it, yeah, and more well, we can do the equation on the body domain with this and because the kernel of this operator is the. kernel of this operator, he did the main term of this equation, did the kernel of this operator similar to the equation of this operator. And then I think it is possible to extend the L50 theory to this equation. So I stop here. I'm sorry here.
