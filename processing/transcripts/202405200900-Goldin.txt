To you, and ask questions, and in particular, about that excursion on Wednesday afternoon. But now it's time to start with the mathematics. Our first speaker is Rebecca Boldin. So I don't have a title yet, so just introduce it. Yes, so I will write it on the board then. And so I'm going to give a board talk. And I should maybe explain while I write this. Maybe explain while I write this title down where I come from, which is a topological and geometric background. I have not heard very much about swine, so I'm super excited to be here, super pleased to be invited. And so I'm going to give an introduction to equivariant cohomology, which sounds like a big word, but I won't explain. Word that I will explain and PKM theory. And I should just ask: is the entirety of this board? Am I allowed to use all of it in its issue we've got is that whatever you're writing is showing up mirrored for the folks online. But all of it is like I can go on a little bit. Oh, it's backwards. Yeah. Well, I don't know how to fix that. I don't know how to fix that. Okay, so as I said, I looked up what Splines were before I came here. That was the extent to which I've done work in this area. And what I read was the following quote from paper, piecewise polynomial functions on the faces of a polyhedral complex that agree on the intersection of two faces. And I think it was just mentioned that there's this kind of connection to statistics and the way that I saw this. And a way that I saw this were things like doing linear regression, where you've got two line segments instead of one line. And, you know, to me, it seemed like a very interesting kind of question. Just we're asking about polynomials, p-vi-polynomials, on unusual spaces, possibly, not necessarily simply on a line, but rather on a graph or on a polyhedral complex. So I'm going to start with like what's the goal of this talk. And this is just a first stab. And this is just a first stab at what the goal of this talk is, which is to associate a useful invariant to a triple, which is a space X, a group G. G, which generally will be a Lie group, so a continuous group, and a group action. And this triple is, I'm going to denote it by just calling it G acting on X. And I'll say a word about what that is in a moment, about what a group action is. But I'd also just kind of like point out that I'm really talking to the people who are not experts. Talking to the people who are not experts. There are many experts in the field here who know a lot about what I've talked about and maybe could give this talk themselves. I won't be able to connect it closely to Splines because that's what I'm hoping to learn about here, but we'll see a little bit of a connection. And what I'd like to do is kind of tell you a story of something that is analogous to how you might take a triple like this and associate to it something like a polyhedral with polynomials that are green, a piece of. Polynomials that are agreeing, of piecewise polynomials that have some kind of agreement, and instead it's going to be a graph with labels. And one might think of that as something like a dual to a polyhedron. And as I said, I'm not going to go into detail that because it certainly is not my area of expertise, but I just wanted to kind of start by saying, like, just what the basics are of some of the language that people are using around this break recently. Okay, so I'm going to just say, as a starting point, we're not going to. As a starting point, we're not going to consider all g, but we're going to restrict our attention to the case where g is going to be abelian, and it's still a Lie group. And you may as well assume it's connected. And you might think of that as saying that G is equal to, or isomorphic, to the circle group, maybe to the. circle group maybe to the nth power or possibly c star where c star is equal to the set of complex numbers but not zero great okay so what i want to do is kind of um um like there's a vast literature on some of the things i'm going to talk about some of it is in the world of um of topological Of topological spaces, perhaps with a structure like a symplectic structure or some other kind of geometric structure. And often it is favored to use a compact group action. And in other circumstances, people are interested in having algebraic varieties and you have a complex algebraic structure. And in that context, you might use a non-compact group action. But most of what I say will be true either which way. And we will, and I'll make it clear. And I'll make it clear when it is that we use that I'm making a distinction. So, the other restriction I'm going to make, aside from saying that I'm really only interested in kind of a simpler situation where the group is actually abelian, is X itself will be smooth and compact. And each of these conditions can be removed in some circumstances, but since I'm trying to give the simplest case here, so we might say smooth compact manifold. In the case of in some cases, but other times we might use a smooth projective variety. As I say, you can loosen up these conditions, and sometimes people add things to these conditions, like they might say it's smooth, but actually, you also want it to be, say, symplectic or even have some specific interaction with how the group acts. Okay, so that's my first start is to say. So that's my first start, is to say that. And let me just remind you what it is to have a group action because I don't really know my audience, but I did ask and I hear that we have statisticians in the audience is really great. Then we're going to have a lot of fun. Okay, so if the group action, if I want a smooth group action, then what I want is for every g inside of the group, there's going to be a map, psi g, from x to itself. From x to itself, that is typically seeking smooth, or you might have it algebraic if you're in the case of an algebraic group. And it has some properties. So I'm going to say it's a diffeomorphism or an algebraic equivalence, which also follows from the following two properties. One is that if I take the identity element of the group, so that being one. So, that being one, that I get the identity map. All right, and the second condition that I'll insist on is that if I consider what happens to one group element and compose it with a second group element, and I look at the composition of those maps, I just get the map associated with the product. So, those two things gave us a group map. Again, it's a group map and a group action. And you might have some additional smoothness condition that about how these are, how these would function under, say, a path from G1 to the identity, for example. But I'm going to stick with this and say this is what we mean by group action. And okay, and so as I kind of do this, I can maybe revise what this goal is. Maybe revise what this goal is and move on to a second stab at what the goal is of this talk, which is to associate to a triple here. Now I'm going to say the triple here is T acting on X, where T is an abelian Lie group and And I should maybe say connected so that I don't get in trouble somewhere. And X would be a smooth space, either a manifold or an algebraic variety. And the goal here then is to have to associate not just a useful invariant, but I'm going to add some adjectives to this to say that the invariant that I want should be. Invariant that I want should be algebraic and combinatorial. And so that's my goal for what I'm going to do here. And hopefully we could just say maybe stud that is realizable as a set of polynomials. With some agreement conditions. And that's the extent to which I will say I'm talking about swines. So that's what my goal is. And as I say, I came about this having never heard the word swines. So what I'm telling you about really is something that has a very long history in mathematics. In mathematics, just in studying group actions on manifolds. All right, so I'm going to just start by saying, well, there's sort of like, you might, and we will refine this goal in just a moment, but I'm going to say like sort of a very, like a silly example that I'm going to start with is that if P is a point, and then I could have And then I could have like S1, let's say, act on the point trivially. So, what does that mean? It just means that every element of S1 sends P to itself, because that's all it can do. Okay, and so then we're going to just associate the polynomial ring the adjoined one variable. That one variable here is going to be Is going to be since S1 is one-dimensional. Now, you might say, what is that coming from? And again, like I said, we're going to get there in a moment. But I just wanted to kind of say, like, the very simple thing to do to say, well, the simplest case one could have is there's no agreement to talk about. There's just polynomials that we associate. That's what's going to be what happens at the point. Okay, so a more interesting example. Is when I have, I'm going to let X be equal to S2, a two-sphere. And I'm going to have S1 act on the two-sphere by rotation around an axis. Okay, so the idea of this is simply that for any theta inside of a circle. Theta inside of a circle S1, what does it do? It rotates by theta, which sends S2 to itself, rotates by theta. And you could maybe add some additional information like counterclockwise when needed from above. So I've now embedded this thing into a three-dimensional space. So I just imagine rotating around. Space, so I just imagine it rotating around the z-axis, and I say, Okay, what it does is it rotates by theta around there. And when we do something like this, the first thing that we might notice: if you rotate a sphere around like this, it has two fixed points. And those fixed points are just the north and the south pole that are fixed by that rotational action. And it's fixed by every theta inside of here. We'll still fix those same two points because that's all we're doing. Okay, so. So there are two fixed points, which are the north and the south pole. And in general, what we're going to be doing is looking at these fixed points. And the graph that we're going to be trying to get, the algebraic combinatorial invariant that we're trying to construct, it's going to start with saying, well, there's going to be a graph and there are two points in the graph. And those points are. Points in the graph, and those points correspond to the fixed points here. Okay, so we'll associate a graph. It's a very small board, so I apologize, with two vertices. And furthermore, again, this is just a, I'm not giving you a why yet, but we'll. Say, I'm not giving you a y yet, but we'll get there. But what we're going to do is we're going to associate two vertices and an edge between them. And that edge is because there's a two-seater. That is to distinguish it from saying what I might associate to just two points. Wow, very fancy. Okay, great. Yeah, this is not a white chalk. Chalk, I think the marker is not one. Yeah, no, the markers won't. Okay. No. Okay, sorry. Sorry about the screen. We don't need to see it. Yeah, we don't need the colour. Need to see, yeah. We don't need this, but I want to make sure they can see, right? Yeah, it's a little bit awkward to have me see myself. I feel worried. I will admit they don't see the entire thing. Oh, yay, I know it doesn't work. So, I guess the question would be: how much can they see to the right? Like, how much can I? Yeah, we have like the camera that can check. Oh, it tracks me. Oh, it takes me. Okay, can we turn this off? We have to turn it off so I don't see that. What if you just turn off the actual? What if you just turn off the actual register itself? No worries. Yeah. Okay. I don't know what. Okay, you're saying that then it tracks something. I don't know what that. Okay. So this is okay. Do you want me over here? But the problem is that if people online, you know, don't have. Oh, I thought you said tracks. That's right. No, no, no, because what they see is through this picture. They see is through this village. No, they see it through there. They see it from there. But not completely blind. It doesn't show you at all. So no, I see. I'll hold if that's like. No, no, no, no, I just. Is there like some? Maybe can you tell me so I stop here? Where do I stop here? Can you see the here? Yeah, talk. But I'm trying to figure out my limit. Okay, great. Thank you. Okay, great. You guys aren't really trapped in the previous entry because ours doesn't track. All right. So as I said, like we kind of say, well, we have these. So again, we're imagining we have, I'm very glad to have them. Imagine we have, I'm very glad to have a little extra space here. So, we have two spheres here. We've got this group that is rotating it around, which is the circle group, and it just rotates it by theta. And we have two fixed points here. And what I said was so far that we associate to that, we take this north pole, we take the south pole, we construct a graph, and I just put a line segment here between them. And why do I put a line segment? Just because it is a T-sphere. Okay, now finally, there's one last thing that I'm going to kind of add to this picture to get this. Of add to this picture to get something that I'm calling combinatorial, of course, maybe I think that graphs here should be reasons combinatorial have a graph. But anyway, I'm going to label this edge. So I'm going to label the edge, the edge with plus or minus the weight of the action, the S1 action at At the point at say the North Pole. Okay, and just to be clear, what I'm saying by this is that when you have a group action, if I think of that group action fixing this point right here, what it does is because it fixes the point, it induces a map on the vector space, which is the tangent space to that point. So the tangent space to the point of S2, it's called this. Of S2. It's called the North Pole point here. Okay, so this guy here has an S1 action that is the same as a representation. And that weight of that representation is what I'm going to label this point here with. And I might just call that plus or minus one from what I said earlier. Plus or minus one from what I said earlier, that I'm rotating it around just as fast as theta itself goes. I could have said I'm going to rotate for every theta inside of a circle, I could have rotated twice as fast, or I could have gone negative theta counterclockwise, and that would have induced a different associated weight that I'm putting here. If I put negative one, of course, it wouldn't have made any difference because I put a plus minus one here. Minus one here. But now I'm going to make this just a little bit more sophisticated because what I'm interested in doing here is creating some kind of invariant that's going to work a little bit more generally here. And so I'm going to just make a slight modification of what I just said. And I'm going to say, hey, if I have two points on a sphere and a sphere that is connecting them, the difference between them and just having Between them and just having two points where I've associated one polynomial ring, is I'm going to just say, Well, for each point here, I shall associate one polynomial ring. And between these two points, I've got this two-sphere. And what I'm going to label it with is plus or minus X itself. Yeah, did you have a question? Oh, did this? Okay. All right, so plus or minus X itself. All right, so that's Minus x itself. All right, so that is going to be the graph that I do that. The plus or minus x is indicating that the north pole, what I'm doing is I'm rotating it with weight one, and at the south pole, it's with weight negative one, but that x is representing the actual weight of the action. Okay, so what I wanted to kind of point out here, we have this kind of rigidity. Maybe I'll just say this guy right here is this kind of rigidity. Right here is this kind of rigidity that's coming into the picture that wasn't there if we just had two points. If we just had two points, I might just say, Hey, I'm going to do some modification. I'm just going to paint two copies of Polynodo ring. And so instead, I'm going to say we have some freedom, except for this rigidity. So the associated the associated algebraic invariant is going to be the set of all is going to be the set of all pairs f and g inside of z adjoint x direct sum z adjoint x so that's just saying i've got a polynomial for the north pole and a polynomial for the south pole and i'm And a polypress self-pole, and I'm going to have the additional condition that the difference of these two is inside of the difference of these two. Well, I'll just write this sorry. Yeah, let me, I'll do it inside of the ideal generated by x. Okay, so that's the associated algebraic invariant, and this is our first non-trivial example, let's say. Non-trivial example, let's say, of the equivariant cohomology denoted HS1 star of S2. So it depends on S2, of course, but also on S1. And what's implied, of course, is that you also know the action from S1 to S2. Now, some of you might. Now, some of you might complain, I didn't tell you. Well, you know, what happens? We're over Z. There's sort of a lot of different literature that some of which use a Z, some of which use a Q. And hopefully I'll try to be clear when I'm using which for the statements. You can now use chalk. I can now use chalk, which is better though. Because at this point, we kind of have a. Well, you can push. Oh, I see. Yeah, well, that was poor planning on my part, I guess. Poor planning on my part, I guess. All right, so I'm going to just cover up what I wrote here. Okay, so let me, okay, we're, okay, all right, so this example is so important. In some sense, GKM theory is built on this. Is built on this example. And so I'm going to redo the example from an algebraic point of view very quickly. So the algebraic view of this, instead of letting t be equal s1, I'm going to let t be equal to c star, which are the non-zero complex numbers. And instead of x being s2, I'm going to let x be cp1. And what I'm going to And what I'm going to write this in coordinates as pair Z1, Z2, where Z1, Z2, not both, they're complex numbers, not both zero. And I have an equivalence that A times V1, A times V2 is equal to Z1, Z2 for all A inside of C star. Inside of C star. Okay, so that's what CP1 is. And then I will let C star act on CP1 by saying that T inside of C star, what does it do? T acts on C1, C2. Oh, sorry, I should have written Z0. Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you. One kind of decision here. Okay, um, so that's right, zero of one. What does it do? It just multiplies it on the first coordinate. That's a non-tervial action. And it has two six points that aren't too hard to find out. So these are again the points that all elements of a torus. Elements of a torus fix. And those are the points that look like either 0, 1, because if I put a 0 here, then 2 doesn't do anything. And also 1, 0, because if I multiply by t at 1, it is equivalent to just finding the 1 here. You've got to get that equivalent. So those are the two fixed points. In fact, I will call 0, 1 will be my North Pole. Will be my north pole and one zero will be my south pole. And once I do that, I can look at that representation that I just mentioned over yonder and say, well, if I look at this action, what happens when I differentiate the action and I look at the tangent space at the North Pole? I look at the tangent space at the North Pole, I could say that the tangent space tangent space at the North Pole of this CP1 is looks like a set of one oh, sorry, Z01. And so we can ask what happens when we act on this. What happens when we act on this? So the weight is well, so notice that t acting on Z01 is just equal to T Z01. And so when we notice that this T part right here, the exponent of that multiplication by T is exactly what Exactly, what gives us the weight of the action, and that gives us the weight weight one action. And similarly, if we had computed what happens, and maybe I'll just do it like quickly T asset CP of CP1, well, we can, that tangent space looks like one z1, and then I can ask t acting on this one z1. On this one z1, well, that's going to be equal to 1 t inverse z1. So I apologize, my handwriting is bothered, but you're going to do a stuck to the white one. All right, so this here gives us this negative one over here. Okay, so the graph that we're going to choose to associate with this is always going to have the plus minus here that's representing that rich image. Okay, so it's just, I've just redid the same. Okay, so it's just I'm just redid the same calculation in the algebraic set. Okay, so any questions, Sabar? Why do we call it virginity? Why do you call it virginity? Well, what I'm doing is I'm forcing onto this story this X mapping between them. And I'm not allowing just any pair of polynomials. So if I were to say, if I didn't have an S2 there at all, I just have two points, the invariant I would associate. Points. The invariant I would associate to two points without an S2 between them would just be pairs of polygons. There'd be no constraint. I see. So this is not rigidity theory. This is the word that you're using. Just the word that I'm using to say I'm forcing onto my algebraic invariant this congruence modulo, this very complex, this additional condition. So, and I haven't given you anything about what that means co-logically. Colologically. All right, so at this point, I'm going to deviate for a moment to say some words about equivalent cohomology. And so I'm going to have to at least erase this, but we're going to come back to the goal to the climate even further in a moment. So I'm going to talk about equivalent cohomology, but just in a very basic way. Basic ways. So let me say something about the basic properties of equivariant cohomology. And they're kind of working properties. If your space is nice enough, it's kind of enough to compute it to know some things about it without actually knowing what it is. I'll tell you what it is as well. Okay, so we're going to be in the context where T is In the comics, where T is a connected abelian Lie group as before, and T is acting on X. All right, so the first thing to know about equivalent cohomology is that if I let T act on a point, so that necessarily is a trivial action, then the cohomology. Then the cohomology of that point is equal to z adjoint x1 through xn, where n is equal to the dimension of that torus. So in the case where t was one or c star, what we just did, we found that we just had one variable associated to the coal modular point, and that's the story that I'm telling you. This is a general version of that of the same. Okay. Okay, and let me just point out here that x1 through xn are actually a basis or identified, let me say, identified with the basis for the irreducible representations of T on a line C. Once we okay. And I want to just make one point about this because I did ask the organizers what people in this audience might know. And I think many of you haven't seen cohomology, but have seen homology. And, you know, cohomology and homology are dual theories. There are reasons to use cohomology for simplicity of definitions when you're dealing. But there are ways to start with homology, I think or anything, but I'm just starting out with cohomology. I've heard anything, but I'm just starting out with cohomology. But I wanted to point out something that in ordinary cohomology, the cohomology of point, which is like the homology, which is equal to the homology of the points, which say isomorphic, is actually just equal to Z itself. It's extraordinarily simple, and it's just Z, maybe I should even say Z when in degree zero and zero otherwise. Okay, so extraordinarily simple. So equivariant. So, equivariant cohomology is like super rich comparatively. Like, it's giving you an entire polynomial ring rather than just having Z itself. So, the second thing to know about equivariant cohomology is that it is a contravariant functor. So, what does that mean? That it means that if I have a map f from y to x, and maybe I'll write x to y, x to y, you get. Why you've got an induced mop that goes the other way. And in homology, you would see the same thing, but going the direction of this mouth. Now I just go the backwards direction. Now, one thing that kind of immediately comes out of point two is what happens when Y is a point. Is a point. So there's a crushing map. It's just the map that sends everything to a point. And that automatically induces a map, which is the cohomology of a point, which we just said is a polynomial ring, to the cohomology of X. And since this is a polynomial ring, what that means is that H means is that h t star of x is a module over the cohomology of a point well i'll just say over polynomials so studying modules over over the polynomial ring is is um you know kind of a useful way of saying that's what that htstar x is one of those and a second thing that comes out of this comes out of this naturality of the of induced maps. And I should actually say this map here needs to be T invariant or T equivariants T equivariant. All right so in other words it has to respect that group action on both X and Y. Okay so the second thing is that if Y is living inside of X is a T invariant subspace. Subspace, subspace of some type. Then, so we have an inclusion map, and that induces a map which goes the other direction, h t star of x going to h t star of y. And so, one of the things you might notice is you'd say, well, look, on the one hand, you have this. On the one hand, you have this crushing map that sends, like, for example, the two-sphere to a point, and that turns the cohomology of the two-sphere that we just described over here into a module over the cohomology of a point, which is just a module over zoin x. Clearly, this thing is a module over zoin x. But you can also say, well, you know, what about, what can I do about what happens if I just say, take the North Pole? Happens if I just say, take the North Pole and include it into S2. And that gives me a map the other direction. So if Y were just one point that lives inside of S2, then I'd get a map from the coal mode of S2 to a single point. And over here, that might look like, say, projecting to that first point. Okay, so there are this map exists here. And I'm going to just take one specific case and write X super. And write x super t to mean the set of points inside of x that have the property that t acting on p equals p for all t inside the torus. So these are points that are fixed by the whole of the torus. And if I let x be this, this lives inside of x. Should have written x star here. Okay. And so that induced. Okay, and so that induces a map I star which looks which sends the equivariant cohomology of X to the equivariant cohomology of the fixed point set. Okay, and so that map is going to play an important role for what we do here in this story. Okay, so great. Great. A couple more properties that I wanted to mention about aquabaric cohomology. And I think I'm still not getting my board space correct here, but I think maybe I'll move over here. And that should make it. No, I can't win. I think I can't win. Yeah, but I don't want to cover up what I say right after I say it. I was trying to avoid, but maybe that's the best. Sorry, but the camera doesn't cover the Doesn't cover the right half of the so I'll just stay there. Okay, so my apologies to those of you who are online who missed. Pardon. Okay, so a couple more properties of this, which is, um, see the third property. If T acting on X is a free Is a free action. What does that mean to be free? Good question of probably Americans who are just together. All right, what does T acting on X mean to be free? It means that if T acting on a point X is equal to the same point X, like if it fixes that point for any X. X in this or any t inside of here, then t is equal to the identity. Okay, that's what it means that there's nothing that fixes anything. Okay, that's what it means to have a free action. Okay, well, in that case, then the equivalent cohomology of x is equal to the ordinary cohomology of x mod t. So some of you may know if you. Some of you may know if you have a free action on, say, a smooth manifold, you can, it's a smooth reaction, and the quotient space itself is also a nice manifold. So, you can just sort of say this is a new topological space with a quotient topology. So that's a kind of particularly nice situation. And you might, as an example, if t is equal to s1 and x is also equal to s1, and the t acting on x is just On x is just rotation. So, in other words, if I do theta acting on alpha, I just get theta plus alpha, maybe modulo 2 pi. Okay, then that is a free action. And the S1 cohomology of S1 in that case is equal to the ordinary cohomology of a point, which we just said is just equal to z. So it's not very interesting. So, there's a kind of like weird thing in which some cases you get the cohomology of a point, which is incredibly rich. And in another case, you might say, well, you get the cohomology of a space with a free action, you get nothing out of it. So, it's kind of a strange, it's a strange kind of beast, economic cohomology. And Okay, and finally, we have, let me just, yeah, okay. So, all right. All right, so maybe I'll just give you a definition, which is just a very quick kind of what is it, because some of you may be interested to know what it is. And again, I'm just going to do it in the case of billion. So for t equals c star or s one, we'll just say what it is in this case. In this case, well, ET is going to be a contractible with a free T action. This space is actually defined up to homotopy. It's been defined in a lot of different ways. You can construct it a lot of different ways. But I'm just going to, you know, one way you might put it, if you did ES1, you could just think of it as S infinity with a certain. S infinity with a circle action that comes from looking at two n plus one living inside of two n plus three moving along like this and the standard x one action it goes on this and in the in the limit it's actually a free action and then t acts on the product x cross e t which is a diagonal action Which is a diagonal action. And that action is free. And the reason it's free is because it's free on the second term ratio. So the existence of Et is a non-trivial statement, but it does exist. In fact, it exists for lots of different groups. And you can think of it for ES1, just as S infinity. If T is isomorphic to S1, to the nth. is isomorphic to S1 to the nth power and Et can be written as again it's it's really only defined up the homotopy S infinity to the nth power okay so then you can define a new space which is X cross E T modulo T and I'm going to call that space X of T Actually, maybe I'd step in right here. The equivalent cohomology of X by definition is just the ordinary cohomology of X subt. Now, in general, this space X, X sub T, is an infinite dimensional space, so it's not like easy to play around with it. And it's one of the reasons that you would use cohomology instead of hop. That you would use cohomology instead of homology because, in homology, if I had a T-invariant subspace of X, then you'd want that, if Y is T invariant, you'd want Y cross E T mod T to be a subspace of X T, and it is, but only it's an infinite dimensional, but it has finite codimension. So if you want in homology, you'd like to say, well, if I had a sub-manifold, I'd like to create a homology class out of that sub-manifold. Create a homology class out of that submanifold. It's a very common thing, like with the simplicial construction, you might say, oh, make some kind of simplicial approximation to a subspace of the space that you're in, and that'll be my homology class I would associate. But you can't do that because it's infinite dimensional, but you do have finite co-dimension, so you can do it in cohomology. That's one reason you might use cohomology. Another reason to use cohomology is that it's a ring very naturally. Those of you who like chow homology might argue. you who like chow homology might argue that's got a ring structure too which is intersection and that's great it's just that's not usually the first homology people use so if you want to use homology instead of cohomology you can use like the realm more homology not the topic of this class but i i know this lecture but i wanted to sort of you know say uh not not ignore that fact okay so why did i want to actually tell you um what this is um What this is, there was a reason for it, which is that what we get out of this story is that X cross E T modulo T has a map down to Et mod T, which says just project onto the second coordinate. And the vibration of that map, there's a, this gives us a vibration, sorry. A this it gives us a fibration, sorry, and the fiber of that map is x. So, fiber is x, and so the inclusion of the fiber, let's call this inclusion map J. So, again, now we have J star. This space over here is XT on the right. So, J star induces a map, not an equivariant cohomology, but an ordinary cohomology. Cohomology, which sends the ordinary cohomology of Xt to the ordinary cohomology of X. But this is, of course, H star X T is the definition of H T star of X. So there's always a map that goes from ordinary, sorry, equivariant cohomology maps to ordinary cohomology. Ordinary cohomology, and one might call that a forgetful map, like you're forgetting the torus actions. But what I really want to emphasize about this is that this map can have all sorts of properties. And when the map is surjective, we say x is equivariantly formed. I'm going to put an asterisk here. The asterisk is that there are many definitions of equivalent formal that turn out to be the same for, I'm going to actually put in the star here and say they turn out to be the same over Q, but not necessarily over Z. So what I mean is, what are the coefficients that I use in this? It's kind of a subtle point. Is kind of a subtle point, so I'm not going to belabor that point here. But I will just say something, one more comment about right here. Another definition, which works over Z is that X is equivariantly formal. If the cohomology of X is a free module over the cohomology of a point. It's a slightly stronger statement that turns out to imply this one over here over Q. Okay, so this, the whole reason that I felt I needed. The whole reason that I felt I needed to actually define all of these things was in order to share with you what it is that we need to assume for the rest of the talk, which is that we will be using this formality property as part of like the underlying apparatus and the underlying kind of like information about our space. Even when we go to the place of like not having to actually understand anything about what cohomology is to actually. anything about what cohomology is to actually calculate it. Okay, so now I can give you some theorems that again are helpful for computational purposes. All right, so here's the first theorem. This is from maybe 1954 approximately and it kind of was buried for a very long time and these people Chang and Shelbred are often not cited for this but I'll just say For this, but I'll just say this: if X is equivariately formal, then the cohomology, the equivariant cohomology of X, mapping to, well, let me just say the, I'm gonna, let me write one. The inclusion of the fixed point set into X induces, as we said, it induces a map on cohomology, but it's actually that map is an injection. So, in other words, equivariant cohomology X injects into the equivalent cohomology of that fixed set. Now, that might seem like, okay, Now, that might seem like, okay, not a big deal. They said actually quite a lot more in their work, and I'm going to say a word about that in a moment. But what I want to kind of emphasize as you think about this theorem and why I care about it is that if X is just a set of isolated points, or maybe I'll just say finite number of points. Then, sorry, I don't have like a really good strong marker here. So, in that case, the equivalent cohomology of XT, the fixed point set, is just equal to the direct sum over every point in the fixed point set of the equivalent cohomology of a point. And as we know, the equivalent cohomology of a point is just a polynomial ring. Polynomial ring. So that tells us that we get the direct sum over all p inside of xt, one polynomial ring for every single fixed point. And this injection here comes from knowing that the single important thing, that x, is equivariantly formal. So example space is not equivariantly formal if you have a free action. You'll never have fixed points, no fixed points of free action. So this kind of Terms of free action, so this kind of story would be absolutely impossible, right? But the sphere, for example, with its two fixed points, it is equilibrium, and that inclusion induces this injection. Over here on the right, we would just have polynomials associated to each of the two fixed points. The inclusion that we found was that we have additional condition that the two polynomials have to agree modulo the variable x. Okay, so what in fact, just a slightly stronger statement, again, for maybe a little bit more for the experts in the room, and then I will kind of go back to the graphs, which is that if you let X1 equal to the one skeleton, which is equal to the union of fixed points. And one-dimensional orbits. Then, so this is like a little bit more than the fixed point set, then the cohomology of this, sort of, yeah, also maps to the cohomology of the fixed point set, and it has the same image. As the cohomology of X. So, this is the theorem continued. This is part of their theorem. And furthermore, they actually said what that image is. And this is the important part here. And let me just stop for a moment to say, okay, so what we found is that if I have a space X, which is equivalently formal, in order to understand its cohomology, Understand its cohomology, I need to understand direct sum of polynomials, which is a pretty easy ring. But to say, well, I still might have an injection, but I don't know what the image of that injection is. And the second statement here is saying the image of the injection is just saying, what's the image of the one skeleton's cohomology? Now, the one skeleton's cohomology is much simpler. In the case that we just did, which was a two-sphere, that the union. Sphere, that the union of the fixed points and the one-dimensional orbits is a whole space, so it's not very interesting, doesn't give us anything new. But we will see shortly, it gives us quite a lot of new space once we up the dimension. So, in particular, in the case that we're going to be interested in, these one-dimensional events will be maximally two dimensions. So that's real dimensions, or maximally one complex dimension for each connected component. Okay. So they also describe the image of that ring, but I'm not going to go into that. Ring, but I'm not going to go into that because what I want to do is now tell you a little bit about hand theory in the last couple minutes of the talk. All right, so all of that setup was giving us room for the following definitions. So X, maybe I'll say the T acting on X is a GKM space. If X T is, well, yeah, I'll say, maybe I'll just put it here. X is complex, projective, smooth, complex, projective variety, or it is a smooth compact. Um, compact manifold and uh t is isomorphic to C star to the n in this case or s1 to the n in that case over there. And it's isomorphic to me. I might have to choose a basis to do that, but okay. And I'm going to make the additional condition that um That for any, this is maybe I'm going to, yeah, I'll put it here. Okay. On the case where we're in the complex variety case, let's move compact case right over here. So t has finitely many one-dimensional, one-complex dimensional orbits. Orbits and over here, I will say that the dimension of a connected component of the fixed point set for any, I'm going to call this K, X K is less than or equal to 2 for any codimension. One K sub torus and for both of them I'm going to have X X equivariant a form so in both cases okay so that's the setup of what it means to be a GPM space and so finally we can make a statement A statement, which is what was popularized by Grantsky, Kotlitz, and McPherson in, I'd say, 1996, 98, maybe. So there's like many different versions of this. I'd say they really did the complex version, which is point out, well, this Chang-Salvet theorem, which, as I said, also specifies the image over here, tells us what to do when we have these additional conditions. When we have these additional conditions where the orbits that we're talking about in the one skeleton are kind of controlled. So that's what I did with DKM spaces. I insisted that the orbits, like sort of, there weren't too many of them. Okay, so let T act on X be a GKM space. Then image. Image of this inclusion here is given by. Okay, so that's my defender because I need to tell you first how to associate a graph. And I will try to go see the fast with you this. Okay, so that'd be like two gold four. I'd like I like, you know, whatever we'll already find is to associate a labeled graph to the t-action on X. And this is what we're going to do. B are going to be vertices and E are going to be, sorry, the fixed point set. E will be edges. E will be edges, PQ, where P and Q are in the fixed point set. And there exists some two-sphere, S2, containing P and Q. So it should be an invariant subspace together. Together with the weight plus or minus alpha, as I described before. Okay, if you wanted to do this with, if you wanted to do this with a complex action here, you would just do exactly the same thing that we did with changing from S2 to CP1 as we did earlier. Okay, and so then we label the end. The edge PQ with the weight plus or minus alpha. Okay, so that is the weight of the action on the tangent space at P of that sphere. Okay, so the idea that you might worry about where you might have more than one two-spared. Have more than one two-squared that's containing the same two points is taken away by the condition of being GKM. Even more so, let me just say this. If P and Q prime is also in the edge set, and Q prime does not equal to Q, then the label will be different. And that comes from that GKM assumption. That GKM assumption that I need. Okay, so now it allows me to just tell you what the actual image is. Going back over here, so we know that this guy right here, since we're in isolated fixed points, this is the direct sum of p inside of xt of the cohomology of a point. And so that's a bunch of polynomial rings, one polynomial ring for each fixed point. polynomial ring for each fixed point. And the image, the image is given by, let's suppose we have L fixed points. We just assume that Fi minus Fj is equal to some as well as in the ideal generated by the weight alpha ij. Hopefully they can see. I'll try not to go past this line here. I would try not to go past this line here where alpha ij, sorry, I should say whenever whenever there's a two-sphere in that graph, or when maybe I should say actually whenever there's an edge PQ with label alpha I actually think. I should say P I PJ. P I P J. Okay, it looks like you've got Fij. So, in other words, the constraint that we put on the system is exactly what we did with the very simple case of a single two-sphere. And we say that whenever you've got a two-sphere, we want these polynomials to agree modulo that corresponding weight. So, my time is super up. So, I'm not going to give you any full examples, but I would just say that the idea of GKM theory is to say, idea of GKM theory is to say, okay, how can we associate these polynomials that agree in these particular ways, which I presume are part of what slides are all about. And that kind of story is enormously powerful for actually computing the equivalent colology. So I'll stop there if I have the time. Thank you. Thanks for the interesting talk. Thanks for the interesting talk. We have time for one or two questions. No questions. Perhaps you could give us a little more examples during the opening problem session. Yeah. It would be really interesting to see some as well. Yes, we'd be happy to do that. Okay. Other questions? Further questions?
