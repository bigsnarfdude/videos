So it's a pleasure and an honor for me to introduce Jun Cheng Wei from UBC. He will give us a lecture on singularity formation in geometric flows. And so your talk will be And so your talk will be 15 minutes talk. Thank you. And I want to thank the organizers for inviting me to give me the honor to speak at this excellent conference. And so today I'm going to talk about single-developed formations in some geometric flow. So Professor Gang Tian talked about the Ricci flow. Professor Xin Wanxu talked about the Gauss curvature. Xin Wan Shi talk about the Gauss capture flow. And today I'm going to talk about another two classical flow problems: harmony mind flow and the young mills. So let me first talk about the harmony mic flow. So I was going to discuss the symphony's harmony micro, which is from a two-dimensional domain to S2. So U is a unit S. So this is a pipe. Yes. So this is a pi-bordical flow for the differential energy function. And this is a differential energy function as a conformity environment. So just to say that this is related to this meeting. And the conformography in DV2 is not compact. So you may expect some singularity. So this is what I'm going to discuss today, the singularity formation. So the general harmony might flow. So the general harmonic micro between two manifolds M and N, this has been studied in the last century from the 60s. Many, many results I will not talk about. I'm going to just discuss the simplest special case. So when the domain M is, when M is one, it's in the domain R2 and N is S2. So this is a harmonic mic flow to two spheres. To two spheres. And one of the motivations for me to study this kind of flow is many applications, not just geometry, but in many applications in physics, like nematic liquid crystal flow and also non-down nucleus. So recently we take this problem with Professor Fang Huanin and Songyu Wang and studied this. And study this using the Hamlet mic flow and to study the numerical nickel crystal flow. And this is a very interesting system between Afstokus and the Hamlet microflow. So another modification is a Nanda Nifs gauge. And this is a kind of interpolation between the Sch√∂dinger mic and Hanwell mic. So this is also quite an interesting system. Okay, so let me. Okay, so let me discuss the general existence result, which is a well-known classical result. And so for this equation, from OMGA to S2, the local existence by Yeltsin Sampson in 1964. And for global existence, Sachs and Unberg initiate the existence of global weak solutions and the steward. And the shoe complete for the harmony mic flow. So, let me discuss the sui solution because later I'm going to say how, okay, we our solutions. Okay. So, the sun solution is the sun's idea is the following. Suppose you have some approximate initial and boundary data. So, you have a weak solution in except In except some finite number of single singular points, okay. Now, the question is: how do we deal with the singular point? So, with idea is that if you have just a single normal time, then you can extract a harmonic two-sphere with a bubble. And the true solution is just simply just abandon the bubble. Okay, just zoom away the bubble and continue the flow. Bubble and continue the flow. So the stew solution is energy decreasing. And so the bubble is just a takeaway. And further we prove that in 95, there's two solutions unique in the class of non-increasing energy solutions. And Fang Huanin and San Yu Wang in 2010 gave a new proof, a simple new proof. So, what happened to the block? Okay, so we know that u is one, absolute value u is one. So, the block only happens when the gradient is infinity. And so in the last century, 90s, there are many, many results and many, many deep results on this on the harmony energy identity in the barber tree. Identity and the Barber tree convergence, and so on, and the Barber convergence for blocking finite time and infinite time. So, I want to mention the fundamental work by Qingjie and Gang Tian in 95. And they started detailed quantitative analysis for this bubble tree convergence. And so, basically, what happened is as TN, as you approach it. T n as you approach the block of time. So your solution will be we approach to k bubbles and then there's a background state, u infinity. Now what are these bubbles? So these bubbles are a scale, a scaled harmony maps, okay, stationary honeymaps. And you can also prove the energy identity. So the energy is the bybound state and the problem. Is the bibond state and the plus the K-homniomite. So, this is a general description of blob. And the question I want to study today, what about the existence? Can we construct such examples of Barbara solutions? So, the first existence of a Barbara solution was due to Zhang Qin Jing Yu and the Yevgang in 1991. In 1991, and they consider the boundary value problem of a so-called one-corruptational harmonic map. So, you take a medium-symmetric harmonic map, and then this becomes a scalar equation, a very simple and the scalar equation. And then you adjust the boundary condition. And what they prove is if the boundary data is small, the solution exists globally. Exists globally, and if a boundary condition is large, then the solution blows up. So the proof is very beautiful and it's based on the shift solution. But the only problem is you don't know the nature of the blob. You don't know what is the blob rate and so. And Rafa and Schur in 2013, they give a new construction proof, but not for the boundary value problem. For the boundary value problem, and I don't think the method works for the boundary value problem. They construct for the Cauchy problem, right? They consider the problem in the whole space, not from B1 to S2, but from R2 to S2. So, and for the Cauchy problem, and they construct a graph solution with the precise graph rate, which is the log square over T minus T. Again, this is a scalar problem. This is a scanner problem. And this is an OD scanner problem. So, the question I want to ask today is what about the general domains and the non-video data? What about the general case? Because all these results depend on the video symmetry, depend on the video symmetry. So, let me introduce our result. Let's suppose we have Let's suppose we have this energy stationary Harvey map. And in fact, you can write down this explicitly. And this is the Harlem map at the infinity. And so this Harmony map has six environments. So you have a scale environment, you have a translation environments, and you have a rotation environment. And for the rotation environments, you have three. Environments you have three because you can rotate the X and Y and the Z. Okay, so you have three rotations and the two translations and one scaling. So these are the six parameter of functions. So this is my first result I'm to discuss. So this is a joint work with Juan Davena and Amanda De Pino, appeared this year. And the mando dipino appeared this year, last year. Sorry, so the result is the following: suppose we have a time, you fix the time, time is fixed, and the fix the points. So the point, k points are fixed. Then you can construct initial conditions and the boundary conditions to the harmony mic flow such that the solution blows up exactly at this key point you prescribe. You prescribe. Okay. And exactly is like what I described, what Qingjia and Gangtian described in the paper. This is decomposition. Your solution is a background state plus the bubble. And you have six parameters. So the main, the block happens for the number for scaling parameters, scanning panel will be T minus C over Lock score. And then the others I and The others will go to some constant. And moreover, we show that this block is stable. It's kind of stable. It's kind of a coordination case stable. So if you just have one block, it's coordination one stable. So except for one dimension, there's a coordination. All other dimensions, you have a stability. The block is kind of stable. So, this result, the solution in this first stem are classical in from zero to t. So, the next result concerns continuation of the solution of a block and the spontaneous block. So, this we call a steward. The story solution constructs a global H1 weak solution by dropping the bubble. Okay, so once you have a bubble, you just drop, just continue. You just drop, just continue the flow. But when you do this, you change the topology of your solution. So, Topin in 2004 in the Einste paper showed a different way to construct a continuation, but for the symmetrical case, for the one quotation class, you can, once you have blocked, you have a bubble, you can attach another bubble after the block. And so this kind of surgery will preserve the whole. Of surgery will preserve the homotopy class of the mic. And in the geodel case, without any symmetry, and we can also do this, and this is the second theorem in the paper. So suppose that UQ be the solution we constructed in the first theorem, then we can continue this solution as a H1 weak solution. H as a H1 weak solution. And this solution, what this solution looks like is that when T less than capital T, the solution blows up like log square over T minus T. But when T greater than T, so you have a reverse bubble. And the block rate is naught T minus capital T square over T minus capital T. So for t less than t, you have a block, for t greater than t, you have another block. And so, so this blob is like you continue this block, okay? And this is a continuation of the bubble. And the third result in the paper, we construct the so-called spontaneous bubble. So, this is also another interesting phenomenon. So, what happened is initially you have no bubble from T less than capital T, the solution is smooth. It's C2, infinite C infinity. But then, immediately, when T greater than capital T, and you have a bubble. So, is the bubble just appeared spontaneously, just appeared in the. Just appeared in the in at the capon spontaneous. So, this is called a spontaneous bubble. And you see that for spontaneous bubble, the generic rate is a little bit different. It's not log square. It's not, it's just one log. And this is general. This is general. So we have discussed this three kinds of property and this forward property and continuation. And continuation, refresh bubbling, continuation bubbling, and the spontaneous bubbling. So this means that you have lots of weak solutions. You have a non-uniqueness of weak solutions. You have infinitely many weak solutions, globally weak solutions, because you can just, at any time, you can just attach a new bubble for the flow. Bubble for the flow at any time, and you have a new bubble. And or you can continue the once you have a bubble, you can also continue the bubble. So you have infinite many weak solutions. So Jewish solution is unique only in the class of energy decreasing functions. But if you don't require the solution to have energy decrease, you have infinite many weaknesses. You have an infinite many weak solutions for any initial condition. You can get infinitely weak solutions. So, let me discuss the Bolabo mechanism and understand the Zhang Ding Ye result. How we understand Zhang Din Ye result. So, let me discuss. So let me discuss this in the one-barber case. So the main part of the solution is given by the six parameter of families, which is the Barbony, the W, and you have six parameter. And then you have some outside noise. You have some initial conditions or boundary conditions will give you some noise. So the blob is. That so the blob is an interaction between this noise and the bubble. Okay, so this code C1C2 are the tangent space. And so this star is the outer noise. So what is the outer noise? They satisfy the heat equation, okay, with some initial conditions and some boundary conditions, just a linear heat equation. And the out will require the outer noise. require the outer noise to satisfy the following condition. So outer noise must at the developer point at the block time equals zero. And the gradient is non-singular. So this is a generic condition. But this condition is the k condition. It's the divergent should be positive. Diversion of this star. Of this star at this, at the blubber point, at the black time should be positive. And so we have six parameters, right? So the trajectory, so the location, right, is graph is determined, basically, basically follow the outer noise. So the location is just OD, just follows the outer noise. Folllows the outer noise. Now, the skinny planter, this is and also, and what's the rotation in the C-axis? This certify a non-local OD. It's very non-local OD. And this non-local ODE will give you the bluff rate. This is the non-local OD give you bluff rate. And we discuss this non-load local ODE later. And these two conditions. And these two conditions, the divergence positive, seems to be necessary for Bolab. Now, this condition, in fact, is the generalized zhang-year condition in the general domains. So, let me discuss why this one is the generalized zhang-year condition. Okay, so this condition, if we restrict this condition to X symmetric, okay, to riddle symmetric, to one quotation of symmetric case. And this condition will be equivalent to this, will be the derivative at the At the derivative at zero should be positive. Okay, now, since our time is very small, okay, so this condition implies that the boundary data will be greater pi. And this exactly, this is the condition where this is a zounding year condition or regional condition. So, in some sense, our Boliva mechanism recovers the zounding year condition in the genotomain. In the general domain. So let me just summarize the blob mechanism. So the blob is generally a bubble plus some noise. And this noise satisfy the generalized sounding year condition. And with this, then you have a blob. So that's why the blob is kind of stable. It's coordination one stable. So what is the What is the main idea of the proof? So the proof is in the outer green. So this is an in-outer green method has been successfully used in many non-linear difficult equations. But to apply this in the outer green to pybolic, and this is this. This kind of green method are developed in these two papers. One is the Kataza, Dapina, and Muso for the energy-critical heat equation. And another one is Davena and Dapina myself for the Hamilton microflow. So, what is the key idea of the in-outer group? The in-outer GUI is to zoom in the concentration region and decouple the whole. And decoupled the whole nonlinear problem to a inner problem, which is only solved near the concentration and captures the essential information of the singularity and the outer problem, which is solved in the whole space and sums all global and external effects. So, let me explain this in the one bubble case. So, suppose we are looking for a bubble. For a barbarous solution to the Harbour Microflow, which is like this. So, at the main order, the first approximation will be the bubbly, the bubble, the degree one solution, and the plus some noise. And we need to choose these six parameters to deal with elements of the kernel. Okay, so the idea is very simple. So we have the approximate solution, and we can add the linear perturbation, add a perturbation. And so we solve the linear operator. Okay, like, and this is a, we, this is a problem we need to solve. We solve for the this linear operator. We want to get a solution which five, which is small. So this is a very simple idea. Very simple idea, but the main problem is how to solve this in linearized operator. So we solve this innovative operator by the inner outer group. So what do you do? You look for a solution which look for a solution which consists of the inner solution, the inner part, and the outer part. So what is the inner part? So the phi solves the inner problem. five solves the inner problem and this only solves in a very small very uh uh small region near the bottom and the and the small region is is like uh it is measured by the r times lambda okay but r is large but the lambda is small okay and the precise solves the outer problem so and then you have to choose the uh the cut of uh approach The cutoff approximating. So both equations form a non-linear piper system. So let's look at the inner problem. So inner problem, basically you linearize the Hamilton mic, stationary human mic. And the outer problem, you just solve a heat equation. But the important thing is that the outer problem enters into the inner problem by The inner problem by this Schrodinger potential, and the inner problem enter into the outer problem by this couple. Okay, so okay, this is very simple, very trivial. Okay, now the question is, how to close the loop, okay? So, the problem is you need to show the inner problem is small, okay. Small okay in the outer problem, so you need to show that the five the inner problem is small in the cutoff region. So what you need to do is to solve to find a inner solution which has both fast space decay and the time decay. So let's look at the inner problem. So if for the inner problem we use the inner problem For the inner problem, we use the inner variables and in y and tau, and so and so in the inner variables, the Pokesm solution becomes like a W. And the inner equation is just an innerized problem for around the station recovery mic. Okay, so for the green to work, for the in-out. Green to work for the inner outer group to work. So we need to find an inner solution which has fast space decay and a fast time decay. Okay, so let's take a model problem. The model problem is a heat equation linear and with some shorting of potential. And this will be our model problem. And suppose my right-hand side. My right-hand side has some time decay and has some space decay. And the question is: can we find a solution with fast decay in both space and time? Now, if this is elliptic, right, if this you don't have phi at all, okay, if this equals zero. And for the elliptic, you can do this by using freedom, right? There's a freedom you add some. A freedom, you add some you need some orthogonal condition, but for private problem, we don't have freedom theory, right? We don't have freedom theory. And so the in-out green, so that we developed is kind of provide a freedom theory for the hybrid problem. So, but our problem is worse than this. So the two So there are two additional difficulties. First, the area is quite a slow decay. It's not even L2. And this is really a big problem. And the second difficulty is the kernel, which is the solution for the linearizer operator. And all this kernel are not in L2. So you cannot talk about the author. So, you cannot talk about the orthogonal condition. So, you cannot talk about the energy using the L2. So, how do we overcome these two difficulties? For the first difficulty, slow decay error. So, you just, how do you see the slow decay error? So, the slow decarron from the WT. So, if you compute the WT. Now, remember, W. Now remember, w is like what are one, okay, in the harmonic map. W is what a one. So when you compute this, you only get like a one of r and one of r and and is not in L2. So to overcome this difficulty, and we have to correct it with some over time, and we have solved a heat equation and use the Duhamer formula and solve the heavy equation by some. The Heavy equation by some self-similar form, and using this, you can get rid of the slow decay error. So we add this term to the initial approximation. So the initial approximation will be the bubble plus the noise plus the global term. Now, so our blob rate will be an interaction between the noise and the global defined term. Under the global defunder term. And the second difficulty is the Ninver Swarf theta. They only have a slow decay candle. So let's look at the Ninver Swarf theta L around the harmony mic, stationary harmony mic. So it has six dimension kernels and you have a kernel in motor cells. So in the tangent space, you can decompose the problem in tangent. Uh, the problem in tangents in mode, you have mode zero, we have two kernels: one corresponds to scaling, another correspond to rotation, but they only decay like a one of R. And we have two translations, and these translations, they decay like a one of R square, which is L two. And then we have two kernels, these are rotations X and Y, and they're only bounded, okay? And they're only bounded. These two kinds are bounded. So, for each of these modes, we need a freedom theory. We need to see how we can find a solution to the linearized operator for the pi bonic problem, which has both time decay and a space decay. So, let's look at freedom theory for the pybonic. So, this is kind of freedom theory for the pybonic. So for the mode one, which is correspondent translation modes, and we do have the freedom theory, and we don't lose anything. And as long as the ostraconic condition is solved, and you have the right freedom theory. So you have the right time decay, the right spatial decay. And the reason is that the kernel is in L2. So you can use some kind of L2 server. Use some kind of electron shape. And so to prove this, you use block analysis and then you will type theorems. So after the shootable block, and you get two possible, you get entire Asian solution. The first block, you get the Asian solution for the linearizer operator. And you need to classify the Asian solution for the linearizer operator. And the second block is the you You get a debit equation, which is the Asian solution for the heat equation. But this Asian solution for the heat equation will have some singularity. And you need to have a removal of a singularity for Asian solution for the heat equation. So this is how we get the freedom state for the linear pi button problem. So this is a good case. This is a good case. This is a good case. The translation modes are a good case. The most difficult case is the scaling. Okay. Now, this is a, so even with the orthogandic condition, and what we found is you can find a solution, but this solution will be extremely bright inside the domain. But decays at the boundary, the boundary which is like R. So, and so this kind of solution is quite interesting because this somehow is deteriorating in the inside, but it's good near the boundary. And exactly because of the decay near the boundary, and we Near the boundary, and we can you we can have the in the outer group because for the in the outer group we just need the solution near the boundary near the boundary near the R. So the existence and the construction is quite complicated for this mode zero case. So finally, let me discuss the equation for lambda. So, and basically this is the equation for lambda, which is quite non-local. Is quite non-local. And so there's no way you can solve this use of ODE. So this proof, even just for this simple ODE, we need many pages to prove, more than 30 pages just to construct the solution. So basically, what we can show that for this long-local ODE, For this non-local ODE, generically, the solution is given by this water by t minus t over log squared. But you may have other solutions. Okay, those are the generic generic case, but non-generic. So generically, you get that the black rate is a T-manity of Fandoka squared. So that's why we can say that generically, the Blap rate is this, is a T-manity of Vandoka squared. Is the T minus T of a local square? So, this is the forward bubble case. And for the reverse bubbly, you also get a non-local OD, but because the reverse Bobby, the continuation of a bobbinic, so you get an OD, which you can solve for both S-nascent and S-grading. And for spontaneous bubbling, and this is the non-local OD. And for this, you get the generic rate, which is log over T minus T. So this is Harmony MyFlow. I will discuss two applications, two extensions of the Harmon MyFlow. One is the Harmon flow with free boundary. Another one is the Hammer MyFlow. Another one is a harmonic mic flow, half harmony mic flow. So the harmonic mic flow with boundary is a harmonic flow, but you assume that U is nice in a submanifold of N. And so you have this kind of lower boundary condition on the boundary. So, and Shen Yu Mei and the Niu Van Huaji constructed. And the new values constructed in 1998 many Bolafer examples in high dimensions for this harmonic flow with boundary. And also, they also except a Bolafer theorem. But in low dimensions, they ask the following question. Suppose M is just R2, N is Rn, and the sigma is a smooth compact sub-manifold Rn. And I find a template. Uh, I find a time block. So we consider the simplest case, which is m is R2 plus, and the sigma is S1, and A is R2. So this is the simplest, the Harmony flow with free boundary. So this is a heat equation in R2 plus. And on the boundary, we have this condition. So U is in S1. Is in S1. So this is simple harmonic mic flow with the boundary. And the station resolution is nothing but the so-called half-harmony map, stationary half-harmony map. This is just an extension of the half-harmony map. And you can classify all such solutions, but we just need. Solutions, but we just need to debug one half-harmon mark, which is just which is written very explicitly like this. And we have these rotations and so on. So with the Yanix Zero and Jung Chen Zin, and we can for this half harmony mic, okay, for the Hammer mic with free boundary, and we show that we also have a finite employer and the block. Block and the block rate is like a humbling is t minus t of an ox square, even though this is one dimensionless. Okay, this problem is one dimensionless, but we get the same blob rate. Now, so you may wonder what happened to the half-harmon flow. So, if you look at the half-harmony flow, and we have the this way, this is the lowest harmonic mic flow with quite a The Hammered Mike flow with critical scaling. This is R1 to S1, which is u t equals equals the half Hammer mile. So the equation form between is a half, if you look at harmonic extension, so this is a harmonic extension, but the UT is downstairs, not upstairs. That's the only difference. Now, for this problem, what we showed What we showed, there are many, many research on the so-called half-harmes, and this related to the minimum surface with free boundary. I will not discuss this. So the question is, do we still have finite improvement for half harmony mic flow? And interesting, what we prove with Yannik Sera and Jung Chen Sen is that for the half harmony. Is that for the half hundred mile, instead, we have infinite templar. We don't have finite template. So we construct a infinite template. And also our construction suggests that for half Hamlet map, we don't have a finite time block. We should have an infinite time block. So this is a very interesting because some Very interesting because somehow that it's the same problem. You get the same steady state. But for the first problem, your UT is upstairs. You get a finite temporarily. And for second problem, there's a UT here. Your UT is downstairs and you get the infinite temporarily. So this and both, you know, they have the same stationery, but they. But they have different singularity formation. This one has a finite temperature, but this one has an infinite temperature. So in the final 10 minutes, I will discuss some of our new results on Yamuse and its heat flow. So the Yamus heat flow is The Yamis Peter flow is a well-known equation. And so it's a gradient of the so-called Yamius functional. And Twarbs and 1982 established the MOS theory for the Yamius. And Wang Hong Yu in 1991 proved the existence of a non-minimum solution to the Yamus. Of a long-minimum solution to the Yamulus. And the Gantian, Professor Gantian, in 2000 proved that the bluff set for the Yamulus is H is M minus 4 rectifiable. And he also proved the energy density identity for the limit. And so this will be like M minus 4 on minimum surface. And Tao and Chen, they prove that if the limit connection is admissible, then it's like you have a general minimum surface of m minus four dimension. And recently, Nabo and Fotoro in 2019, they showed that the energy density can be computed explicitly as a sum of the As a sum of the bubbly energy. So they have kind of energy identities. Now, in dimension not equal to four and the rate and the proof of the Godob exists for dimension two and three. And in dimension n greater than four, you have finite ant block. And this is a by NAIDO in 94. So the critical dimension is a dimension four. So in dimension four, So, in dimension four, Shui proved the global weak solution with finitely many bond singularities and eigen logitals harmony by flow in dimension two. And Shanata in 97 gave exact formulation and the proof of the block analysis and the long-time behavior of a Yamis flow by Shuwei. And this also isyntotic behavior and the structure of single set by Hong. By Hong Hominshen and Gangtin in 2004. So, in division four, and Shanata proved the global existence for small data. And recently, there's a very nice result by Walton. And we are motivated by his result. And he proved GNOVO well positive for any initial data for the MBSO flow. So you don't have finite time block for Yamius flow. If you want to look for singularity formation, the block is infinity at infinity. So the question we want to answer is what about the long-time behavior of the youngest heat flow in dimension four? And so Shinata and Shuwe in 1998 showed the Yami's heat flow in SO. Yamin's heat flow in SO4 eco-fire case, which is like a regional special case. They prove the global existence for all time for any initial and the boundary data by using the shop and the subsolution method as in the two-dimensional harmonic microflow. And the infant time barbony for the SO4 equal variant case, this has been proved. This has been proved by Warden's thesis, Peach's thesis in Canumbia. I don't know, not in ETH. So this is the first infant time bubble for the Yambios flow, but in the equivalent case, in the video symmetric case. So in the video symmetric case, there are also some results. Some results by Gortowski and Chatar. They point out the Yamvius heat flow in Division 4 behave similarly to degree 2 hominemi. Like degree 2 harmony. So this is a degree M hominimi. And this degree, this is the Yamuels, the equal five and Yamius. And when M equals two, And when m equals two, and these two equations are almost identical. So, and uh, and uh, so so, because of this connection, and uh in dimension two, uh we also construct an infantine block with uh one davana and uh the pedo and uh and young chen sen for for degree two harmony mic. So so then we can construct the infant temple up. Construct the infant templar for the young mule's cater flow without the equivalent in the general case, okay, without the ecovirant SSO4 condition. So let me first introduce some notations. So for R4, for Yamius, it's important to use the quotania and the Nie algebra. algebra and so what is the what is like like a station harvard map so the station hard map in the young corresponding in the yamus is called a bpst adhm instance and these are the uh matrices uh given by this by this uh express this called an insult instance okay and this is a non-trivial self-dual incidence uh with the principal uh bound Principal bundle SU2 and so the corresponding this is the A and this is the curvature. So this will be our like our stationary Hubble map and this will be our basic profile okay for infinite time for all so we can write down the this write down this in four dimensions explicitly Explicitly. So, based on this solution, so there's a family of YAMUs with the five parameters. These are the four translations and one screening. So, Atia and the H and the Senga, they prove that these are the only solutions, modern gauge. So, with Yannick Sero and Yung. With Yadix Sero and Jung Chen Xin, and we can prove the infant temperature without any symmetry, okay, for this general case for any point in our form, and we can find the initial data and smooth function A and lambda. And we found a infant temperature for the Yambi scattered flow, and the lambda goes the Goes the dilation parameter lambda decay to zero exponential. So our solution is in the video symmetric case is like a solution in the Shanata and Shui case. So you can also have a bubble towel. So, you can also have a bubble towel. So, for bubble towel, this is not even known for the ecovirner case. So, the bubble tower, so you can have two bubbles. They are patching that at the same place, almost at the same place, but with a different bluff rate. And one is e to the minus t, another one is e to the minus e to the t, which is extremely small. Which is extremely small, okay. So, uh, this is the barber tower for the young mules, and this is new even in the X in the region symmetrical case. So, so what is the how do we construct the solution for the Yambius? How do we apply the in the outer GUI for Yambius heat flow? So, what is the main problem for the So, what is the main problem for the Yamius? The main difficulty for Yamil's hit flow. The main difficulty is the gauge. This everyone knows, the problem is the gauge. Because of the gauge environments of the Yamius equation, so the inner outer equation are not parabolic unless we choose a proper gauge. So, in the time-independent case, if we look at the Yamius equation. Case, if you look at the Yamius equation around the incident, if you look at the Linux operator, this operator is not elliptic. This Linux operator is not elliptic. So, and it's elliptic only and certain gauge, like a conumber gauge. So, how do we overcome this problem? How do we, okay? So, the key idea. So, the key idea, okay. So, this is the answers. Okay, uh, we uh uh so we we have to uh because of the gauge, we have to include not only the translation parameter, the scaling parameter, also include the rotation parameter. And this rotation parameter comes from the gauge, okay? And so we also need to find the dynamic for the rotation parameters as well, okay. Parameters as well. And so, this is the approximate solution. And the key idea to use the Donaldson detector trick. And this is like the corresponding Wunerberg gauge in the pipeline case. And this is discovered by Donaldson and Stuart. By Donaldson and Stewie in 1994. And so if we use this tech trick, and then the problem will become egyptic and the universal operator will become egyptic. And we compute all the kernels. And this is the dynamics. The scanning parameter solves a linear equation. And the translation solves just ODE. I just ODE and the rotation, the gauge, solve another ODE. There's a gate equation for the gauge. And with this, and then you can use the apply the in the outer green to the amuse. So I think my time is up and okay, I think I'm done now. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you very much. From the audience, are there questions? May I ask you that K stable condition? What you say is code I mean K stable condition. Yeah, so code dimension K means that except the rotation around the C. And in the rotation around C, if you start with a rotation. With a rotation C0, and the blob may not get zero. Okay, so this is instability. The rotation around the C is instability. And all the other directions, they are stable. So except for one direction, there's a rotation around the C. For easy points, it's only one direction, you mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So you can always choose the giving, just say k equal to one case. If you choose, you can use the rotation that's always a blow-up, finite time blow up. No, no, you can. If the rotation equals that value, the value is given. It's okay. You only have one value of rotation, which gives you a block. Which gives you a block, and all other values will not give you a block. Yeah, okay, that's why. Okay, thanks. Any other question? May I ask one? Yeah. I wanted to ask whether for harmonic maps, can you have also blow up with the higher degrees? Bubble? Oh, yeah. In the degree two, yeah, we have with bubble over bubble. Yeah, bubble over bubble. Yeah. Yeah, bubble over bubble. Yeah. Yeah. So bubble over bubble do occur. Yeah, no, okay. In degree two. In degree two, you get a bubble tower. And yeah, but can you have a blow up with a profile of a degree two or higher bubble? You mean what you mean? Finite temperatures or infinite template? Yeah, whatever. But in this case, the two bundles are separate. In this case, the two bubbles are separating in scales, I guess. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm asking whether you can get profiles with really a higher-degree bubble after rescaling. Yeah, you do, yeah. You get a, but this will be infinite ample. Okay. Yeah, you don't get a finite time block. Only degree one you have a finite time block. Okay, thanks. Okay, thanks. Okay, okay. Any other comments and question? So for this lecture, we actually need a course to understand the whole material. One is not enough. Okay.
