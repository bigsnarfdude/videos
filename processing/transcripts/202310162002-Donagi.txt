was that you wanted me to say something about the duality of coefficient systems, which will be the basis apparently for several of the parts that will follow. So let me try to do that. So the Hitching system starts with cos C and the group G, which you can take to be GLAN. You can take the BGLN without much loss. I guess the official version is supposed to be a reductive version. So we're considering V, which are principal G bundles. In the case that G of G of N, this just means lack and vector ones. So if you're not familiar with the group theory, you could just focus on this case. The Higgs bundle is a pair of V and phi, where V is a vector bundle, a principle G bundle. And phi is what's called the Higgs field, which my physicists tell me is the table is normal. But the name has become standardized in mathematics. It's a global section oversea. Of the C of the adjunct bundle value in the canonical buckle of C. So in the case of J L it just means map from V 12 to V tensor K C sorry enough V and V tensor K C So there are various versions and colors of this stuff. You can define this to be a stack or as a moduli space using a notion of stability that allows you to use geophysical variant theory. Some versions emphasis on it being rubbish or something else. So there are various possibilities. Possibilities that a prone network emphasizes much, but when it becomes important, I'll tell you which one I'm working on. So we'll call this thing kill XF C and G status case of all these fields, all these bundles. All X bundles on a given C for the co-given model. And similarly, there's another object, Bund, C, which classifies just the bundles without the Hayes fields. And again, you have a stack and a multiplayer space and so on. And the relation between them is that a cotangent vector to burn The cotangent vector to burn is given exactly by a phi that's all by elementary deformation theory. So the cotangent space of bun is contained in Higgs. If you're working at the stacky level, this is actually an inequality. The Higgs stack is the containment button to the button, to the stack of buttons. Of bundles. If you are working with the geometric invariant object, they differ, you only have an inclusion. The reason is that the stability condition that you use to define bundles has to do with all bundles. You need to have slope less than or equal to something. While when you're working on the so that's when you're working on the button side, on the Higgs side, you're looking only at some buttons that are Higgs buttons, and I don't think. In other words, they have to be invariant under the action limit. So you're minimizing over a smaller set of objects, so it's hard to come out as complex objects. That's why you get at the Moispace level an open inclusion. Anyway, the key is that this is an integral system. So Hitchen gives you a map. So Hitchen gives you a map that's called F. I have too many H's in my story is to a certain base B, which I will now describe. And the key properties are that Higgs is going to be symplectic in the algebraic sense. The base is going to be a vector space of half a dimension. The map is going to be Lagrangian. The map is going to be Lagrangian, which is making this synthetic stretch term. And the map is going to be proper. The patterns are going to be compact, Lagrangian. So in the case that G is G L A G L R Then I can describe the basics usually as summation algorithm 1 to rank on global sections and see what came to the icout. So what's the map? The map F is a bunch of maps Fi's into the components. And Fi, you can take it exclusively between You can take it explicitly to be the trace of V to the R. So phi goes from V to V tensor K. You iterate it a few times, opposing the morphism part and tensoring the wonderful part, you get something whose trace is a iconical differential. So that's explicitly the HNAP for the case of G. For the case of G L N. Or a general G simply replace the degrees i by di, which is the degree of i invariant polynomial for the group. For example, if we're doing SO to n, those degrees would be 2, 4, 6, up to 2n minus 2, and then we would expect to end n and we have a phi, which is the square root of the term. So for each group, we have a set of r degrees of the elementary band polynomials, and fi is written by I is written by the i's polynomial. There's a more intrinsic version which says Today's is double sections over the curve C of the following slightly strange thing. We take T, that's the maximum torus of the Lie algebra of the temperature. So the time is of algebra. I tend the way to make a canonical bundle. So that gives me a vector bundle over the curve of rank R. Of blank R. The weird thing is that I'm dividing that by the action of the vial group. So in the case of GLA, the bile group is just a submitted group of main letters. It's a little more complicated for the other reductive groups. So what kind of object is it? It's a vector bundle divided by W. So just a bundle of something. In fact, by theorem of symmetric functions, this is still a vector space more or less. Is still a vector space, more or less isomorphic to a vector space. The automorphism groups is a little bigger than J Ln. So I'm constructing an explicit bundle over the curve this way. And the section of that, I claim, is equivalent, if you work it out, to the beat there was before. One advantage of this view is that you can take the You can take the natural map from global sections of T tensor Kc without dividing by the by group and divide by the by group. This gives you a cover of the base beam and And for each point B and each base, you now get a cover C tilde of B, which is the finite cover of the curve C. In fact, it's a GAWA cover with GABO group W. So what am I doing? B, by definition, is a section going to the quotient. Going to the quotient and looking at all the ways of lifting it to the thing with the other quotient. That gives me a double O. This thing is called the camera cover. If you take the case of SL3, sorry, you have this chamber picture in the Caritan of the algebra. And basically, you're assigning one point to each chamber. One point each chamber. So you have a family of cartons moving over the curve C, and you could try to cover each time parameterization. One dot for each change. So that's why it's called camera dot. And you get for every representation row of the bi group, you're getting. You're getting an associated row signal of me. That's called a spectrograph. So in the case of GLN again, the camera cover has degree 3 factorial, which is 6. The spectral cover is simply quotient by the atoms you want to. So it's a three-shift cover. Sorry, that's really. I'm sorry, that's not right. Ruby LN, LN factorial versus equal. They're equivalent data. If you have the Gallo version, the camera cover, you recover the spell cover as a quotient. If you have the spell cover, you take its Galois closure and that recovers the Gamo cover. So which one you use is really Use really an idea of preference. Anyway, the basic results of the story are as follows. Higgs is symplectic. The restriction of the symplectic form to the open Restriction of the symplectic form to the open subset, which is the cotangent of B, so the cotangent of one is the natural symplectic structure of the cotangent. The H map F is the lagoon gen X is twelve point. Also, the hitchy base. The fibers are compact Lagrangians. In fact, fibers are, they do admit various very precise descriptions. So they're just going to be the Jacobian or the spheric cover if you're in. You feel entitled to all. There will be various kinds of fruit varieties. So if you're taking either the orthogonal or the vector groups, the spell cover ends up having a natural involution. Involution. We can take the premium in the sense that was defined for us in the first time this morning. And that turned out to be the fiber of this map. But the actual description is case by case. It's a little different for each group. If you want an overall description that always works, then it's better to say that it's a sort of generalized trim. Generalized trim of the camera. So to define a generalized frame, you have to give two abelian varieties and a map between them, or something like that. What you actually do is you give one abelian variety, which is the huge Jacobian curve. You observe that W acts on it, so it decomposes into. Apps on it, so it decomposes into types according to representation in W. And you pick one of those types, namely the one that corresponds to the reflection representation, the action of the bio group on the criteria itself. So there are some details, but we have completely explicit description of the virus. Case by case or uniformly in general. They're like genuine virus. General fibers. Sorry? Like general fibers, but all parties of fibers. Well, this is all fibers, it's just that if the snow cover is singular, then you have to be careful about what you mean by that. Do you allow us only line buttons or not? So yes. So what what if we qualify and say there exists a discriminant which divides on it? So the values of delta in B. And this is, so the above claims are true literally on the contoming of the screen. That's the locus of smooth camera cover. You can do a little better, you can extend it to smooth, very coverless. Never mind, I need it. And there's one other big result that's in the background, and that is non-Abidian Hodge theory, which tells you that this thing is not just symplectic, it's actually hypercalar. So there's a hypercalar rotation. There's a P1's worth of different complex structures on this thing. There's an actual parameter on it. So you can talk about structure number 0, structure number 1, and so on. For all non-zero numbers, the structure, the structure. Non-zero number, the structure is equivalent. It gives you the border space of local systems on the curve. While when lambda goes to zero, it becomes the Higgs model space. So it fits in this hypercalero, in this crystal found. Any questions so far? Could you uh repeat only the definition of CB tilde? Yes. The question was to repeat the definition of C B tilde. What I'm saying is B is a section of something. So it's mapped in the curve to the total space of k C. T tensor Kc mod W. Now take just T tends to Kc without modified W. That maps here. It's a W Gado cover. Take the psycho quad. That's a catalog cover. Other questions? Let me say a few words about the puncher kins. So now instead of signing with a curve C, instead of the curve C and it divides on D. So there's going to be a sum of There's going to be a sum of a bunch of points, and I'm going to assume that the points are distinct. But neuromorphic bundles that I'm going to be constructing are going to be tamely ramified. The order of the poles at each point will be at most one. So we're going to replace the canonical bundle by By K twisted by D. We're allowing first-order poles at each of the points of the device of D. So we have a modified object which we call x sub d that's the stack or space of all things bundles. Phi is now allowed to have first of all d then we have a hitch and base b sympt where you literally go through the Where you literally go through the definitions, the very definitions they gave for B, and replace K by K2 by B, which allows for a sort of pulse. And there's a hedging map that's called a pulse of B, going from Higgs D to B. This was considered by Mauchman, somewhat later also by Bodachin. And here are the results. So Higgs D is no longer symplectic, but it is Poisson. And the map S of D is also Poisson. Is also Poisson. It preserves the structure. The Poisson version of the grandeur. Learn to try to spell that out a little more fully. So you want to choose an orbit. Actually, a co-joint orbit, so it's a dual of the Lie algebra. But for reductive Lie algebra, it's kind of Of the artworks, can I identify G with G star? So for each I, each of the points, fix a conjugacy class at that point. Then we define So we get E sub O is the subset of B. B, remember, parameterizes all the characteristic polynomials of endomorphisms that are allowed to have a first of the core at the point. B sub O would parameterize all the polynomials. B sub O will parameterize all those patristic polynomials that come from domorphisms whose residue at the point is in the given conjugacy class OR. That's clear enough or should I say it again? But it's a subset of B D, not a B D B D, thank you. A B D, thank you. Yeah, of course. This is a B D and F D inverse of D O is a symplectic lease. So if you have a Poisson manifold, it is canonically stratified by symplectic. symplectic leads, symplectic some manifold that some manifold that which is for some form becomes symplectic. These are the symplectic needs in this case. They're completely explicit. And HPO is a symplectic symplectic integral system this is a source for construction of many integral systems in fact many integral systems that were known in the 19th century and early 20th century we described by picking the curve just zero never endpoint and take some very small important o-bit and to give rise Orbit and give rise to very classical examples. Things like two different flow and other stories, and we look at book with spoken ones. Data functions are lots of examples. Okay, any questions about this? I have two questions. So, O is a little bit of an orbit. So, what would you say was? For the applications to the physics, the physicists will want. To the physics, the physicists will want it to be important. For us, mathematicians, there's no reason to make that distinction. Oh, it's just an orbit. Just any orbit. Just a conjugate class. Another question was, are there some lights for the control? Good question. Oh, yeah, there are. I turned them on when I gave my tab. The left one stage. Stage lights. Yeah. Oh, no, no, to the left of it. Oh, yeah. So, let me talk about what we talked about. So the group level is a group G and its lineless dual group GL. Roughly speaking, the group G has a maximum coordinates and has a group of And it has a group of weights, which is somewhere between the lattice of roots and the lattice of corrupts. So let lambda be the sort of characters or weights of the group J. And you take the dual lattice and you use the classification of reductive groups. You say that you need to determine some reductive group, which we'll call. And we like to work which we're calling the language as well. So if you start with GLR, you get GLR itself. If you start with SLR, you get PGLR. They're isogenous, there's only algebra, the different linguists. You could start with D and E, for example, SO2N. To Noz back to itself that SO2n plus 1 goes to the symplectic group of O2n. So this is kind of surprising. If you think about it in terms of the thinking diagrams, you're just reversing all the errors. So the A, D, and E cases are self-dual at least at the level of the algebras, while B goes the same. And it's a finer thing is going on at the level of things. Okay. So Okay, so the rough statement that I want to explain is that the Hitchin system for group G is dual to the H system. I guess I'm oscillating between calling it Higgs and Hinge. That'd be the same thing. That'd be the same thing. We'll put that in quotation marks, and I'll try to explain it. By the way, this is in an old paper that wrote Historian content. In the case of type AN, in other words, GLN, SLN, In other words, GLN, SLN, PGLN is in an older paper of Amosa and Cadness, who, by the way, interpret this duality as, in the hypocrite context, as a form of neurosimilarity. So I assume that that's So I assume that that's part of why you wanted me to get this talk. Anyway, let me just try to spell this out a little more. So we have the hitcher bases, B for the group G, and let's say B L would be the Hitcher base for the annual drop of G L. So the first claim is that these two are These two are canonically isomorphic. In other words, there's an isomorphism, I call it L, from B to B L, which sends a discriminant to the discriminant. From points, this more points. So if you're looking at tag AR, like GLR, it's just going to be the identity of the bits. If you look at tags B and C, that's something completely new, but it says that kitesups of symplectic groups are equivalent to chootesic polynomials of To cut into polynomials of target groups of R or you go down the list to groups of tag F and G, those are the non-simple base scripts. Each of them is Langland's dual to itself. But the map that you get to the base is not the identity. It's a rotation by roughly half a chamber. It says short roots for long roots and long roots for short words. Not equal to the den and not even conjugate to the end. Anyway discriminant finance during discriminant General fibers to be well, that's been a zero here. Well, that's pretty zero here. Again, I just mean things that are topologically trivial. That means the underlying vector bundle is going to be zero. This type is going to be an abelian variety. Not necessarily principally polarized. In the case of GLO it would be sim it would be sim um principally polarized, but in this in the other cases it will have very small multiplicities. Very small multiplicities. But the relevant to us is that let's call it A sub B. So the part we have not to ask is that for the line of the dual group, over the corresponding point of the base, the dual of the base variety. The dual of the abelian variety is the abelian variety of the original. In other words, fiber by fiber, under this matching of the two bases, the fibers are dual abelian variety. You can interpret one of them as x0 of the other. And there's a rather fancy extension of this too. Extension of this to non-neutral components. So, since it's not terribly relevant to me, and I don't want to put too much past time, let me just say without writing, that these are obviously going to be torsos over the neutral fibers. These are going to be torsos over the varieties. General, if you have a Well, if you have a vibration by tori or by the varieties, then a torso for that vibration and the gravity goes to a joby structure on the other side. There are really two parameters by which you can twist given pulse vibration. One is the amount of twisting the torso and the other is the amount of jerbiness. The amount of jobiness. Parameter spaces for those things get switched under language duality and exactly also for one goes to dual joke for the effect. Like I said, making full sense of this will take too long. But this was discussed originally in a paper that I wrote with Skythring. And And in another earlier paper, which was 200, we showed this general phenomenon that forces growing drawing into one other property that I would like to state in Spain, but I need a little background for that. This is at least part of the motivation for Least part of the motivation for wanting to know this. Comments are the co-adjoint components. Well, these occur in the punctured case. This theorem so far is only for the unpunctured case, so they haven't connected yet. You did see today a little bit about the punctured case, Veronica's talk, and I'm Right like a start, and I'm hoping that I have a few minutes to connect with that. So part of the motivation for looking at this comes from the geometric language projecture. Let me try to outline it very quickly. So the objects we're looking at here are, I think, V, there's a double function. I think V, there's a double colour. That's going to be a local system. One C. So you can think of it as a representation of a select group, or you can think of it as a connection on a vector binding. Because that's the mental vector, something like that. That tells you to go to equivalent vertex. So in my notes in calling those local systems, they really should call them flat connections, to be more precise. So the geometric language conjecture says very roughly that this should be equivalent to Automorphic reverse shields on burn. This is burn on the coast C with the line as draw L G. Fancier version. Says that this is part of an equivalence of categories. So let's see. It goes to the derived category, coherent modules on lock. So do I have category? And L1 are the models. So the case that I was describing here, your special case of a fancier version, but it's the most important one. It's the basic thing that you really need to construct. So a robot. A local system is the same as a coherent sheaf on the motor space of local systems that's supported at the point, just the structure shape of the point. B is interpreted as a sheaf supported with the point of log, while the automorphic sheaf multiplication is going to be a special case with B module on the L by L So the key property of this is that it sends a structure sheet of the local system V to a Heke eigen. This is what I've done, I see them. Let's see, what's that? What's heck? I can set this button cross button. Cross bound crosses because the triple V prime and the point of vx then I can define heck a correspondence to be the set of triplets. to be the set of triples V V prime of X such that V prime contains V as a sheet. It's contained in V twisted by X. In other words, V prime is a modification of V at the point X. But this is a little disconnected. You have an emergency variant which is the length of the quotient. Length of the quotient. That can be any integer from 1 to R, where R is the length. And there's a similar, slightly more complicated definition for any group gene. This hecky thing. This hecky thing, if you instead of putting an x here, you put an elevating multiple of x, which is what you need in order to make sensible for other groups. This becomes an infinite-dimensional object, because you can keep modifying it. It is stratified by pieces here. I can use these out okay. A case that I was bounded by a character. So in the case of G Ln, specifying you basically specifying the integer i from 1 to r, which is the length of the quotient. So with a more precise version of the eigenshaped property, if I start with the structure sheet of a local system B and I apply this mysterious geometric angle that's correspondence to it. So now I get something on L bar. L bar, I can apply the Hecke transformation. And this is the Heke for the Language-Doh group. And in order to keep things finite, I'll truncate it at this mu. And the claim is that this is what we started with, C for me. Tenzoid, where is something manufactured out of V. The something we manufacture out of V should depend on the character mu. In fact, we just apply the Erodu's little presentation, rho is highest weight, mu, to it. This is a precise version of how COV works as an eigen Works as an eigen sheet of the HECA operators, where the eigenvalue is essentially VLC. So for every local system, we expect to get an eigen sheath with that original thing as its eigen object. So here's the homework problem for you. Let's consider the simplest case where G is G and one. So we multiply that with C star. So then becomes the Dakota and zero becomes the Jacobian. What does he become? There are going to be two of them. Mu can be 0 of 1. How was mu? Mu can be 0 of 1. Mu equals 0 just means I haven't done anything. just means I haven't done anything. So x is 0, it's just the identity, meaning it's, so the flux v prime x with v prime equals v. So I haven't done anything. So interestingly, this is when mu equals 1, but that just means that v prime is v twisted by x. Because then we did it with line bundles. Twisting by x just increases the degree by 1. So Hecke becomes the average of the map. The Alpha-Jacobi map. Believe it is the map from the curve to its Jacobian. A bit more intrinsically the map from the curve across the Picard to the Picard, sending a point and a line bundle to the twist. So vertical liners in this case becomes the very elementary. The very elementary and standard theory of curves in their Jacobians. So let me leave that as an exercise to prove this case of geometric latency. Okay, so what does that have to do with the Hitchin system? Well, there are two ways to connect them. At least. So this goes under the heading of idealization. The key point is that on Higgs we have the Higgin math, which goes to B. But we also have a map from Higgs to Bun, which is just a projection. You forget the H feet. Let's call it pi for projection. So these are two distinct Lagrangian vibrations on the same total space. Of course, you've noticed that I dotted this map. It's not a morphism, it's only a rational map, because of the discrepancy between stability for X buttons and stability for underlying buttons. So the name of the game is to play art is tolerant vibrations. So I've just defined for you Hecking, which is a sub stack, I guess, of bun plus bun plus C. Similarly, I can define that. Really nice heck as a sub of Higgs plus Higgs crossing. So what am I doing? I'm looking at pairs v phi and v prime phi prime in the point x such that v prime is obtained by modification of v, and that modification needs to be consistent. That modification needs to be consistent or invariant under the H. In other words, I don't get to twist by any point. I get to twist only by one of the points above, above X on the spherical cover. So it's essentially the existence of these two projections that allow me to define that billionaires version of Heke, which maps. Which maps are heck, but it's much smaller. What are the fibers of the map to Higgs crossing? The map from Hacking tilde to Higgs cross C? They're finite. Finite. So what are the fibers for the full hecking? Corresponding, exactly. So here I have an endomorphism. Let's say over a genetic point. The endomorphism is Walk it in this simple, so it has a bunch of distinct eigenvalues and corresponding eigen lines. Looking only at those points of the Gauss Magnian or those subspaces which are invariant out of phi. In other words, I can just make a finite subset of the n line and make a vector spa. So I get two to the n, or two to the r point. Okay. Okay. So midpoint number one actually let me let me add just a couple of words here. So the so I told you we went to the market. So I told you, we went through several versions of the duality between the HIN system and its dual. And I promised that there was going to be one more statement about that package. And that says that I can chips for their billionized hacker operators do exist. In fact, Billing eyed Okay, eigenshi's exist and they're given as follows. You simply take a degree zero line bundle all in a hidden fiber. And you take the time always its projection. And now gives you a vector bundle of some final drag, like to the end, downstairs. So the claim is so the duality has with So the duality tells you that 5 of one engine system is dual to the 5 of the other. In other words, it's a point on it, it's a line bundle on the other of degree zero. So that needs to be that. So you want to think of F inverse of B. Of B as a spectral color of button. So I take a point B, pull it back to get an equation, and project it the other way. I'm getting a finite cover. When I think of that as a spherical cover, take a line beneath on that spell cover, push it down. It gives me a sheet down the stairs, which would be in it. Which we claim is an eigenshap of the ability. Okay, point number one on this is that this is a classical limit of virtual GLC. So yeah. Yeah. So the ways of interpreting each of these as out of a family, classical limit is when you get relative gram to go to zero. What we're doing on this side is we're taking the twist of happening or the Lean's lambda connections. When lambda is not zero, you're unlock. The limit when lambda goes to zero. In the limit when lambda goes to zero, you get X. On this side, you are not degenerating the space, you are degenerating the sheath. So D is the ring of differential operator is filtered by degree of the differential operator. It is an associated graded, which is just functions of the contangent bundle. Contangent bundle is Higgs. So the classical limit to So the classical limit of both of these, of both sides of this, is going to be the same. It's going to be direct algebra of coherent sheets on Higgs with four coefficients. So one point of view is that we've proved the classical limit of geometric lag lens. Then this is like older than zero. And you need to work out Higher deformations of this. And indeed, there's some pretty amazing work of Avrin King and others where they tried to do it. Just to extend this service order equivalence to first ordering. New point number two is a point. This is actually equivalent to the fourth. So the very rough idea is if the generated something from lambda equals 1 to lambda equals 0, we think of the anti lambda equals 0 as the limit. anti-lambda equals zero is the limit. But instead we can use an ability and Hodge theory to say that categorically the lambda equals zero and lambda equals one versions are actually equivalent to each other. So proving something at lambda equals zero is at least morally equivalent to proving it at land equals zero. So this is this uses Full version of Ronapin Hodge theory, where the original was developed by Simpson and collected various others. And the final version that we need in every three dimensions due to much is okay and so that's. So so so are other people. Anyway, so um we can think of so we're about to post a paper where we actually work out the details of its equivalent in one special case. There's another one that we've already posted in another special case. It's going to be high time to t to try to do it in the general version. In the Java version. Currently, we'd like you to do? So, yes, this is supposed to work when we have the example we have a much more modern. But this construction of this shift, like for the slimmer, but that that would work right or not. The statement has to do with I mean these phases are becoming more complicated, but the sheaves that you're using more the same as what they were in the GLN case. So well I was hoping to talk I was hop hoping to talk to to also talk about the supercon conformal field theories and the role that no more kitchen systems playing there, but I guess they'll have to wait for another day. So thank you. It's a it's person it's past ten at home and it's nine o'clock. Minutes nine o'clock. I don't think you want me to go over time. I'm not sure if we are still recording. If you have any questions, thanks for the thought. Ron, especially if this laid out just a very quick question. About the spectral cover of fun, maybe you already said it, or maybe it's quite true, but what is it branched over? Which bundles in that? Yeah, so the the branching we can pretty much work out by working out on the answer. The hard issue, now we're not recording. The hard issue is with these maps failed to be defined, and that's what's called the wobbly locus. So you have the moduli space of bundles. Of bundles. There's a notion of bundle being very stable, which basically means it has no neural quote hidden fields on it. And the wobbly locus field is a bundle that are stable, but not very stable. So they walk. So that's the locus that you really need to understand to make all this story work. So 80% of the 300p pay for the drop-out. The 300p for the dropout to post, and also setting the warp logos in specific cases. Other questions with high order flows? It's really tough. I mean if you're non-team case, you get into all kinds of So presumably, I think Markman's original paper did include high order, in case I'm not sure whether how strong it's all right. There are no points of actions.  Yeah, I think it's a self-reflection, but keep it as small as what you mean. With Newman presentation for that background in the population, and then the packets made up of the How often does this happen? Well, I mean, it's not going to be part of the thing where you should get anything.   Yeah, but it's natural but of course we've seen that you've seen what what was But video misunderstanding would have seen as well. Who are they with? One of these with John Patrick. Now Carlos joined the other ones. Joined the party silver ones. Carlos was visiting this person this year. Gave the project a big price. I wasn't trying to buy it too. Yeah, both. But then these hyper deformations got me thinking about it because I mean presumably they're you know like deformations and hyper columnology H2H3 so on presumably yeah because I also have Yeah, because I also have PhD sequel and I was thinking, and this could end up being a silly direction, but I have been thinking about it. Because, you know, one way to produce these bundles, of course, is to take stable modules and compute engine space. And of course, then the dual type, the co-tap space, basically looks for that stable model. So but you know, from that point of invoking it, but instead of invoking the service width, you get instead of invoking the third wave, it gets you to remote tangent space and stay with the tangent space and research with the tangent bubble. So looking at tangent clock types, and so on. And so producing these pier pieces get produced every time. I'm not saying that this geometry results in modile spaces, which is the change. Of the zoological model spaces, which is interesting. Maybe there's some local interest in the big part of the system. That's pretty much the model and now it's going to be what we have on this one. First of all, what I mean is that it is just that doing it was incredibly difficult work. This gets a wonderful thing. Already the company are off the charts. So the reason why you said about this is because it helps them with the fun system just going all over the place. People have already done the hard analysis for this one.  I'm Manelaus. Manelaus. I'm sorry. It's Greek. I'm I don't preach my students. Yeah, I do like to talk. Thank you. Yeah, Pond is funny, I haven't talked about Open yet. Hopefully Vogos is like that before as you just mentioned.
