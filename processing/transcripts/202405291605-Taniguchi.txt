Thank you, Yihong. So, first of all, I would like to thank the organizers for organizing this workshop and kind invitation. And especially, I would like to thank Professor Hirokazu Ninomiya for taking every effort, his effort. Every effort, his effort to make this workshop successful. Today, I'd like to talk about study Alan-Khan equation of balance type. And n is any positive integer greater than or equals to two. Greater than or equals to two. And this is usual ankle equation of balance type. And w is a potential, random potential, and prime means the derivative. And in this talk, x prime means this vector, x1 to xn minus 1. And if I write board x, x prime to xn, this is rn vector. This is rn minus. Rn vector. This is Rn minus one vector. And Laplacian is this one is usual Laplacian. And then assumption on a potential W, I will explain. W is a sheet su this one and that satisfy this condition. And so usually W has So usually W has two stable equilibrium states. That is, I call it plus one and minus one. And they are stable, asymptotically stable constants, steady states. And Ws is positive between this one. This one is a sufficient. Is a sufficient necessary and sufficient condition to ensure, guarantee the standing font. So the graph of W is like this. Plus one and minus one is two asymptotically stable steady states. And from this, here, the second derivative is strictly. Is strictly positive, and here is a positive one. And here I take S star. This is the largest flat point between minus one and one, and I take theta zero here. This is the random potential W. This is a user assumption. And the typical example of W is Of W is all over U no U minus U cubic. This is a typical one. And in this case, this one is a well-known double well potential. And then so for this equation, so I back to the equation. Equation and I explain entire solution and traveling wave solution, traveling front solution. So for traveling front solution is C is velocity, speed. In this of I'll take call this one speed and V is traveling profile. And the profile equation of C V is given by this one. This one. Then this one becomes a traveling fault solution. It's okay. Just a moment. I'll back to the slideshow. And this is Massim. is a massive mathematical sub American mathematical society subject this one is given and I explain about entire solution this one is another and u is called an n-dimensional entire solution if and only if it satisfies this one so up to t minus infinity Minus infinity. So sometimes this one is called entire solution or eternal solution. And every n-dimensional traveling wave is a itself is a n-dimensional entire solution. So torn font of any dimension is a typical example of any dimension. Of any dimensional entire solution. And for balanced bi-stable reaction diffusion equations, entire solutions have been studied by Cheng Guo and Ino Hirokasu Ninyomiya. Aguo is John Sheng Guo, he is, I think, in the audience. And Cheng is Shinfu Chen. And also, one measure, another entire solution have been studied by Manuel Delpin. Many Telpino and Cochikas. These are NSI solutions. And for about the traveling front, balanced case, the only one-dimensional standing traveling front is a standing front. Standing front is a traveling front with speed zero. And this is explicitly. And this is explicitly given by this formula. Okay. And then this is a one-dimensional traveling front. And how about the n-dimensional traveling front? For axisymmetric traveling front. So this one is axisymmetric traveling front. And the picture is just, I'll be back here. I'll be back here. This theorem, this is a big profile. It's an axis symmetric torn front in balanced reaction diffusion equations. It's going to the xn direction with speed c. And this one is studied by Cheng Guo Chen Amel Nomia. Amir, Nomir, and Brookjoffer in 2007, and by myself in another method using pyramid traveling font, limit of parameter traveling font here, 2020. This one is a profile equation for axisymmetric traveling font, and this one satisfies that. And then? And then so how about axially asymmetric tremendous front? So many people say this is next point is axially asymmetric. Asymmetric means non-symmetric travel font. So R1, R2, n minus 1 be arbitrarily given. And this is profile equation. This one means the cross section at the height theta. At theta is some number of xn the cross-section is over. So this is axially asymmetric travel front. So the profile, the picture is like this. Profile, the picture is like this. And let me show, this is the profile. And just moment, profile is something like this. This one, and you can see such one from this direction, such one. It's not axially. It's axially asymmetric, non-symmetrical. Symmetric, no symmetrical shape, such as a cross-section of the axiomy asymmetric triangle font. And then next slide is most important. So in this talk, I will emphasize this fact. Any dimensional traveling. N-dimensional traveling front gives an entire solution of n minus one as the speed goes to infinity. So this is a most important fact. So Vc is any dimensional traveling font with speed C. Then, as I take this one. I take this one. Then, as C, the speed goes to infinity, this UC, the limit of UC, gives an n minus one image entire solution. So, this one is for imbalanced bicep reaction diffusion equations. Hirokazu Neomia and myself study. And myself studied Rotter submitted a paper, and in this paper, we take the speed goes to infinity for any dimensionatorial front. And any every we short every Every n dimensional torrent font gives a n minus one dimensional n minus solution for imbalanced by stable reaction diffusion equations. I think this paper is a very, very important paper. And if you are reviewing this paper, if this is under reviewing, please read this paper carefully and give your opinion to us. And then next one. So I'll show this one by next slide. So this is a profile equation. And I shift, make a shift of the n-dimensional parameter so I write the font like this. And then take xn. Take XN and T this relation. And then this relation is most important. And then next, take the limit of UC and chapter U satisfy becomes end dimension entire solution. So using this fact, I'll I prove the existence of radially asymmetric travel entire solution. Radially symmetric entire solution and also radially asymmetric entire solution. So this is radially symmetric entire solution. This one. And this one is a The shape, the shape is this one. This is the time development of the level set for radially symmetric entire solution. And this one and this paper is accepted. This paper is accepted for publication in Mathematics Analytics and this is an open access paper, so you can download it freely. Already, it's open. Now everyone can access this paper. And then next, Ray Asymmetry entire solution. So R1, R2, Rn minus one. R1, R2, Rn minus one is a it's a major axis or minor axes of the overall. That's this number be arbitrarily given. Then there exists chapter U, it's an entire solution, and it's an entire solution t goes to can be got minus infinity. Can be go to minus infinity and satisfy this one. The this one it's a at time zero the major axis and minor axis can be diffused. So it's a rate it Ray it radially asymmetric entire solution so this is same paper and the picture is like this here so time t equals zero it's over and time t equals one it's a over but the ratio aspect ratio becomes approaches to one and And here is here minus one, and here plus one. And t goes to minus infinity. This one becomes over large aspect ratio. So that means at t goes to minus infinity, this is becomes a And it becomes almost two parallel lines. And this is two parallel planes, almost, but always this shape. This is radially asymmetric, entire solution. And the method is like this: this is. This one is use this one and take use this one and take c goes to infinity. I'll explain how that this one. So let me explain in this picture. This is a radially asymmetric traveling front, energetic traveling front. So as I said, Front. So, as I said, this is axially asymmetric. So, traveling front has a traveling axis. So, asymmetric, symmetric or asymmetric means with regard respect to the torrent axis, but entire solution has no such axis. Axis. So I call radially asymmetric or radially symmetric. So this is a axially asymmetric traveling front, and I see this axially asymmetric travel font from the upward direction and take C, take the speed C goes. Take the speed C goes to infinity, then this and this one x and take and I take minus t x n that right that means it's all. This one minus Xn I consider T, then this one becomes the development of the level set of an entire solution. So this is a so as this as C goes to infinity. Infinity, this one converges to here. The movement, time development of a radially asymmetric entire solution. And so, so I think such radially asymmetric entire solution, you remind the units of. Angular. So just let me explain about the relationship of this radially asymmetric entire solution with the angina's O. So everyone knows balanced bistable reaction diffusions are closely. Are closely related with those to the mean curvature flow. It's a such result, classical result. Everyone knows such. It's a classical theory and curve shortening. So this morning, Professor Sigur Ayang explained the curve. Explain the curve shortening flow. And if we consider it in R2, this one is a curve shortening flow. And Argonne's over and Professor Angenet, I don't know his maybe his name is Angenet, Professor Siguraji. I don't know, but Angenet spoiled himself. He himself calls this one paper clip ancient solution. So this one is also studied by Dascal himself, introduced this one and studied by Dascal Paulas, Hamilton, and Cézanne, Professor Cézanne. And this one, this is the Angenen's Orba paper critique ancient solution. And this one is a curvature is given explicitly by the Explicitly by this one, and lambda is any arbitrary given number. So t can be minus infinity. That's then this one is called ancient solutions. And t is zero, it becomes shrinks to one point. So this is a ancient solution, not at all. Ancient solution, not eternal solution. And we consider this the association. So there should be an associated solution in balanced Aden-Kahn equation. In this case, T can be plus infinity. The any bounded solution can be solved uniquely after t goes to plus infinity. T goes to plus infinity. So the associated solution should be an anti-S solution. So how about the relation between NAS formal or paper clip agent solution and this radially asymmetry entire solution? So this is an open problem. And my conjecture is if Is if w is this one and then an epsilon goes to zero, then the level set of this entire solution to the balanced Arankan equation converges to Angus over in a compact time interval as Epsom goes to zero. This is my conjecture. So, Conjecture. So that means this one linearly assimilative entire solution to the Arankai equation converges to this one. And then that's all. Thank you for listening. Do you hear any questions? Yeah, could I just a comment about the oval? It has been discovered by many people, and as far as I know, the oldest reference I know is by a group of Japanese physicists, Wadati, I think, Isusu. I'll mention the reference on Friday. But thank you for this very nice talk. Nice talk. Thank you. There are many other ancient solutions of this type. There's an ancient sine wave, and I wonder if you could construct those as entire solutions of Aladd Khan. Yeah, please teach me. So in the equative copy, please teach me about such soliton solutions. Maybe I would like to study them. Thank you very much, Sigurd. Professor. Much Sigurd, Professor Angel. Sure, thank you. Sigurd, yeah. Are there any other questions from people online? If no, let's thank the speaker again. Thank you.
