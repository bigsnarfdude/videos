Hi, hello everyone. It's nice to see you. It's nice to see you again here. Today I'm going to talk to you about a problem that I have been working with. Well, that we already worked on with Victor Almendra. Victor Almendra is the same Victor Almendra as in the previous talk. So this is joint. In the previous talk, so this is joint work with Victor Almendra Fernandez. Fernandez. And well, the title of the work is on prescribing orders to pairwise Euclidean distances. The idea of the problem is actually very easy to understand. However, when we started working on this problem, we reached a point in which, well, we couldn't say anything else, as you will see. The idea is actually very. The idea is actually very, very simple. And it starts with, well, some points on the plane, as many Herdos-type problems. And well, let me start with an example. Let's suppose that we have the following points on R2 on the plane. It's just a small example with four points, but it will be enough to start talking about some of the things in the, well, some of the definitions and to understand what the problem is about. So let me think that. Is about. So let me think that the points are the points that I have drawn here, and that I know how long these distances are. However, I will forget about the specific length of the distances. And the only thing that I will think about is how long they are compared to each other. So it is not very important whether this distance is two or this one is three. The only thing that I will care about is whether this distance is small. About is whether this distance is smaller or larger than each other, and we may have repeated distances that is allowed. So, for example, maybe this point has name one, this one has name two, this one has name three, this one has name four, and this one has certain length with one segment, and this one with two, and maybe this one is also, this one has the same length as this one, this one has a triple, and this one has four. So, if they have the same. So, if they have the same number of marks, they have the same length, but also more marks mean greater lengths, right? So, when we have some points on the plane, then we can induce an order on the pairwise distances of points. So, for example, from this example, this ordering of the pairwise distances is 1, 2 is less than 3, 4, which is the same as. Which is the same as 2, 3, which is less than 1, 4, which is the same as 2, 4, which is less than 1, 3. All right? So when we start with a given point on the plane, say, we can create an ordering of the pairwise distances. This one, two less than three, four, well, it only means that this length is less than this one here. Of course, it might be the case that a pair has the same distribution. That a pair has the same distance as another pair, but that doesn't mean they are the same pairs, right? They are different pairs, but with the same length. So, this gives an idea on how, starting from a given set of points on the plane, we can create an ordering on the pairwise distances. So, as you can imagine, this talk is about trying to understand what happens the other way around. Say, I start now with an ordering of the pairwise distances. Is it possible? Is it possible to create an example? Is there a geometric realization of that ordering? So, that's the general idea of the talk. I will start with some definitions, but if you understood this idea, then you're probably already about the definitions. There are some precisions that I have to make because the results that I will state, in some cases, will allow equal distances, and in some cases, well, we won't allow them. So, I have to make a distinction. And, well, here I And well, here I have presented to you a complete version of the problem in the sense that we are taking note of all the possible pairwise distances, but I will also describe a bipartite version of the problem, which also has some interesting behaviors. So, well, let me just get on with that. So, what will I need in order to pose this problem completely? First, the first definition that I will need is The first definition that I would need is: well, just a brief reminder: what do I mean by a pre-order? When I say that I have a pre-order, I have a relation less than or equal to, that it is reflexive, and that it's transitive. However, we don't know whether this relation is anti-symmetric. So it might be the case that when we have pre-orders, this happens and also this happens, but these two are not the same, right? It's kind of what is happening here with 3, 4 and 2, 3. I mean, 3, 4 is both less, well, the distance associated with 3, 4 is less than or equal to the 1, 2, 2, 3. three four is less than or equal to the one two two three and vice versa. Two three is less than or equal to the distance to three four actually they are equal. However, as pairs, as pairs, they are not the same pair, right? Three, four is a distinct pair from two, three. And of course, if this happens and we also have anti-symmetry, anti-symmetry, and we have an order. And we have an order, yes? So, this is the definition for order, and we get an order. All right, of course, well, as I said before, I am interested not only in studying the problem for pre-orders or orders in general, I will be studying this for very complete orders, so to say, strictly speaking, complete orders. So, what I will do is that I will Will check or also impose not only an order, an arbitrary order, or an arbitrary pre-order. I want to know what is happening either to the whole set of pairs or I want to know what happens with the pairs given by partition of the numbers. So, in addition to these two definitions, I also have this one here, definition. An order or pre-order or pre-order is complete if for every X and Y we either have x less than or equal to y or y less than or equal to x. So we can compare any two elements. And similarly, definition definition if we have a partition if x a union b A union B is a partition A complete bipartite order on its pairs on its say Well, colored pairs say is an order on the elements of A times B such that can be compared. Just as a small example, in this case, when I am talking about bipartite orders, say I have this, for example, one, two, and three elements on this side, and say on the other side, I have here, say, small a and small b. So I am. And small b. So I am not interested anymore in comparing any two pairs, but only in comparing pairs that go from this side of the partition to this side of the partition. So, well, another way to say this is that we can draw the edges, so to say, of this bipartite graph. And the only thing that I am taking note of is whether the number or the thing that I am, whether the order that I am assigning says that this one. Says that this one is larger than this one, or not, or vice versa. When I am asking that this order is total, well, I want to know this for every pair of edges created in this way, but I do not care about edges that are like this. I completely ignore them. So one, two is not given any place in this ordering. Yes? So this is the bipartite version of a complete order. And as you can imagine, well, we can also talk about a complete bipartite bear, a complete bipartite version. A complete bipartite version for pre-orders, not for orders. Yes? So, what is exactly the problem? Well, given these definitions over here, what is exactly the problem that we want to study? Well, what we want to know is when, if I am given an order, I can construct some points in some Euclidean space, in some RD of some dimension, so that the distances induced by this example create the This example create the initial order or pre-order. Yeah. So probably I should write that. So let me write it somewhere here. This is like the general version of the problem or the phenomena that we are interested in. And then I will speak about the specific version that we solve and what we are interested in solving next or understanding next. So in general, in general, In general, the question that we want to answer is which orders or pre-orders can be represented with an example of points. In RD. Yeah. Either for the bipartite version or for the complete version, and for both cases for considering both orders and pre-orders. All right. So that is the general question that we want to study. Of course, if one thinks about this for a minute or so, one can decide. Or so, one can discover very quickly that it will be basically impossible to give a classification result for this, well, that answers this question very precisely because there are many problems in discrete geometry that are included in this kind of questions. For example, if, yes, not necessarily. I mean, there are just general points that are somewhere there. There. So this problem includes a full characterization of something answering this. Of course, it solves a lot of problems in discrete geometry that we have no hope to solve for at this time. For example, if we completely understand the problem for pre-orders, well, pre-orders includes, of course, the case in which some distances are equal. And if we can say which are all the possible or other realizable orders, sorry, pre-orders. Orders, sorry, pre-orders. And in particular, we will know how many times a unit distance could be repeated, right? So this is way out of reach. So this one here includes, for example, questions concerning unit distances. Similarly, we have distinct distances here. And of course, well, there are some other ones: maximum or maximum. Or maximum number of diameters, and so on. All right. So, understanding the full characterizations of the pre-orders that can be realized by points in Rd, it's just impossible. So, instead of trying to solve that, what we decided to do and what we started studying is to solve, well, first, an initial question on, say that we start with a specific number of points. We start with a specific number of points, end points, which is the minimal dimension in which we can represent all the possible orders or pre-orders or endpoints. And that one we can answer. We can answer in the following way. So let me pose the problem somewhere here. I know there is more Blackboard for but More blackboard, but they told me that I should use the green one. Yeah. So we focus on a more specific problem that is the following. A problem. Let's go to something more specific, which is the smallest. The smallest dimension B such that any pre-order or order, yeah, there are variants, just consider one of them, think of it. Just consider one of them, think of it as your favorite one, fix that one. So, the problem is: which is the smallest dimension this such that any pre-order or order on n choose to move. Remember, this is a set. This is the set of pairwise of pairs. This is a set of pairs so that any order on this guy can be realized. As the order, well, as the pre-order or order induced by an example or by the pairwise distances of endpoints. Endpoints in RD. All right. Small example. So say we have this order. Well, as you may imagine now, if we are talking about pre-orders, well, this number Well, this number of cores will increase, for example, if I ask for too many equal distances. Well, I need a high dimension to realize that. But also in the case of orders, and here is a small example. Let me just give a small example. So in which dimension can we realize The following one, two less than, no, sorry, this isn't the previous one, two, three, less than one, three, less than one, two, less than three, four, less than two, four, and less than one, four. This is a small, easy problem, maybe for a discrete geometry course, first days of a first discrete geometry course. First, um, discrete geometry course. So let's suppose that we have to place some points somewhere. I don't know yet whether on R or R2 or where. But the thing is that I want to place some points here, maybe on the real line, that would be ideal, so that the distances satisfy this pre-order. All right, this order. Actually, this one is an order. This one is an order. So, in order to do that, I have to place the point somewhere here. Of course, there are things that I can see immediately from the order because one, four is the largest distance. Then, of course, one has to be one extreme and four has to be the other extreme. Otherwise, well, it won't work out without loss of generality. This one is one and this one is four. And now I have to decide which one of these is two and which one is three. And if that is possible, then I have to make some small adjustments. Make some small adjustments in order to make all these inequalities hold. However, it will be as easily seen that the arrangement is impossible, because if you take a look at this one, three, four less than two, four, what this one is saying is that this one must be three, right? And that this one must be four, because three should be closer to four than two. So three, four is. So three, four is shorter than two, four, therefore three is closer to four. But on the other hand, we also have this condition that says something that contradicts this fact, right? Because now we must have one tree less than one, two, or shorter than one, two. But since we tree is already fixed here, well, this distance is larger than this one here, and this one cannot hold. So this example cannot be realized on. Example cannot be realized in R. Yes. So this example is impossible to realize in R. However, well, I won't do it here on the blackboard, but you can think a little bit about it. And actually this one, you can realize it on the plane, right? So it is, I assured you that it is possible to find four points on the plane such that the distances and when you compare them yield this ordering. Yield this ordering of the distances. This is just a small example, just like to understand a little bit more of the phenomenon. What have we realized to do so far that is already published? Well, we understood, we basically completely solved the question that is asked here. So, if I want an ordering for endpoints, Want an ordering for end points. We know exactly which is the smallest dimension in which we have to be in order to realize all the possible orderings. Let me make a small table because, as I told you, there are many variants for this problem. So, results. So, we have the following: the minimal dimension. Exactly, for a given n, I will state in that table, which is the minimal d in which all the possible orderings for end points can be realized. And except for one case, but there are some small improvements. There is a large improvement, and then there is a small question left. So the minimal dimension in which all orders orders reorders bipartite. Bipartite orders and bipartite preorders can be realized on orders, sorry, on endpoints.  N minus one and minus one. So these two are tabets. This one is also tabet. Of course, there is a catch for the bipartite version. I'll say that in a moment, because the bipartite version does not depend on a single parameter, right? It depends on two parameters that are the sizes of A and B. All right. All right. So we have managed to prove all the following. Thanks. So, how do you read that table? Let me give some examples of some interesting things happening in this table. Say, for example, that I'm speaking about bipartite pre-orders. Yes? And where we have an exact... Where we have an exact bound. So, example. I'm choosing that one because it has also a nice relation with another problem on unit distances. So, as an example, consider bipartite reorders and consider the lower bound. So, what the lower bound is saying is that there is an example of Of A reorder on A times B with A with end points and B with n points such, well, that requires dimension. Min N M Let me tell you why this one is interesting because of course you can read the table, but this one is one of the most interesting ones. Because suppose that we are not thinking about pre-orders, but about unique distances. Okay? Let's suppose we are talking about unique distances and that the only thing that would block our That would block our examples are unit distances. So, what happens if I require all the distances to be equal, all the bipartite distances to be equal? All of this, all of this, all of these distances to be equal to one. And here I have end points, and here I have endpoints. Do you have any intuition for which is the minimum required? For which is the minimum required dimension for this to happen? Yes? No. Four. So regardless of the number of points that you place here and the number of points that you place here, you can always place as many points as you want with bipartite distances equal to one. With bipartite distances equal to one, in R4. This is a classical example. This is probably an S1 times S1, right? If you take any points from here and any points from here, well, the distance is the same, basically. So this is nice because on the other hand, well, what this example is saying is that for unit distances, we can go as large as we want with M and N. And well, it seems that there is no. And well, it seems that there is no obstruction or no problem with constructing an example satisfying that all these distances are equal with just dimension four. However, what we managed to prove, say for example, for this one, is that there is an example of a pre-order here. So if we choose carefully which ones are equal and which ones are larger than another one or smaller than another one, then there are bipartite examples that cannot be. That cannot be created, that cannot be realized by points on R4, and that actually require arbitrarily large dimensions in order to be realized, which is nice. This is something different happening from the, say, only considering unit distances problem. There are some other things that I'd like to say, maybe just to tell you about the techniques. So, this is just to mention. So, this is just to mention that this one is interesting. Of course, in order to create things for this column, what you need to do is to create, to propose orderings or pre-orderings that will fail. And in order to the lower bound for all of this, well, we exhibit the order and then the argument to show that it is non-realizable. It depends a lot on which one we are doing. For example, this one for pre-orders can be. For pre-orders, can be proven with the say maximum distances problem. Well, there is also another proof that uses a lot of equal distances. This one here, let me see which one. Well, this one, that one there, but we impose some restrictions and those restrictions impose some affine independence condition on the points on one side of the partition. So we can impose that kind of restrictions. We only use it in the ordering of the distances. The ordering of the distances. There is also another one here, which is kind of interesting because we propose an ordering, and the reason because it fails is because of Helly's theorem. So we find some sets that should intersect D plus one by D plus one because of the ordering conditions, but we show that they have empty intersections, so that fails. So this side here, as you can imagine, lots of creativity and lots of kind of trying to check. kind of trying to check which orderings or which kind of properties the ordering impose on examples. On the other hand, for the constructions, for the upper bound size, we repeatedly use either the following result or variants or adaptations, which is well, maybe can be. Well, maybe it can be thought of as a linear algebra technique. The main result that we use in order to construct the upper bounds for any given ordering is the following theorem by Schoenberg. The theorem says the following. So it says that the matrix A in say the plus one R given by graph. I will write the entries with a little bit of shifted notation. A0, A 0, no, sorry, A A 0 C. A A00, A01, A0D, because it's D plus one, but I start in zero. A one zero A one one A one D A D zero A D one A D D contains the pairwise. The pairwise distances of a set of endpoints, no, sorry, d plus one points d zero p d in R D, of course, in the obvious way, for the distance of Pi and Pj. Of P I and P J is the entry A I J if and only if and only if asymmetric And well, of course, we need all of them. I can put here greater than or equal to zero. A is symmetric, and this other matrix, which is in M V this time, so one and This time, so one entry less given by M I'll write, I just explicitly write it A zero one squared plus A zero one squared minus A one one squared then A Then a zero one squared plus a zero two squared minus a one two squared it goes on a one zero squared plus a no zero it's still zero now this one is zero two a zero one squared minus a two one squared and so on and so forth. Squared and so on and so forth. So, what you do with the ijth entry in general m i j is one half because of this one half of a zero i squared plus a zero j squared minus a j squared is positive semi-definite. This is a nice result. This is a linear algebra result. If you are familiar with the book by Matrusek, 33 Miniatures in Linear Algebra, this is one of the results in one of the chapters. And actually, he has a very, very nice proof there. So you can check the theory and to see why this works. So it somehow characterizes in terms of a say, so to say, generalized triangle inequality. Generalized triangle inequality stated by this positive semi-definitiveness when some numbers are the perwest distances of a set of points. Now, this one we can use sometimes and directly, actually just maybe for this one here, for pre-orders, in order to understand how we can construct them. And well, the proof is actually not that difficult once we have this. Difficult ones, we have this result for this one here. But then we have to make careful adaptations in order to use these results several times in order to make some examples that can be glued together in order to create examples for all of these other upper bounds. All right. Well, the details, probably I won't have a lot of time to talk to them about you, but just think about, say, the case for But just think about, say, the case for pre-orders and n minus one. That one is kind of easy to understand because what we want is to be able to describe all the or to impose conditions on the on the lengths of the simplex, right? Because we are in one dimensionless. And that sounds kind of in theory easy to do. If we have a tetrahedron R3, probably I can impose the ordering of the edges as. Ordering of the edges as well, however I want. Yeah. And well, in order to actually formalize how to do that, we can do some continuity argument showing that the tetrahedra actually exists because it exists. And then we just make small changes to the entries of this matrix to get the desired comparisons. And well, as I said, the other ones are just gluing together many of these examples. As you can see, there is an open program. As you can see, there is an open problem here. What Edgardo and the student Gerardo Maldonado managed to prove is that for n and n plus one, the minimum distance is n. Sorry, the minimal dimension is n, but there is still an open case over here that cannot be, where we still cannot solve. And of course, well, they're having this one. Having this, one can start asking some combinatorial questions like how many possible orderings can be realized, right? So now we have some forbidden configurations, but asymptotically, how many of them can be realized or not? And that's it. Thank you very much. There is a general value to determine if a given order can be realized in a given dimension. No, we still don't have any order and we think that it will be very hard to have that one because it will solve some important problems. Maybe, maybe the things are nice enough in R for dimension one. So we still don't have a criteria for R1. And we think that that one is probably And we think that that one is probably doable, but we haven't found one. Yes. I don't know. That's a good question. I mean, which one? For for general D, I think that yeah, probably whether to realize a given order or not. Whether to realize a given order or not. That's an excellent question. I mean, we don't even have any algorithm for R, for dimension one. Probably R, I mean, if one thing, say, for example, intersection of convex sets in R, whether to know if you have a nerve or not, and that one is kind of solvable. But in higher dimensions, it's become complicated. Probably this will become very complicated very quickly as well. Very quickly as well. But I don't know, we can think about it. So that was just sort of easy. Yes. You mean linear, a linear program? Well, maybe we can talk about that one. That one, yeah, yes, but if I only restrict myself to complete order, yes, and if you don't have a final set of tricky cover to examples, but uh I wonder if we can take a random one with that verse with the high possibility sorry for which for which version? Which one? This one, the And then I can just ask, I take a random complete order, right? Isn't that the one randomly put them in order? I didn't even have the expected value, but we have no intuition on that. We have no intuition on that. And that one, that one is, I mean, as of now, I have no idea whether if more, asymptotically, more orderings are realizable or not, or dimension one. So I don't know if a random one would work in order to not be representable with high probability, but maybe. No, but maybe trying to understand for a general ordering which is the Which is the expected dimension, or something like that? Could be all right. Now we
