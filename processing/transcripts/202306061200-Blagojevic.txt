So he's there. So he's there. Hi, Pablo. Hi, Anos. Good to see you. Likewise, I'm sorry for not being there. We are also sorry, but you are televised here. Yes, believe it or not, you have an audience. So, well, welcome by TV to Oaxaca. And this is Pablo Blagojevich, and he will talk about many partitions of many arrangements. And you have certain Have 38 minutes. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you, Janos. I'm sorry for not being there, and I will try to give you an idea about many partitions. I want to say, explain what means many and what are the mass assignments. What I'm going to talk about, it is a joint work with Michael Krab, and it builds on the work by Haime, Michael, and Haime, Michael, and Alexandra that came up last year, and this one has many more features. And I just want to share with you an idea and how a new setup comes around. And for that one, we start as usual with a very old setup. And I will first try to explain what is a Grimbaugh-Handwiger-Ramos problem. And many of you know about it and worked on it. And worked on it successfully. And first of all, the first notion I want to talk about is an affine hyperplane. For me, V is always Euclidean, a real vector space, which means I have a scalar product. I don't particularly care what it is. And alpha hyperplane for me is given by two ingredients with a vector u on the On the sphere, unit sphere of the European space V, and the real number A, what I want to have is I have a direction U, and on the distance, which can be, of course, negative A, I have a hyperplane which is perpendicular to the half line. And in formula, this is my hyperplane where this difference is equal to zero. Okay. To zero. Okay, usual thing, nothing significantly happened. But now I, with this notation, I have two more ingredients. I have two half spaces, one positive. In this case, this would be the positive half space. For me, closed or open does not matter. And I will indicate that it is oriented by u. U looks into the half space and minus u here looks into this half. Here looks into this half space. So actually, I have oriented alpha hyperplane. I know what's an orientation, and it's given by my vector u. And I know what's a left half space, positive actually, and what's a negative. All this I will just denote by h ua. And we can play a bit just for a second. Notice if you change the sign of u and a. Of U and A, what is going to happen to our hyperplane? Well, the set will stay the same, only interchange will happen between these two half spaces. So I'm just changing the orientation of my oriented affine hyperplane. Okay, that's the first thing. The second thing is I want not one hyperplane, I want more, and I just call a K arrangement. I just call a k arrangement or just arrangement-oriented hyperplanes ordered collection of k of them. So I have some amount of them, and I also have directions which tells me what's positive, what's negative. Having this in mind, I can also define ortons. And one way to define an ortant is the following one. So I take a vector, actually, a collection of unit vectors. Collection of unit vectors, k-tuple, from this product. Notice that this is actually a finite set, and I can even call it z2 because I have two elements at every place to the k, like a group z2 to the k, just the different presentation. For an element of this set, I have a particular ortant defined by a hyper by arrangement and this k vector. This is just intersection of corresponding half-space. Section of corresponding half spaces. For example, this is an ortant, which is encoded by our hyperplane arrangement, and three vectors, which are unit vectors from this collection. The other way to look at ortons, if you don't care which one you want to take, you can say just ortons are connected components of the V without union. V without union of an arrangement, nothing else. Okay, with these two notions, I can talk about Grimoire-Hadeger mass partition problem in Euclidean space V. And deliberately, I'm going to work with a little bit different setup. So I simplify my life when I define a mass assignment. So, first of all, I'm going to look at the collection of functions with the compact support. With the compact support. So I can take an integral. They are continuous with compact support. And I am going to look at arrangement. And I will say that this arrangement, equiparts, this collection of, I can say, functions, measures, doesn't matter. If for every function in this collection and every actually order, this is a parameterization of ortons, the integral of the function over. Of the function over the ortant is exactly one over two to the k integral over all, so each ordant gets the same. And the question proposed by Ramos, which has a long history, which starts with Herm-Sandrich theorem, which is the first instance of this problem, and then with the results of Greenbaum, where he looked only at one measure instead of Looked only at one measure instead of J measures and only asked for equipartition of one measure. Then it was extended a bit by Fadwiger. And then finally, in full generality, it was stated by Ramos. And he asked for finding a function delta j k, exact values or some approximation, which is the minimal dimension of the Euclidean vector space, such that the following property holds, that for every collection of J. Every collection of J functions on this vector space with the compact support, continuous with the compact support, there exists always an arrangement of k affine hyperplanes such that this arrangement equiparts simultaneously all the measures. So that's the question. Determine the function delta j k. This is a classical question. Question and we know some results on it, not actually too much. We know, for example, that delta d1 is equal to d. What does this mean? I have d measures and the minimal dimension where I can equip d measures simultaneously is one by one. The hyperplane is d. Sorry. On the other hand, On the other hand, if you are asking for one measure and two hyperplanes, so arrangement of two hyperplanes, the minimal dimension is plane, two-dimensional thing. Then delta two is equal to three. So two measures, two hyperplanes, minimal dimension is three. One measure, three hyperplanes, minimal dimension is three. And we have actually lower and upper bound for the And upper bound for the full function. That's somehow the classical results. The first result, just a bit of names, is actually a statement of a ham sandwich, which tells you that in Rd, when you have D measures, you can equip them by one hyperplane. That's actually ham sandwich, with the addition that if you have d plus one measures concentrated, for example, on the vertices of a zero. Example on the vertices of a simplex, there is no hyperplane that will simultaneously touch them, so you cannot do this with more measures. Then, the first, this result is due to Greenbaum and these two to Hadwiger, where the first one implies the second with a nice trick. The lower bounds are due to Avis and Ramos, while the upper bound comes from the work of Manilawica, Vereczica, and Zhuvalevich. And we know a few more exact values, and I'll just pick two of them to give you here. Delta two three is five and delta four three is equal to ten. This was actually obtained in the end by counting so-called iterated or concatenated gray chords and asking for parity of discount. This is a classical setup. This is what we know. This is what we know. And as you can see, not really much. And as usual in mathematics, when you don't know much, you generalize. Let's see more complicated problem, more complicated setup. Can we say anything about it? And this goes back to recent few years to Schneider, Pablo, and others, where we change the setup. And what is the setup? I look at the And what is the setup? I look at the real vector bundle. E is a real vector bundle, Euclidean, which means I have a Euclidean structure on any fiber over, let's say, compact, suitable topological space. I don't care for this lecture about properties of this space. So I have B. At every point, I have one vector space. So a vector bundle can be thought of, and these are zeros, thought of as a family. Thought of as a family of vector spaces where we see our base space as just collecting zeros of these vector spaces inside. So E is a total space, union of all these vector spaces, and B is parameter space. Okay, that's the ambient. So what do we want to partition? And these are this word of mass assignment. In order to just not work. Just not work with masses. I use this idea to talk about continuous function on the total space to R, where continuous and compact support will allow me to integrate. So I look at J different functions on the total space with the property of continuity and compact support. Of course, you can generalize this, but for the purpose of this talk, it doesn't really contribute anything. And what is the To anything. And what is the question? Generalized Grimbaum-Hadwiger problem or problem for mass assignments. Determine delta E. Now it depends on the vector bundle you picked. So many vector bundles. You want to determine all the pairs j, k such that for every collection of j functions, there exists now a point in the base space and there exists a k arrangement. Exists a k arrangement inside this vector space. So if this is the point B, I'm looking for an affine arrangement of subspaces in there, which will equip. So here's an arrangement which will equip part now restrictions of these functions to this EB, to the fiber. To the fiber. So, once more, just to be certain, I have a family of vector spaces and now and on it a family of functions. And I want to find one vector space where something happens. And I hope that I can do better than when I'm working with one vector space without any parametrization. So that's the hope. So the question is: what can we say about the Is what can we say about delta E? Of course, this depends on the bundle, and what is the interaction between this set and the topology of it? So what should we know? And the result we have so far is that the pairs of integers j and k with the following properties. Let me not read, it's not really important to come around, is a subset of delta. Is a subset of delta E of the bundle. This is a tautological bundle of L-dimensional subspace over the Grassmannian of L-dimensional subspaces in D-dimensional vector space, real vector space. So this is a classical thing to start since all the real vector bundles are pulled back of the autological vector bundle over Grassmannian. Why not ask the question first for this bundle? And this was done. And this was done by Carlos Krav, Dmitrievich, Blagovich, and myself. And the tools we apply there are heavily relying on spectral sequences and really, you could say, exotic tools. And today, I will not mention any of it and will not really use any of it. So that's the aim. Now, in order to simplify life even more, and I will move up in the world. And I will move up in the world and follow the idea of Matoshek and Barani from their paper on partitions of diphens, where they move from the plane to the sphere. And for that reason, I am going to consider a homomorphism of a vector space V embedded in V plus R on the height minus one, where this is a unit sphere. A unit sphere, and I will just look at lambda. Is you take a point, take the origin, take the line, and here's lambda of v if this is v. This is a homomorphism with the following properties. First of all, great circles on the sphere are mapped to, of course, intersected with the lower hemisphere corresponding to affine hyper. Are corresponding to alphine hyperplanes in V, which is very nice feature. And of course, measures in the Euclidean space can be pulled to the measures on the sphere. And so suddenly compactness becomes no problem whatsoever, compact support. And of course, now instead of affine hyperplanes, I can look at great circles, which are intersections of linear hyperplanes. Intersections of linear hyperplanes and a sphere. So, in some sense, I simplify my life, I extend the problem, solving the problem on the sphere will imply solution of the problem in the Euclidean space. Knowing this, I can go back and instead in this setup, instead of saying I will look at all the functions from e to R, I will say. To R, I will say I will look at the continuous functions, no necessity for compact support anymore. From the associate sphere bundle, what is that? In every vector space, I just take the sphere and take the union of all these spheres. So why not? Of course, I increase the dimension by one, and then I look for E, delta S of V, all J case such that all for every J functions. Every j functions from the sphere bundle from S of E to R, the same holds. So I just switch from Euclidean space to a sphere and not even take too much care about it. In this way, I moved from alpha hyperplanes to linear and also from continuous functions with compact support only to continuous functions. Support only to continuous functions. Okay, having this in mind, now the new setup is: I have a Euclidean vector bundle over path-connected vector space. I have associated sphere bundle and I have a continuous function j of them on this sphere bundle, and I want to equip them. The same problem. Well, what is the question? What is the question general? Is there a point B and a hyperplane and arrangement of now linear hyperplanes? So that's important. In EB, this is a fiber over B such that for every function between 1 and J, and every two connected components, these are Ortons. So connected components of the complement. So connected components of the complement integral of μi over this ortant first is equal to the integral to the over the second order, everything on the sphere. So that's the question. Can I find for the given bundle a point and arrangement such that these functions are equiparted there? Okay, so let's build a configuration test map scheme completely different from the one. Completely different from the ones used before. And I will try to explain what are some advantages of them. So I start with the classical one. I change the classical one to motivate the change in the mass assignment case. I take the Euclidean vector space. Let's say that it's a dimension. And then I have a unit sphere there. This is S of V, and P of V is just a set of all one-dimensional subspaces, a projective space of V. Projective space of V. V is Euclidean space, has topology, and therefore this one has a Portium topology. Now, H of V is a Hopfline bundle, which means this is a set of pairs in the product projective space times the vector space, so pairs L V, such that this vector V belongs to a line. This is a classical object in algebraic topology. And now I want to look for the space of all solutions. The space of all solutions. What are solutions? Well, all k-tuples of hyperplanes. Well, hyperplanes, now, but linear hyperplanes. So they are parametrized all by projective space to the k because you have duality between projective space and the space of all hyperplanes by taking the orthogonal complement. If you take, on the other hand, the sphere in each In each instance, then instead of all linear subspaces, you get all oriented linear subspaces. There is a natural map from here to here, and this map is 2K covering. Okay. One question: What is the fiber? For L. For lines L1 to Lk, the fiber of this bundle is just the product of the sphere L1 to the Lk, sphere over Lk. And here's a trick which I would ask if I was present. So, what is the cardinality of this set? And the answer is actually, this is a finite set because this is a line. This is S0 times times S0. times times s0 and this is just two to the k points so the fiber here is only finite okay and now i look at the real vector bundle of dimension two to the k over the product of projective spaces where fiber at these k points these are k hyperplanes is the real vector space of all maps from the product of this maps from the product of these spheres to R. As I explained, this is a finite set. This is a real vector space of dimension 2 to the k. But the nice thing about it is that we keep the track for every point, we know exactly the collection of unit vectors which determine us ortons. So this is a family actually of ortons determined by the arrangement. Now Now, if I have a function from the sphere to R, then it induces so-called section of this vector bundle where you just take k hyperpoint, take a particular function, so at v1 to vk to be the integral of the function of the corresponding ortant. And what you want to achieve is that this section always gives you a function. Section always gives you exact values. But the first thing to notice is: since this is the space of all functions, you can take the constant function and it will give you a trivial bundle which you factor out. This is a trivial bundle. So the question we want to answer is: is it true, and this is a purely topological question, that the bundle, that this bundle, this is a Bayes space, has a section, which means. Space has a section, which means a continuous map backwards, such that composition, section, projection is identity. And in topology, the answer to such questions, saying that which you want to say that the section has to hit zero at some point, is that the corresponding Euler class is different from zero. And so a configuration test map scheme theorem tells you if the Euler class Theorem tells you if the Euler class of this thing is not zero, then this delta spherical j k is less than equal to the dimension of v. So, this is a main result for the configuration test map scheme. It can be seen with some effort that the vector bundle is actually a tensor product of these direct sums of the pulled backs, which will be useful later. And now, when we know this in the classic Now, when we know this in the classical case, let's mimic it in the case when we have not one vector space, but a family of vector spaces. So I start with the vector bundle. And like before, instead of sphere, I have associated sphere bundle over B. Instead of the projective space, I have a bundle of a projective bundle over B. This means I take a point in B instead of the fiber EB, now I look. Of the fiber EB, now I look at as fiber a projective space of EB at every point. And finally, I have a Hoff bundle, but now over POV, over projective bundle, which now is a collection of point line in the fiber and a vector in the fiber. These are just equivalent notions we had before. What is the situation? What is the situation? Well, I can start, and I want to consider now all the arrangements. These are solutions, now linear arrangements. I'm sorry. I want all the linear arrangements, but in one fiber. And I start not with that. I just take a line in one fiber, I take a line in another fiber, k of them. And this is actually too much, and this does not contribute to anything. But this is nevertheless a classical vector. Nevertheless, a classical vector bundle. What I do next, I embed B, just a Bay space by a diagonal embedding, sending just X to a pair XX inside this bundle and pull back this vector bundle back, which means now at every point I have a collection of projective spaces over this point, not arbitrary, everything. Arbitrary. Everything is now over the point. And similarly, I can do this with the sphere. I have a projection here and I have a nice vector bundle structure. So now candidates for a solution space, these are all families of k arrangements in fibers, and these are all families of k arrangements, but now oriented k arrangements in the fibers. So these are so-called. So, these are so-called fiber products. Okay. And now, again, a vector bundle, which will help me get my configuration test map scheme and tell me topological thing to work with. It's again AK, but now it depends on E, and I define it in the same way. For a collection of lines in now projective space of the fiber to the K, I consider all the functions. I consider all the functions, this is a finite set, to R. Again, in the same way, a function now from the sphere bundle defines a section of this vector bundle. Again, this vector bundle has a trivial one, and I want that these sections actually hit the zero when I quotient out the trivial bundle. And so the thing. So, the thing I want is to consider the j direct sum of this vector bundle. And it is over this base space. This is a fiberwise projective product of projective bundles. And I want to understand whether every section of this bundle becomes zero at some point. And then my problem is solved. So the theorem tells. Solved. So the theorem tells us that if the order class of this bundle, whatever it is, is different from zero, our problem is solved. Okay, so that's the issue to work with. Now, the next question is, why change of the perspective? Why didn't I follow what we did with Jaime, Crab, first, and Alexandra? So we have this button. So we have this bundle. This is rather general, and now I can put constraints. I can actually look for more solutions. This is this many partitions. With this theorem, I solve one problem, but now I can, for example, instead of one bundle, look at k different sub-bundles of E. This puts constraints on the choice of the hyperplane arrangements. I allow only the normal vectors to belong to one of these. To one of these sub-bundles. And then I just pull back my vector bundle here, and still I have the same configuration test map scheme. So instead of that, I can also look for maybe partition by mutually orthonormal hyperplanes. So instead of looking at this fiber product, I look at these collections such that these lines are mutually orthogonal. And again, Mutually orthogonal. And again, I pull back and consider this. So, this setup allows me to look at many problems simultaneously from one viewpoint. And let me just try to share in, I think, last eight minutes one of the main results. So, the aim is to understand what is the other class. And if I can say something about non-being zero, I sold my. Non-being zero, I solved my problem, whatever that is. And what is the strategy? I started with the geometrical problem, made it more complicated, did the transition to topology, these other classes, and what I am going to end up is actually algebra. And let's do this. So if I want to understand all the classes, one of the ways to which would suffice it to be non-zero is to say, okay, I will not look at the other class, I will look at Oller class, I will look at the top corresponding Stifel-Witting class. This is a dimension of the Stifel-Witting class, and where does it live? It lives in the cohomology of this ugly space. Well, the first job is to understand this cohomology, and it turns out that it's not, it can be done. And the cohomology is isomorphic to you have a polynomial ring in k variables as many as. ring in k variables as many as you have factor these bundles these are variables x1 to xk but the coefficients are in cohomology of b so the cohomology of the base space comes into play and you portion out by ideals where in the polynomials we generate ideal comes different witny classes of your bundle still depends on the base space depends on the Euler class On the Stifler Witni classes. Okay, that's one side of the picture, but what about a Stiflerwitni class? Do we know what it is? And it turns out we know, in this case, for J, this is AK to B is a product of all linear non-zero polynomials to the J. This is so-called top-Dixon invariant to J, a classical object. And now the question. Object. And now the question is when this polynomial does not belong to this ideal, because then this polynomial will be non-zero in this quotient ring. So finally, a pure algebraic question with a catch that topology comes in the language of the cohomology of the Bayes space and in the cohomology in the Stiffer-Witting classes. But I want to get rid of them. To get rid of them, so I don't really like to have this in the picture. Also, I can generalize this very easily. The same calculation comes, just bundle changes to pullback. You have instead of this fiber product, you have fiber product where particular vector bundles are different. This class is the same, but here the ideal changes a bit. So the same. A bit. So the same proof goes there. So I can generalize rather easily, or not so. And then one of the theorems tells me if I know this number, ik, which depends on k bundles, this is a maximum j such that this polynomial does not belong to the ideal. This is when I have a problem, when I have that my Euler class is not zero. And then if j is less than this, I have a solution. This, I have a solution. So, everything that I want to understand is to compute these numbers. If I know these numbers, I have results. So, I can forget about everything and just for a moment think about numbers ik, which depends on the bundles. And still, I would like them not to depend on the bundles. This is not something I like. And then we start studying them, and you prove first that this yotta i of a vector bundle, which by definition, Of a vector bundle, which by definition is this maximum, is actually a maximum of all j's such that this Stifel-Witting class of the all class or the inverse class, inverse bundle is non-zero. In particular, for a tautological bundle, this is d minus one. This can be calculated, and moreover, here's a transition to not knowing anything about vector space. About vector space, I define one more collection of numbers, ik, which depends on the natural numbers m1 to mk. This is maximal j such that a k p of the point, which means there is no topological space to the j, belong, does not belong to this ideal. Okay, so I have two numbers. It would be wonderful if they are equal. This would mean that this number in this case, This number in this case does not depend on the topology of B or E. And it turns out that you can prove a theorem that if some product of some of homology classes is non-zero, then this number which rules my solutions is actually equal to this number which does not depend whatsoever on the topology if we know, of course, these values. These values. So, this is the first important transition. And then, suddenly, just what I said, this one depends on B and this one does not if you know these values. Okay, in this way, you can reprove the result we got previously, saying that if j is 2 to the t plus r, where r is less than 2 to the t. R is less than 2 to the t and of course positive. And if d is bigger or equal to this amount, then the pair J K belongs to delta S of now tautological abundance. So here there is no topology, just numbers. Finally, what can we get with this approach? Well, we can get partitional results for. Partitional results for orthogonal arrangements. We get algebraic criterions which can be tested. Then we can get a fairbread sandwich theorem of accelerod fried and soberon. Then again, sphere partition by affine functions where we use.  So I'm sorry for dying off. I hope it will share now. Yes, sorry. Final, yeah, two minutes. Partition results of with the affine functions, partitions by spherical wedge of Schneider and also Soberon and Takahashi. And finally, we can extend results of Wooden. Can extend results of Gut and Katz, Gut and Dimitriz Blagovich Sigler and myself. And of course, the question is: what comes next? And one of the partition problems we many of us considered is Nandakuma Ramana Rau in the Euclidean plane, in the Euclidean space. And now the question is: can we do it for mass assignment? What means if I have a vector bundle, can I find Vector bundle, can I find a point, a fiber, and a convex partition such that corresponding functions are equalize? And this will come as a joint work with Michael Krab and Tatiana Lewinson very soon, where the topology framework again changed to so-called fiber-wise configuration spaces and became rather unexpectedly hard. So I would. So, I would stop at this moment and thank you for the opportunity to talk, despite I'm not present. Thank you for that. Thank you very much, Pablo, for the nice talk. Maybe we have time for one question. Yes. Pablo, with this method, so with this new setting, you can recover a lot of. So, with this new setting, you can recover a lot of previous results. Is there any one of them where you can improve or get something that wasn't so? An improvement on bounce of those results? So, bounds you cannot improve for some reason. You see, this is the reason for not getting improvement. So, in many cases, whenever this happens, and this happens. This happens, and this happens for example for Grassmannians that this is this product is different from zero. Uh, whatever bundles you take here are completely equal, while you completely forget the space with the classical result. What you get improvement is as probably, you know, you get it for all bundles of in between, you get improvement, but not beyond the bounds of the classical case. So, of course, now instead of Hams and HEM sandwich does not hold any does not hold for I don't know five measures in R3 but now but for in the mass assignment if you have in R5 you can find a cut so a linear hyperplane linear three-dimensional space such that five measures will be equiparted by one hyperplane but we cannot go beyond five and that's the problem And that's the problem. And my suspicion is, I didn't investigate, is that there is some topological reason for that. And this should be looked for a counterexample in examples for existence of vector existence of sections of, for example, tautological vector boundary. There is another quick question, and this will be the last one. In this vector bundle, how is the dimension of the fiber involved in the solution? It turns out it's not. So, when you get this result in this case of the theorem, for every dimension of the fiber between one and the whole dimension, you get the same result, which is quite surprising. Okay, so thank you very much again. We have the next talk starting in my Next talk starting in minus three minutes. So, thank you for the nice presentation. Thank you very much.
