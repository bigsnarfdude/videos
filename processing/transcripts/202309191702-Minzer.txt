staying for the rest of the day so I know that I'm the one said that I think you're from dinner so I'll try to make it quick and uh simple. So this talk is about something that is related to optimization problems in the sense that I'll show it but the whole view that we are going to take here is really inspired by the first topic we saw today by Homein. And I hope to make it clear but if I I hope to make it clear, but if I don't matter, then we'll be on. So I'll start with explaining what is parallel condition. And this is a concept that is very popular in TCP and in cryptography, but I'm not going to define things power. I'm just going to give it by example. So what is power competition? So let's consider So let's consider a very simple game, the 3D New game, which I may defined earlier today. So we have a set of variables, x1 to xn and we have a collection of equations, u1 to en and each equation is a linear equation of f2 involving three of the variables from x. Let's say x1. Let's say x1 plus x7 plus x12 is equal to 1. And you know, whenever you get some system of equation like that, usually your goal is to find an assignment that satisfies as many of the equations as possible. That's fine. Now, I want to turn it into the language of parallel petition, and for that, I'm going to basically view this optimization problem. Basically, view this optimization problem as a one-one protocol with a verifier and two pairs. So let's imagine that we have some system of equations like that, and we have a verifier, and the verifier wishes to study whether this system is highly satisfiable. Remember, if there is an assignment that satisfies at least 99% of this equation. At least 99% of these equations, or maybe it's not very satisfactory. Maybe you can only do 51%. Now, the developer is completely bound. He cannot do it by himself. So he asked the help of two groups that do not talk to each other, which we are going to call Alex and Bob. So, the doorflower is going to ask them some questions, they are going to give them some answers, and the base of that is Him some answers and based off that he's going to need to make a decision whether this is highly satisfiable or not. What is he going to do? Well, there is not so much he can do. He's going to pick an equation of uniformic random. Let's say it is x plus x k plus x k equals b is going to send all of its variables to Alice. All of its variables to Alice. It's going to send one of the variables chosen uniformly to both. Then the verifier gets from each one of them an assigned good variables. So from Alice, he gets three bits. From Bob, he gets one bit. He gets one read. And then the developer is going to make two checks. He's going to check that this assignment that Talis gave him satisfies the equation. And secondly, that Alice and Bob are consistent on the shared variable. Okay, so that's that's the simplest protocol you can think about. And here is a claim that you can easily show. So if this system is at least one of the exceptions, it is favorable. Then there are strategies for Isenborg that makes the verifier accept with probability at least one is epsilon. Two well, now. Do well, now I'm going to say that if the system is not very satisfiable, then they cannot do that well. So if the system is at most, let's say half as data set fellow, then ISNO can win, with probability, a cost five or six. That's that one. So don't stress about this difference between half and five over six. This is not the point. This is the point is that you get two numbers that are bounded away from each other. So this indeed helps the verifier distinguish between these two cases. But you know, we're talking about one versus five or six. Not a nothing to write on about. So how can the verifier gain more confidence? The verifier gain more confidence that the system is indeed highly satisfied. Now, of course, they can play this game again and again and again and again, but this is called sequential repetition and it's not that useful in harvest approximation. What turns out to be more useful is what is called parallel repetition. Okay. I'll amplify it. I will amplify one out of it. So here, the valid file is going to change to choose, instead of a single equation, they are going to choose multiple equations. So it's going to choose M equations uniformly condominium apparently. It's going to send Lattice all the variables. Let's say I send just all the equation. I send to both one value from each equation. Question and give me the usual answers, they tell me what these variables put together. And I repeat this check for each one of the equations. Okay, so what can we say about this protocol? So, by the way, it's been convenient for me to To so let me call this psi, this is called the basic aim, and it's going to be convenient for me to define this notion which is called value psi, which is the maximum probability that Alice and Boff can win. And then naturally the notation here would be 5 tens of m times. Because I requires m times independently. Okay, so what can we say? Well, if the system is highly satisfiable, then you know, ISABOC can use their own strategy. They can pick a good assignment to begin with, and then they do pretty well. So, in the S case, so if X is at least one second set, they can win with probability, which is at least one minute of exactly. probability which is at least one means epsilon to them which usually is just close to one because you never take that number for the decision more than one on average so now the question is what about the size so if x is the most half a status up then what can you say well the value of The value of repeating n times independently. So we know each coordinate is done independently, each one will have probability value of psi. Do we know? You know, clearly this is at most valuable psi. And this is exponentially small. Done. And actually, this is So this is not the point of this talk, but this is actually what parallelism was suggested in a paper by Faulkner, Rompel and Sitzer. This is actually the proof that they gave. And it's a little bit problematic because it's actually just false because you can actually find games or if you do two competitions, the value remains exactly the same. So something So, something very interesting is going on here, and nevertheless, it is true that the value goes down exponentially in M, but the proof is highly non-trivial, and this was done by Van Rauspurs and using information theory. And in nature, the rather goes down exponentially down. Okay, my point here is that file condition is kind of a tricky beast. Things can look completely trivial, but then it's actually false and to actually get to work. You need quite any proofs. Okay. I gave you a very simple example for capital 1, many other hoofs were discovered, all of them are n none of them is particularly simple, and all of them applied to the case where we have two terms, ice and bottle. So we have two players, ice and bubble. The natural question is: what happens when you have multiplayer games? So, indeed, this question was asked in the recent papers. And you know, there is a class of games which is called connected games, which is very much related to the notion of connectivity. Related to the notion of connectivity that Amay discussed, for which, you know, if you squint at this proof hard enough, you can convince the information theory to work, and you can prove exponentially decaying balance like that. But in general, so I'm going to stick to three variables. It is known that if It is known that if the value of a gamma is smaller than one, then the value of the repeated gamma does go down to zero, but not in a very implicit manner. This uses a very, very heavy handler. This uses the best he had to actually win. And, you know, clearly this is logo status. It's supposed supposed to be exponential in AI. But this is the best that is known for general games. Okay, so then you have to study more restricted classes of games. And as I said, connected games are something that people studied. And they, in that paper, they identify In that paper, they identified a certain game which is called the DHZ game for which all of the techniques fail. This is the best that we knew. And actually, it's a game that comes from quantum physics. So I'm going to tell you this again now. So wherever I found that. And now we have stickers. So the verifier is going to sample x, y, and z from the distribution mu, which is the distribution of f2 to the 3, over inputs that sum up to 0. So, this is the charge that the derifer generates. The derifer is going to send each one of the players one of these inputs. The developer is going to get a bit from each one of them. Then the developer is going to accept if when they sum A, B, and C, the answers they are equal to X of Y over A. So this is this is again. It's a little bit weird, but It's a little bit of overwhelm game, but this is. So, what is so special about this game? Well, what I'm thinking is that if you look One thing is that if you look at any two players, let's say Alice and Charlie, then together they know all of the challenges. Therefore, you cannot take this three-player game and turn it into some two-player game that is interesting, because then the game becomes trivial. So that's one thing. Secondly, here are two facts that are not so difficult to prove, and they point out that this game is really different in some respect. In some respect. So if you look at the value of this again, then if you look at x or y or z, so there are four inputs that satisfy this. For three of them, this always one, for one of them, they always zero. So the best the player can do, currently, or player to be, to just guess this is one and try to hit it. So the value of this game doesn't be three quarters. But then, if you go beyond the realm of classical strategies, if you allow these players to have entangled quantum state, then it turns out they can do very well. But they can do perfectly well. Values one in the quantum world. And this is actually the reason that physicists, I think, looked at it. Looked at it, they, you know, physics is a very good name for poems, so they call this quantum telepathy, because you know, it's as if the players can communicate by their mic to get a value one. But at this point out, the disk game has something going for it, and it's not clear what to do. So, this is the GHC game. And if you try information theory, we don't know how to get. We don't know how to get anywhere, we cannot move anything. And as I said, this was the bottleneck for the techniques until there was this paper by Holm Gran. However, a few years ago, that managed to get non-trivial decay for the repetition of the DHC game. But they managed to get polynomial decay rates. And the pool field is by a combination of Fourier analysis and information field. And indeed, as predicted by earlier rogues, once they managed to Earlier Hawks, once they managed to get this result, they actually managed to get quite a nice family of three-player games for which they managed to this rate of decay. And at least to me, there doesn't seem to be any reason that this should be the true rate of decay. And you know, the truth should be exponential, and this is indeed what we proved. And return zero ID command of this. Okay. Yeah, so if I had a little bit more time I could actually give you the full proof of this. But I have like five to seven minutes. So I'm not going to give you the full proof. Instead I'm going to give you the main big idea. It's not going to be idea. You're going to see it. It looks very amusing. But once you have it But once you have it, you're kind of done, but then you realize it looks sort of arbitrary and it's not clear where it came from. So the key fact of the observation is the follow-up using fact. So let's look at the check with the verifier max. So, you know, we like linear things. So, you know, we like linear things. Linear things are good, linear algebra is good, we can solve it. So, we're happy with the left-hand side. But this whole business, I don't know, it's not that pleasant. And it would be really, really nice if we could convert it into some linear check. And it turns out that you can. So if you have x-rays in that sum up to zero. Then the answers satisfy the verifier if and only if they satisfy you, then you are going to get some equation. So this is equation module two. Then you are going to get some linear equation, but module four. So But model four. So this is really the main observation. And you know, once I tell you this observation, you know, it's ridic very it's kind of ridiculous to check it because check four things. And at last you can do it. Why look at it? I can explain. But let me first of all convince you that once you have it, you're in good shape. Or at least things are improving. Well, let's consider the repetition of the game. So now we're going to sample, you know, n things. We're going to send all of the x's to Alex, all of the y's to both. Nor of this is to Charlie. And the players are going to give us an answer for each one of the coordinates. A1 to AN, CI to CN, and BI to BN. So let's denote the strategy for ABC ABC. So A to N. So these are the strategies of the players and if they manage to do well in the game then the probability to exceed this absolute this probability is you can write it as following way. I'm not doing anything clever, I'm just copying down what it needs to be again. Here I mean, you know, I like vectors, so here I mean the vector where you do all each coordinates at option. So, what did we learn from this very deep observation? We learned that we can turn this into a linear check. So, we multiply by two and we turn the O into a sum. Then, you know, we shift around some things. So, we get 2a minus x plus 2b. minus x plus 2b minus y plus 2c minus z is equal to 0. Module 4. If you look now at this function, the function of x, this is the function of y, this function of z. Then in reinterpreting it says the following thing. Take three vectors x, y, and z. Take three vectors x, y, and z, that sum up to zero. Apply Fg and H. Then you are going to get the sum of the Fg and H is zero with some noticeable probability. This means that you know Fg and H have this sort of linear looking behavior. So there are what is called Simon. And you know, once you look at it and you know the right buzzword to Google, which is actually not that half that easy. So actually we kind of solve it and then we And then we knew what to Google, and then, okay, we can just write the results. Fine. So if you know what to Google, then you can put up some results in homogenomics, some results of Dawers and Perker, you know, some very classical stuff. And eventually what you managed to show is that FG and H cannot be arbitrary. They have to have some structure and they have to s resemble some linear sa type of function. And once you have some structure, then you're on the boot check and you can continue to argue that this structure cannot be actually achieved by a function of this form. So this is to convince you that once you observe this, then you're in good true. Now, why would you observe this? So, kind of the way that this was achieved, so as we don't like this, all we like this sum. So, you can observe by some positionality inequality that if you take x, y and z and x prime, y and z prime, that the o's are all the same, then the sum of this and the sum of this is supposed to be the same. And the sum of this is supposed to be the same. So when you play around, you get that ax minus x1 plus ay minus b1 plus cz1. And you get this, you have some very nice correlation like that. So then you have this notion of abay embeddings or linear embeddings from a mixed of. And this lens sort of suggests. This learn sort of suggests that these type of problems have a trivial solution, which is some linear constraints that these x's and x primes satisfy. And you know, we do have something like that because we do know that x plus y plus z is equal to 0, and the primes are also. So you can kind of hope that these are the only things that exist. But then when you actually try to make it work, Then, when you actually try to make it work, you realize that this is not true. Like, there are surprising Billian constraints here that are encapsulated by this. And once you look at it further, you realize that there is some mod 4 equation that is going over here. Then, okay, mod 4 suddenly out of the picture, maybe the original question already has it. So, then you know to look for mode 4 business and then you just see it. You just see it. So, this is sort of inspired by this abelian embedding ads. But, you know, once you start believing that there should be a connection between a billion of learning and all of this parallel business, you can try again for larger classes of games and indeed in the following follow-up. And indeed in the following follow-up walk future walk with America Mal Bash and uh Jan, with you we actually show how to you know take this sort of argument, combine it with Of argument, combine it with actually the analysis type stuff that I so showed in the morning, and prove similar decay results for a more general class of games with probably three extra games. So this is still in the working, so I don't want to give a precise statement. Anyway, I'm out of time. So my main point here is that all of this analysis stuff gets also in parallel petition and you know sometimes Power repetition, and you know, sometimes a bit of comment always gets in through the window. But that's all I have to say. Thank you. Questions? So, we do not know how to make them work. It depends who you ask. I know sufficiently little information for you to say that I don't think that it can work. But kind of in a deeper sense, there is a gap in difficulty once you go from two pairs to three pairs, not only in parallel repetition, but also in communication complexity. And there you can give better excuses to why information theory doesn't work. The same excuses don't work here, but give some. Is there like any game or like exponential is not the true an excellent question? So we don't know I think I think that there is a conjecture that the proof should be experimental, but no, then it's going to be even more prestigious. Instead of the three, can you consider K? Yeah. So uh that's a good question. Uh that's a good question. So well so yeah just like in a mazook, you can send this three, four, five, six and more. But actually the difficulty of this volume gets much much much worse. So once you go beyond four, once you go beyond three, you say you have to four, you are already supposed to take into account all of this inverse Gauss theorem. Because whatever the analytical theorem Because whatever analytical theorems you're going to at least if you go along these lines whatever analytical theorems you're going to prove have to inside them include the strength of inverse Gauss. Inverse Gauss is serious business, so. But then you can assume inverse Gauver is. No, you have to go beyond that. It's not like that that's it. You have to actually go much, much beyond that. So and even even infused Gauer's theorem doesn't tell with the quantity balance. The quantitative balance. So, this one over log star that I showed, this comes from density LG went. And actually, if you go to four pair games, it's not even one over log star, it's a wowzel function. So, it's quite fun. These Z4 embeddings, do they have anything to do with the quantum strategies being perfect? Yeah, I think so. I know sufficiently little quantum to say it, I'm sure of it. But yeah, so that's actually But uh yeah, so that's actually uh one interesting question. Um whether there is relationship between you know this additive commuter exchange working and quantum values like one. Because somehow in my mind all quantum can do is some stuff over being works. And probably this is what's going on in data counting.
