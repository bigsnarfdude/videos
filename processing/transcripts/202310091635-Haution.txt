And in the talk on the concentration period, we want to pick all of them. But let me sign the lighters. So the subject is the so-called concentration theorem may be better known as localization. Localization theorem. This is about equivalent commodity theories. We start right away by giving a main statement of this type of theorem. We take a group G acting on some geometric object. Geometric object, so this base for me is told this scheme, X take equivalent common G theory of schemes G equivalent spaces. And H. We can when we have X and so there is a map to fixed locus, in general this has no reason to be a but there's a concentration the other state that is Theorem states that this becomes one on a certain utilization or say a certain subset T sign the column G of the P so this is the equivalent homology of X is called the X. The equivalent homology of X is concentrated on the fixed occasion on inverting some process. Since I don't say what is T since addition into the critical point, we understand how destructive sequence of localizing sequels. So the sequel of the talk has been precise, but this gives some idea of the type of statement. Does T connect? No, no, T with C project. So this is of course very classical topic and quite fast, so I will not attempt to make an exhaustive summary. Term to make an exhaustive survey, but briefly mentioned so. First, in topology on this, but I should mention that here both the buttons of some of this type of theorem. Since this type of theorem is quite central in the theory of client commodity theories, in the sense that many results in the server can be linked in one way or another to this type of results. To mention one thing, for instance, this implies things like fixed points form Well, there are versions in algebraic geometry. I guess one should mention Passoner for K-theory paper ninety-two. So here we are. Here I can be more precise works for schemes over S. So S is some scheme. So G diagonally. SQL X is a scheme, it's a finite type scheme. So with a G action, and now I can say what is first.huri, if I have T theory, you could be defining theory. In this case, this is the set of uh classes of non-trivial characters. There has been many variants for other community theories, for instance, the version for showing against that because it has been just been. That should maybe mention what happened recently. Something in direction. So it's slightly different, but it's certainly a very list. Looked at the theories of these groups. has been also worked from DeepCan and RAV. Again, maybe from a slightly different point of view for abstract point of view for stacks. Anyway, from what I explained, I guess it's quite clear that there should be a multi-production. And I I will give uh version data and its talk. Maybe that's not the main point. I'd like also to present a slightly different approach to this type of system. But as far as I understand, at least managed by geometry, That is measured by geometry. Seems in the end always the approach of Thomas and say typically uses called general slide theorem. For actions of Tori, Tori actions some kind of stratification technique as a next time. I understand quite clear. The idea is to reduce oneself to actions of tori. This stratify our scheme, but the potential of the tori acts freely. The phase of production is not very difficult. First, I'd like to discuss a sort of more direct approach. What I call the geometric version of instead geometric version geometric contrast I mentioned earlier multi-generation. Motification in the sense that it would imply preparation for various cohomology theories. In a sense, the more primitive has nothing to do with motives or cohort theory. This is just some basic geometric statement. Then it will be the following work. That's only with an altar on the skin. You can take if you want spectrum of a field and we take schemes, so let's say flat, fine, fine, fine. We need some technical condition on G. But rather postponed the description until after the theorem, so we can just say One, two, three. If I take theorem, but you can think of those as technical conditions. And so this is about a fine case. So S is defined. So X is defined. Also, X is defined, so Ng X on defined there is no fixed point. Then we may find representation of the Guban vector bundle of S V such that gives us the V such that H0 And D acquires admits G equivalent no average exception but over X. X, yes, not an S scheme, sorry. What I mean is the pullback of V such a s clearly over S there is no subsection. In fact, the only equivalent section is zero. But somehow, when we pull back to X, we can find a slightly more general can make a slightly more general proof a slightly more general statement where make no assumption on the fixed locus then the conclusion is that there exists a fee like this and the section with vanishing locus is precisely for fixed locus I guess this statement would be sufficient for But explain in a minute the relation with the theorem, but first I need to state this condition. So here G satisfies conditions. First and most important of G is linear in T. I think there is no ambiguity about what this means when S is fit. No, I'm not sure, so let me make it maybe clear what I mean by this. So look at so G is an affine scheme, so it's a spectrum of. Scheme, so it's a spectrum of some of the S. It contains OS and the condition is that it has a section, equivalent section, where S minor G equivalent the fraction is always end. So certainly there is always a non-equivalent fraction given by the unit of G. Say when G is finite, we can make it equivalent by averaging conjugates of this retraction and sort of a generalization of this averaging operator. That's one way to think of we are the other fit. Second is that um That I guess in characteristic zero, yes, but is this equivalent to some category representation being slice and pole or over a fifth, yes, but not over a I'm not sure maybe precisely, but there were a few. Exercise, but the whole thing is no explaining. So the OS module, so this OSG, I know it is flat, but I mean also it has to be locally conjective. So it's a classic composition. This should have the reservation properties. Every Coherent G module is a potion of Every query on top of S. G module over S, voice module, G equivalent voice module is quotient of finite function. Let me briefly comment on these three conditions. I think of two and three as rather mild conditions. Technical, for instance, they are automatic when S is respectable. By contrast, one is a more serious condition. An example of a non-linear relative group scheme. The non-trivial unit but some groups. Just group is quite clear that the theorem fails. So I'm not saying that this set of conditions are optimal, but certainly it's starting to make some assumptions in the direction of one. We see make the connection to concentration theorem. So, we have again a bit big, but let's take each G21 homology theory of schemes. What is but particularly having the theory of earlier classes? Of earlier classes. Look at the earlier class of so let's put ourselves in the situation of 0. So S like this, X like this. We can look at the other class of V. Don't be easy in H of S, but we can look at the full market in H of S. The property of error classes is that when there is a no-have vanishing section, the error class vanishes. And particularly, any localization of each of x is particular. But x have little control over V, but the key property is this one. Is this one? Let's look at the set of all such B's equivariant vector bond models such that and we look at the center of the And we look at the set of the classes. Think of this as a subset of H of S and the conclusion that H of X multiplied by T vanished. This is the case. In this case, in the case when there is nothing, and I say that this is the sort of central case which has written a more property case, and so forth, if you try to remote opinion variance, we can reduce to the fine case when you use the device. And also, using localization sequence, we reduce to the case when there is no. Sequence will be reduced to the case where there is no fixed point. State an older version so for state inclusive SHG equivalent. Once you make the equivariant C-ball of the category, and this was constructed by Marco Mohammed quite interestingly to also in this category, he also makes conditions similar to those, only two doesn't appear. Only two doesn't appear, three is there, and the biot of one is the same. Okay, so this category is built schemes, so those are the g equivalent schemes, which are quasi-projective or s in the g equivalents. Duty of speech. So speaking per vector order, but specifically an element of P, where we remove the zero section, P dot. Projects to there is a map to S. You can look at, so there's a functor for this category to this one, edge of this map. S, S H E S F note. Now this category is a triangulated category, so we can look at all this, but it's called the term space distinguished. It's not, I'll call it, like to think of it as the pressure class for what we are going to invert. Odos E V or E V. In the SHGS Then the event is one can expect category X. X wants to invert morphism. Of course, you can put them y to this G X because it's equivalent to the same G of these processes. For X that's one of the conversion that P here can be. Parametric inversion, but maybe I can give them much more concrete time. usually get the coronary when x is smooth so case you have so you look at the inclusion of the fixed focus so this is morphism of smooth things and you can look at the image of this morphism in so this becomes in these morphisms I want to invert by inverting E, as it does not distinguish between those two. And let me just briefly mention that this is optimal in the photo extensions. First of all, we saw that localizing at key, converting these morphisms, well, amounts to killing their code. You need to power. Ah, just a question. When you said to invert EV, it's really to make it a nice morphism. I thought it was to make the top space of V an invertible object. No, no, no. I'm guessing it is anyway. As an errand spectrum communication Yeah, I mean when it's not okay, but it will meet the morphism becomes to be an isomorphism so that we can get a little bit of a I guess that's not the. Coming back to this, what we do in this localization, we kill all those major all these schemes. But it is clearly necessary to do so for the collaborative Just look at this X D naught to this well the removed the fixed point point. Well we should have this. Then uh most objection by so what I'm saying is that this is the largest organization, the largest function of CG of S, where all those map economized moves. So I guess once you have this motivation it's or less immediate to determine Or less immediate to deduce various localization theorem for homology theories, which are represented in theory and which have some theory for earlier classes. Example of such is algebraic K-theory, equivalent algebra K-theory. So in particular, we the special cases we cover are common results key theory. And this is a RC. That's really what I wanted to discuss. Now, I want to do something a bit different. Just a Borel type covariant theorems. So, Borel's construction. One-known construction, which is the way to produce defined theories out of non-equivalent one-size-fits-all, equivalent. So we call it the X I mean it's let's say a direct system is categorian, so this U n plus one plus one, so indexed by integers and So G acts on each UN, so it acts freely on UN and the motion is a skew. Following, to start with the non-equivalent form of the state represented by first, when you take X in this category, for the projective, G for the projective, can look at the mixed equations But we denote by xm this does exist as a stream. The idea is that you take a non-equivalent homology theory, you look at its value on all xn, take the codimet, and use the probability type. It will say a spectrum. And PQ and Z we set A P Q G X as the polymit over L of all this in Q the usual. So, commutative theory A will be evaluated at the Xm. So, this is our notation for such animorphisms from Xm to function of A. And also by 3G by X as the right sum of phone costs. The right sum of photos. If you are familiar with this procedure, you know that I omitted portal condition. You mean that usually we so for instance here we take the constant direct system. What I'm going to say that this is this condition is. This is this condition, but of course, uh the sensible thing to do is to take um and this is always possible at least for S is spectrum of the field. This is certainly what you want to do if you want to talk about a variety type of assumption. Okay, so that's about equivalent theory. So to state the concentration theorem got allocated. But so and allocated exists. Uh so and another classes exist for A is uh called G and oriented theory corresponds to what was called oriented theory of these two but I want to be slightly more general because after all for the concentration theorem we don't absolutely need variable classes, we just need some characteristic class to be called characteristic class. Characteristic classes exist as soon as we have some kind of advantage. For notion of orientation, uh S P orientation, let's take I guess we can be a bit more general in what I call hyperbolic variant in the spectrum, but I guess it's quite non-duction. In any case, the property of such theory is that you can define character XT classes which we use a bit like the other classes. Like the other classes, if you have vector model, you can associate so-called top x3 again as EX So, to fix the idea, when A is G-oriented, just a square of adornments, course you can make this equivalent where you can just define PB as coordinate of XPEN H H so now we know to advance. This is P D G S this I can state here in the setting. So we take x. So we take X in this category first H X B X locus not what we had before, but I just want to point out that it's not clear that this already It's not clear that this for a type equivalent theory are the present table in CHQS. So the does not follow immediately from the motilic version that I mentioned before. But going back to the geometric version, I wanted to mention amount. This in fact is quite useful. This practice is quite useful. If x is smooth, let's consider inclusion of this locus. So we can see this normal bundle. Then, so in this setting you have not only a pullback but also a push forward for PG Ag, but not quite, so you have to twist just by the normal order PG X. So yeah, I'm not going to be precise, but you can think of this as a twisted form of Dg of X G. Of Vg of Xg, where instead of including the physics from Xgase function, you will start from the time space of a twisted form of this. This, when you revert to OP, this becomes a slow analysis. This becomes also an isomorphism. And so, in particular, one here is really supportive and if his locket can say what he sees. So for experior theory, we still have the notion of grade of class, but it's just that they live in the twisted co-working. Twisted co-workers. Subclass we don't add here and then we multiply by a beam vertical. So part of the statement is that this class is in the vertical position gives an explicit formula for the age of 1. And in the case when A is G-oriented, cover when the old formula that 1 is just the push-forward. Formula that one is just the push forward of the inverse of the other curves. I don't plan really to discuss applications, but I'll just say that the motivation for me was to obtain this pattern for my EN. It's actually very cool because having this formula is the publication. Essentially, this this is the key. Essentially this this is the key, providing connection between channel numbers of x, let's say when x is most objective, and the channel numbers of the fixed workers. How far let's proceed for the follow-up size and kind of package for it from just maybe that have to prove first that this is invertible. So I guess at this point I should make a few remarks. Two remarks. Because I guess all this seems very general, so G is quite arbitrary. But in fact I I think concretely that the weight is there is restriction on the type of G for which Type of DG for which this is really going to be useful. So, first, let's look at classical case when A is GN-oriented. Maybe S is just a spectrum of the shot. And the claim if G is not of multiplicative style. And so this localization is zero. So in particular, A A G X applies at P is zero. And so the proof, the idea of proof, let's say when K is algebraically closed. So in this situation, So in this situation the assumption means that G is not diagonal final the georepresentation G or geo representation of the geometric character and we just look at Then we just look at project P. Look at P dot. This is a scheme with a G action. And what are the fixed points? So these points are precisely the sub-representation of one, they are not. But the consequence of the local. So in consequence of the location of the Persian theorem, we get that H x G is linearly empty from the mean. So this is zero. But for jet-oriented theory, you have For jet-oriented theory, you have projective mandala theory that things as a direct summon PGS as a work like. I'd say it's a negative result, and it's perhaps a bit disappointing because it's a pretty serious restriction of the type of G which the concentration theorem is going to be useful, at least in the special case where G adapted. For instance, we generalize for the Thomas's theorem, but that's not much diagnosable to the metrics. Diagnosable to the most positive. But let me still point out that in the proof thing we did use the consultation theorem for arbitration. Characteristic P anyway you only have this uh both wires and connectivity uh Wireless and connective. All uh characters is zero. Of course, we have to GLM every relative character. Second mark and main is what I was looking at some of the opposite case. So the opposite of G-oriented taperiotic and St and SP-oriented. So an example of such is bit groups. So in this case, we have a similar negative result. So if set of representation of fixed points, if there is a representation containing Change Ben It's not hard to see that in this case it's going to be zero in conclusion and this belongs to P, it's just a conclusion. Since looking at this other extreme have the same type of negative results, then so for instance when G is diagonizable, then there are different bits that take a character, this is a hazard. So that's not okay. Time to discuss one more thing, but I guess we should have to go. Thank you very much. Any questions? So if you were to say something like SL two or It's in the intersection of, I mean, it's outside of your two negative, right? SL2 for bit groups. I think you can find the hot work about characters, but so it's a yeah, it's pretty serious. For instance, I guess you could look at symmetry. I guess you could look at the symmetry of a Q, but that was part. Other questions? Can you put this first in the topological text, I think, or was it not? But at least you can be quite There definitely has been many consultations during geology. Other questions? Just a remark about this idea relative. So actually uh uh this group groups are a team between the That speeds a mix of it. Then speeds the question for the extension of Jilliana modules, it's equivalent to split out I guess it's equivalent to do it just for four S inside of For OS inside G. There is also the notion that the fixed point functor is exact one representation and this is equivalent of a field but over a general base and not extension may not be split as extension of OS modules. There's no other questions, then the technical speaker gets and tomorrow we start, not like today, at 8:45, we start at 9. Tomorrow there's no introduction by using the music.
