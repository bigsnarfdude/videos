Thanks. Nice. Okay, thank you. Hi, everyone. So I'm going to give a talk. It's an ongoing work. So in this work, we are trying to understand how the cost of prophylactis when there is no disease can affect epidemic outcome. Affect epidemic outcomes. I'm going to share some preliminary results and open to conversation. Go for it. So we have heard already a lot about this today, yesterday. Tension, prophylaxis here means just preventive measures, and I'm preferring this term because of Of the fact that they don't provide a long-term protection against the disease, right? And again, because of that, they require a lot of engagement. Because if you stop doing them, you lost everything, you can get affected. So this is one way they are different from vaccination, immunization, right? A second way they are very different is if you're vaccinating a population, Vaccinating a population, the more you vaccinate, the best. But here, having a stronger response, prophylactic response, more people engaging in prophylactic measures doesn't always give a better outcome. Of course, it depends on what we really consider as the best outcome. So, we have some literature on this song. Non-monotonic effect of engaging in prophylactic behavior. So, here, what we are trying to do is just to see what's the effect of the cost of prophylactic itself. But here, the cost is the social economic cost. So, it's kind of a blend of these two things. It could be that if I'm part of a social group, then Social group, then maybe wearing a mask could make me look weird. And because in the group, we think that you should not follow what the government is saying. So it would decrease the kind of influence in the social group. But must also have social or economic cost. So, cost here is a blend of these two things together. Things together. So, of course, prophylaxis should have some benefit. So, we'll be looking at this question given the benefit of the prophylaxis, how much protection it provides. So, we start with this model, which has been around for some time, right before COVID, and it's kind of you can have two opinions about. You can have two opinions about proof-latting measures, right? Against or for it. But if you take people who are against it, then you can divide them in sub-groups. So here, within the framework of this model, you can have two groups or four groups or six groups, and so on. Most of the time, even at four groups, it gets already complicated, and the model becomes a little bit difficult to analyze. Analyzed. So we were trying to get something between 2 and 4, 3. And we also change a little bit the interpretation. Here we consider that we have just two prophylactic measures, and S0, S1, S2, these numbers just represent the number of prophylactic behavior people are engaged in. Now Now here we have kind of what measure how someone can pace towards another individual and like spread his beliefs or his attitude. So we imagine when there is no disease, people who are non-prophylactic will be more convincing. Because there's no disease, there is no point in putting No disease, there is no point in putting a mask on. But people who want to be who want to be prophylactic when there is no disease, they will have, we imagine they will have a cost of this prophylactic behavior, meaning they will have less influence. So this is exactly what I was saying. They will have less, it means that behaving prophylactically costs them something. So this So, this is the cost. This cost is represented by C in these equations. And so, C is if you following the two measures I'm considering, then this is the cost. This is what it's cost you in terms of influencing, convincing other people to follow you in your profilaxis. So, we put this system in. system into an SIR model. So here S is kind of representing susceptible. We have seen a lot of time already. So I'm not going to describe each compartment in this model. What we can note is just that these turns represent the rate at which people are moving between different susceptible groups and they depend on the infectious population. The infectious population, right? So if the infectious population is zero, people will be moving from these two compartments to zero, as zero. If when we get an epidemic going on, then more people will be moving into this direction. And we have recruitment rates in this equation, but we don't put any recruitment for people who are People who are following, like you said, full prophylaxis. So the idea is that people are coming from disease-free, the recruitment are coming from disease-free area, so they are not fully engaged in those luxuries. They may be moderately or not engaged. And the infected population, we divide it in many compartments. So the idea is that people are not really aware of the risk. Not really aware of the risk of getting infected. So we only detect some cases. So it's only these cases that provide some information on the risk, on the eronodic true risk. Okay, so here I'm showing the distribution of the population when there is no disease based on this model I just show. So this is a heat map where on the y-axis we have the proportion of axis we have the proportion of the recruitments coming from the proportion of the recruitment that are not prophylactic at all and here we have the cost of prophylaxis in disease-free condition so the idea here is that we will expect that when there is no disease most of the population will be behaving non-prophylactic so this is exactly what we get at the top At the top, we see that if the proportion of people behaving non-prophyl is very low, and the inference cost is um not the inference cost the rate at which this um opinion or attitude dynamic is happening is very low. Is happening is very low, then we expect that. Well, people will have some people behaving prophylactically. That's what we are seeing here. But what I'm trying to show is just that if this is not happening, this is not likely, then the system is just as we expect. So here I'm showing some preliminary results. This is a heat map for the size of a peak. Of a peak. So beta is the transmission rate, and alpha is the strength of attitude dynamics. And here we have the reduction in contact rate provided by full prophylaxis to someone who is doing the two moissions. And here we have the cost of inference. So we can see that when the disease is very the force of infection is very strong and the speed of opinion dynamics is very low. So this is what we have here. Then we have the largest speed we can have. And that's all I'm going to say about this. You can see that maybe this. These contours are not totally monotonous, right? When you change in the cost of prophylaxis, you don't have, if you decrease in it, decrease in it doesn't always lead to a decrease in the peak size in some of these scenarios. So we see this better when we consider the final size of the epidemic. If I take this for it, If I take this for instance, this is the highest cost of prophylaxis. But when I start decreasing A, the final size will increase and then decrease. So it's not monotony, it's not just increasing or just decreasing. That's the general conclusion. And we have something similar, not very much here, but we have something similar for the number of ways. Something similar for the number of waves, too. So, in conclusion, what I'm trying to say here is that even if we consider the cost of prophylaxis in disease-free conditions, it can provide us some information if we know what we consider as best disease outcome, right? Because this itself is very important. This itself is very important. Sometimes the peak size can be the most important. So, knowing the relationship between the cost of prosylaxis or level of protection it provides can help us see how much decrease we want in the cost of posthumous, for instance, to optimize the outcome. And the answer will be different if we consider peak size. If we consider peak size, which is important for people maybe managing hospitals, it can be different for maybe politicians who want the final size to be low. It depends on what we really value. So in future, we are considering testing the effect of reporting of the data. If you are reporting more or less, if we are doing More or less, if we are doing more testing, what's the effect on the epidemic outcomes? Yeah, I think that's all. Thank you for your attention.
