 So I'm very pleased to be here in Oaxaca at this Brussels conference. And the topic I've chosen for today seminar is a topic that I've been working together with my younger collaborator, Thomas. Collaborator Thomas Weber on the problem of the Levitic Vita connections on quantum groups. Can you hear me well? Now, given the heterogeneous composition of this conference, I've decided to give a To give a long and extended introduction, framing and motivating this specific work that is addressing a more mathematically precise question of what is the Riemannian geometry on quantum groups, let's say, of the ABCD series introduced by the infinite Jimbo or the Ferdev Region. Jimbo, or the Fadeva-Hetekin Takta-Jan version of them, and indeed frame it in a more general quest for the study of gravity in non-commutative space-times. So I will start there for with some physics motivation. And the known, very well known by now argument is that in the passage from quantum mechanics from classic. From classical mechanics to quantum mechanics, observables becomes non-commutative. And similarly, it is expected that in the passage from general relativity to quantum gravity, the space-time structure itself becomes non-commutative. This expectation is supported by Gedanken experiments. Gedanken experiments localizing test particles looking at the trajectories and it is therefore very natural to include these lattice-like or space structure in an effective non-commutative structure of space-time that automatically Of space-time that automatically gives some impossibility of pinpointing exactly the trajectory of a particle. The idea is that the particle, in order to see the particle, you have to pinpoint the trajectory of the particle, you have to take the particle very massive and a very massive particle will create. Particle will create a back reaction of gravitational effect in the end will create a black hole. You cannot test the space-time structure in the very at the Planck scale. So, given this general expectation, it is, as I said, interesting to understand whether a non-commutative space-time can serve as an effective way to incorporate some aspect of To incorporate some aspect of quantum gravity. And this expectation is also coherent or there are other hints about these lattice lines or discrete aspects of space-time, and these hints come from loop quantum reality and also from string theory. For example, in closed strings we have T-duality and we cannot go belong below string scale, or in the presence of fluxes, we automatically are led on brains to consider space-times that are non-commutative. So, besides these conceptual motivations for Conceptual motivations for studying non-commutative space and the gravity on such non-commutative space. I would like also to add some quantum gravity phenomenology motivations in the sense that for those interested in the physics, we have now to be able to test eventual aspects of such space-time non-commutativity. And in the literature, there are possibilities. There is a possibility of testing this. For example, thanks either to cosmological data near inflationary epoch, that is not far from Planck scale energies, or thanks to cumulative phenomena, for example, light traveling very long time out of Out of, for example, a gamma-ray burst. And indeed, there are data concerning time delays in photons that are very energetic with respect to photons that are less energetic, that may be compatible with the idea of space-time being a non-trivial, non-linear. Non-trivial non-linear optical medium having some dispersion relations, and these dispersion relations, it turns out, they are well nicely produced once spacetime becomes non-commutative. So this I see it as a way to test whether non-commutativity of spacetime may have something to do with observational data. This is a history. There's a lot of literature in this respect. What I would like to add here is that recently with Pachol and Borhoviek, we have seen that these optical nonlinear phenomena, these dispersion relations, appear when both non-commutativity and curvature. And curvature are turned on. So it's the combined effect of these two aspects that are relevant. And in the literature presently, there has been studies where the background is standard Fadev Robertson Walker Le Matter background where one puts on some non-commutativity. But it would be nice to have some background that comes out of Ground that comes out of some non-commutative Einstein equations to couple non-commutative electromagnetism on space-time with non-commutative gravity and have a better idea of such models. So this is also one direction that I think it's interesting and it has also quite some physical applications. Applications. With this idea in mind, let's come to some more mathematical study of developing a non-commutative Riemannian geometry. And here in this talk, I would be extremely conservative, meaning consider a metric and out of it, extract the Levitic-Chivita connection of the metric and write. interconnection of the metric and write down Einstein equation and the scalar, the Einstein tensor. What is needed for such a program? Well, first of all, notions of non-commutative differential geometry. I'm here taking a quantum algebra approach. I'm not following in this talk like earlier in this morning. Earlier in this morning, a spectrometric approach to the problem. And the differential geometry construction is, so to say, quite well understood. We need a differential calculus, a notion of connection. Now, the bimodal of one forms is no more commutative, so I will take specific right connection. Take specific right connection, that's why I denote the connection with this double bar, and then out of it, there is a well-known notion of curvature and of torsion. But when we add up extra conditions, so what is a metric, and in which sense we can require a compatibility condition between the metric and the connection? Well, here is where things get non-trivial, and there are Non-trivial, and there are different proposals in the literature. So, I would like to briefly discuss them and see how we studied in this context. So, in particular, especially if you think from a pathogenical point of view, what does it mean to have a metric on a quantum algebra? Well, the first thing you would think is I have some non-commutative. Is I have some non-commutative structure. If I take a metric, it should be compatible with the non-commutative structure. This we do every time. We have a group, let's say, a semi-simple group. What is the metric on the semi-simple L group? It will be the killing metric. On the other hand, and so that's what has been very much studied in the literature, rightly so. But if we come from this idea of having Idea of having a theory of gravity of keeping the metric dynamic, not of considering just around metric, but of looking, for example, at oscillations around the Killing metric. Well, we need an arbitrary dynamical field. So these are the two different approaches and are completely treated in quite different ways mathematically. And these two different approaches reverberate. Reverberate into different approaches in connections. Again, connections can be taken to be compatible with the non-commutative structure. Typically, they are called bimodal connections, so to say, have some commutativity property or can be taken to be arbitrary connections. Well, the metric compatibility. Metric compatibility connection in the litters has been studied, especially for connections that are bimodal connections. When connections are taken to be very general, one problem is to understand exactly what does it mean to lift a connection that acts on 10, on one, let's say, on cotangent vectors, to product of cotangent vectors, to the tens of. vectors to the tensor to extend the connections to the tensor field product to product of tensor fields. So here is a brief list of some results in the case where the metric is compatible with the non-commutativity. Starting from early work of John Mador on fuzzy spaces, then we have work of Then we have work of bags and magid, the so-called bimodule connections of Tu Boa Volette and Mitchell were used then by Bohmwick, Roswami and Landy, considering central modules. Weber worked for with a triangular For with the triangular Hopf algebras, having some four ones instead of but one. Yes. Yes, I was saying that here the matrix is taken to be coinvariant, not necessarily central. And in this paper that was quite influential for me and for Thomas Weber, connections are considered on a metrics that are B coinvariant. Are B co-invariant, so connections are considered on quantum groups. On quantum groups, you have an action on the left and an action of the right of the group. So they consider here connections that are invariant under this left and right action, but not necessarily central. I recall that for quantum groups, there are elements that are B coinvariant and central. For example, if you think about the differential calculus, typically the different Typically, the differential is an inner operation with a one form that is not central but is left and right coin variant. So, this was an interesting step because it has some compatibility with the group structure, with the non-commutative structure, the quantum group, but is not central. And so, we said, can we extend this result? That was the idea. And indeed, And indeed, this first slide was about metrics that have to cope with the non-commutativity. And the second class of algebras, on the other hand, the metric is completely arbitrary, but the non-commutativity is tame, is taken to be mild, let's say. In which sense? Well, for example, the typical Moiel Weil space. Or it's a very Or it's a version, compact version, the torque. Here, arbitrary metrics can be considered. Slightly generalizing this, out of abelian drink twist, here there was a way to construct a Levi-Chivita connection for any metric. And here it was used by Arn Lind to work out, in particular, the example of the peta pre-sphere. These examples have in common somehow the existence of a preferred basis of vector fields or forms that simplify the treatment. The question was keeping this algebra simple, can we avoid using specific basis that has extra properties? That has extra properties. And in a recent result, I was sorry able to indeed construct such Levichivita connections. Let's briefly. Let's briefly review them. So, we take algebras that are triangular. What does it mean? They have an action of a Hopf algebra on the algebra A, and they are commutative up to an action of a permutation group that is represented by an R matrix that is not a simple flip, but this object squares to the identity. Squares to the identity is the permutation. Well, on such an algebra, there is a canonical way to construct a differential calculus. There is a notion of metric defined as a symmetric, braided symmetric non-degenerate to tensor. And connections are extended to tense product of tensor fields as braided derivations. You see here, there is an action of this braiding on the connection. It tells you. On the connection. It tells you that the connection is not invariant under the non-commutativity. It has to change. Well, under these assumptions, well, it is possible to prove that there is a unique torsion-free and metric-compatible connection for any metric G. And moreover, the curvature out of this connection. Out of this connection satisfies the Bianchi identity, one can construct the Ricci tensor, the scalar curvature, and definitely end up with Einstein vacuum equations. And these examples, algebras that satisfy these conditions, include, as I was saying, all algebras coming from Dwinfeld twist and also more abstractly, for example, More abstractly, for example, half algebras that are triangular. So, in this case, H is the same as A. I'm doing the calculus on a quantum group itself, but this quantum group is triangular. Okay, so I think that this is a result that is ready to be applied to some physics investigation. Investigations. I would, however, now continue with this idea of being more general and try to see whether it can be relaxed the triangular structure that I've been considering here. So the idea is which is the easiest case of a non-commutative algebra that is Non-commutative algebra that is not triangular. Well, the most interested objects are quantum groups. So let's consider the problem of understanding a, let's say, dynamical Levi-Chivita connection on a quantum group. So you see, let's take, for example, SUQ2. This is a quasi-triangular Hofage. What can be said here about Levy-Chivita connections or about their homogeneous? Connections or about their homogeneous spaces. And as I said, since quantum groups are main examples of non-commutative geometry, let's consider the simple case of just a quantum group. And the point that I make in this talk is to study, indeed, the existence and uniqueness of Levi-Chivita connections, possibly with metrics that are arbitrary. That are arbitrary. So here are the goals. And this I mention now the topic, more specific topic of the research with Thomas Weber. So I think this is a good point to stop if there are some questions concerning the more general part I've been discussing. So let me continue then. Let me continue then. And so the goal is twofold. On one hand, to understand what is meant by metric compatibility condition. When H is not a triangular hopal, is not a quasi, is not a triangular hof algebra. Actually, H can be whatever Hof algebra. And G is neither central nor big. Central nor B co-invariant metric on H. Once we understand this condition, then the idea is to prove existence and uniqueness of the Levitic Vita condition. We are not able to solve it in general, but we have some interesting class of examples. In particular, for a metric that is conformal to A. A killing metric, then we have Levich-Lita connections. But here, when I say conformal, I think of a conformal rescaling that is a function. So we introduce a one dynamical degree of freedom in metrics. And for all such metrics, we have Levitica connections. So this is the first step toward a general solution of the problem. The problem of the Levitic connections on quantum loops. Which are the tools that we use to arrive at these results? Well, a main point that we clarify is how to sum connections. And indeed, the metric compatibility condition requires to lift the connection. To leave the connection to the metric. The metric is in the tensor product of forms times forms. And following work of Bonvik and Mukopadai, the diexam the composition of two tensors in symmetric tensors that I denote with this V and anti-symmetric tensors that as usual I denote. Tensors that are as usual, I don't know, with the wedge. Okay, so in all the talk, this will be symmetric and this will be anti-symmetric. Okay, so let's enter more the talk and we will in the next see first of all what how to construct the sum of connections and to do that we need to understand. To do that, we need to understand what is a tensor product among linear maps, just maps between vector spaces. Then, with such a tensor product in the context of Bicovarian bimodules, that is the space of one forms and vector fields associated to the Bicovarian differential calculus of Voronovic on quantum groups, we will be able to do some connections. Then we will briefly go through some linear algebra to understand the decomposition that I was advocating here. And then finally, the result from a connection some quantum groups. Okay, now I I need two slides that are a little bit more technical. So let me summarize what the slides are. The bottom line is things works well. You don't need to care about mathematical details. If, on the other hand, you want to see why the mathematics work well, then you stay with me for these two slides. For these two slides. Connections. So tensors are compatible with the modules, are maps from one forms to one forms, and they're compatible with the module structure. The A module structure. Structured the A module structured of functions, but the connections they have the liblitshood, they are not tensors. So, in general, they are linear maps. I need to understand how to consider the tensor product of two linear maps, not of two tensor fields. So, let's understand this. In order to understand this, well, let's settle the stage. I take a Hoff algebra. A Hoff algebra, I take the monoidal category of right commodules, my space of tensors, let's say, and I consider linear maps from a module M to another module N. And the first thing I can consider, since I have a HOP algebra, is that these maps are right collinear, so right H equivariant. H equivariant. I call these maps with these, give these maps this name. Well, on such maps, there is I'm having problems here with you on such maps. So he is not able to. So the ingredients in this talk will be these maps and then what I call the just the linear maps between M and N that don't have the H H equivariance property that are not H collinear. I will denote them with the index K. K here, you can take it to be complex numbers. It's the Bay ring. Now, since on M and on N, there is a collection of the Hopf algebra H, one could think that there is a coaction of the this coaction leaves two linear maps from M to N. maps from M to N. This is in general technically not true. One has to restrict properly all these linear maps from M to N. One has to restrict them to the image of this map, to the inverse image of this map. And defining this subclass, then one is able to prove that this subclass of linear maps has a very Has a very nice notion of is a nice H commodule. This is the same problem as defining the coproduct on functions on a group. The group has to be compact, otherwise I have to extend the tensor pro the notion of tensor product. The coproduct naturally does not go into H tensor H. And here, this is the same problem. So following So, following work of Ulbricht, we have this set of linear maps on which there is a nature H coaction. They are called rational morphisms. We will work with such maps. Linear maps for us will be such rational morphisms. In particular, rational morphism satisfies this condition that the coinvariant rational morphism are exactly the co-or Exactly, the co-invariant morphism here. All this to say that with this rational morphism, right H modules with the usual tensor product form a closed monoidal category. Well, Well, now we enrich these modules. Instead of taking just right H co-modules, we take right H co-modules that are also right H modules, which have a coaction and an action of H on M. Well, in this case, we can consider this subset of Set of elements that are the rational morphism here that are right H linear. And it turns out that these are exactly the right H linear maps from M to N, where M and N belong to this very rich module structure. This provided that M is finally generated as a right H module, and we will always be in such context. always be in such context. Of course, one can take instead of right H modules or H commodules, left H modules and H commodules, so to say, one can take Bicoval by modules. There is a right and left action and co-action. And there is a notion of rational morphisms there too. And the right morphism are automatically rational. So that's the bottom point that everything works well. Well, okay, let's indeed discuss this Bicober and by modules. So they are they are There are left and right modules, left and right co-modules, and there are this compatibility condition between the left actions and the co-actions. The natural morphism in this category of bicovariant bimodules are morphisms that are H-bilinear and H-B-co-linear, H-equivariant. Moreover, when we take the tensor when we take the tensor product balanced over H of two Bicovariant bimodules, we obtain a new Bicovariant bimodule. A very well-known statement is that the category of Bicovariant bimodules with distensor product and with the braiding that is obtained, was studied, for example, by Vornowich, and that it's obtained taking a left invariant element, a right invariant element. Element, a right invariant element, and flipping left and right invariant elements, and then extending this to any element requiring that the braiding is a bimodal morphism. Well, this category is a braided monodal category. The first thing that we have to understand when we consider sorry Okay, now let's take morphism that are right H linear from M to N. This is another B covariant by module. The left and right actions on morphism is this one, is done, is defined in this way. In this way. And for the next sake of this talk, this braiding will be denoted with this sum over index alphas in the next slide. So what we have? We have an isomorphism between this Bicovian by module, this B covariant by module. You see, this is another Bicovarian by module because I said before that the tensor product over H of B covariant by module is a Bicovarian by module. B covariant by module. And this, that is another Bicovarian by module, the Bicovian by module of right H linear maps from M tensor Hn into M prime tensor H prime. We call this morphism tensor product sigma Voronovic. And what it does, it takes an element that is an element in the tensor product of 2B covariant by modules. And let me think, And let me think, let us think of it as a morphism itself. So, classically, we don't see any difference between these two objects. This is, if you want, is the identity. But at the quantum level, we have to specify this isomorphism. This isomorphism is very well known. Here, it is explicitly written how. It is explicitly written how it acts. It uses the braiding, indeed, and it gives a tensor product structure. It is associative. Indeed, the category of Vicovari bimodule with such tensor product and the tensor over H. Tensor over H is a closed monoidal category. But this product is not enough for our purposes, because we want to consider the tensor product of two linear maps, two connections, while here phi and psi were right-h linear maps. So we have to, in order to consider connections on tensor product modules, we cannot use this tensor. Product modules, we cannot use this tensor product. So, the first point is to understand whether this tensor product can be generalized, can be lifted. And here is the result. It is possible to lift this value and non-tensor product to a tensor product. Sorry, first of all, it is possible to lift the braiding morphism. Brading morphism between tensor product over H to a map that it is indeed a morphism, as we now show, that is a map between the tensor over complex numbers of two modules. This map has the nice properties that is a morphism in this category. It is indeed also It is indeed also has this central it is well defined also on the tensor product of H and has one half of the hexagon conditions. Well, using this map How can I go back to excuse me? How can I like to use the point there? Okay, thank you. Using this map, using this map, sigma, one can. Sigma, one can construct a new tensor product. This tensor product is a map from k-linear maps, tensor k-linear maps, actually rational morphisms, tensor-rational morphisms, into the rational morphism of tensor products over H. And this is the sort of generalization of the initial tensor product because it can. Initial tensor product because it can be shown that for right rational morphisms, right H-linear maps, this tensor product becomes the usual one. Now that we have seen how to construct the tensor product of two linear maps, we apply this to the study of connections. So a connection on a Bicovarian bimodule for us will be just simply a connection on a on simply a connection on the right module associated to the B covariant by module. So it will be just a map like this. We take a first order differential carcass on the rope of algebra H and the connection naturally extends to the tensor product of M over H with the exterior algebra. This is the canonical way the connection extends. The connection extends. A first remark is that this extension very nicely can be described by saying that the extended connection is obtained considering the tensor, the headed tensor product that I've just defined in the previous slides of the original connection with the identity map or of the identity map with the exterior differentiation. So you see, this is the first application of this. This is the first application of this tensor product. Once we have the extended connection, the curvature and the torsion are defined in the usual way. Now, on Bico-Inbay modules, there is a lot of extra structure, there are very rich modules, and in particular, we have canonical connections that I would like to briefly describe. First of all, there is a canonical connection. So, since the covalent bimodule Uh, because module is a free module that is, for example, freely generated by the left invariant elements in the module, tensor, of course, H. Well, one can define a canonical connection asking that it's zero on every left invariant or co-invariant element, and that's the explicit expression of this connection. So, here DM is a connection, and it has a lot of properties. And it has a lot of properties, is a left and right equivariant. There is another connection that one can naturally construct on such Bicovarian bimodules, and it's a torsion-free connection. It's the analog of the torsion-free connection on a group. And using a basis and introducing structure constant is given explicitly in this way. Now, let's tackle. Now let's attack how to define the sum of connections for connections on bicovariant bimodule. First a preliminary lemma. Any height connection is a rational morphism. So it's exactly one of those maps that I can consider together with my tensor-heated product. Second, provided this has been checked, Has been checked, the sum of two connections, so the connection on the tensor product module M tensor N, is defined in this way. And it is indeed a connection. So here, M is and N nabla M and Nabla N are arbitrary connections. One can ask what happens of the very specific uh canonical connections we have on Canonical connections we have on B covariant bimodules. Well, if I do the sum of the canonical connection on M and the canonical connection on N, I get the canonical connection on M times A. So this definition of connection fits perfectly with the expectation of these canonical connections. Indeed, there is another way of writing the sum of connections, and is this. Any connection is the canonical connection plus connection plus a right H linear map. And therefore, the sum of good connection is the sum of the canonical connection plus the sum of the two right H linear maps that I've written here. This way of looking at the sum of connection is particularly interesting when one wants to understand the curvature of the sum of connection. So here is the formula. Here is the formula. The curvature of the sum of the connection is the sum of the curvatures. That's the classical result. Plus extra terms. These extra terms are nicely written down in terms of these right H-linear maps that are the difference of these two connections. When the connections nabla are bico-invariant, all these extra terms vanish. But this is an interesting formula. It tells us, for example, It tells us, for example, that if I have two flat connections, their sum may be non-flat. Now we come to the linear algebra aspect. Once we have understood this sum of connections, we have to understand how the tensor product of two one forms is split into the symmetric. Into the symmetric part and the anti-symmetric part. For this, we assume that the grading sigma Voronovic is diagonalizable. And this is true for ABCD series of quantum groups. So it's not a big assumption. And that one is among the eigenvalues of sigma. So given that, we indeed can split as a direct sum the tensor product of omega, tensor omega. product of omega tensor omega and symmetric part and anti-symmetric part and this anti-symmetric part actually is the image of identity minus sigma is identified with the exterior algebra. So we have projectors from omega 10 so omega and omega 10 so omega that I call P V and P wedge and P wedge is just the wedge product. And together with these projectors we have projections. Projectors, we have projections from the symmetric and the complement of the symmetric. Of course, sigma is compatible with the duality between forms and vector fields, so also the tensor product of vector fields splits into this direction. With all these preparations. This preparatory work, we are able now to understand what a Levitica connection is or to define it. So, first of all, we want to consider the sum of two connections. Given a connection on one forms, we want to extend it on the tensor product of one forms. And this is done via the sum of connections. Then, out of it, we want to extract a connection that is A connection that is acting on the symmetric tensor product, a connection that is acting on the two forms on the symmetric part, and also the off-diagonal terms in this diexam decomposition. Here are the off-diagonal terms. What is non-trivial is in the classical case, nabla 1, 2 and nabla 2, 1 are zero. While here, due to the fact that sigma does not square to the identity, Does not square to the identity, they are non-trivial. So the connection splits into all these maps. The diagonal ones are connections, the off-diagonal ones are morphism, right, H-linear maps. Okay. Yes. So No, I don't have the right timing. Two times. Okay. Thank you. Okay. So out of a connection, we extract these four connections, these four maps. And they can be dualized to vector fields in the usual way. You see, this has the bar on the left because these are left connections on vector fields, while these are right connections on forms. Well, under visualization, it follows also that the dual of these connections are these connections, and the dual of these morphisms are these morphisms. Now we can define what the LAVC-Vita connection is for us. The LAVIC Vita connection is for us. So, first of all, a metric is a symmetric element in the vector field stands of vector fields, where vector fields here is the space of vector fields on a Bikovarian differential car Kurusa La-Goronovic on the Hopf algebra. And this symmetric element is required to be non-degenerator, where this is the usual musical isomorphism. Musical isomorphism. And the height connection on the space of one form is said to be Levicivita if it is torsion-free and if its projection to the symmetric part vanishes on G. So it's a very specific condition that is weaker than asking the connection without the projection to be zero. Under this assumption, Under these assumptions, we can, this definition, you see in particular G is not central, is not left or right covariant. Under these assumptions, we can construct a Levitica connection provided the following map. We have a criterion. We have a criterion, we give a criterion for Levich data connections. Consider the following map. This is a map that depends on G, that to a map from forms to symmetric forms that I call phi associates a new map that acts from symmetric forms just to forms. It's done like this. It's a quite complicated map. The first thing I have to do is to consider the direct sum of phi with phi. So this is a map. phi with phi. So this is a map from omega 1 tensor omega 1 in omega 1 tensor omega 1 tensor omega 1 is defined here. It is the same as the sum of connections, but these are right rational morphisms. Then we have to consider the projection. Well all this map is what I call phi v so phi v compose g is giving me this map capital phi g this This map capital Phi G, I will also briefly write it like that. I just use this notation. And the statement is generalizing a result by Bohm Vick and collaborator is that provided this map is invertible, then a Levi-Chivita connection is obtained by this definition. Definition. So inverting the map. And this is the unique Levi-Chivita connection for G. So I don't think I have time to go through the proof. I just would like to pinpoint that this is the initial part, is the what is phi. What is phi here? I would like to just discuss what is the argument of phi minus one of g is this argument here, is the map I call phi here. Well, it's easy to see that this is a right H linear map, and so one can apply phi minus one, and so this object is a connection because it's a sum. A connection because it's the sum of a connection plus a right H linear map. And then the torsion free and the metric compatibility condition follow from the very definition of what is φg this very definition here. So this is the first So, this is a first result because it generalizes the work of Bonvik and Mukopal Dayai, because here G is assumed to be arbitrary. The only assumption is the invertibility of this map φg. Well, there are other existence and uniqueness theorems. In particular, we can consider now. Can consider now the very simple and specific case in which G is central or actually sigma central. This meaning that the braiding with the metric and then generic one form is simply the flip. And these sigma-central metrics were considered by Heckenberg in his original work. Well, Well, there are some criterion for sigma centrality, in particular if G is central and B coinvariant then is automatically sigma central. And a result concerning this sigma central metric is that the invertibility of this complicated map capital Phi G is automatically proven provided a much simpler map. Provided a much simpler map is invertible. This much simpler map depends only on sigma, does not depend on the metric. So, a check of Levitica, if provided the metric is sigma-central, boils down to a check on the property of the braiding. This is the proof, it's just proving that there is a commutative diagram of isomorphism. And the interesting final result that we can explain is the fact that if G is a matrix such that phi G is invertible, for all matrix that are conformally equivalent to G, so that differ from G by a function f, well, then there is. Well, then there is a unique Levitica connection. It's quite easy actually to prove that Fg has also the invertibility property of this capital Phi, and so one has an explicit invertible connection. Now, this is our main result because allows, provided that this map is invertible, to Is invertible to obtain Levichivita connections that are not of matrix of this kind, that are therefore nor be invariant nor central. And as an example, I would like to consider the because I calculate on SLQ2 or SUQ2. Here, the map pi has been proven that. Has been proven that is this map has been proven to be invertible. So take any sigma central metric on SUQ2, then any scaling by a function of such a sigma central metric, like example the Bico invariance central metric, will have a corresponding Levi-Chibita connection. So in this sense, we have succeeded in obtaining In obtaining a class of Levitica connections or existence and uniqueness of Levi-Chibita connections for matrix on quantum groups that have a one degree of freedom. As a side remark, one can ask, but when the Hof algebra is triangular, well, when the Hof algebra is triangular, Hof algebra is triangular. All this construction goes through, and we recover some of the results of the most specific case for triangular hop algebra. So with this, we see that there is the possibility of understanding gravity on a quantum group with a generic metric. This is a first step. It's not fully generic, it's generic up to conform for scaling. Come for scaling. And with this, I thank you for your attention. Okay, let's start here and then we will have a question for it. Okay, well, I was guarding where to go from. The construction imaged he needed to use the lift of the two phones into one tensor one phone and this in this construction you have this problem not present or This problem is not present, or you need also to have a lift of two forms to one tensor, one if you would like to define the rich tensor out of the curvature or out of the in one tensor. Look, rich tensor has been defined in the triangular case. There it is, symmetric and anti-symmetric forms are naturally subspaces of. Uh, sub spaces of the forms, tensor forms, and the notion of Ricci is non-problematic. It uses the fact that we are working in a rigid monoidal category, so there are automatically traces. So, it's unique, right? So, there's no ambiguity in defining the literature here? No, there's no ambiguity. It's non-trivial because one has to go from right to left mode. To go from right to left modules, but there's no I'm just wondering, can we put this in terms of spectral triple? It seems to like there is a spectral triple that you put like the exterior algebra, the D and the Yes. Continuous functions. Yes, indeed. So, wait a second. For the triangular case, yes, indeed, the examples of the fazis of the theta spheres are examples that can be understood. Spectral triples, Con Landi spheres. So it would be interesting to for more general triangular hop algebras or algebras with triangular hop algebra symmetry. Of algebra symmetry. So to say, understand the dictionary between, let's say, what Ludwig has done, explained us earlier this morning, and this other approach. For the quantum group case, where there's no triangularity, well, things are more difficult. I was told that there are two top two questions, I believe, from the Zoom. Is that correct? I don't know, I was told that, but let me double-check. So whoever had a question from the people via Zoom? Yes, I have one question. Please go ahead. Hello, Mezu. Hi, Paulo. Yes, thanks for a nice talk. As you know, As you know, I think in Lie groups, there are these nice results that relate Ricci curvature for this Y-invariant metric connection to killing forms. So are there such results in this context? In your context, I mean the triangular case, yes. Then in the quantum group case, the situation is more in. The situation is more involved, so that's why I've been more careful. I was saying take a B-invariant central metric, but there are many different possibilities. And for example, Majid is stating that on a four D calculus or on SU SLQ two, there is a unique B invariant central metric. Central metric. I see. But I mean, the general discussion was initiated by Heckenberger, then Land and Zampini worked on that. Zampini had a follow-up paper. So I think that there is some extra work to be done there. I see. Is there another question from people online? Yes. Online, yes, uh, it's Caetano. Um, I ask, uh, as usual, what about star structures? Is there any star structure which is compatible with your construction? Yes, yes, that's a good question indeed. Here, I didn't have the time to discuss star structures. Um, are star structures. Star structures are important. Indeed, the metrics have some reality conditions. The metrics I was advocating before citing Majid is, for example, real. So, on one end, we know that the Covalen differential calculus goes well along with the star structure. All what I said is What I said is does apply to pseudo-Riemannian geometry. There's no need for positive definiteness of the metric. A full discussion of the star structure I don't have yet. I mean, star structures were again considered, for example, by Landy and Zampini and by Zampini. But again, full star structure. Again, full structured discussion is not presently exhaustive. But what would you expect, for example, for the connection? Under a star structure, will it become from right linear to left linear or how can you get some Can you get something which is mapped into itself? I mean, one has to expect that under a style structure, right linearity becomes left linearity. Well, that might well be so. Let's I've been considering the case where you start with a Start with a metric that is real, and then the unique Levitic-Chivita connection that comes out of it is the associated Levitica connection. I have not been thinking of putting a reality condition on the star structure in this very general context. Okay. Let us thank Paolo again. Thank Pablo again. And we meet at three o'clock, I think, with Fidel. Okay. I enjoy a lot of food. Find my way. Why why wouldn't you have why you wouldn't think
