In collaboration with Juan Davila, Manuel De Pino from the University of Basque, and Jun Cheng Wei from UBC on solution to Euler equation with concentrated both discipline. So, yeah. Yeah, okay. So, I will consider. I will consider the Euler equation both in this talk, both in dimension two and in dimension three in the whole space. And the solution I am interested in are those regular solutions whose vorticity, in some sense, converges. Converge to a Dirac delta, and the Dirac delta is seated on a set gamma that is a collection of a finite number of points in the case of dimension two and it is a curve in the case of dimension three. So, in the first part of my talk, I will be focusing on Be focusing on the case of dimension two and talk about the singularization of vortices. In the second part of the talk, I will present some results about what experiments and the leap flowing. These constructions are obtained by using what are known as gluing. What are known as bluing methods that have been used in other contexts, and we put them here in the Euler flow. So, let me start with dimension two. I will call omega the vorticity, and here in red is the stream-vorticity formulation of the Euler equation in dimension two, and psi is the stream function. So, if Is the string function. So if omega decays as some decays in space, we can talk about the string function that I will denote by psi. So let me assume that there exists a vorticity, a family of vorticity omega epsilon in a certain that in a certain interval of time. That in a certain interval of time, say zero to capital T is an epsilon regularization of a sum of Dirac delta centered at a certain number of points, C1, CK, in the sense that the vorticity converge weakly in sense of measures as epsilon goes to zero to the sum of the rap deltas and the Deltas and being the stream function, the inverse, so the inverse of the flaxion of the vorticity, the stream function psi epsilon will converge as epsilon goes to zero to a singular vorticity psi s, which will be given by the sum of fundamental solution that I denoted here by gamma. That they denoted here by gamma. So, if you have such a situation, so a smooth solution, a family of solutions of the Euler equation that converts an epsilon regularization of the sum of direct deltas. But it is known that the family of points, the set of points C1, CK, satisfy a system that sometimes is called the kid. Sometimes it's called the Kirkhoff root Hamiltonian system, the one written here in violet. And sometimes this system is known as the vortex model. So the K-vortex desingularization problem consists in the following question. Suppose you have a solution, xi, this is ψ1, psi. This is psi one, psi k of the system k and this is a solution in an interval of time zero to capital T and in this interval of time zero to capital T there are no collision. So the question is whether you have a solution, a regular solution of the stream vorticity system that system that converge as epsilon goes to zero to the singular vorticity and to the singular string function. And the answer to this question is yes, you have this and this is the result by Marchioro and Pulviretti in say 1983 in which they start with an initial condition. They start with an initial condition given by the sum of what they call a k blob. Each one of these blob is a smooth function with support in a ball of radius epsilon and the intensity of the vorticity epsilon to minus two, so it's an initial condition in L infinity and in L one. L1 and they let the Euler flow evolve and they prove in fact that this is true. The vorticity converges to the sum of the singular vorticity and the strain function as well. This result, which is very classical, very interesting, doesn't give Interesting, it doesn't give, because of the way it is obtained, any information on the vorticity or the string function, especially around the points, the vortices where the vorticity becomes singular. So, what we did, and what I would like to present first, is we We revisit this problem and we give an answer to this problem using a different method, the bluing methods, which I will try to explain, give in particular very precise description of the solution, especially near the vortices. The vortices. In fact, what we can do is we find a solution that, say, for the string function and the vorticity is written as a main part. Say, let me read just the vorticity. It's omega zero epsilon plus a reminder term. And omega zero epsilon and psi zero epsilon are very explicit. Are very explicit epsilon regularization of the singular vorticity and the singular steam function. And on the remainder terms, this psi epsilon and phi epsilon, we have a strong control. So let me describe how we design the string function. And let me start with the Let me start with epsi 0 epsilon. So epsi 0 epsilon, this is the log, we epsilon regularize it just adding here epsilon squared. So let me take this epsilon epsilon defined in this way. And of course, we oh sorry, this is very sensitive. We have the vorticity defined as Defined as minus Laplacian of the string function that takes a very explicit form is given by the proper scaling of what are known as the Kaufman-Schooling vortices. So it's immediate to see that this omega zero epsilon converge as epsilon goes to zero to the sum of the rack delta. To the sum of Dirac delta. And besides, if you believe what I wrote before that we have a solution like this with the control on the reminder terms, we have a precise description of the gradient per of psi zero epsilon, say the velocity field, how it converges to the sum of the rack delta. Sum of the Rach delta and the exact rate at which it goes to the sum of the Rach deltas. So the theorem that we have is the following. Suppose you have this set of points C1, CK that in the interval of time zero to capital T doesn't have any collision, then there is a solution to A solution to the Euler equation that has exactly this form. So the vorticity I introduced before, it is the Scully vortex with one over epsilon squared in front. The psi zero epsilon is the epsilon regularization of the fundamental solution. And we have the this estimate on the reminder term phi epsilon and psi epsilon. epsilon and psi epsilon. In fact, phi epsilon is epsilon to power sigma with some sigma in between zero and one smaller than the main part of the vorticity. While on the remainder part of the stream function we have this type of control. Our result is true, we can prove it, provided we are working on a finite interval of time, so from zero to capital T, and our construction or our method is not allowing us to pass to T equal to infinity. Nevertheless, we can extend a little bit. Little bit, we can reach large time, large in terms of epsilon, but we cannot reach time t equal to infinity. This remains an open question which would be extremely interesting to consider because of its relation with the stability of concentration vortex. Concentration vorticity. Let me mention that with also with AU we found exact traveling wave solution of this form where the points ψ are zero of the other most polynomials. So what I would like to do is to go through To go through a little bit the proof of this construction. Before going into the proof, let me tell you that there are three main ingredients in this construction. First of all, we build an approximate solution with expanding power of epsilon using. Using elliptic and transport equation. Then, in order to find a true solution of the problem, we set up a couple system of problems. One is called the inner problem and the other is called the outer problem. The inner problem somehow takes into account what happens close to the vortices while the outer problem is. While the outer problem is more regular and takes into account what goes on far away from the vortices. And finally, we can prove the solution via a fixed point argument, which is based on solving some basic linear theory. A theory that are solved using continuation argument and a priori estimate. So let me be a little bit more precise. So let me start with the approximation. And in particular, let me focus on the approximate solution near the vertices. So E. So E denotes the Euler operator, and we want to find the omega and psi so that E equals to zero. Let me denote with gamma zero this function here. This is gamma zero in some other context. This is the solution of the village equation, namely it solves minus Laplacian of gamma zero equals f of gamma zero with f of gamma zero with f certain exponential. And you can see that this f of gamma zero gives you the Kaufmann scurry vortex capital U0. So I introduce gamma zero in such a way that the same function I introduced before can be written in terms of this capital gamma zero. capital gamma zero. And the vorticity, the initial vorticity or the vorticity we start with is given by the sum of scaled scaly vortices. So if you introduce, if you want to look at what happens near one vortex, a good way to do it is to scale the variable. So let me introduce why. introduce y the variable x minus psi j divided by epsilon and we look for a solution of the form the principal part psi zero epsilon plus a reminder that is expressed in terms of the variable y and also for the vorticity we have the principal part this is omega zero epsilon and then we have a reminder which has the same form the same shape one form the same shape one over epsilon square times a function phi of y and t. So in the in the y variable and after multiplying by epsilon to power four the Euler equation gets written in this form here. So you have epsilon square 15 and then you have the quadratic term here. And then immediately at the first glance you see that the end A first glance, you see that the error is well, the point xi move around, but maybe they are bounded. So this term here seems to be of size epsilon. But if you immediately use the dynamics that the point psi satisfy, you get an immediate reduction of the energy. A reduction of the error, and in particular, you see that these two terms in the error look like the gradient percent of the function gamma zero plus a term that I call the capital R, which is of size epsilon square, y square. So, if you put this back in the equation and you do Do the computation of this quadratic part, you recognize that the error can be rewritten in this form. Let me say why. So you have here a gradient perp of gamma zero dot gradient of u zero. This is zero. Then you have gradient perk of gamma zero dot phi, but phi. dot phi, but phi is the Laplacian of psi, so you recognize this term here. Then you have the gradient perp of psi dot the gradient of u zero. Then you use the fact that the scaly vortex u zero is the exponential of the function gamma zero, and you differentiate it to get this term here, f prime gamma zero psi. prime gamma zero psi gradient everything dotted with the gradient path of gamma zero and then you have the rest you have a term that does not depend on fine psi you have another term which is linear but goes with a smaller term in front and you have the quadratic part gradient thep of psi dot gradient of phi so the initial error say as we mentioned before is mentioned before is so r is epsilon square y square so you zero in the the case like one over y to power four the gradient is one over y to power five you get an error of this size in order to improve this error we first solve not the full linear operator but we just take Operator, but we just take the elliptic part of this operator. So, this elliptic part of the operator can be written in a more friendly way if you introduce polar coordinates. In fact, this elliptic operator is just a a weight here, one over rho square, times d theta of the linearized Louville equation here. Wheel equation here. So, if you want to improve, the problem is that you want to invert somehow this linear operator, but this operator is highly degenerate. In fact, all radial functions, of course, belongs to the kernel of this operator. And also, the linearized Liouville equation, this linear operator here inside the bracket, has The bracket has three bounded elements in the kernel coming from the invariance under translation and certain dilation of an elliptic equation. So you have a lot of degeneracy in this elliptic operator. Nevertheless, you are lucky. You are lucky because your first error has the form of d theta times something. times something and this something has only in Fourier modes modes two and three so that you can solve elliptically you get a epsi of order epsilon square and a phi of order epsilon square which and a decay of size rho to minus the two. So that you get a new error you started with an error of new error you started with an error of size epsilon that then you get to an error of size epsilon square and here we are with an error of epsilon of size epsilon to power four and this happens not to be enough so what we need is to get to an error of size epsilon to power five and decay in spatial decay Decay rho cube and we can do it by solving sometimes the elliptic equation I just described or the transport equation written here. So we solve using the elliptic when we can, when the error is somehow orthogonal to the element of the kernel. Orthogonal to the element of the kernel. And if we do that, we gain to the power of epsilon and lose some decay. When we cannot solve with the elliptic operator, we use the transport equation. And in this case, we lose to the power of epsilon in the new error, but we gain decay in space. In space. But we are able to get to an error of this form, of this size. This is enough, in fact, for what goes after, which I would like to describe. It is the inner and outer gluing scheme. So we have, say, built an approximation an approximate solution a vorticity omega epsilon star this is defined for t between zero and capital t and an explicit psi epsilon star so we look for a solution of this form let me just describe the vorticity so besides So, besides the approximation, we add two terms. The first term is expressed in the scaled variable and it is multiplied by a cutoff function, eta j and scaled with epsilon to power minus two, which is the natural scaling for the vorticity, which is not present, of course, for the Of course, for the stream function. And another term that we call phi outer, which is expressed in terms of the original variable x. So you make these ansats here, and we observe that if the phi j and we have k phi j phi out phi out psi j psi out solve a certain system of equation then we have a solution with this this system of equation is so it's a coupled system of a k inner equation this is the one written in red where you recognize the linear operation Recognize the linear operator discussed before, then you have the error, you have these terms here represents the quadratic terms and the other terms coming and the coupling, the coupling with the outer equation, with the variable in the outer function. The outer function, while the phi outer and the psi outer solve this system here, which is at main order a transport equation. I'm sorry to interrupt. I'm a little confused. Can I ask what is the K here? Can you go back one slide? Yes, how do you choose this phij? Why can't you, for example, combine them to one term? Oh, so you have, okay, you have k centers. You have k centers, sorry. In fact, I could have done it with just one. Yeah, let's forget about. Okay, I see. So, once you have the answers for omega, is the answers for psi, big psi, just solved from omega or? Solved from omega or and you you solve uh so the the psi j are are solved from phi j using pier-sava law using pier-savag law okay the psi j is it's the psi out is more complicated because you are having you have you have um a coupling between the two systems in fact you you need to somehow to control the car Somehow to control the coupling. So it's clear how the outer enters in the inner and so how the inner enters in the outer is made in such a way that every time you find the F or F in the outer, it goes with a derivative of the cutoff. Of the cutoff. So that what you really need to do for when you want to solve the inner equation is to control the solution in a region where the derivative of the cutoff is not zero. Thank you. So, what I would like to discuss here is just the linear equation for the inner problem. The inner problem. So that we recognize it is like I wrote before with the initial condition zero for a right-hand side, say an error of this size, of this type. Of course, E is also a function of t, but t, everything that involves the variable t Involves the variable t is smooth and bounded. So this is the description of the right-hand side E. In order to solve and to get bounds on this solution, the central step is to get an L2 a priori estimate for the solution. We then pass to We then pass to Lp and L infinity with weight, but I would like to discuss the L2 a priori estimate for this inner problem in R2. So assume you have a solution, phi, that solves this problem, and psi is given by Opsavan law. And the a priori estimate we have is the following. Assume phi is a solution and satisfy this four or to Satisfy this four orthogonality condition. Remember that the elliptic operator here has elements in the kernel, all Rydal functions, so somehow you want to kill the Rydal function. Then there are elements in the kernel of the Liouville equation that are killed in part by this orthogonality condition and this other orthogonality condition. So assume you have a solution of So, assume you have a solution of this equation satisfying this orthogonality condition, then we get the following L2 estimate for L2 weighted norm. So you control the L2 weighted, so U0 is like one over rho to power four, so this here you have a weight of size rho squared. size rho square. So you control this L2 norm in terms of the equivalent L2 norm of the right hand side, losing epsilon squared, which is coming from here, but we also have a log of epsilon, which we will see will come from this orthogonality condition that is not taken because of decay in the whole space R2. The whole space are two, you have to take it in a large ball of size epsilon to power minus one. So, how do we get the a priori estimate? We found a good text function, this little g. We multiply the equation against little g. We do some computations which are very explicit. Explicit and we get rid of this term here. And to get rid of this term here, we use two facts. We use the fact that u zero is f of gamma zero and the fact that gamma zero and u zero are a radial function. So you are left with the first term and the second term and using older on the right and then On the right, and then integrating in time, you get that this integral phi times g is bounded by this term here. Now, the point is to estimate from below this term, the integral of phi times g, by what we want, which is the L2 norm of phi u0 to. phi u zero to power minus one half. The other bound from above, the control here, is automatic. So let me describe and discuss this bound on a quadratic form on phi times g. In order to get this bound, we found it useful to go to the To S2 and this integral in S2, if Phi tilde lives in S2, becomes this integral here. So if you decompose Phi tilde with in spherical harmonics, and let me write, say, the first four elements. The four elements up to j from zero to three, and then the rest fit in the pair. The orthogonality condition, the first two of the orthogonality condition, gives automatically that lambda zero. So the first value here is zero. Value here is zero, and you also, so phi tilde is zero, sorry, and phi tilde three is zero because of the orthogonality condition. So you can write this quadratic form in this way, which is proportional to the L2 norm of Fitilde Perk. But you need this L2 norm of fit perfect. This L2 norm of phi tilde perp to be proportional to the whole norm L2 of phi tilde. And you can do it, but losing using the other two orthogonality conditions, but here you lose a log epsilon. And this is why you get a log epsilon. You also use lose a log epsilon, not only an epsilon squared, in the apioi bounds. Square in the apioid bounds. Okay, this was the proof, the method. So what I can say is that the difference with the result of Marchioro and Pulvirenti is that they start with a certain initial condition and they let the flow evolve. We follow the flow closely. Closely. And in this way, we can describe precisely the asymptotics of the solution, in particular near the vortices. So let me go to now the Euler equation in dimension three. This is written in the This is written in dimension three, and here now I am interested in in vorticity that are big in a neighborhood of size epsilon of a certain curve. The curve moves in time, it's gamma t, and it is parameterized by arc length s. So we can think of the vorticity as like the arc delta. Like the Rach delta set along this curve multiplied by the tangent to this curve gamma of t. So this is the finite frame. T is the tangent and the normal and b is the binormal. And the real formal computation gives you that if you have such an object, formally the curve gamma. Formally, the curve gamma evolves by the binormal flow. So, gamma t is proportional to the binormal vector at each point and at each time, at each instant in time. And here, kappa is the curvature of the curve. So, if you with With a term here coming, he uses the Vyotsevar law, coming there is a log epsilon, so epsilon is the size of the neighborhood. If you want to get rid of the log epsilon here, you change variable in this way and you get the binormal flow for Normal flow for curves. This formal law was obtained by several authors. Cauchy problem for Navier-Stokes with initial data like Dirac delta on a curve has been widely studied by these and other authors. And there is also And there is also a particular specific study on the binormal flow for curves. Yeah, let me skip this because I am running out of time. So, what can be called vortex filament conjecture now is Now is the following. Assume you are given a solution, a curve that evolves by normal flow. Is that true that we can find a true solution to the 3D Euler flow so that the vorticity as epsilon goes to zero concentrate along the Along the flow along the Dirac delta concentrates along this curve gamma that evolved by normal flow with exactly this form. The vortex filament conjecture was not explicitly stated by the early works of Helmholtz, Kelving and Darios, but And the Rios, but it was somehow implicit there, but it was explicitly stated by Benedetto Caglioro and Marchioro and Gerard and Says. So this problem is open except in very special cases. So two examples of curves that evolve by binormal flow are the Are the elixir that translate vertically and rotate without changing shape, and the circle that translates vertically along its axis with constant velocity. So let me start with the Elix. In fact, this In fact, this this curve here, gamma of s tau, for any tau, this is an elix and you can move the elix. So if you choose A1 here and B1 properly, this is a family of rotating and translating ELICE that solved the binormal flow. And in fact, we were able to Fact, we were able to construct a solution of the Euler equation whose vorticity concentrates along an elix that evolved by normal flow. In fact, along one elix or several elixes. The construction is in a sense reduced to an elliptic equation. To an elliptic equation. In fact, a derivation by work by Etiker and TT in 2009, they proved that if you consider a solution which have elikoidal symmetry and so that the initial velocity is orthogonal to the tangent of the elixir. And this property, if you start with an initial velocity, If you start with an initial velocity like that, this property is kept along the flow. So, if you are under this condition, the magic thing is that the vortex stretching term disappear, and the solution can be found as a scanar function omega multiplied by a vector, and this vector is just the tangent to the elix. Tangent to the elix. So this scalar function here satisfy if you want a 2D because this is a function of in 2D, a 2D Euler equation with a different Bayot-Savart law. So it's different Bayot-Savart law, but it's in divergence form. And you can treat it. In particular, if you look for a rotating solution, Solution, you reduce to study an elliptic equation with this operator in divergence frame. And this is what we did. Now, another solution is the vortex ring that these are known. The vortex ring are a solution to the axis-symmetric Euler equation with a no. Equation with no swill. So you are reduced to solve this equation here in the box. So it's like an Euler equation in 2D. Here, R is bigger than zero and zeta is the other variable. And the Biot-Savar law is given. I wrote it is like Laplacian 5 because the Bayot-Savar law is given by that. So L. So, Elmos already said that this vortex ring solution existed, and Frankel proved it. And in fact, Frankel, what he proved is the existence of exact traveling ring solution. So, he put these answers, this WT disappears, you get this equation here, and you can solve. Here, and you can solve this equation if you find the psi solution of this elliptic equation here for any choice of nonlinearity little F. Now, since you want that RW, so the vorticity is like concentrated, so you want Rw to be like a derivative. Like a Dirac delta around a point. Let me take P0, P0, the point of type R0, 0, second component is 0. It's important to have an idea of what is the green function of the new operator, the Laplacian 5, of G. And this can be And this can be expanded when you are close to p0 in this way. H0 is quadratic when x, so it's like x minus p0 square, and h1 is an harmonic function, smooth and decaying. So Franklin's solution is just in terms of stream function, is an epsilon regular. Is an epsilon regularization of this green function. In fact, if you choose f to be an exponential nonlinearity, with this choice of, say, epsilon, you recover w. Epsilon again is like the Scully vortex scaled around P0. So if you try to compute the error, To compute the error, which is a way to phrase Franklin's result, you get that the velocity with which the vortex ring travels vertically is proportional to the radius R0 of the ring, and the next order term is of order one over log. So in So in his paper in 1858, Elmos also described the leapfrog. And in fact, he saw that, assume you have two of these rings and they travel in the same direction, they have the same access. Same axis and they interact between each other. Since the speed of each ring is proportional to one of the radius, you will have, say, a larger radius that travels slowly than the ring with a smaller radius that Smaller radius that travels faster. And these rings they penetrate one. So you see in this picture, there are three rings. There is the red ring, which is wider and goes slowlier. The green one is a smaller radio, it goes faster. So the green one penetrates the red one and so on. This is And so on. This is what is called the leapfrogging. So what we did is to construct this solution. So the solution is a solution of the equation written here. How did we do it? We took two Frankl solutions, right? So two rings in terms of vorticity. In terms of vorticity, they are centered at point Pj and scaled with epsilon j, and there is one over rj in front. These are just two Frankl solution. And we let the points and the scaling parameter be function of time. In fact, we need that along the time. That along the time, this quantity here remains constant in time. Why? Because if you compute the error, so if you compute the equation, the equation is just given by this box here plus this box here. You get a term, the blue term here, which is multiplied by a radial. Is multiplied by a radial function, the famous capital U0. And the radial function are complicated to be. So choosing this relation between the first component of pj and the scaling parameter epsilon j in terms of time, we get rid of this first term here. Then we Then we have this is a smaller term, and then we have terms that go together with the gradient of u zero. So if we put together the terms that go with the gradient of u zero, we get this equation, this system. So assume you have just one ring. So you have just P1 and you have You have just p1 and you don't have p2. This equation recovers the equation of Frankel. So the ring is of radius r0 and the speed is proportional to 1 over r0. But assume you have the second point. Well, you can write the second point in this way. So the next term is of So, the next term is of size 1 over square root of log epsilon. If the points BI written here satisfy a certain equation, the leapfrog dynamics, then the PI satisfy at main order this system of ODE. So, what we proved is that if you have a solution that in an interval of That in an interval of time, solution of the leapfrog dynamics: that in an interval of time 0t doesn't have any collision, then you can find a solution like the sum of two vortex rings. So two To Frankel's solution, and this describes exactly the leapfrogging. The leapfrog was derived first by Clain, Maida, and Damodaran in 1995. John's Metz constructs a solution of the Gross-Pitayevsky equation with In which you can see the phenomenon of the leap frogging. And of course, the vortex filament conjecture is still open. An important ingredient is the linear spectral analysis around a vertical vortex filament by Galileo. By Galilean Smiths. And maybe these gluing methods can be used to give some results on the vortex filament conjecture. Okay, thank you very much. Sorry, I probably went a little bit over time.
