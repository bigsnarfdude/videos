Okay, thank you. Thank you. I thank organizers for this wonderful workshop. I'm sorry I could not be there in person. I hoped I could do it, but sorry for that. So I changed the title because I didn't know what I put the wrong abstract there. So actually, this is the one I want. There, so actually, this is the one I want to talk about. Okay, great, thank you. Uh, let me uh look at this. So, I'm going to just talk three of these parts. First, I'm going to introduce this elasticity and equations and mention a little bit about some relevant existence result. And then I'm going to talk about some elastic effect on voltage sheets. On voltage sheets, and then finally, the elastic effect on invisit limit. Okay. So, of course, everyone knows that electricity is an important branch in mechanics. And so, and there are lots of applications in many. Many subjects. And also, there are lots of studies, huge actually literature on the analysis on the related elastic flows. And so, elastic fluids actually has a combination of both fluid and solid characteristics. So, it So it makes it special because there's a strong interaction between this microscopic elastic property and also the macroscopic fluid motions. So this makes things in elastic fluids complicated and also difficult in a relevant, right? And so in general, In general, the visco elastic flow, for example, this is like a fluid flow. Okay, looks like the equations look like this. So here you have the standard kind of compressible Levstocks part, and then you have this part which is called the deformation gradient. So F is a matrix which represents the deformation gradient. And then the deformation gradient. So, in three-dimensional case, it is a three by three matrix, right? And so, this visco elasticity fluid, this equation on F, about F here is kind of transport on left side. There is some term on right side here. So, it's very important that there is no diffusion in this equation, in this equation of deformation gradient. So, even in viscos elasticity, Even in viscous elasticity with this viscosity on the momentum equation, you still have a lot of difficulty about this problem because you cannot control F, the regularity of F. So F still has this low regularity in general. Okay, so which makes the general theory of existence and so on difficult. And so on difficult. And in the case, so we have this kind of Euler type equations, right? And a couple of same equation on this deformation granted, F, right? So, of course, there are lots of studies about the existence of solutions on Existence of solutions on either the viscous elasticity or the elastic inviscid elastic case, right? So, lots of studies there. And I'm going to just mention one relevant result here, which is which was done many years ago with my student Xin Pong Fu. So, we consider a bounded domain, right? You consider the initial boundary variable problem in a bounded domain. Boundary variable problem in a boundary domain and look at this visco elastic problem. As I just said that this deformation gradient actually makes this problem difficult because we cannot get a good regularity. Okay, so some good things about this elasticity here is that you have some intuitive properties. For example, these three identities here are listed here. If they are satisfied initially, If they are satisfied initially at a time t equal to zero, then you can prove that these three things hold for all time t bigger than zero. Okay, so these three properties are very important, are very important structures for the basic elastic problem. Okay, so I just code one result here. So as I said here in this So, as I said, here in this case, we consider a small perturbation of a constant background solution, okay? Constant equilibrium. So, constant background, you have a small perturbation here, and then you can, of course, you can find the group of strong solution for this visco elastic problem. And of course, if the perturbation is large, in general, the existing problem is still. In general, the existing problem is still open, still open. So, this is actually the kind of the bad part about this elasticity because of the coupling strong interaction with the deformation gradient, right? In terms of this existence theory. And of course, in the invisible case, you can also form this, you have the final formation of singularity. Of singularity in final time. So, but what I'm talking about here is some on the other direction. So, the other direction is that actually, although the deformation can give you lots of trouble in many cases, but sometimes actually the deformation can provide some good things, some special good effects on the behavior of elastic flow. On the behavior of elastic fluids. Okay. So, as I mentioned in the beginning, so I'm going to talk about a tool. So, first, for example, the first one here is you can provide, this deformation can provide a stabilizing effect on the voltage sheets and the context discontinued in the free boundary problems of this compressible inviscid elastic problem. And there are lots of work here, so I'm going to mention that. To mention that. So, what is vortex sheet? Basically, vortex sheet vortex sheets are interfaces in flows where the tangential velocity has a jump, but the normal velocity is continuous. I'm going to show you a couple of pictures. So, this is a kind of volcano in nature. And this is also volcanic around the airfoil. Okay, you have this kind of volcanic sheet. This kind of voltage sheet here around FOIA. And so, this is just a graph explaining what the voltage sheet is. So, here you have a voltage sheet. This is the interface, okay? But on both sides, these tangential fluid different tangential. But the normal direction, the velocity is continuous, all right. Is continuous, all right. So, uh, for this problem, there have been actually lots of studies on the stability of voltage of voltage, the county discontinuity is in the compressible fluids. So, for example, for the oil of flow, Connor B and Saki, they have had a couple of papers in early 2024. 2004 and 08, and then they continue to have lots of other problems, papers on related things. Okay, this is about the oil. And also this, Ya Wang and Fang Yu, they had some papers on the steady case. All right. But also, in recent years, there are also some studies about this stability of voltage sheets. For example, For example, in MHD, for example, oil flow with surface tension, relativistic flows, and also plasma vacuum, and so on. So, how are the some just needs to sum up the papers here? Okay, and there is also some other related works still, I think it's going on there. Okay, I should mention that for this void test. That uh, for this voltage, there are many many papers in uh for the incompressible cases, okay, for the incompressible. So, I'm not going to uh go over that. And the main thing is that for vortex sheet is that for the three-dimensional compressible orinoflow, the vortex sheets are always wide and unstable, always unstable. Okay, so there are some simple. Some simple arguments. Okay, for example, in this paper by Miles, and also Dennis has some argument on that. And but recently, we have there is some papers on stabilizing. So first the stabilizing effects was discovered by Guizhang Cheng and Yaguang, and also independent by Chikini. In dependent by Chicini for the MHD problem, okay, three-dimensional MHD problem. So that means, okay, the Euler, three-dimensional Euler water sheets is not stable, right? But if we add a MHD magnetic field, it is stable, all right? So this is, and then if we add a surface tension, it is also stable. So this is Ben-Stevens work. And recently, we find that the electricity can also provide this. Can also provide this stabilizing effect. So, this is our work, recent work, especially with my colleague Ming Chen and also my former student, Jino Hu. And here we have this also Fu Ming Huang and this is Defen Yuan and as well. Okay, so I'm going to just look at this 3D case. Okay, so in the 3D elastic flow, it says this is the equation. Elastic flow, this is the equation. So, you can rewrite the last equation on deformation grade in the divergence form. Okay, so then you can form the vortex sheet. So, okay, the vortex sheet here, you can use a piecewise smooth solution on both sides of a interface, hypersurface, and described by this equation. Equation. And there's so both sides, u plus, u minus are smooth as the picture I show you. And then in the jumper condition, so we, because we have all the divergence form, we can form, we can easily write down the Rankine-Hugely jumper condition. Okay, so the jumper condition in general looks like that. But for vocal sheets, it is a contact discontinuity. So you have the normal direction, the jump. That the normal direction, the jump is zero, which means the normal direction is continuous, but uh, the velocity still has jump, which means the tangential direction has jumped. Okay, and this is just means the contact is so then the jump condition looks like this, okay? So it looks like that, like this one. And then to do this problem, the general approach is that you are going to flatten, you are going to fix the free boundary. Okay, so you are going to introduce some. Okay, so you are going to introduce some function phi to make this happen. Let me see. All right, so then the problem becomes like become this one. So here in this equation, here you have a1, a2, a3, and so on, and these are complicated matrices. Okay, so I didn't put it here because. So, I'm I didn't put it here because each one is very big, it's like a 13 by 13 uh matrix. So, it's I'm not, I didn't put it here, but there are bigger matrices here, okay, so with some boundary condition. So, what do you want to you want to solve this problem, okay? So, this problem, and uh, and uh, the first step is to linearize this. is to linearize this system around at least backward constant background solution. So what does that mean is that you are going to have a flat constant background so that on the both sides they are constants and then the interface is a straight line. And so you are going to linearize the system around this constant background solution. And then we look at this linear system. So, the first step for this problem is the linear step in it. So, you look at this linearizer system, and then we can have this kind of a rough statement of this linear step image. All right. So, what this basically says is that this one, if This one, if the first row and the second row of the deformation gradient, the background solution, if they are not parallel, and this velocity is between zero, bigger than zero, of course, and less than this F, I'm going to explain a little bit about this curved F here. Or this velocity between these two things, okay, then the constant, the voltage sheet solution, the back constant background solution. Sheet solution, the back constant background solution is nearly stable. Otherwise, if this is bigger than that, then this constant background solution is nearly unstable. So before I explain the F here, then you see that we actually have sufficient and necessary condition for the linear stability. All right. So the reason we put a, we separate these two cases here because they are estimates and it will be different. Okay. Estimates and it will be different, okay? So, for these two cases, uh, so what is this curve f? The curl f the expression is very complicated, and uh, so it comes from uh a unpunicior function derived from my equation. So, it's complicated to say, but uh, roughly it has a good estimate. Like, this f is between this one and this one, okay? So, what is this notation here is like. This notation here is like this. So you have vector A and vector B, and this is the projection of A along the direction of B, and this is the vertical component, right? And therefore, here, this is also the vertical component here. And so you see that first thing, you see that if I hear some echo there. If this F1 and F2 are parallel, then this is zero, right? So that's why we don't want this to be to be parallel. Therefore, so we have a region, a stable, two stable region there. And so from this one, you can see that if f is zero, okay, look at what is this. If f is zero, then this is going to be. You this is going to be zero, right? This is going to be zero, and so that is you are not going to have a stable linear stable region. So that means which we go back to the Euler equation, right? That means this, if you go back to the Euler, then the voltage sheet is unstable, which is consistent with the analysis in literature. Basically, you can correct. Okay, which you basically can recover those oil case. All right, so but when you have this elasticity, actually you have some stable region, okay? So you have some region which is give you the linear stability, all right? So this is the effect of this electricity. Otherwise, you don't have this really Otherwise, you don't have this linear stable region. All right. So, to do this, here we are looking at the three-dimensional case. So, the extra dimension means that you're comparing this three-dimensional case with a two-dimensional case, right? So, this extra dimension actually make the analysis, especially the spectrum analysis, much more complicated. And this uniform crisis, the Patiski condition failed. This lumbatiski condition fails and also the distribution of rules for the lumbatiski determiner is very complicated. Okay, and also the standard symmetrization technique cannot be applied here. So, what is the main idea in our proof? So, your gondo, of course, you need to use this norm here, at least we use the normal mode analysis. And so, because the And so, because the standard cross-symmetriz does not work, so we use the up triangular triangularization to separate the outgoing mode. So, this is something we need to do in order to study the elastic problem, right? And of course, you need to look at the lobitisk determinants, okay? And so, this is very complicated, so you need to look at. Need to look at them carefully, very carefully, and eventually you're going to derive this establish this energy estimate. Okay, so this is the main idea. And this just shows you that we have some good things coming out from the electricity in terms of the stability of voltage sheets. All right. And well, this is only the linear stability. Then, last natural question is: how about the non-linear stability, which turns out to be. Affinity, which turns out to be very difficult. So we are still looking at this part. But let me just show you the 2D case. In the 2D case, we have actually this non-linear stability. So let me just explain the 2D case for the non-linear stability because the 3D case is still ongoing here. So for the Euler, we know that for the Euler equation, in 2D case, the voltage sheet are unstable if the Macher number is. Are unstable if the Mach number is less than square of two, and stable if in the supersonic case, Mark number bigger than square root of two. Okay, this is in their paper. And but what is the elasticity part results? So in this electricity case, you see that if the velocity is bigger than this, so here you see also some elastic effect coming. And also, or this one, the velocity is less than this. Nessing this. So, this is a kind of subsonic region. All right. So, in order case, it says if the marker is nesting squared, you don't have any stable region. But in elasticity, you have some extra region here besides this supersonic region, right? And so we have this kind of non-linear stepping for this elastic flow in the 20 case, right? In the 2D case. So, to do the anonymous stability, we actually can do it, can do it by three steps. First, the linear stability with constant coefficients. Second, the linear stability with variable coefficients. Then you look at the linear stability, right? So, the main technique here is you need a normal model analysis, upper triangular method. This is required. This is required for the elastic problem, okay. And actually, this upper triangle can be applied to Euler, to MHD, and so on, right? So, and also we need some pair neuralization, micro-local analysis, and national, and so on, okay? And so, this is basically the and in the last few minutes, I'll probably go over it quickly about this. This Vinishi viscosity limit. So, the inacid also can provide some good effects on the Vinishi viscosity process. This shows that it can prevent the formation of strong boundary layers. So, this is a elastic, visco-elastic problem in half-space, XY half space. And the initial, you can put the initial data and also the this is a no. Also, this is a no loose limp boundary condition, okay. No sniper function condition like this, and uh, uh, so the when epsilon goes to zero, of course, this becomes elastic, invisit elastic equation, all right? So, the end the goal is to justify the invisible limit as epsilon go to zero under this low super boundary condition. So, history shows that for the kaushi problem, you can do many things, okay, in the Uh, many things okay. In the compressible case, you can do it, also, compressible case, you can verify this compressible case for cooking. There's some work on also on the humicity limit. When you have a boundary, things becomes complicated because you have possible boundary layers. Okay, on the other hand, when you have the level of slip boundary condition, there is no strong boundary layer, so you can still have this. Can still have this vanishing with its cost limits, right? And there's some also free boundary with surface tension. When you have the loose boundary condition, in couple of cases, there are some work on this. You can see some of this work in even MHD also something. But for the compressible case, the only paper in literature, and always I know is this paper. Is this paper for the linearized problem, not for the original part for the linearizer problem? So, in general, for the compressed way, this is open in analytic, and even this class, all right, dual class. Okay, so but when you have the deformation gradient in elasticity, things becomes actually better. So, there will be no strong boundary layer in this case when you do that. In this case, when you do the vanish-based continuum, so uh, so let me just show you uh the main result before that. Uh, we need to introduce the chronomal derivative. Okay, you need to use this chromo derivative, and here is the weight phi. A typical choice is this one, and you can define the subony space like that, and also the energy here. Okay, I'm not going to go over the details, these are just notations, and the main result is like this: okay, suppose. Is like this. Suppose you have the small perturbation of some constant backbone solution. Okay. And then initially, we need how we need this condition. So this will be these structures will be true for all time t bigger than zero. And then you have this estimate. Okay. You have this, you have a solution, right? You have a, so you have a unique solution, and also you have this estimate. And also, Have this estimate, and also you have a function u0 satisfying this limit. So, at this limit, u0 is the solution to the inviscid case, okay, with the same no-snip boundary condition. So, which means that you don't have strong boundary layer when you do the inviscid limit. Let me just show you quickly why we can do this because the calculation is complicated, but the crucial things, let me The crucial things, let me just a couple of slides, probably very quick. Here, just show you some remarks. I'm going to skip, I guess, just to show that the elasticity can provide a good things. All right, so you rewrite the system, all right, and because of the perturbation, we use the perturbation notation, and then you need to prove this proposition. This is the main estimates you need to get. You need to get. All right, these are basically how you want to key part is to derive the uniform estimate of the normal derivative of solutions. So here this one basically shows you the main reason why elasticity can do it. So from the equation of the elasticity, you can write the normal derivative of the velocity in terms of these elastic components. Okay. So this if Okay, so this if there are no elastic components here, you cannot represent the normal durability of the velocity. But when you have the elasticity, you can do it like this. And so this is the main reason why you can do this. So then using this expression here, then you can estimate the dilutive, the normal derivative of the velocity. So this is the major main reason. Otherwise, you cannot do it. Okay. So of course, Okay, so of course the remaining party have to make a sense, make the estimates. So there's other steps also need to estimate the deformation, the normal derivative of the deformation gradient, F, right? And there are also some other steps to calculate the derivative of the pressure, okay? Okay, and there are some techniques. These are the technical parts. Okay, very kind of they have to figure out a way to close the estimate. So that's basically the idea. And then also do more estimates, finishes the estimates for the F. All right. Okay. So I'm going to skip the detail. But eventually you have to close the estimates. You need to control this horn Q. That means. Q. That means you need to get a more estimate on the derivative. So just take the derivative on the equation and do the similar estimates. Okay, so it's repeat these steps. And recently you can also do 3D case. So here we did a 2D case, but also can do 3D case. Okay. So this basically summary is the elasticity, although Summary: The elasticity, although can be bad in many cases, but also can provide a good sense on the stability of voltage sheets and also vanish viscosity, right? So, there's, of course, many urban problems there. Okay, so I thank you.
