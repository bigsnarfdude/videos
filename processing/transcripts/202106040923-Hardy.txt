Welcome to the ultimate panel discussion. So the idea unfortunately Fabio couldn't make it and Marcus will just be with us for 10 to 15 minutes. So we should bear that in mind. So please, if you have questions for Marcus, please ask those early on. Okay, so first of all, perhaps I could. So, first of all, perhaps I could ask everyone on the panel to sort of give the sort of big picture discussion of the field. What are the big challenges? What are the big questions that you want to investigate? And so, and try to keep that short. So, do it in 30 seconds to one minute. So, no pressure, really. And I'll start with Marcus. Thanks, Rob. So, the big challenge that I The big challenge that I was highlighting is the one of quantum solids, to put it very blatantly. How can we prepare in the experiment and control quantum states of massive objects and in particular objects with large delocalizations, large mass, and large coherence times. Great, thanks. That was under 30 seconds. Great, thanks. That was under thirty seconds. And let me ask Silke next. Well, so I think that, I mean, within analog gravity or in general, if we interact with measure the selective excitations in the systems, how can we do this? What is the suitable quantum sensitive measure? So, in particular, if you want to use the superfluids as quantum simulators, how can you extract the information, the observables, without sort of destroying your system, without destroying the quantum simulator? So, I think this is an interesting question within analog gravity, but beyond for people working with Posey-Einstein condensate and superfluid helium systems. Okay. I think for sorry, Chris, please go ahead. Yeah, sorry. So speaking specifically for, yeah, just the quantum simulation, I mean, I think the obvious thing to try to do is to scale up, you know, the and I think and more, well, scaling up part of that is saying trying to actually get to the point of doing something useful or finding hard models. And so I think. Finding hard models. And so I think, in general, the point of analog quantum simulation is kind of a waypoint. You know, if some point in the future we have universal, you know, error-corrected quantum computers, then you'll just do digital simulations of whatever you want. But in the meantime, which could be still the next 20 years, this analog quantum simulation is interesting. But we still want to get up to a scale and add things like interactions and go to the higher dimension where you do things that you can't do on a classical computer now. On a classical computer now. So I think that's definitely the goal. Okay, thank you. Okay, let's take questions and Gavin, you have questions. Is your question for Marcus? Yes. Okay, great. Please go ahead. Hi, Marcus. Is Gavin? Hi, Marcus. It's Gavin here. How are you going? So you said that the entanglement rate is the same when you've got two trapped particles next to each other. That gets the same gravity entangling rate as if you put each one into a spatial superposition. Can you sort of give me an intuitive way of understanding that? Because I would have thought that putting them into a spatial supersposition. That the putting them into a spatial superposition seems intuitively to sort of help. So it turns out that the thing that defines the strength of the coupling is really the delocalization. And so this is where a situation where you have a harmonic oscillator. So basically just a wave packet with large delocalization. With large delocalization, for example, a squeezed state, provides the same coupling strength than a superposition with two distinct center of mass positions at a separation of delta x. So, you know, very, very loosely speaking, it's actually the amount of fluctuation that determines the strength. And as long as you keep delta x the same, so in the one case, it's a squeezing or a It's a squeezing, or let's say, an extended wave packet of harmonic oscillator, or a genuine separation of the center of mass states, you get the same order of magnitude coupling rates. I mean, if you're interested, one can actually easily write that down. So it is a quick derivation of the coupling rates, and it's the same. So in the one case, the Hamiltonian of the Newtonian coupling, the detailer expand, in the other case, the cow phase shift. The cow phase shift. I have notes on that. I can send that to you. Yeah. Okay. I guess I see that maybe the entangling rate is the same, but is it still better for an entanglement witness at the end? Yeah, that's a good question. Yeah, I agree. This is a totally different question. Okay. So once you have entanglement, how do you measure it? And then what is the best witness? I don't have a good answer to that yet. In the one case, you measured basically EPR. Basically, EPR variances if you generate continuous rail entanglement. In the other case, you do, well, as Sugato and others proposed, the spin witness. But I think in both cases, it's possible. And it's not really obvious if one is really superior to the other. And I guess the readout is the least of our problems. I guess the biggest challenge is actually the generation of the initial state. Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, that makes sense. Thanks, okay. Um, and Linking, you have a question? Uh, thanks. Um, so I will be very grateful if Marcus could comment on a general question. So, on this quest of the very first experimental signature for quantum gravity, how does tabletop experiment compare to LIGO's potential measurement on, let's say, possible? Measurement on, let's say, possible quantum signature on the gravitational wave absorption properties and the echoes from the merging black hole in terms of like the time scale. We foresee the time scale and the potential of verifying different theories. Thanks. Thanks a lot. I don't have a good answer to that, I have to admit. The question is great. So, I have not thought about that. Okay, full stop. If I want now to answer, just let's say from the intuition, I'd say that, well, I cannot see how one should be able to observe quantum signatures in the, let's say, classical regime of energy dissipation in GR. You really, I mean, this is similar. You really would. I mean, this is similar. Imagine the analog situation to quantum optics. So, there, if you have a classical source, there it's basically the measurement of photons. So, really the measurement device that provides the non-linearity and allows you to get access to the quantum properties of the field. And I think as long as we don't have a measurement apparatus that is sensitive to that, I don't see. I don't see a way. On the other hand, quantum optics also taught us that relations like Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities that bound classical statistical behaviors of fields give you at least a bound that you can experimentally sort of try to violate, maybe even with classical correlation measurements. Correlation measurement, nancy correlation measurement. I think that's all I have to say. But again, great question. It's worthwhile going into more details here. Thanks a lot. Okay, do we have more questions now? And I think we can broaden out the questions to include questions to Chris and Silka as well. So just while people are thinking of questions, one actually. One, actually, Gavin, you have your hand up again? I think you go, you go, Lucian. The question was: so when Yvette was talking a few days ago, or yesterday, I forget when, there was also strong potential for applications, you know, what she was doing. In fact, she had a few patents out. And I wonder if If there are applications coming out of the work that any of you three guys are doing that might see practical applications there. So if I can go first, I apologize for jumping the queue here. Indeed, if you remember what I said about our gravity measurements, for example, then Example, then it turns out that the sensitivities to inertial forces is extremely large. So you can imagine going down this path of being able to quantum control levitated solids that you have extremely sensitive inertial sensors, that you have extremely sensitive gravimeters. And these are things we are actively studying. studying how um what is the so the perform the performance for inertial sensing exceeds um the other approaches that that we have today so including atom interferometers and um so yes there is that um yes there is application potential and we are looking into that as as we talk and speak thanks uh i don't know if chris or silk have uh So, yeah, I can say that, I mean, for these quantum simulations, I talked about, I mean, let's say some far goal, you know, could be something like simulating lattice QCB, but that's, you know, super hard. But in the shorter term, I mean, I also did mention that there's a lot of, I think there's a lot of interesting condensed matter models that you can see that also have topology. Like, so we've also simulated something called like the SSH model, which is just Called like the SSH model, which is just a 1D model for kind of topological molecules. But there's lots of things, you know, I think there's a lot of quantum materials where we don't really have a theory for how they work. I mean, high temperature superconductivity being one of them. And part of the problem is people can write down candidate theories for high temperature superconductivity, but they can't solve them because they're strongly coupled theories. So I think there's a lot of So I think there's a lot of potential for this type of quantum simulator to answer questions in condensed matter physics or start to unlock questions in condensed matter physics as we work towards kind of doing the more fundamental simulations, which are just more complex, which are maybe harder and more complex fields to simulate. Okay, thanks. And Silky, you were going to say, Smike? Yeah, okay. So the practice. Okay, so the practical applications, so away from fundamental physics questions, are, I think, there's a great potential here when it comes to the detection methods, how you interact with your fluids and superfluids. So in particular, how well can you measure fluid interfaces? And while this seems like an easy problem, it is actually not such an easy problem to capture interfaces. To capture interfaces, especially because of low refractive index, or the, you know, or just it's harder to map them out. So, for there is an industrial application for cooling films in motors and so on, and one would like to test the fluids' behavior in, as I said, cooling films or other practicals or fabrication. And to test them, one could, of course, use this interferometric detection skill. Course uses interferometric detection schemes to an unprecedented precision. So that would be one application. Right, and then of course, you know, many, many of the suggestions for metrology are always about, you know, as also, you know, collective excitations in superfluids and how to use them for metrology or for sensing methods. But then again, there's the question. Methods. But then again, there's the question of how well you can read them out. So it's one thing to, you know, it's the second step that you say you have some system, you have collective excitations, they're coupled to some external fields, but then how do you read that out? So I think in general, like the way we interact with fluids and superfluids in the measurement, there's still a lot of potential for improvement. And so I think this will be sort of the more. Will be sort of the more technical application beyond sort of what we're interested in in terms of fundamental physics for the particular system, but also mapping it to gravity. Thanks. So we have a question from Gavin. Yeah, so I built up lots of questions as the chairman, just because I was sort of thinking. Thinking that I'd be maybe having to ask questions. Silka, I was thinking about your system. So, obviously, there's people have done superfluid turbulence experiments and turbulence is really hard to simulate. And so, you know, does superfluid turbulence have, you know, is that something is that an an analogy of anything in in sort of in cosmology or, you know? Of in cosmology, or you know, what have you thought about this slide? So, okay, so the simulations I showed, or the regime we're interested in, we have a disordered lattice, so we're not really in the turbulent regime. So, in this sense, we are not directly looking into quantum turbulence, we want to stay away from that. Now, having said that, what was Now, having said that, what I thought was quite interesting is the fact that for this disordered vortex cluster, you can actually sort of find out of the mess a useful information by defining an effective background, geometry, by aviation out, and then using perturbation theory. You could sort of understand wave-vortex interaction in a clear way, which could predict how this vortices. Which could predict how these vortices interact and send off sound waves in the system. So, for quantum turbulence, right, you would need to find some sort of collective flow behavior. If that is there, then similar procedures may hold. Not necessarily, but this is what we're looking at. We're looking at sort of averaged fluid flows at the moment and how sound waves interact with. Sound waves interact with them because that's where we can apply our sort of the schemes the toolboxes developed within for the gravitational sector. We can apply them to the fluid flows. We also could do things like not really for turbulence, but for extract, turning it around. You can by looking for this ring down modes, you can interfere information about the fluid flow and how about the The fluid flow and how about the effective field theory of sound waves interacting with the fluid flow. So there's a long answer. So the short answer is we have been staying away from quantum turbulence, but what I can tell you by going to the sort of disordered regime of vortice lattices, they are the methods who are surprisingly applicable. Well, you know, they have some really predictive power. And it would be nice to push this even further into the turbulent regime, but it's not. Turbulent regime, but it's not, I wouldn't see it a priori why this would work or in what way exactly you know one could apply them. And can I, it seems like no one else has got their hands up. I might just come back on that, if that's all right. So it's in superfluids, and obviously, like you know, you've got second sound and things like this, where the normal fluid and the superfluid can be sort of moving against each other. Against each other. So does that sort of help in terms of, you know, are there analogies of that in cosmology, or is that a problem? Is that like a sort of a thing that doesn't show up when you're doing a quantum field theory simulation? So in a way, in a short way, I mean, you could also look at phase transitions. And I think the people in Holloway are interested in sort of helium-3 phase transitions more for. Helium 3 phase transitions more for the early universe. What is the best regime for the analogies if you're in the pure superfluid phase? Reason being, because when we write down our quantum field series in curved space-time, a quantum field series, we don't have dumping, right? We, of course, you can have decoherence and you can have mode-mode interactions, but in general, like. Mode-mode interactions, but in general, like we are interested in quantum field theory in non-interacting field theories, free fields, Gaussian fields. And so, when you have these superfluids and you have a high normal component, that means that you still have dissipation, you have friction in your system, you have all these unwanted things. So, in a way, we want to go away from having this normal component because the analogy works best when you're in the pure superfluid phase, which is also Pure superfluid phase, which is also, and it's also, you know, as Marco said, like when you have a fluid, right, and a fluid has this collective excitations, you want to, you don't want, you want to be in the quantum machine, you want to have it at almost zero temperatures. You want to not having the collective excitations excited through any other things. You want to cool it down. And so this means in a way that. In a way that again, you have to go to this regime where the normal component is not there. So there are some, in other ways, just looking at phase transitions in general, but in the regime we are working at, it's the best analogy is in the superfluid phase. And what is surprising that all these classical analogues work so well because it's really a dirty fluid. There is, you know, it's so many additional effects, and it shows how robust all of these processes are. All of these processes are a question for Gavin, if I am allowed to now. Yes, please go. I was wondering, so one of the things they're doing, Gavin in Xavier, for example, does in Holloway. So when you have a superfluid, he works with superfluid helium flow. Superfluid helium for flows confined on nanoscales. And then what they do is they put nano-engineer micropillars and they do this to reduce the density of states. And that allows them then to access quantum fluctuations in the system because the long fluctuations are the ones which are most likely to be overwhelmed by the thermal noise in the system or by any other vibrational noise or whatever. So they in they using In they using a reduction of the density of state so that this is these excitations cannot just not be in the system. So, what about optomechanics, Gavin? Are you also sort of instead of just making the things smaller and smaller, can you also modify the density of states of your collective excitations in the system? Yeah, yeah, no, that's a whole interesting area of research. Area of research is not something I do, but with it, because with a levitated system, we sort of don't really need that because we're just trying to be in very high vacuum, just without much coupling to any environment. But there's clever things like you say, for people that are doing things like cantilevers, things that are tethered, to people build bridges with holes in them, and they put the holes in the right place to have. Holes in the right place to have a phononic band gap, and then that can lead to the sort of mechanical mode being really, really impressively isolated from the phonons in the environment. So, yeah, it's cool. And it also allows you to make the system larger, right? Because one of the things is we cannot make them too small. We need to have a certain size because we want to be in a linear part of the dispersion relation, which means you have to have some sort of long wavelength excitation. So you cannot just, you know. So, you cannot just make the system so small as you wish. You have to have a certain size, but then you have to worry about thermal noise or other vibrational noise, the bigger it is. So, this reduction in density of states, I find a very interesting area, actually. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, me too. Yeah. Rob, you have a question? Oh, yeah, I am not muted. Yeah, so thanks, everyone. Yeah, so thanks everyone. This is a question, I guess, mainly for Chris, though Silka might want to comment, and it could very well reveal my near total ignorance of how to do actual experimental physics. What I'm wondering basically is we heard a lot from Fabio about testing various models of locality and causality. Can you do that kind of thing in your setup? I'm not, I mean, maybe you don't want to for other reasons, but is it possible? To for other reasons, but is it possible? I mean, I haven't thought in super detail, you know, just about what he did, but yeah, I think we can do things like that. I mean, so for instance, I mean, certainly we've shown in earlier work that we can entangle these different modes, right? So when I do the parametric down conversion, the pairs of photons I create are entangled. So we have a way of kind of putting entangled, you know, entanglement into these nodes. And like we said, and you know, and we can do these things. Like we said, and you know, and we can do these things, we can do time dependence. We've also done things where we kind of look at this as like a platform for continuous variable quantum computation. Essentially, we can make quantum circuits, but now in kind of frequency and time, right? Because we can turn on interactions between these nodes as we go along. So, I think you can do the same kinds of things. You know, yeah, you can do a lot of different things with this platform. But yeah, I think thinking about testing these kinds of, yeah, I think those are interesting things. Uh, yeah, I think those are interesting things to think about. Um, I think you can also do interesting. I mean, some of the work like Andrew Hauck at Princeton has looked at, um, you know, with the connectivity, you can do things like also build curved space-times, right? You can build graphs that have a hyperbolic geometry or things like that. So you can kind of add other features into the system to kind of study some, you know, and then we can add, you know, we could put in entangled photons into curved space-time and see. Photons into curved spacetime and see what happens. So I think there's lots of interesting things to do. Okay, thanks. And back to Gavin. Yeah, so Chris, I had a question for you. So as I'm sure you know, there's this work where Andreas Woolrough has two superconducting, you know, two dill fridges connected by. Deal fridge is connected by this enormous long two, three meter pipe, and the whole thing is at millikelvin, and he's sort of sent microwave photons through the link. So, does that mean that you could then, with a thing like that, you could have a length, you know, that's that's incredibly long, that's a meter or two meters, you know, or several meters long if you fold it up. And then, I guess that would then get you to this problem that you mentioned about the squid having. about the squid having limited bandwidth and so then what would sort of what could you do about the limited bandwidth on the squid and you know what what would be the real um the best case well i'm not sure it's not really the the bandwidth um for the squid i think what i was what i worry about is kind of let's say dynamic range in a sense where you know it is non-linear so we're trying to excite this particular kind of non-linearity right and if we keep piling more and more signals Keep piling more and more signals in there, we're exciting it more and more. And so I think you could just start to see that at some point you'll start to excite more nonlinearity. You'll get stray terms or you'll get higher order terms, which are then not what you want in your simulation. So, I mean, that's my guess, although we haven't seen it. But I do say also, so that's where I say I think ultimately to scale really big, you might need many of these catalogs. You know, you might need many of these cavities, or at some point we might go back to just saying that you explicitly make, you have a physical lattice where I have different oscillators or different qubits that I array out, but then say, you know, so I lose some of the flexibility, but it might be the ultimate, you know, then I'm, you know, say I could still be turning on couplings or adding phases. I could still parametrically couple these discrete resonators to get some of the benefits. Some of the benefits. But, you know, I lose some of the flexibility with the geometry, but now I'm just putting one tone into each coupling squid or something like that. So I think at some point you have to, you'll end up having to do many squids to get to really big simulations. Yeah. And what do you need to simulate like, you know, a cube rate superconductor? How many nodes do you need? Or what, you know, how do we think about that? How do we think about that? I mean, I don't have a good answer for that. I mean, I'm kind of focused on next week, but no, but I think these things become hard very quickly. So, say, like, one model, I mean, I don't know if it's still thought to be, you know, the answer to high-temperature superconductivity, but there's something called the Bose-Hubbard model, you know, which is one early proposal. But it's basically just, you know, in our language, it would be just an array of bosons hopping around with some interaction. Bosons hopping around with some interaction, right? And really, in our language, it'd be just like a square array of qubits or something like that. And I think at the level, at current levels, if you have 50 lattice sites in two dimensions with the Bose-Hubbard model, I think that's already a very difficult problem to solve with classical computation. So I think models that are difficult to solve. Modical models that are difficult to solve with classical computation are kind of within reach, or are close to the state of the art. I had another question. This is on the general principle of analog simulation versus digital computers. So it seems to me there's almost a philosophical difference. It seems to me there's almost a philosophical difference between the two approaches in the following sense: that in an analog simulation, you don't have full knowledge of the underlying physics necessarily, whereas in a digital simulation, you have complete control over what it is you're trying to simulate. And it seems to me that the former might actually be an advantage, that it might throw up phenomena that come from some. From some underlying physics in the simulation that you don't understand or you don't know about. And that there might be corresponding unknown physics in the thing you're trying to simulate. So that was just a sort of general observation. So is there any truth in that? Are there any examples where something like that has happened? Yeah, well, I'm not sure. But what I would say is that I think, I mean, obviously they are a different point of view. And I think it's just a question of what are the And I think it's just a question of what are the resources. I mean, even in my, when I was an undergraduate in the 90s, one of the projects I did is I built a circuit to simulate an array of neurons. So even with a Spark workstation at the time, it took 30 seconds to simulate one action potential. So we built a bunch of op-amp circuits and wired them together so we could look at synchronization of neurons. So that was an analog. Even in the 90s, analog simulations were still useful. Simulations were still useful. You know, so I think it's just that. I mean, for sure, I think it's once you have a fully universal, large-scale, you know, error-corrected quantum computer, you'll just do digital quantum simulations, right? But that, yeah, that might still be 20 years away. So, I mean, there's a useful space for doing the analog things. And, of course, there are errors, right? There are other terms or I'm making some approximation for my Hamiltonian. You know, for my Hamiltonian, but I think at least you can kind of bound these things, right? So we can understand what those errors are, which is not so, you know, it's different, but not so different from thinking about that, you know, if I'm doing a digital simulation, I also have errors, right? You know, you have to be careful about how you do your simulations and the precision that you're using and different algorithms do better with different precisions and things like that. So it's not that there aren't errors or, you know, in digital simulations, they just kind of come up in a different way. They just kind of come up in a different way, and you have to manage them. But yeah, I think it's, yeah. But my contention is that maybe the sort of errors that analog simulations make are more like the kinds of errors that nature herself makes. Yeah, no, I mean, and there might be. And yeah, so I mean, it is a very interesting question, or if you see some very, you know, I mean, I guess it can always be something, you know, if I see some interesting behavior, is there something else funny going on? Else funny going on, or it's because some higher order interaction. I mean, I guess that's always a possibility. But I mean, I think most simulators that I know of, I mean, there's always these kinds of rotating wave approximations and things like that. And I think these things that you kind of slowly figure out how good is your rotating wave approximation as you go along and as you try to push the precision of things. But yeah, it is an interesting point that maybe in the real world too, you have approximation. World too, you have approximations, or field theories are some approximation of what's really going on. Yes, I could add to this. It is a bit about you need to have an extreme high control over your simulator, and you need to characterize the differences between the simulator and what you want to simulate, because that also you know some unwanted effects which would show up, which you need to be aware of how big the difference. You need to be aware of how big the deviation is just because you're not interacting with the real system, you're having an analogue of it. And then, sort of, it's getting precision measurements out, at least what we are doing, is not the goal of what we're doing. It's proof of principle concepts to see what are the important things to take into account. Now, suppose you have some sort of analytical prediction. Have some sort of analytical predictions, some regime where you can solve it, and then you set up an analog simulator and you see some deviations. You need to ask yourself: are these deviations there because of the system I've chosen? Or are these deviations also would occur in the system which you want to simulate? Is there something else you have perhaps neglected, some effect that whenever we predict something analytically, we made a lot of approximation or also Made a lot of approximation or also to reduce the complexity of the models for a particular system. And so, in this sense, these analogs are very useful. It gives you some sort of steps which you can control of the way you think about the system and a modeling, what you need to take account. You see if it works in the analog systems. If it doesn't work, it may just be because you're working with a particular system and it's not a good analog simulator in this extent. Or you can then say, well, perhaps there's also some. Then say, Well, perhaps there's also something in our case on the gravitational side that could potentially cause some troubles and needs to be taken into account. I think there are, just as any experiment, there are dialogues between theory and experiment. And then you always very careful need to see where potential deviations pop up. But one of the nice things is also that you see that while there are many deviations sometimes, you still get sort of the bulk part. Still get sort of the bulk part of the physics you're interested in is very robust. That's a very good sign. You know, it shows that this effect, at least when you see something that is still there, even so there is some deviation that you see in perhaps in some occupation numbers, but still the bulk effect is still there, for example, then you learn also something about it. You learn about the robustness of this effect. So I think there is, you know, this is not a simple yes or no answer, but I would just say it opens a I would just say it opens a very useful dialogue in physics as physics are supposed to be. Thanks. So interesting answers. So we are at 12 o'clock, which I think is when we are supposed to finish. So it remains to thank the panelists again. So Chris and Silke, who are still here. Still here, and Fabio and Marcus, and also Gavin for chairing the session earlier. And for those of you that are still around, we have one more session starting at, I guess, six o'clock Ontario time, whatever that is in your local time. Actually, does it start later because of. No, it starts at six. It starts at six. Great. Six, great. So, uh, we'll see you there then. Yeah, and thanks, everybody. Thanks for your participation this week. Very much appreciated and quite interesting. Yes, able to stay up through the night. If you're in Europe, you're certainly welcome to come. Sorry, just one more thing. We started half past six today. Half past six. Yes. Oh, we start at 6:30 today. Oh, I missed that. 30 today. Oh, I missed that. Why is that? Because we have one talk last. We had scheduled the MITAX talk for, but then it was moved to Wednesday, so it's half an hour later. Okay, that's probably worth sending out an email reminder to.
