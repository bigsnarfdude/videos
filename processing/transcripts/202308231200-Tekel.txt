For putting this wonderful event together and for giving me an opportunity to tell you something about work that I have been doing with Samuel Kovacik in Bratislava. And as you can see, we are quite optimistic to have something out later this month. And let me also acknowledge the support that paid for my terribly overpriced plane ticket here. Okay, so uh this makes sounds uh instead of so I like to now okay now it works. I like to start my talks with uh my message that I want you to leave uh this room with and so if this if you have capacity to remember one slide from my To remember one slide from my talk, I suggest this to be it. At this point in the meeting, I think that remembering one slide from a presentation is roughly the expected value. So let's go. So I'm going to present a construction of a three-dimensional non-commutative space composed of concentric fuzzy spheres in an explicit matrix model formulation. Some of the things that I'm going to talk about are. Things that I'm going to talk about are well known and have been done by people a long time before. Some of the things are new, and I'm going to try to highlight the things that have been known and that are new. And so the construction works like concentric spheres of increasing radius, where the dynamics, the angular dynamics is governed by the standard Laplacian on the fuzzy sphere, and the radial dynamics is something that needs to be put in by hand, and we'll see how that works. By hand, and we'll see how that works on several physics examples that I'm going to claim work reasonably well, and the construction looks to be promising. So if you don't have capacity for whole one slide, but just couple of words, then the look promising part would be the one that I would like you to concentrate on. So let me start with some quick motivation, why to consider fuzzy spaces. Fuzzy spaces. So, when you try to combine quantum mechanics and gravity, you get discrete short-distance structure of space-time. That's my motivation. First of all, Paolo did yesterday a much better job than I could explaining further details about this. And the other thing is, this is the we're at Casa Mathematica. This is a mathematical workshop. I don't think that mathematicians need more motivation than this. So, let me talk about. So, let me talk about Fuzzy Sphere, which is the simplest example of non-commutative space. And it's something that we all try to get back to when we are building new things. So, yeah, and as you can see, those ideas are also not terribly new. So, when thinking about spaces in terms of functions, when I say thinking about spaces in terms of functions, Thinking about spaces in terms of functions, it probably is something that comes very natural to this audience. So, this is probably a little redundant. You can think of the sphere in terms of functions expressed in terms of spherical harmonics. And the point is that when you describe features on the sphere, when the features are very small, you need larger and larger angular momentum here in this expansion to describe smaller and smaller features. So, if you want to continue to And smaller features. So, if you want to construct a space that has some finite resolution, the natural guess would be to cut off this number up here. Because then, for example, if you construct your points as delta functions and delta functions as sequences of Gaussians, that at some point the Gaussians cannot get any narrower because you have explicitly by hand removed the modes that would. And removed the modes that would construct your narrow Gaussian. So, expressions like this describe something on the sphere with short distance structure, with the shortest length scale that you can reasonably describe. However, expressions like this are not closed under pointwise multiplication because the simplest example is when you multiply two spherical harmonics of L equal to one, you obtain something that's clear. One, you obtain something that's clearly proportional to L equal to two. So you need to play some games, and the games we play is we borrow a closed product from matrices. Yeah, we map the corresponding spherical harmonics onto n-times and Hermitian matrices, and then we realize that we can, you know, this, sorry. Oh, okay. So we can. Okay, so we can this representation of SU2 is reducible and as it reduces into the blocks of spherical harmonics, you can multiply these and then borrow the now non-commutative star product from the multiplication of matrices. So, and this closes your algebra, this closes the product in between. Is the product in between the objects that I have defined before? It now forms an algebra and describes something that we call fuzzy sphere. However, the price we had to pay was a non-commutative product in between the functions. And as we increase the cutoff, we slowly recover the original sphere as before. Now, this is an instructive construction, but for my purposes, a different construction is more useful where you explicitly. More useful where you explicitly introduce matrices, and instead of the defining relations for the regular sphere, where you define the functions on the regular sphere as algebra generated by such generators, you explicitly introduce some non-commutativity in here, and you call your fuzzy sphere whatever is object that has this algebra generated by these. Algebra generated by these objects as algebra functions. And now, when you remember your quantum mechanics, you remember that this is basically, this is realized by representations of SU2, and you can explicitly construct operators x, where the fuzzy sphere has radius r, and the explicit non-commutativity parameter scales as one over n. And the idea is that. And the idea is that you still have full SU2 acting on this axis. Therefore, the fuzzy sphere, even though we have introduced some short-distance structure, enjoys the full rotational symmetry, opposing to some naive lattice-like regularizations. Now, what I'm going to need is a Laplacian, which governs the geometry that maybe Jen Denjio tomorrow is going to tell us more about how these things work. Things work that matrices themselves do not form geometry. You need some extra information. You can do it either by Dirac operators that we have seen before in this meeting or for my purposes, a Laplacian is going to be enough. And what I'm going to also need is a notion of integral on the fuzzy sphere, which is a trace, which has a very nice interpretation of summing over eigenvalues of the mitre. Summing over eigenvalues of the matrix phi that corresponds to the function on the fuzzy sphere. So the eigenvalues have interpretation of the functional values of the function phi on the n Planck cells that we have divided the fuzzy sphere into, and including the normalization of the area of the one Planck cell. And now again, we can see that as we increase n. We increase n beyond any limits, we should recover the original fuzzy sphere. Now, I'm a physicist, so I'm happy with this sentence here. As we have seen, there are people who can go for hours regarding this topic. And I mean it in a good way. I'm really happy that there are people who think about properly defining and giving meaning to such sentences so that I don't have to. And I can go and do some physics there. Some physics there. So, but what's good to keep in mind is the notion of small distance structure also coming from the uncertainty principle for position operators with some non-zero commutator. And so essentially, what we're doing is we're taking the phase space of one-dimensional quantum mechanics, we're promoting it to a configuration space of whatever we are trying to describe. And in the case of fuzzy sphere, we're And in the case of fuzzy sphere, we're patching the two-dimensional non-cummetric plane onto a sphere in a completely standard way. So we have, in constructing the fuzzy sphere, we have turned the regular smooth sphere into something that has a lattice-like structure, but the lattice is not the way it's shown here because this is a rigid structure. Shown here because this is a rigid structure, and the boundaries of our n Planck cells that we have divided the sphere into are fuzzy. There's no clear distinction between one Planck cell and the other Planck cell. So a picture that I like to show is this one. I hope you can see it. This is the standard optical illusion where the snakes should swirl in places that you're not looking at. And when you change where you're looking at, then suddenly. Change where you're looking at, then suddenly the snakes stop the swirl, then they start to swirl somewhere else. So the fuzzy sphere is completely opposite to this. Where you're trying to look at the fuzzy space, the things are becoming fuzzy and blurred. And the more you're trying to look, the more fuzzy and blurred it becomes. Okay, now let's construct the onion or a onion, as we will see. Now, usually when you're giving a talk and you have a collaborator, then you say that all the That all the mistakes are mine. Now, this definite article in the name of our paper is due to Samuel, so I'm going to dump things on him. It's a little aggressive. It's Bionion. As we will see, there are different ways to do this construction. And some work better, some work worse, and some might be related, some might not be related. So, let's see how. Related. So let's see how the article works out and whether we are working with Donion or Aonion. So the idea is to take fuzzy spheres of increasing radius, concentric fuzzy spheres of increasing radius, and try to work out some structure in this space. Now, as I have said, this is way from being new. It's now more than 20 years ago when first such ideas came to life. And I'm going to tell you more about these things when the time comes. But the different thing in our approach, opposing to all these works, is that in all of those cases, the concentric shell structure emerged from something different that the authors have been considering. Authors have been considering. We are doing the bottom-up approach. We are constructing the layers, we are putting in some structure and hoping for the best. So let's take number M and let's take M fuzzy spheres of radius lambda, two lambda, and all the way to M lambda. So we are taking some parameter lambda to dictate to give us the short distance scale. Give us the short distance scale or the scale of the short distance scale. And now we construct the functions as a block diagonal matrix, which I'm going to call phi, sorry, psi of matrices phi, where clearly the matrix, this upper index in brackets gives you the size of the matrix or the radius of the sphere when we're working. So this is the functional value on the most inner. Functional value on the most inner layer, which is just one Planck cell at the origin. This is a two by two matrix of functional configuration of the next cell, and so on and so on. We go all the way up to M. And then hopefully in some reasonable M goes to infinity limit, we can recover the whole space being non-cummetative. But at the moment, we are constructing basically an onion that has an That has an edge on the outside, and then the rest of the space, we will need to put some boundary condition in there. Now, recall the non-commutativity parameter, which now with R on nth layer being Lambda times n, essentially becomes proportional to lambda. So apart from the also all the fuzzy So, all the fuzzy structure on each of the layers is controlled by this parameter lambda. It's not completely the same on each of the layers because of these factors in here, but it's consistent. So what we have done is we have taken fuzzy spheres with the Planck cells of the same size and made them into concept. Made them into concentric shells. So the whole Planck cell size in the space is consistent and is consistent also in the radial direction because the step in the radial direction is the same scale as the size of the Planck cell. Now, and what I want to say is that the discreteness in the radial direction and in the angular direction is very different. That in the radial direction, we have discrete values. Discrete values of the radial coordinates, opposing to angular direction when we have the fuzzy sphere being fuzzy. And let me just introduce you to this number that I'm going to use. D is the dimensionality of this, of the space of size. Since this is m times m matrix, no, it's not really a matrix, sorry, it's not m times n matrix, but it doesn't have it doesn't scale with m to the fourth power as one would. M to the fourth power, and one would naively guess, since it's just a block diagonal matrix, it scales with only m to the third power. So, this is the number of degrees of freedom of this matrix up here. Okay, so we now need to construct an integral, which is just by pure analogy from here to here, it's the angle integral times dr times r squared summed over all layers. Squared summed over all layers, which turns out to be this. Yeah, I have reserved the lowercase trace for the traces over the individual layers and the uppercase trace as a trace over the matrix space psi. And you get this factor R in the integration, which actually was obtained also in the previous works that I have mentioned. And I have introduced a radius matrix, which is quite Is quite natural. Yeah, I'm going to write matrices basically. So anybody who has taken linear algebra course could follow what I'm trying to do. And I tried to be fancy with writing one like this in here. Okay, so now the angular. So this is kinematics. This is the functions on our space. Now we need to introduce some derivatives to play games. To play games. And the angular derivatives are easy. We borrow them from the fuzzy sphere notion. And we just, you know, when we act by Laplacian in the angular direction, we just do the Laplacian on each of the layers decorated by the radius, which is now a matrix, not a single number, as it was before for the single layer. But what about the radial direction? Now this is not. But what about the radial direction? Now, this is not clear because when you're comparing functional values on two different layers, you want to compare matrices of different size. So you need to figure out somehow how to compare the matrices of different size. And the most naive thing that comes to your mind that maybe some of you already came up with is simply to drop the non-existing modes in the larger matrix. Here we have matrix of size n plus one. have matrix of size n plus one and we have matrix of size n okay so here here it is we have matrix of size n plus one matrix of size n so we expand the matrix into the spherical harmonic fuzzy spherical harmonics as i have shown you before and we simply drop the the terms that were that are not present on the nth layer but are present on the n plus plus one layer and when we try to go one step up Try to go one step up. We simply create a matrix that has zeros for the components that did not exist on the nth layer, but are there on n plus one layer. So this is a very fancy way of just telling you that if there are modes, express the matrices in terms of fuzzy spherical harmonic modes. And if there are modes that you cannot compare, just ignore them. And then you use your finite derivatives to construct the first and second derivative in the radial direction. And then you try to recall what was the Laplacian in the standard spherical coordinates. And what we have done is we have defined the radial direction, the radial derivative like this. Like this, not like this. I'm going to get to that point later. Now, and this is quite an abuse of notation because here, this operator doesn't act only on the matrix phi 3. It needs to know the values of matrix phi 2 and phi 4. So, this is not at the end of the day, it works a little more completely, it is a little more complicated than this, but I just wanted to. Complicated than this, but I just wanted to show you something that is probably getting the message across. Okay, so we then define a fuzzy onion Laplacian combining this radial Laplacian and angular Laplacian. And the difference between A onion and D onion comes in these definitions. We could have taken different We could have taken different prescriptions for the derivative. We could have taken different prescriptions for the radial Laplacian. We have taken something and we're going to see what happens. So let me mention the construction by Peter and his collaborators. And something similar has appeared also in other Peter's paper, where you do not explicitly. Where you do not explicitly construct the fuzzy coordinates by matrices, but you introduce creation and annihilation operators and you introduce an auxiliary Hilbert space where these operators act. And it's at the end of the day, it's the same thing described in a little different language. And when you consider just one layer, you Just one layer, you restrict yourself to the subspace of the Hilbert space with this operator being constant. And then you can see that this is basically the same formula that I have given you before. And what I'm trying to show here is the expression for the Peter, Veronica, and Samuel have computed spectrum of the hydrogen atom in such a space. Of the hydrogen atom in such a space, and they have obtained such a formula, which in lambda goes to zero limit, becomes the standard one over n squared minus one over n squared energies of the hydrogen atom. And there are some non-commutative corrections. And we're going to need this formula again. So, this is my construction. And this is a good place to take the first set of questions if there are any. If there are any, I'm going to back that, go get back to that. You basically write one over R, you take your free Hamiltonian as Laplacian, and you take one over R potential when one over R is, where R is the matrix that I have shown you, and you take inverse of that. And you take this operator, and that's your Hamiltonian for a hydrogen atom. For a hydrogen atom. But I'm going to show you more details later. Okay, so we have constructed an onion, and I never thought I was going to ever say such a sentence in a scientific setting when I was starting my undergrad, but here I am. And let's do some onion physics. So, first, we have looked at scalar field theory because you Because you can write down the action for the scalar field theory on the Fasionian. And then, as we already have seen today, you define your expectation values as functional integrals. But now, the upshot of all this is that this measure here is well defined because it's just a finite dimensional matrix measure. And probably this is something that came to mind of many people. Something that came to mind of many people, but I have heard it explicitly said by Harold a couple of years ago in Corfu, and I like that sentence a lot because at the end of the day, really, a matrix model begs to be put on a computer. So that's what we did. And we didn't do the whole simulation and whole numerical calculation of such expectation values. But what we have done is we have done hybrid Monte Carlo evolution of one state. We have taken some initial. Of one state, we have taken some initial state, we have evolved, let it thermalize, and then we have let it fluctuate around what we hope to be the minimum for that particular variance of these numbers in here. And we have tried two different things. We have evolved the state and let it fluctuate for space with the radial part of the Laplace operator. Radial part of the Laplace operator turned off. So it was basically fields oscillating on layers without knowing about the other layers. And this is an image for 10 layers. Yeah, this is the innermost layer. This is the outermost layer. And these are the values of the fields mapped back onto the spherical harmonic functions. And you can see, what I would like you to see here is that. Would like you to see here is that the oscillations, yeah, there's some background and the field oscillates around that background, and that the oscillations in between the layers do not couple. Yeah, that here the field is positive, and here on the next layer is incredibly negative. So, so if you take, if you point, if you take your direction in the three-dimensional space and look at the fluctuations of the Look at the fluctuations of the field along the direction, those fluctuations are completely independent, and each layer does its own thing. However, when you turn on the radial Laplacian, then the fluctuations along one radial directions are coupled. They do not change too much layer to layer. Now, again, this is something that That needs more work. And hopefully, sometime Samuel's student is actually already taking a look into some proper calculations in this and simulations in this. But what I'm trying to say by these two sets of images is that when you turn on the radial Laplacian the way we have postulated it, the layers, the fluctuations of the scalar field on individuals, Scalar field on individual layers started to talk to each other. So, this is what you would expect from field from layers being coupled through radial Laplacian, the fluctuations to not be independent, but somehow to be correlated. So, I'm claiming that the radio Laplacian does its job, or at least seems to be doing its job in the field theory formulation. Formulation. Now, second thing that we have tried is we did a classical problem of heat transfer. So classical in the sense that now the function doesn't represent some wave function or anything quantum of any system. It's a distribution of temperature in the classical sense. However, on a space that has some On a space that has some discreteness, some fuzziness. And such description has been suggested to describe granular materials. So essentially, what I'm doing is I'm describing flow of heat in a granular material where the heat transfers infinitely fast inside the grains, but takes some time to move from one grain to another. And this is probably the And this is probably the most physics example I have ever done in my life. And so we have taken five layers and we have initialized the tent pre-school distribution to be surrounded around the north pole of the outermost layer. So again, this is the innermost layer. These are five layers. This is outermost layer. And there's some temperature distribution along the north pole. And we have let the system evolve in a discrete time. In a discrete time. And as you can see, the heat really does distribute inside the five-layered onion. And in five steps of time, it's pretty evenly distributed along the now granular onion. So taking the radial Laplacian the way we did seems to be doing things that. To be doing things that one would expect for transfer of heat in your system. And now comes my favorite part. Now comes the hydrogen atom. So you take your Hamiltonian to be the standard Hamiltonian of quantum mechanics. And yeah, we're not going to bother too much about the constants. So this sets also the Bohr radius to be one. And then you. And then you compute the, you look for energies as solutions to this eigenvalue problem. Now, I haven't stressed it before enough, or maybe it was or wasn't clear, but as is written here, the Hamiltonian is not a matrix. It's an operator that acts on a matrix, but cannot be expressed in terms of matrix multiplication. It's some commutators with matrices. So, when you want So, when you want to look for eigenvalues of such a problem, you need to express the matrix H, the operator H as some matrix. So, you turn your matrix psi into a vector of the fuzzy spherical harmonics expansion coefficients. Now, this is a d-dimensional vector, so it's a pretty large vector, but not Pretty large vector, but nonetheless, it is in a vector, and we can express the Hamiltonian here as d times d matrix acting on such a vector. So the radius, now the blocks become n squared times n squared matrices. This is rather technical. I'm just, you know, flashing the. You know, flashing the expressions in case it makes sense to somebody. If it doesn't, don't worry. I have images at the end. So, and now the complicated part was to express the derivatives as such D times D matrices. As you can see, I didn't even try to put it into one slide. It's just the typesetting this thing was much more complicated than actually figuring out what the matrix should look like. out what the matrix should look like. Because it's from the description of the derivative, it's clear. There's one over lambda here, there's minus one over two lambda here, and you just need to figure out in LaTeX where to put the non-zero value. And the d squared matrix looks like this, eigen. Nothing terribly complicated. And so you have a d times d matrix. You're going to compute eigenvalues of d times d matrix. Now, I have a story to share. I have a story to share. When I was first year undergrad, I lived in a dormitory with two older students, and they had their friends coming over. And one night I was doing my linear algebra homework. And one of the guys that came over just looked over my shoulder and asked me what I was doing. I told him, I'm computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors. And he told me, learn this well. This is very important. And here I am, 20 years later in Mexico, telling you about computing eigenvalues. You about computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of 3000 by 3000 matrices. So, indeed, it is very important. But yeah, the matrix is D times D, but since it's a spherically symmetric problem, you can restrict yourself to L equal to zero sector. And then the matrix is manageable n times n. We have tried also doing the L non-zero sector and checked for smaller. And checked for smaller m that the values that we obtain are actually really the same, that it really does not depend on your L. But we have gone to high values of m for L equal to zero. So now, Fedela did beat me in showing you numbers as the first person in this conference. However, as you can see, I'm going to show you much more numbers than Fedela did. So, and I would argue that at And I would argue that Ed did beat both of us in his talk. I think it was the second talk of the conference when he showed the numerical simulation of the dust. I think that those, yeah, probably those are numbers. Anyway, here are some eigenvalues for m equal to 50 and lambda equal to 1. And let me decode this for you. So this is the nth eigenvalue of that matrix. This is the value of the formula by Peter and collaborators that I have shown. Peter and collaborate that I have shown you a couple of slides ago. And this is the commutative quantum mechanics for these particular values of parameters. So as you can see, for the first couple of states, we obtain the very same number as Peter did and his square root formula did. Now, this number really goes, it's the same up to 35 digits or something like that. Yeah, because this isn't. Something like that. Yeah, because this is a numerical number. I have let Mathematica run overnight and compute the values numerically for me. This is an explicit number that you get by calculating the square root, and the numbers did agree up to 35 digits or something. So either somebody's playing games with me, or our formula is the same as Peter's formula for the radio Laplacian. And but you can see that. But you can see that larger ends, the higher excited states, do become quite different. And this is because Peter was considering the full space to be non-commutative. We have only a non-commutative ball. So we're going to see the reason for that in the wave functions that I'm going to show you shortly. So now I have looked at the first ground state. The first at the ground state for increasing size of the matrix, and this thing here gives you the ratio of our value compared to the value by Peter and collaborators. And you can see that with increasing m for fixed lambda, it becomes better and better. And also, you know, if you take your If you take your lambda smaller, then you still can increase your size of matrix to get something in reasonable agreement. And this is for the second or for the first excited state for the second eigenvalue. Now, this NA means that these are only negative eigenvalues. And for matrices that are small, Matrices that are small, the eigenvalues of the matrix look strange because the wave function gets compressed and it oscillates much more than it does in the classical case. And therefore, it has much higher energy. And this is something that we don't have a good hold on yet. But it's actually an interesting question to ask: what are the scattering states, what are the bound states in your final? The bound states in your finite model. But yeah, at this moment, I've just concentrated on the negative eigenvalues. And if the system didn't have negative eigenvalues, I have just increased n until it had some negative eigenvalues. So I'm going to claim that it seems that in going to infinity limit, we do recover the system that was considered by Peter, Veronica, and Samuel. Peter, Veronica, and Samuel. And that our Laplacian that we have naively postulated for the radial direction gives the same results as their free Hamiltonian, their Laplacian gave. Now, I have experimented with different versions of Laplacian here, and it was interesting to see that most of the different versions didn't make any sense. They gave results that didn't. didn't didn't reproduce the classical results in lambda going going to zero limit or they didn't even do anything it was just just horrible mess uh and interesting thing is remember the the what was that this this version of the radio laplacian it gave reasonable eigenvalues it gave eigenvalues that in lambda go going to zero In lambda, going to zero limit, reproduced the classical case, but they did not reproduce the results that I have mentioned before. So clearly, it's a onion, it's not the onion. You can do different things and obtain results that are reasonable, that have proper classical limit, but for finite lambda, do something, something different. Different. But I have been a good student and I have learned not only to compute eigenvalues but also eigenvectors. So we can look at the wave functions themselves. So I'm going to show you a couple of these images. So let me deconstruct what the image tells you on this first one. So here are the parameters. Now, the black dots show you the locations of the layers. That's where the layers are located. It's where the layers are located. The red dashed line is classical in lambda equal to zero probability distribution for the electron. It's not a wave function, it's probability, radial probability distribution for the position of the electron. And the blue dots represent the values of the fuzzy wave function on the layers. And I've just On the layers. And I've just connected them. But yeah, there's nothing in between this layer and this layer. The connection is purely to make the image more legible. So what has happened here is you can see that not much. The difference between red and blue is rather subtle, which you would expect for a system that is 50 times your length scale. You can see that the electron is slightly pushed. Is slightly pushed away from the origin, which is again something that you would expect from there being a finite cell at the origin and not arbitrarily close point to the origin. And that's what you can see from this image. Let's go further. This is a different extreme case. You can see that here, the classical distribution of the The classical distribution of the electron goes way beyond our Fazionian. And what I probably forgot to tell you is that we're taking the Richlette-Blandery condition. So we take the wave function to be zero beyond this most outer layer. So we're forcing the electron to live inside the fuzzy onion. And you can see that, again, something that you would expect that this squeeze. That this squeezes the electron inside the onion, increasing its energy. And that's why we got much greater energy for the high excited states than in the whole M going to infinity space. Okay, so now let's look at the case where lambda is smaller than the border radius. You a similar thing happens here that electrons get squeezed into the onion a little because there's a significant part of classic electron living outside the onion. But also the electron is pushed away a little from the origin. So it's squeezed a little from both sides. Now I just... And now I just wanted to show you that if you have a classical structure that's much, much larger than your lambda, then nothing really changes. This blue peak looks the same way as the red peak did. However, this is the same picture zoomed into the origin, where you can see that close to the origin where the Close to the origin where the structures are at the order of your lambda, things are happening, and these peaks of the fuzzy electron are pushed away from the origin opposing compared to the classic electron. And now, when you go full non-commutative and you take lambda much greater than your bore radius, you can see that there were structures in the classical distribution. In the classical distribution, they just got completely washed away by the non-commutativity. And the non-commutative, the fuzzy electron does something completely different than the classic electron, as one would expect. Because in the fuzzy space, there's absolutely no way to see such a small structure. And now I wanted to show you also that this can happen both ways. Both ways, that if we have in the same probability distribution, we have a structure that's quite larger than the non-commutative scale. And the fuzzy electron reproduces this structure in, but close to the origin, we have structures that are smaller than the non-commutative scale. And the fuzzy electron and the classical electron, sorry, do very different things. So. So also Electron seems to be doing things that are compatible with what we would expect. Okay. So these are the three things that we did to make sure that our proposal for the Radio Laplacian makes sense and that it does reasonable things that one would expect it to do. And let me give you, I hope you appreciate my storytelling of trees. Let me give you three. Let me give you three outlooks of what to do further. So originally, I was quite with this random vector configuration and description. I was much more optimistic than I am now, but maybe it makes sense to some of you, and there's something that one can do here. It's basically to describe the field theory in the whole onion. In the whole onion, in terms of the d-dimensional vector and d times d-dimensional operators. Because the idea is to try to say something analytic about the field theory. You can put the field theory on the computer and calculate things. I'm going to talk about it shortly. But I would like to say something analytic about the theory. And as we have heard in the first talk today, there's not much that. There's not much that you can do analytically for random matrices at finite n. The natural thing to do is to take large n limit, but here we have finite n at each of the layers. So it's not clear how to approach the field theory problem analytically. And one of the guesses was to approach it as a random vector model. But then when you express the field theory action in terms of the vector c, you get something that's You get something that's horribly messy. It's a random vector model with non-diagonal propagator and some extremely complicated interactions. Now, what one could do is to modify this and simply say, okay, let's consider a different theory that gets rid of all these nasty things and it's expressed purely nicely in the vector. Nicely in the vector, in the D-dimensional vector. And then you could try to find the basis which diagonalizes the propagator and hope for the best in the interaction part. I have tried doing that. I didn't get too far, but maybe there are people listening who are much better in vector models that could do that. Okay. Then phases of scalar field theory are quite well understood, both numerically, or numerically, they're quite well understood. Or numerically, they're quite well understood for the fuzzy sphere, and there's some analytical understanding also. So, what do I mean by that? I'm waving my hands, and my watch just told me that I made 16,000 steps today. So, in classical case, in class, Euclidean classical field theory for negative mass squared, the field as at certain point states. At certain point stops to oscillate around the fake vacuum of zero and starts to oscillate around the true vacuum of the potential. This is the Higgs mechanism in two dimensions that we all know and love. In fuzzy spaces, something more complicated happens, and you get a phase that doesn't oscillate around a single value of the field in the whole space, but it changes the values around which it oscillates. The values around which it oscillates and it creates this kind of striped structure on the fuzzy sphere. As I said, this is more or less understood for the fuzzy sphere. Can we do something for the Fazionian? Yeah, the radial part of the Laplacian couples the layers. So the oscillations around at the layers are not independent. At the layers are not independent, and we expect some kind of phase transition happening in the whole space. So there's an obvious way to go to calculate, to do the Monte Carlo simulations for such a matrix model. At the end of the day, this is a matrix model, which begs to be put on a computer. And you can try to see whether you get the similar diagram as here. And I'm going to back to that. And I'm going to back to that soon. And also, and the question is whether one can do what to do numerically, it's quite straightforward. It's a matrix model, you put it on a computer. Question is what to do analytically, whether there is something that we can do analytically in the M, probably in the M going to infinity limit, but still anything analytical would be very nice. And one way to go might go all the way back. Go all the way back to the other set of papers that I have shown you in the beginning that have considered this construction, which is actually the original construction, where you consider four-dimensional Moyal space and you introduce a different star product in between the functions. It's not a standard Moyal. Standard Moyal star product. It's something that's induced by the coherent states. You get different star product, and you look what happens, and you can induce from this star product a radial Laplacian on a similar structure, or at the same structure that I have described. Your mole space. Your Moyal space descends into layered, or you can restrict yourself on a part of Moyal space that describes the same layered structure, and you can induce your radial Laplacian from the star product that you have constructed on the four-dimensional space. Now, here Patricia and Jean-Christophe have computed the eigenvalues of that radial Laplacian and Radial Laplacian, and it turns out it is diagonal, block diagonal in the radial dimension. So it's something different than what we are doing. And it would really be interesting to see to what extent it is different. And that Laplacian changes the dynamics on individual layers. It introduces some coupling between the modes on individual layers. And they have argued. Layers, and they have argued that there seems to be removal of UVR mixing with this Laplacian in that space, which would mean that in the matrix model, we shouldn't see this part of the diagram. And my question is whether anything that these people have been doing is translatable into our formulation of the Into our formulation of the radio Laplacian and whether it can give us any tools to work, especially on the analytical part of the field theory. And with that, I'm going to, in case you forgot, I'm going to show you my take-home message again, especially pointing your attention to these two words. And there's a little more, there's a to-do list here. So apart from the outlook things. Apart from the outlook things that I have told you, I think in quantum mechanics, in L equal to zero sector, in M going to infinity limit, you should be able to do something analytically because the matrix looks very nice and you should be able to compute the eigenvalues analytically and most importantly, analytically prove the equivalence of our Laplacian and the Laplacian by Peter, Veronica, and some. Then there's the question whether one can introduce There's the question whether one can introduce some kind of fuzzy radial structure, because our structure was discrete in the radial direction, but it was rigid. And the question is whether you can either smear out the wave functions or do anything to make also the radial direction properly fuzzy. And since we are in a quantum gravity workshop, there have been some attempts to describe black holes in this setting. Actually, the paper by This setting. Actually, the paper by Peter Schugan collaborator that I've shown you discovered this kind of structure as a black hole solution in a particular model. So you could either do this or you could try to do the thing that we have seen earlier this meeting, to calculate, to write down equations, for example, for dust in this setting and see whether something similar happens as we have seen in the. similar happens as we have seen in the in the second talk of this meeting so what what i would argue is that this this space might be a nice setting for some some quantum gravity considerations because it has it is three-dimensional and it has fuzzy structure in all three dimensions and with that i thank you for your attention thank you very much For atmospheric physics because it's natural to consider a layer. It's natural to consider a layer with cutting out the interior of the onion. And you can use hydrodynamic equations. Thank you, perhaps. Is there a question from people in Zoom? Okay, Martin. I was just wondering, I think it was around slide fifty, where we had a wave function. Where you had a wave function. And that was the only case where there seemed to be a huge difference in the area under the density. But they were both normalized, right? Yeah, because there was a huge part of the classic electron that was living outside of the sphere. So there was a large part of the red curve that I didn't show you. Oh, you didn't show it. Yeah, yeah, because the red curve goes all the way to infinity. Okay. That's a good point, but. That's a good point, but uh, was it this one, yeah? You know, the the the red red curve gives you one more peak and that falls off into infinity. So there's a large part here that compensates for the large part that you can see here. And then the real question: you mentioned the black hole connection. Is there also a time direction included? Is it four-dimensional? Included as a four-dimensional. If you want to take time, you need to introduce another coordinate. In principle, you could look into the radial direction being a time coordinate, but that would make things probably very nice. I'm not talking into the microphone, sorry. Has anyone thought of a Laplacian where the coefficients are not constant, so to mimic some sort of curvature of space-time? The fact that all the slides, the shells of the onion are equidistant is encoded in the in the paper by Peter Schuban, collaborator, they give a formula where lambda is dependent on your radius, but I'm not sure whether they do anything with this very, but in principle, since you could, yeah, you could consider lambda being dependent on the radius and see what happens. Radius and see what happens, but I don't think that anybody has looked into that too much. Yeah, you know, you could you just change your R matrix, but in you could I think you could do it straightforwardly, but I don't know whether anybody has done that. Is there any other question? If not, thank you very much. So, as far as I know, which the information I can. I know which the information I have is the same that you have. We're going to leave from here at one
