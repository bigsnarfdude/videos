I'm Wenjung Shi coming from New York University. First, I'd like to thank the organizer to inviting me. Today I'm going to talk about the chirality in the cell collectives as an emergent property of the boundary effects. And this is a collaboration work. Me and Alex, we do the modeling part, and all the experiments are coming from such a slab. Okay. Okay, so let's begin. So, the big picture of this project is that we know that the chirality is kind of ubiquitous, universal in all the length scales in the biological world, from the nanometer, in the molecular, and also in the cell, tissue, and even organs, like Stephen talked about yesterday. And even some people claim that actually the universe itself is charot, but that is definitely out of our scope today. So we'll only focus on the biological world. But even that, we know that it's also crossed many length scales from the nanometer even to the meters. Okay, so here we give two examples. One is that we can see that this is one cell and we fix its shape as a circle. As a circle. And if you look at these active fibers in a cell, actually, we can characterize into two. One is the, we call it radio fiber, it's in this radio direction, and one is the transverse fiber. And you can, if you look at this, you can see that the organization of the acting fiber is symmetric. Okay, it's symmetric. But actually, this is not its steady state. If we let it evolve over time, we can clearly see that this stress fibers. These stress fibers rotate clockwise and they will evolve into some parallel-like shape. This is definitely a symmetry breaking case and the karate emerges in this single cell. This is one example of the charity in a single cell level. And if we put all these cells together, but not fix its shape, you can see that if you put This shape, you can see that if you put this cell in a confined rectangle and let it evolve over time, eventually they will also have some nematic order, which is also biased, which means that in most cases, they will align in this direction in the clockwisely, and that is the chirality in the cell collective level. Okay, and this is just one cell from these cell collectives. Uh, cell effectives. And one thing I have to clarify is that this is similar to what Pasca introduced yesterday: is that they cell tilted, but actually it's different is that in Pasca's case, that is the karate emerge because of their say share flow. It's a global share flow emerged from the boundary, but here that we don't we do not see that global share flow here. Okay, so and it's So, and it's confined, so we and it's a different reason for the karate emergence. So, here these are two examples. So, if we come back to this big picture, so when we wonder how does this chirality translate between these different scales, for example, so how does this molecular chirality lead to the secular chirality? This is one. This is one typical question, and also, we may ask that how does this tissue skill charity emerge from the charity of the individual cells? And even more, you can ask that what would be the function consequences on the human physiology or other things associated to that. But today, we do not have time to answer all these questions, but rather we will focus on the second one. So, given the character of the So given the chirality of the individual cell, how can we explain the chirality in the cell collectives? This is the question we are going to answer today. Or let me maybe rephrase this question another way that we know that the chirality in a smaller scale is necessary for the chirality in a bigger scale. This is reasonable. But is that the chirality? Is that the charity in a smaller scale sufficient to explain what happened in a bigger scale? This is the question we are going to answer. And because we are trying to answer this question, we need to build some model. So if we really focus on this cell collectives in this rectangle, and we look at the cell close to its boundary, for example, if you focus only one cell close to its boundary, so what do we see here? To this boundary. So, what do we see here? So, we see that when the cell close to the boundary, its stress fiber can see this light green fibers actually tilted at close to the boundary. So the stress fiber expected a tilted direction close to the boundary. So, this enlighten us that, okay, maybe this is the origin of the chirality. So, if we use the animation to show you that, suppose we have an edge. That suppose we have an edge and we are cell close to get close to this boundary, and this represents its active fiber. So the cell may just rotate, and this is the active fiber will be here. And because this cell is tilted close to the boundary, and other cells get close to that through the cell cell alignment effects, they will also be tilted. So eventually, all the cells will be tilted. So this is our hypothesis. So, how do we formulate this based on this simple hypothesis? So, we can model the cell in the simplest case just by a rigid ellipsoid particle. So, also we assume that the cell goes some normal diffusion. This is a very simple assumption. And also, they have a rotation node. Rotation node diffusion as well. Just everything is normal here. And besides this, this is a demonstration of this diffusion. And besides this, we also assume that there are some cell cell alignment effects between different cells. And because there's an interaction between angles, so we assume they have a sine function. And because it's dimetic, so this is two here. And of course, this effect will decrease over distance. So we have exponential. Decrease over distance, so we have an exponential function here. It's a very simple assumption. The cell aligned. Another one is that the cell has the interaction with this wall. In this case, if we assume that they behave similar to the cell-cell alignment, if we read it in this way, but however, because as we just observed, there's a chirality here, so we may put a minus alpha, which will account for. A minus alpha, which accounts for the charity here. Okay, and this is where the karate arrives in this model. Okay, so very simple assumption. And we modeled each cell individually. So if we run the simulation, so here's one demonstration of the simulation. We can see that the cell will align each other and gradually resolve all their defects, and eventually they will form some steady state shape. State shape. This is a very simple simulation. But if we really go examine that, all this steady state shape, this is the simplest case that we focus on the steady state. You will see that actually there's not only one steady state. There are many, many possible steady states as we show here. And why that? It's also very simple. So we can. Also, very simple, so we can investigate one by one. So, the difference, if we look at this shape, for example, we have here that because we have a rectangle, so there's always a competition between a short edge and a long edge. By competition, I mean that because we assume that cells want to align close to the boundary, of course, it's tutor, but they also want to align to the shorter edge as well. So, because they are orthogonal to each other, so for the cells have to be. Each other. So the cell has to decide whether they want to align here or they want to align here. Okay. So in some cases, this long edge wing, that is in the case that you will see that the cell is formed this aligned in this diagonal direction. And also we see this in a simulation. You can see this more clear that all the cells in this diagonal direction. And we call this shape this like the inverse of the n shape. Inverse of the N shape. So this is N, and this is like the inverse of the N, okay, on the E shape. This is one scenario where the long set wins. Okay, this is most possible because it's long over the short, but this is not the only case. In other scenarios, if the short edge wins, which is still possible, in this case, you will see the direct end shape. This is also possible. So if the means that the character They mean that the chirality, uh, the chirality here, sorry, the chirality at the shorter edge wings. Okay, and of course, there's also other combinations is that the one of the short edge and one of the long edge wings. Okay, in that case, you will see some C-like shape, okay? So it means that the cell aligned here and also aligned here, right? You will see some like a C type of shape, okay? So if this one, this one waits, and of course. Wins and of course, you will see some inverse of C shape as well. Uh, if this one, this one wins, okay. But if you think twice, actually, this C shape and I C shape is the same, it's the same because this is a rectangle. So, if you rotate it 180 degrees, the C will become inverse of C. So, it's the same thing. So, this is the fourth case. The fifth case is that. Case. The fifth case is that in some scenario, which is rare but still possible, is that all the sites means, okay, all the sites mix, and you will see some like a Z shape, okay, some like a Z shape. And this means that all the chiral, all the chirality are functionalized, okay? You will see that like a Z shape. And of course, this in theoretical possible, but in practice, it's almost impossible that you see some inverse of Z shape. That means that all the characterity fails. means that all the character fails. We see some inverse of the Z shape. And the last one will be just tight. So nobody wins. And in this case, you will see you lose the character and you will just see some straight strips. Okay. So this is all by observation. We see that we can characterize this by seven different types of shapes, but how do we really? Shapes, but how do we really quantify them? So, actually, it's simple: is that if we really look at these different shapes, if we segment this into four parts, and we look at the sign of the average angle here, for example, for the first one is the inverse of n-shape. And if we really calculate the angle and the average angle in this whole segment, we can see that this one is positive, positive, positive, and this one is positive. And by positive, I mean. Positive and by positive, I mean that we calculate the angle with respect to the vertical axis and we assume that the clockwise is positive. Okay, this is how we measure the angle. I know for most people, this is not a general combination, but we assume here. So, this is how we categorize them, is that we classify them. We just measure the angle of the sign here, and if they are all positive, then we assume, okay, this is the inverse of n shape. Okay, this is the inverse of n shape. And we can do exactly the same thing is that if we have minus, minus, plus, plus here, then we'll see this is an I shape. Okay. And if you see that it's minus, plus, plus, minus, then we'll see this is a Z shape. Okay. So in such a way, we just look at these images, we can easily compute and classify all these shapes into different classification into different groups. Okay. And here's the result. And here's the result. So you can see that the red one is experiment. The most possible one would be the inverse of the end ship, which means that the long edge winds, which is not a surprise. But still, there are some possibilities that you will see other ships as well. And the blue ones is the model. Actually, this model works not perfect, but quite well that they can match the experimental result. Do you have questions for this part? So, this is the first part: is that we generate a model and it works quite well for the experiment. But we know that as a modeler, after we create a model, we always ask us three questions. Why is that correct? Okay, this is kind of correct. This is kind of correct, and the second one is that is this model universal? Right, it means that to what limit this model breaks down, right? This is the second question because we know that all the models will break down at some point. And the third question that we typically ask ourselves is, is this model unique? This model unique? Just like the discussion between James Feng and Chi Wang yesterday about the selection of the boundary condition. Selection of the boundary condition, right? We know that in most cases, the model is not unique. And I guess that is the bitter speed part of the modeling is that the model always has siblings. And so does the other case too. So we know that this model works, but is this model unique? We don't know. So if we take another look at the experiment. At the experiment, so this is a cell also from this rectangle, but this is the cell not close to a boundary but rather in a bulk. So if you take a close look at this cell, you can see that the acting fiber, and also we know that this acting fiber rotate clockwisely, and you can see that it looks like this cell, this direction of the cell also rotates clockwisely to chase. To chase the direction of the acting fiber. So, this enlightens us that maybe this also could be the origin of the chirality in the cell collectives. So, if you want to demonstrate this, it's like if you have a cell in the bulk and those cells also rotate clockwisely, which is biased, and because you have a boundary here. And because you have a boundary here, so they will counterbalance this rotation, so we are not rotating forever. And at some point, they will form some steady state as well. Okay, so this is a different origin that we assume that the kirate may also kind of arise from the bulk. Okay, so in this case, if you want to formulize this, so again, we can assume that this part will not change. The diffusion and the cell cell alignment is the same. And the cell cell alignment is the same. But however, the origin of the kiralty will be changed. So here we have to assign two angles. One that we have the direction of the cell is denoted as theta here. Another one we denote the angle of the acting fiber as the side here. And this angle could potentially be different. And in that case, we assume that because there Because there is this, the angle of the cell always wants to chase the angle of the acting fiber. And because the acting fiber is careless, so we will multiply a habitat function to assume that the acting fiber can only rotate clockwisely. And there will always be some alpha between them, means that if the acting fiber right. Right, it's like if you have a cell and this is it's acting fiber, and acting fiber wants to rotate and they will form some shape like this again. Okay, this is like the model here. And the karate is is sorry, the karate is captured by this. Is captured by this heavy set function means that the acting fiber can only rotate clockwise. And for this model, because we want to distinguish between the boundary model, so in this case, there's still cell-wall interaction, but we assume that the cell always want to parallel to the wall. So there's no characterity from the wall in this case. But the cell wall interaction is still important because this counterbalance on the Counterbalance and the karate emerged from the block, otherwise, everything will just rotate forever. Okay, so this is another model, which is also very simple. So if you run this model, we may ask, can we do exactly the same thing as we do? This is one demonstration. As you can see, that this shorter yellow edge is the acting fiber, and this blue one is the cell. You can see the gradual. You can see they gradually rotate clockwisely, and they still kind of eventually form some steady state shape. So it looks like this model also works. If we classify the identify the shape, actually, if we see that this is also not a very bad model, the bulk model also works. It means that if we assume that the chirality emerge from the bulk, emerge from the intrinsic career. The intrinsic curve rotation of the cell, this also can explain what we see in the experiment. So now this gives us a question that which one is correct, right? But they are both correct, but which one is more correct? Which one is more correct? So we know that to this point, you have to do the new, you have to run the new experiment. You have to do more experiment to see which one is correct. More experiment to see which one is correct. So, but the question is: how do we design this experiment to differentiate them? So, you may see that what is the key difference between these two models? Why is that the character emerge from the boundary and why is that the character emerge from the bulk? So, what you can do is that if you can somehow change the ratio between these two effects, then these two models should lead to different directions. And then you test the experiment to see which one is correct, or maybe both are wrong, right? Both sides are wrong, right? This is also possible. So, what we can do here is that in all the previous experiment, what we do is that we always do in 600 times 300 millimeter square rectangle. And also, to quantify the experiment more precisely, we measure the average angle distribution in all these rectangles, in all these rectangles. All these rectangles, in all these replicates. Okay, so before that, we only characterize the shape, but this is like a semi-a quantification experiment, a semi-quantitative. But here we directly measured angle here. And now, if we keep the aspect ratio the same, means that we, because we know there's all there's also competition between the shorter and long edge. So, if we fix the aspect ratio, but rather we just scale it, then we can see that the chirality actually. The chirality actually increases if you make it smaller, okay? If you make it smaller, and this trend gets enhanced if you make it even smaller, okay. And in the opposite direction, if you make this rectangle bigger, it's like you lose your clarity, it becomes smoothed out. And if you even make it much bigger, the clarity is almost diminished. Okay, it's almost diminished. So, how do we really concentrate? So, how do we really quantify? So, this is all by observation, right? So, how do we really quantify this chirality? In a simple way, we can directly use the ratio between the clockwise part and the counterclockwise part, just between the area between these two parts. If this is big, it means that the carolity is big. If it's small, it's one, it means that you lose the carolity. Okay, and to account for the boundary and the bulk, we can. Boundary and the bulk, we can directly just use the ratio between the outer part and the inner part, just the area ratio. Okay, as we can do here, it's very common in biology that it's just like the 3D case. We know that the ratio between the like the membrane between the area and the volume is important here because it's 2D. So, it's the parameter between it's the ratio between parameter and the area. So, in such a way, we can. So in such a way, we can, if we plot the characterity ratio as a function of the area ratio, so we can see that they have a quite linear response is that the characterity ratio monotonically increase as the boundary, as the rectangle becomes smaller and smaller, or the boundary becomes more and more important. Okay, so this seems tell us that the boundary The boundary is more important. Okay, so if we look at the prediction from the boundary model, so this is the simulation result. It's much smoother here. So if we have a biggest rectangle, so you can see the karate is not that significant. And if you gradually make it smaller and smaller, you can see the karate getting host. Already getting host. Okay. So, this is quite follow the trend as the experiment. Okay. And we can exactly plot the same thing as we do for the boundary model. You can see they almost coincide with each other. So, which means that this seems that the boundary model is correct. So, how about the Bach model? If we do the exact same thing for the Bach model, you can see that. So you can see that this is smallest one and this is the big one and big one and big one and the biggest one. It's not that clear to see how the karate change but if you look at the average you can clearly see that the average here is around five and around here is almost already 20. So you can see that the karate actually enhanced as the area got bigger and bigger, which is not surprised because in this model the karate emerged from the bulk. Carity emerged from the bulk. So, if you make it bigger and bigger, the boundary will become less and important and the clarity will be getting enhanced. Okay, so if you plot them together, you can see the bulk model exactly predicts the opposite direction. It means that the character score will decrease as the x rectangle becomes smaller and smaller. So, if we inverse the x-axis, rather plot the x-axis. x-axis rather plot as the alter over inner we just plot the inner over alter you can see the bulk model will predict the linear increase means that you have bigger and bigger rectangle and the keroscope will increase okay but sadly this is not what the experiment see and in the experiment we see that it is followed what boundary model predict so to this point we can safely see that the at least the boundary model wins to this point okay But then we come back to the question that we ask: okay, so at what point this boundary model will break down? For this rectangle, we know that we can do this scaling experiment. Another thing is that, as we showed in the first part, we can do is that we also can do, we change aspect ratio. What will then be the Keroscale behavior of this? If we look at this, this is our control experiment, right? We do this 600 times 300. We do this 600 times 300. And now we keep the long axis, but rather change the shorter axis where we change the aspect ratio. And this is all experiment. You can see if we make the shorter edge to the half, this charity got significantly increased. And if you make it shorter edge longer, you almost lose the charity. And if you make it into a square, you completely lose it. Square, you completely lose it. Which is very simple to understand because this is no difference between this and this edge. So if you rotate 90 degrees, everything becomes the same. So you completely lose the currentity. And if you look at the prediction from the boundary, and so here, the first. So how do we quantify this? So in the previous way, we plot the ratio, the career score as the function of the error ratio, but now we have. Of the error ratio, but now we have accounts for the aspect ratio as well. And we know that, as we just showed, the characterity will get enhanced when the aspect ratio increases. So the simplest case is that we just directly multiply these two ratio and we got a new ratio. And if we plot them, this is all the experiment result, we can see that they all form in a single line. Okay, so if we use this new ratio rather than only Use this new ratio rather than only the error ratio, but also considered as by ratio, the Kerascal can predict by this represent by this geometry ratio. And this is all experiment data. And we can do the same thing for the boundary model. This is the prediction from the boundary. We can see we see a similar trend from the inner inner square completely lost. And if we plot this experimental boundary model, you can see. The boundary model, you can see the boundary model is still valid, okay, still valid to predict this. So, this is all we can do for the rectangle, right? Because you have a rectangle, what you can play with, you can play with the aspiratial or you can change its just scale it up and down. But we know that the rectangle itself is symmetric, right? It's symmetric. Since we are interested in this. Since we are interested in this chirality problem, so why not put the cell into a chirality geometry directly? And we know that the simplest one would be the parallelogram, right? And we know that the parallelogram itself is chiral. So how about if we put the cell into it, and we can directly, since we run out of time, can directly see the results. This is the sorry, this both are the experiment data. And in that case, if you measure. And if in that case, if you measure the angle distribution, we can see that it is not perfectly symmetric. And the reason is very simple because it's chiral. So both in this paragraph and in this problem, they shifted to the right, which means because of the chirality. And for the modeling, we can capture this asymmetry distribution. And okay, and the last one I want to show you is that not only we can do for the steady state, but also we can see the time evolution. So this is the experiment measurement of the cell over time. And if we measure this mimetic order over time, you can see this is experimental data. So we can see that this is the end, this is the order, and this color represents. And this color represents the angle as well. And note that we measure the angle respect to the long respect to the vertical axis. And if we see how it's evolved over time, you can see that eventually they will reach some steady state. And notice that the cell close to the boundary is almost unchanged because they already ordered at the very beginning. It almost remains unchanged. Where in the middle, they evolve. Middle, they evolve over time and eventually reach to some steady state. And you can see this sino-steady kind of steady state shape is like a tilted rectangle, which is definitely makes sense because this is caroled. And if you look at this is the mean angle. If you look at the standard deviation over time, you can clearly see that first you can see that the cell close to the boundary, the The boundary, the ordered at the very beginning, they almost remain unchanged. The standard deviation here is very low, but the inner block is really high. It means that the cell is just random in a box at the beginning. And gradually, the order propagates inside. The cell in a box will also become ordered. And this is another very strong evidence that this is really an outside-in model, that the order creates at the boundary first and then gradually propagates inside. Propagate inside. And so to this point, I think we already answered the question I bring in the very beginning: is that the charot, we know that the charity in a smaller scale is necessary, but it is not sufficient to explain the charity in the cell collectives. In this scenario, the boundary is also very important. Otherwise, you cannot have the charity in the cell collectives. And with that, I'd like to set And with that, I'd like to thank all our collaborators. Alex and I, we do the modeler, Alec and Sasha, they do the experiment. And also, I'd like to offer my special thanks to Ihan. She's not here, but she's maybe one of the best experimentalists I have ever seen. All the experiments are done by her. And without her, I can never imagine this project can be. This pro this project can be done. Yeah. Okay, and that's the end of my talk. Thank you.
