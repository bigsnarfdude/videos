Hey again everyone, I hope you enjoyed the coffee break and we'll have all a week to interact. And now we have Christian Tubio who will speak about the harmonious systematic number of Lemmigraphs. Thank you. I'm happy to be here with you and thank you for the invitation. And I want to say thank you to the organizer for this event. I'm going to talk about the colorings, about the harmonious chromatic number. Let me explain this. So, a coloring is a function in the vertices, and we require two conditions. The first one is the user that they The first one is the user that the coloring is not proper. So this is an example of not proper coloring. So I don't like it. And the other thing is that we avoid something like this. So we have a pair of colors in a 8, but only we can have one. Can have one pair, but not two of them. Okay? So, this is an example of no harmonious coloring. So, what is a harmonious coloring? Well, it's a proper coloring such that every pair of colors appears on at most one edge. This graph has a harmonious coloring, and if you put And if you put a different color in each vertex, you have harmonious coloring. So we are looking for the minimum number and this parameter is called a harmonious chromatic number. Well, it was introduced in the 80s by a Harryan Kotrov and other people. Okay. Okay, two essential things about this parameter. Any graph of diameter 2 equals its harmonious colouring. Why? Well, if you have two vertices with the same color, then you can find an edge with this pair of color and other one. So any graph of diameter 2 has harmonious. Two has harmonious chromatic number equals to the number of pairs. The other thing is that we have a lower bound for this parameter and this is because every two color classes has at most one edge between them. So we have this lower bound. Okay, some examples. Some examples. This is the Hubble graph. Maybe you know this graph. And for this example, its harmonious chromatic number is 7. Every two vertices with the same color are at distance 3 in this case. So this is one representation of the graph of the Fund plane. This is the same graph in two different ways. Here is like a bipartite graph. In one part we have all the colors and represents the points in the pandemic plane. And in the other side, we have the lines. Okay? We have the same in the The same in the representation with the Hamiltonian cycle. And in the final plane, that means color, the vertex, well, the points here and the lines. For instance, we have this color in this vertex in green color and the line in green. And maybe you prefer the And maybe you prefer the cyclic model, and this is the representation. The lines here are these three angles. And maybe you can find a pattern here, maybe not. Or maybe you prefer matrix. And this is the coloring. In this case, the ones represents that vertex. That vertex, the point and the line are incidents. So this pair has to be in different cells. Okay, that is another representation. But in general, we know that if we have a Levigraph of the algebraic projective plane of organ q, we can And q, we can give this bounce q plus 2 square plus q plus 1. That is because every two points are at distance 2, so all of you require different colors. And we can give a coloring, a harmonious coloring, with one color more. So what we What we would like to put colors in the points and in the lines. We don't like this because that means that the coloring in the lemmigraph is proper, is not proper. And we don't allow this this fair of colors in this point and vertex because that means that the coloring is not harmonious. Is non-harmonious. Okay? So the first problem, maybe for you, is how we can improve this upper bound. Well, we require a bigjection between points and lines avoiding these two things. Okay? Maybe it's easy for you, maybe not. I don't know. Well, in general, we have a linear space. Have a linear space, we have the three actions for the linear space. The first one is that every two points determine a line. That means that a lower bound for the harmonious chromatic number of the signal graph is the number of points. And we have colors also in the lines. So if only we give Only we give colors to the lines, which is called line coloring, and it's proper if every two of the lines with the same color are disjoint. So the chromatic index is defined here as the smallest k such that the configuration accepts a k coloring property in the lines. Okay. Well, Well, this conjecture, the Erdos-Aberdover conjectures, is equivalent to this form. If you have a linear space with endpoints, then the chromatic index is at most n. So, in the case of the Lebigraph for these linear spaces, we have a We have a lower bound n because it's the number of points, and the upper bound is n plus the chromatic index using different colors. So maybe you prefer a harder problem to improve this upper bound. Well, in the case of the Erdos Fiber Lobas conjecture is true, we have the upper bound two times L, right? Times M, right? Well, we can take different linear spaces. One of the eases is only take Kn and the Lemigraph have the points and the edges. And the bounds that we have is 3n over 2 as lower bound, and the upper bound is And the upper bound is phi n over 3. So the problem is if you can prove these bounds. Maybe you prefer to work with the affine plane. In this case, we have these bounds. The lower bound is the number of points, and the upper bound is q2 squared plus q2 plus 1. In this case, it In this case, it's because we have parallel classes, and all these parallel classes with a different color, but we don't know the exact value. I think that maybe it's the upper bound, but I don't know. Well, in general, we can think in block design, in the standard different system, or any other, and we need to know the for this. For this block design, what is the value of the chromatic and the harmonious chromatic nomenclature for the Liby graph? So it's problem 5. Or if you take the phenic prolific plane, also here we can consider in the Levin graph points and 9, okay, but maybe you prefer other you prefer other two other options. You can consider points and a hyperplane for instance or any other two. So in this case we have two different problems. You can think in the dimension tree and take planes and points. Consider the Legraph of this and what is the harmonious chromatic number. One more problem is maybe you can take the generalized quadrangles. And this is the smallest example. And we can give coloring with 10 color. Here is the coloring, the construction of this, or there are different ways, but you can take the k6, the points. The points have the numbers and every edge defines a point in the generalized quadrangle of order q and the lines are defined by matchings here. Okay, so for instance this line defines the matching one, three, four, six and the other is this and This and the other. Okay? In general, we don't know what is the value of this parameter here. The Liby graph is this, and we can observe in this case that, for instance, there are three points, three vertices in every chromatic class, and the distance is. And the distance is 3 in 2 of them, and for the other is 4 because it's 9.9. Well, this is the set of problems. Maybe you can check, you wish to check these references. Here is about our results. You can check, for instance, the chromatic index. instance the chromatic index of the project P space or the case of the cyclic standard system and maybe you can use some ideas for this or this is a paper summit that says that the Erdos favor Lobas convector is true. Okay, that's all. Thank you very much, Christian. Are there questions or comments? I think I have the good news because I have the solution to your first problem and probably the solutions to the sixth problem. Excellent. It would be good to stay in the same group, but I might Yeah. In my the talk of today, the last talk, I will show briefly how to solve uh the test problem. Yes, exactly. Not just formatic name, but the number for the level graph of the projective plane. For the q always q squared plus q plus 1. The trick is that we use differences. Default for this. Maybe we can talk about this on Wednesday. Maybe. Okay. I advertise my talk. It is the last one. So we have a perfect solution to problem one and then it's excellent. I wonder if there is something similar for edge colouring instead of edge colouring. Well, we don't work edge yet, but we think, for example, if you take the computer and consider each coloring, the diameter is two and require the total of edges is equal to the harmonic chromatic number of n, but in other cases. In other cases, in the case of the cage, for instance, no, we don't know the answer. That's another interesting question to follow. Yes. Do you mean that any two vertices receive different set of colours on the edges? Yep. Do you mean that edge coloring where two vertices receive different set of colours on the edges? This is the condition? No. This is the condition. No. No, the condition is if you have two edges with different colours, they only meet one vertex at both. So maybe it's partitioning two paths of language. You can take the linear graph of this and take the column in the vertices, and the question is the same. So, in your previous slides, the so here there's a colouring on the edges that are paths of length two, except for the white and the well and the tourquise one, right? One more? This is different because here is the construction for the quadrangles. Yes. So the lines are matching here. Matching here, but the coloring are in the vertices corresponds to the vertices. Thank you very much again. Another question. The next one. Okay, and stay in front, because this is the law of the bulleting of the Institute of Communatorics and its applications. So if he wants to take a picture to put it in B. Geez, like the opportunity. Thank you. Thanks again. I think we are exactly on time for Mika's talk, right? Yeah. One minute. Thank you again.
