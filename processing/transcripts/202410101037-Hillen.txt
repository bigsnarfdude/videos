Thank you very much. Thank you for the opportunity to give a talk here. Everybody loves two lips, of course, so this will be a talk about two lips. The original idea, as you know, was that I had the last talk of this meeting, so I thought I'd do something entertaining and mathematically light. And so this is not only about the math, it's also about the entire story of this. Math is also about the entire story of these tulips and how they were worshipped essentially in Holland in the 17th century, etc. So, I'm going to touch about arts and economy and poetry and of course biology and science as well. And mathematics too. So, the question is these stripes. So, tulips, of course, you know, have all different forms and colors. Mostly, you have uniform colors like yellow or red or white, but then sometimes you have a striped tulip like. Sometimes you have a stripe to lift like the one shown here. And the simple question I would like to ask now is: what generates the stripes? How do they work? This is joint work with Aiden Wong. Aiden Wong was an NSERC USRA student of mine two years ago. Gustavo Carrero is a colleague at Athabasca University, which is a small university in Alberta. So the tulips came to Holland in the 16th century, and the Dutch botanist Carolos Clusios is credited with planting the first ones in his garden. And people loved them so much they were constantly stolen from his backyard. So at some point he just stopped planting those. It's just no point. Yeah. And then in particular there arose two lips which has these broken patterns. Tulips which has these broken patterns, they're called broken tulips, where they form stripes or patterns here in yellow and red, for example. And they became so famous, I think that's my next picture, yeah, that they were painted. So people love these tulips so much, but of course they only have a finite lifespan. So they asked painters, professional painters, to paint these bouquets of broken tulips. And that's why they were called Rembrandt tulips as well. Rembrandt tulips as well. And here are two examples by Morel and Bolingy from this time. And you can really see beautiful these striped patterns here. And they look a little bit different than those which I've shown you in the photographs. And the reason is that to find these real broken tulips in nature is almost impossible. So the other ones which I've shown you in the photographs are genetically engineered stripes. So it's a different process. But I'm interested in this national. But I'm interested in this natural occurring stripes, whether here or here. Yeah, so Rembrandt only painted one of these on his wife. This is a picture of his wife, Saskia, which he painted as Flora, and then there's one broken tulip petal in her head bouquet. It's still called the Remrod tulip, so, anyways. Now, this led to the tulip Omania, and I'm sure many of you. Tulipomania, and I'm sure many of you have heard about this. So that the price of the tulip bulb really increased, increased astronomically, and people would pay in 3,000 guilders for a tulip petal, sorry, bulb, which corresponds to about 300,000 Canadian dollars right now. So it's really, really, really, really blew up a market for these. But then people would buy these and plant them, and then sometimes they form the stripes, and sometimes They form the stripes, and sometimes they don't form the stripes. And so, this was a market which couldn't be maintained, and it broke down in one of the first collapses. Well, I think people consider this the first market collapse in 1630 C, which 37, which ever occurred. This picture is wonderful from this time. There is like a merchant selling a tulip pulp to a fool who pays this. So, here you see illustration of the market price of these tulips in this time. So, this is an image from around that time in the 17th century. And this is Thomson 2007, who reconsidered the price evolution of these tulips. And then, in particular, so you can see a constant rise until this is 1636, and then this dashed line. And then this dashed line is people call this the price of the tulips, but it really was the option price. So they introduced option pricing because you can't get tulips every time in the year, right? But you can buy options for the next season. And so the option price went really up like this, but it was never realized. So tulips were never sold at this price. But still, there was a very steep increase here, and then it broke down in 1636. So Gustavo Carrero, my collaborator with his student, they published a model for the bursting of financial bubbles based on behavior, investment behavior of the investors. That's on a side. But now back to the question, what causes these stripes? And of course, in those earlier times, I didn't know where the stripes come from. And it took like, I don't know, 200 years before we found out what. Before we found out what is actually responsible for these trips. So, before I answer this, any ideas? I mean, Mark, you cannot answer. You have very much word. So, what they found is the color breaking was transmissible from broken tulips to solid tulips by aphids. So, there's a hint. So, it sounds like a disease, right? It sounds like a disease. Disease, right? It sounds like a disease. Transmittable, okay. So the answer is this came in 1928. It is a virus. It is a virus infection of the tulip metal. And this is actually the reason I got interested in, I'll tell you more in a second, because I'm interested in oncolytic viruses, so I was looking into virus infections. And so then, so then this is a virus infection. It's called the two-lip-breaking virus. This is not. This is not the first plant virus which was found. So, a similar virus was discovered in 1892, which is a tobacco mosaic virus, TMV, which has been studied quite a bit more because it's relevant for the tobacco industry. So, instead of stripes, the tobacco mosaic virus makes just dark patches on the tobacco plants. And if you roll this into a cigar, it looks really crappy. So, people were concerned for economical reasons about. We were concerned for economical reasons about the tobacco mosaic virus. But it's a very similar virus than the tulip-breaking virus. And here it is: so it's a positive, a rod-like positive strain RNA virus measuring this size, and it belongs to the POTI virus family. And here are some images of that virus. Alright. Now, the tulip-breaking virus interferes with the production and expression of pigments. Production and expression of pigments in the tulips. And these pigments are called anthocyanins, which are right here. And yeah, and so people think that the virus inhibits the formation or the production of these anthocyanins. So this was so famous that there's also a poem written about these tulips. So for decades, no one knew what caused the flaring or feathering of tulips. Parrot-like, red and orange, pepper. Red on orange, peppermint red on white, black on tangerine, eruption into flame for broken tulips like Apsalom and Mabel. What causes tulips to break? The mosadic virus carried by aphids infects bulbs and the flower breaks. Its hold on one color, the primary color suppressed and lighter colors bleeding through. The beauty of a curse by Deborah Laitzino. So I like. So I like this here: the beauty of a curse, because virus typically you think it's really evil and really bad. But here, a virus infection actually leads to extra beauty of the tulip buttons. Okay, so now being in a room of mathematicians who have experience in reaction diffusion equations, what can generate these stripes? Turing patterns, right? So there would be an idea. So that would be an idea. And this leads me to the real reason why I looked into this. This is a book by Karen MÃ¶rling. She's a virologist in Germany. And she wrote this book, Viruses, More Friends Than Foes, which is a wonderful introduction just into virus biology in general. It is not overloaded with RNA and DNA and antigens. It tells stories about viruses. And it also tells stories how viruses can be actually quite useful in a colony. Quite useful in a college. And so then on page 223, 224, she talked about the tulip breaking virus. And then she wrote this. She wrote, Ellen Turing described the mathematics leading to strikes. An activator and a long-range inhibitor are interacting, but I do not know which of the two is a virus. And so I read this and I thought, I can do this! I can do this! I have all the tools. So I want to answer a question. So I want to answer a question: is the virus the activated or the answer? And you can think about this already now, what you think might be the result here. So let's look at Turing just a little bit. I mean, you are, I think most of you are very familiar with the figure of Alan Turing. He is represented really nicely in this immutation game movie, which maybe most of us have seen. But in addition to decoding the And in addition to decoding the Enigma machine, he also invented the first computer, which is called the Turing machine. And he also invented this Turing test, where a tester, TSC, has to distinguish between answers from a machine versus answers from a human using like a chat thing. And of course, this Turing problem has now been, this Turing test has been beaten. I think nowadays it would not be possible to distinguish between a Would not be possible to distinguish between a human or a machine. But you need to be, I think, really, really smart to do that. Okay. Yeah, what we are interested in, of course, are the Turing patterns. The Turing is famous for this pattern formation and has been used in fish and in zebra and in seashells and in many different examples. Okay, so let's look at the Turing mechanism just briefly. So a little bit of math you'll allow me to do. This is a Turing model, right? This is the Turing model, right? And then I'm sure many of you actually teach this in the classes. So we look at the Jacobian of the kinetic part F and G, and then we look for two patterns. And then we have the plus minus, plus minus, and the minus minus plus plus. And these are the ones which lead to pattern formation if the diffusion coefficients are sufficiently separate. And yeah, so the left one is the activator-inhibitor model, and the right one is called the sub-structure. And the right one is called the substrate activator model. And I think when people teach Turing models, they focus on activator inhibitor. And then maybe you would say, okay, the substrate activator is the same or very similar or it can do the same thing, whatever. So it turns out with the two-lip virus here, we actually are in this case. This is a substrate activator model. So the goal is to build a simple mechanistic mathematical model that captures the formation of the tetles of broken. The formation of the petals of broken tulips, and then answer Karin Berling's question: Is the virus the inhibitor or the artifact? All right, so we use three ingredients, anthocyanins. This is a nice picture because anthocyanins is a class of molecules and they can form all kinds of different colors. So, here is all the different color shades you can get anthracyan produce. Then we have the virus here on the right, and the virus is made out of wilt. Right, and the virus is made out of building blocks out of proteins and amino acids, which I call P. And so then the virus infects the cells, it reproduces, so it uses a lot of building blocks, it interferes with the anthocyanin production, and this is what I would like to capture in the model. So here's anthocyanin again. So two-lip-breaking virus interferes with the expression of anthocyanins and broken sectors of the pattern. And broken sectors of the petal represent virus-infected tissues or virus-infected areas. But there's also a reverse interaction, so the anthocyanins interact with the virus production. So then, yeah. So anthocyanin inhibits tobacco-mosaic virus reproduction. So here we go to the tobacco-mosaic virus because it has never been measured for the tulip-breaking virus, but the viruses are similar. Virus, but the viruses are similar, so we assume a similar process. Increased anthocyanin biosynthesis inhibits TMV production in tomato plants. So again, not tulips, but we need to get the information from somewhere else. So let's start with the anthracyan dynamics. So here we use a very standard model, which is known as the Bolpert model, and a paper by Louis, Leck, and Bolpert. And I think this Lewis is not marked. And I think this Louis is not Mark. And so this has been reported, or this mechanism has been found in apples, in cabbage, and in crab apple leaves. Again, never been measured for tulip-breaking virus, but nevertheless, we use this mechanism. So we have the anthocyanin concentration, which we call T. There's an input signal, rho zero, there's a degradation term, and then There's a degradation term, and then there's an autoregulation term of this monotype or Hill type 2. So, what it does, this is an ODE, so I can just plot it here. The right-hand side is plotted in three graphs. So, for, let's look here first. For high-input row zero, you have a full expression steady state where the undersigned n is fully expressed. For low input rho zero, you get two additional steady states. You get two additional steady states, and the lower one here is also stable. So then we have two stable steady states, a high and a low. And the low one would be the expression of no antocyanin, so where the pattern is absent or where the color is absent. So then the input signal here or the reproduction of antocyanin will be changed by the presence of the virus. And we do it this way. So then for high virus concentration, this term is reduced. This term is reduced so that we get no expression of anthocyanins. Alright? Yeah, and then we need the other components. So now I show you the full model. So we have the anthocyanin, the tulip pigment, the building blocks for the virus, and the virus particles down here. The building blocks and the virus particles diffuse. The anthocyanin does not diffuse, it sticks in the cells where it's produced. And then what do we have? So we have diffusion. And then, what do we have? So, we have diffusion, we have substrate production, and then here we have the interaction of the virus and the substrate, which is consumed to build new viruses, which is done here. This rate is reduced by the presence of anthocyanin, as I explained earlier, and then the viral is degraded or lost at the constant rate gamma. So, then this model, we could find these parameter values. So, we have a base set of parameter values. A base set of parameter values. Again, using a lot of tobacco-moza equirus data as well. Why is it v squared? This is v squared. Yeah, why v squared. Okay, actually, we used a Schnachenberg model, so that's the idea. We have the Schnachenberg model. So there's a non-linear interaction between virus and in other words, otherwise we don't get patterns. Okay. Okay. So we we submitted this paper is the revision and the reviewers suggested no, this comes later, okay. Ah, no, explain this first. Good. Now if we take these parameter values, you see they have different scales. They're 10 to the minus 6, they're 10 to the minus 2, there's a 10, there's a 32. And so we can identify where in the equation are the large and the small parameters. And it turns out we get this structure. We get actually small parameters in the Parameters in the ultrasig equation, and we get broader larger parameters in the equations for D and B. So, this is great, so we can do a multi-scale analysis. We can set epsilon to zero, look at the fast system here, and then we look at the slow system later. And this is nice, so let's do that. A small parameter is always good. So, then we have the fast system here, and then we can do a Turing-type analysis, and we find this pattern. Type analysis, and we find this pattern, which is of activator substrate structure. It's also the Schnachenberg model, so it has been analyzed to depth, and we know essentially everything about it. Important, though, is it comes out that V is a short-range activator. So the virus is indeed the activator of this pattern. Although it inhibits anthocyanin, but mathematically, it's the activator of the pattern. So it's really So it's really a funny conclusion here for this bit. It's also why it's not so easy to intuitively say is this the activator or the innovator. So this is good. And then we can run simulations for these parameter values which we found and we get these patterns. All right, there you are. So yeah. And then we go to the slow system, which is the under Seinine equation, and then V is already the pattern. And then V is already the pattern, right? So we get a pre-pattern from the fast dynamics, which means rho goes up and down, so it switches between this and this stage. And so then the pattern is transported to the antosine as well. And if we solve the three equations together, we get these kind of wiggley patterns. Depending on the parameters, you get different frequencies. Okay. Oh, yeah. Here's now what I said about the referees. So they wanted like a sense. The referees, so they wanted like a sensitivity analysis of the parameter waves. So we do this here for two of the parameters. We do a Latin hypercube analysis, and green means pattern formation, and red means no pattern formation. And the black dot is the region of our parameter variance which we estimated. So we are well in the pattern forming region here. So does this look the same? Uh does this look the same? Are these uh the same uh tools I found? I think Sebastian is not convinced. So something is missing, I find. So this is not very convincing. And what is missing is the tulip actually grows while it makes a pattern. In particular, the petals grow while the pattern is arranged. And this happens on the same time scale. It is not like you first get a petal and then the pattern creeps in. So this happens. Creeps in. So this happens at the same time. So we need to look at a growing petal actually. So here are petal shapes which we looked at. And so there is these wonderful shapes. And they grow out from the stem and go to the bottom, to the top. So we need to solve this reaction diffusion system on a growing domain. And now this has been developed in the work of Edmund Crampin, who is a colleague of who made. Who is a colleague of who many of us might actually have known? And he passed away way too young in May 2021 during COVID. But he didn't pass away on COVID. But it's still a sad story. But so I'm glad that we can use this theory here. And so we have a reaction diffusion system. We study it on a domain where the length of the domain increases because the 2D platform grows. And so we rescale. And so we rescale space by this length, and then we get an additional drift term, actually a dilution term right here, which we then can solve on a fixed domain of 0, 1, and then we have standard methods for fixed domains here. So then the next question is, what is actually L? How does a tulip grow? How can we parametrize the growth of this tulip petal? So we looked through the literature and we could not find a tulip petal growth. A two-lip petal growth equation, but we could find a rose petal growth equation. And so this is the rose curve function. I think everybody of you would have guessed it should have this form. And this just, if it grows, it gives like a rose pattern. So we solved our model on the rose and we get this. So here initial conditions at the top and time goes down and you see these formation of patterns. So here is the two lip pigments, the building blocks and the virus. The building blocks and the virus. And where the virus is high, the pigmentation is missing. And then this shape here is like a rose petal shape, which we use. So it's kind of a proof of concept so the thing works. But it still doesn't look like the tulips. So then we go back and do some 20th century botany. So we take a tulip petal, we shine through the light from the back. Shine through the light from the back, and then we print it on a large piece of paper, and then we measure the arcs which are perpendicular to the arteries here, or to the veins. So we measure arcs perpendicular to the veins, and the idea is that those arcs are cells of equal age. And so we can measure all this out, we can measure a radius here, we can measure the distance, we know how old this paddle is, etc. So we can get a good estimate about the. A good estimate about the growth shape of this panel. And so, what we get is this: so, we get the arc length, which is the length of the segment, and we get the radius as we go from the stem to the outer rim, from 0 to 12. And so, these are the measured data points, and then we fit it with a curve. So, here we fit it with a logistic curve, this one, and here we fit it actually with the same voltboard curve. Fit it actually with the same Volbot curve which we used in the first equation. And so we get beautiful fits. Actually, here I showed two: the Volbot function is the blue, and the cubic function is the yellow. So we could have this either way. But they give us information now how the tulip shape grows. So, and this is then what we do. So, here is now time. As time increases, the arc length. The arc length, which is the blue bar here, increases. So, this tells you how the arc length increases. And that's the domain where you solve your tulip break and virus problem. But then we have to curve it. So, we have a radius of curvature. So, once we solve it on the blue line, we curve it around to get it into the tulip shape, which then is a green line. Okay, so that's how this works. And if we do this, we get, first of all, we get these patterns. We get these patterns forming on these intervals, and then we curve them around, and we get these beautiful petal shapes, which now do look like turning petals. And they get these shapes. And then like Turing models, if you change the, let's say, the domain length, the initial domain length, you get different kinds of frequencies in these patterns. And you can compute all this from the linearization on this. Linearization along the corresponding domain length. So let's compare this to existing, no, not existing, but real two limbs which have been painted 300 years ago. So here's the Camelot Vandina, so this is kind of this kind of pattern. And the Vitier Nerver has more white in these patterns, but I think they actually resemble really nicely. Yeah, so this is then coming to the end. So the model employs a Turing-type substrate activator system and a Volport gradient sensing mechanism. Actually, that's also interesting because as we grow up, at least Mark and I and Chris, people would discuss the Volport mechanism and the Turing mechanism. And people would say, Volport is right, Turing is wrong, or the other way around. So we use both together. We estimate realistic parameter values as much as available in the literature, and then answer Merlin's question: the virus is the activator. Krampin's theory of reaction diffusion on growing domains is essential here. And then the parameterization of the growing petal is a new method, actually. So, this in itself might be interesting to some people. Nowadays, though, so these are tulips in my neighbor's garden. These are genetically engineered tulips, so nobody wants to have the virus because the virus is still a virus, so it makes the plants weaker and they don't reproduce so well, etc. So nowadays, if you buy striped tulips, they are genetically engineered. And so then here I plotted these tulip shapes on a I plotted these two-lip shapes on a piece of paper and I arranged them in this tulip fashion. Thank you very much. I love total. I don't know anything that will last very long. It's a habit, so it lasts until we get to the end of the page. All right, questions. We got time for one. I'm for multiple questions. Thank you very much. There are two questions. The first is technical, in compass theory, which kind of the growth do you use? Like the uniform, are people? You have to say where is the growth is uniform everywhere. And my second question is more like perspective. Would we be able to prove that it's actually this? I don't know that Jetty at some point. I remember those people were. I remember people were working on skin to get very convincing. I think you think about the fish where they cut out a piece and rotate it. It's very convincing. I want to say that it's actually terrific and plate. Actually, we tried. So Aiden planted tulips in his garden, and then at some point, we inserted some eek drops into the growing petal and want to see how the. Is a blowing petal and want to see how the intro interferes with the petal. But the ink would completely smear out, and everything would be like a light blue. Wouldn't really interfere. But yeah, I think that's a good idea. But did you do the one with virus? Yes, right. Yeah, that was so. Two questions. The first one was: is the virus introduced right at the beginning of the growth? Because that's kind of implicit in your model, or does the virus infect? Of inputs in your model, or does the virus infect the whole planet? Exactly. In the model, it is introduced from the beginning. In nature, it is transported by aphids. So, this could happen anytime and then it goes. And does one see variability in the pattern, like in earlier stages, closest to the bottom? Absolutely. And the second question was, you had the small parameter for the time scale, but there was also like, I think, a small parameter for the spatial scale with the diffusivity of the virus. And then, like, I saw very much localization in the fire. Much like localization and the viral distribution, they do explore that aspect in a kind of organic. Yeah, that's of course it's very central. So we have the short-range virus. So the virus is pretty local, which makes a lot of sense. So the virus infects a cell and then reproduces inside the cell, right, before it bursts again. But I think that's the central point. Did you construct anything analytically with using that spatial scale? Oh, yes. So we did all the tooling analysis of the eigenvalues at the frequencies. So it's a beautiful talk. So I'm really interested in the equations of T because from low to zero is exactly my honeybee. Oh, is it? So basically you do have a certain range, you have this T by the A, right? Also the ridge of the. Also, the rate of animal variables, you have bistability. We have bistability in DPS. So, how is contributing to the having formations of the to the? Yeah, so if you have a lower stable equilibrium point, this is where the virus concentration is high, and this means you have no anthocyanin expression. So, this is then the white color and these patterns. Is it this a contrary to the like you have the white strap, you have the red strap? So the white straps are the lower equilibrium and the red straps are the higher equilibrium. Okay, so that's my hydro, yeah. Because of the facility kind of weight. Definitely, yes. Yeah. I have two questions. Have you ever talked to any biologists who work on Tulu? How does it work? Well, we got a review report from a biologist who works on Max. We are still working on this. I mean, he went completely nuts. So he did exactly. Completely nuts. So, he did exactly what I didn't want to do. He talked about antigens and DNA and RNAs. So, we're a little bit lost there. The second question is: you know, there are a lot of DVDs for magnosis and other models. Is that possible to have similar ideas to fit to other absolutely? So, the tobacco mosaic virus would be kind of the next goal to look at, right? But then there are other Right, but then there are other similar plants which are infected by other similar viruses. So yeah, I think this is much wider applicable than just really fun. I really enjoyed it. Thank you. My question is: so, in this pretty, in this final picture where you got the desired result and the pretty pattern that looks like, do you think? Do you uh like measure in any sense how close the pattern you generate is to the tulip or is it you just say this looks better than the previous one? No, exactly. We did to the second, so we looked at something which looks similar. We didn't look at the frequencies exactly. So, for the what you find now in the market, you said it's genetically engineered. Right. Is there a similar mechanism? Right. Is there a similar mechanism underlying that one good model? Oh, this is a very good question. And see why the patterns are different from these? I mean, there must be something which regulates the expression of anthocyanin, right? Periodic pattern. But this is genetics, so yeah, I don't know. Oh, one last question.  Yeah, we have an idea.
