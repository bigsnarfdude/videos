All right, so our next speaker is going to be Christian Ketterer from the University of Freiburg. And he's going to tell us about the characterization of the null energy condition and the displacement complexity back model. Yeah, thank you very much. And thanks to the organizers for the invitation. Yeah, so I will speak about a possible characterization of the null energy condition by a display. The null energy condition via displacement convexity of entropy. And yeah, so this is a question that was raised already yesterday in Robert's talk and where he gave a possible answer. And this is about another approach to this. And so let me start by fixing a little bit of terminology. So in this talk, I always consider time-oriented. I always consider time-oriented, connected, n plus one-dimensional elements in manifold. And yeah, so we have this definitions here of a vector, a tension vector is called time-like, space-like, causal or null if the inner product with the vector, the inner product of the vector with itself is negative, positive, non-negative, or zero. zero and also a curve is then called time-like, space-like, and causal or non-like with tension vectors or so. And here one final definition. So a set is called R-chronal or R-causal if no time-like or causal curve intersects A twice and an R-chronal hypersurface. Sigma is called a Cauchy hypersurface if every inextendable time-like time-like curve in. And my curve intersects sigma exactly once. Okay, so this is just terminology. So let me recall here briefly what is the Ricci curvature. So it's the trace of the remaining curvature tensor with respect to a multinormal basis that is orthogonal to this vector W. And so we can speak about lower Ricci curvature bounds in the Lorentzian set. Curvature bounds in the Lorentzian setting, we can insert time-like vectors, and we speak about time-like Laura Ricci curvature bounds. And if k here is zero, then this is called the strong energy condition, which is one assumption, for instance, in Hawking's singularity theory. Okay, and so the important theorem that Robert also mentioned yesterday is this characterization of the strong energy condition. Characterization of the strong energy condition that was proved by Robert McCann and Mandino and Zur, which is in terms of convexity of the Nurini entropy along WQ geodesics with Q separated endpoints. So I will not explain this theorem again. So I mean because it will not be Because it will not be important, but Robert already told you all these essentials yesterday. So this theorem is the starting point of this development for a synthetic strong energy condition for Lorentzian length spaces. And so what I'm interested in now is, or I mean, this is the question. Or, I mean, this is the question that was already raised. So, what is about the null energy condition? So, we do not insert time-like vectors, but null vectors in the Ricci tensor, and we require that the Ricci tensor in this null directions is non-negative. Okay, so let me motivate this condition first. So, this is Condition first. So, this is important because it shows up in also in various theorems and general relativity. So, let me mention two of them. So, it's an assumption, for instance, in the Hawking monotonicity theorem that says the following. So, if H is a black hole horizon that is also future complete, then we have. that is also future complete and we have two space-like archronals in two hypersurfaces. We can intersect these hypersurfaces with the black hole horizon. And then the statement is if S0 is in the past of S1, then the area of S1 is larger than the area of S0. So it increases towards the area of this. Of these intersections with the horizon increase towards the future. And yeah, this is also called sometimes the third law of black hole thermodynamics. Second? Second, isn't it? I mean, I don't know. So I think, I was going to ask you, I think the interpretation of this should be that the sigma non and the sigma one are like different observers, one in the future or the other. And what this is saying is that the entry, so that the That the entry, so that the area of this intersection, SI, is supposed to be the entropy of the black hole measured by that observer, and it's saying that the entropy of the black hole can only block high. Yeah. My question was, is that the correct interpretation? Yeah, yeah, this is also what I had in mind. I was just not sure if this law that entropy always goes up is the third or the second law of thermodynamics. Okay, thanks. The fluish cosmological journey constant is lambda zero or maybe this does not play a role so the yeah so so actually the funny thing about that the although the strong energy condition depends on the cosmological constant the null energy condition doesn't because the null vector when you stick it in kills the cosmological constant yeah exactly and it also kills the speed Yeah, exactly. And it also kills the scalar curvature in that sign tensor. So physicists were very critical about the strong energy condition because they say the thing that matters is the stress energy tensor, not the Ricci tensor. But for null vectors, they're the same thing. Yeah, thanks. And so this is the Hawking monogenicity. The second famous theorem where the null energy condition shows up is All energy condition shows up is the Penrose singularity theorem. So, which says the statement is: so, if we have our space-time and there exists a non-compact Cauchy hypersurface and also a future-converging co-dimensional submanifold S, then the space-time is future now, geodesically incomplete. Where here, so future converging means that Future converging means that if we have the codimension to submanifold S, then the pairing of the mean curvature vector with any null vector on S is negative. This is also called trap sometimes or future trap. Okay, so this is Yeah, so this is what I wanted to say about this here. And okay, so let's so therefore let's continue and let's let me give you one remark here about the Ricci tensor in null directions. So one thing one can observe first when we want to study this here is that so if we if we look in a null direction, then in contrast to time-like direction, In contrast to time-like directions, the Ricci tensor here only depends on contributions of n minus one directions in our space-time. So we, or in other words, we can find an orthonormal basis such that the first vector here is the null vector, such as that the Ricci tensor is this sum here for i equal 1 to n minus 1. And maybe I didn't say that. And maybe I didn't say that, but I always assume my space-time is n plus one-dimensional. So I mean, therefore, we so yeah, so this is it only depends on n minus one direction. Yeah, sorry, somehow confused. Your space is n plus one dimensional, but your reaching should be then a trace over n directions, shouldn't it? Yeah, I mean it it originally is, but if the novel is. Yeah, because we insert here, we will have a null, null vector. So you've chosen a basis in which therefore you can choose a basis such that it only depends on this n minus one or aches. Okay. So, I mean, okay, so the goal here is. So I mean okay so the goal here is now that we want to give a characterization of the null energy condition via entropy convexity and so the problem here is so the approach that is available for for the strong energy condition doesn't work because the optimal transport problem doesn't make any sense. Yeah, I mean you you you cannot really solve I mean what what you would what you would like to consider here is that our measures that are where this Lorentz Wassenstein distance is zero but I mean this this is not I mean I mean problems arise like like the ones Robert explained yesterday so one has to come up with with another idea how to apply. Come up with another idea how to approach this. Or, I mean, one idea is the one Robert presented yesterday, another idea is what I want to show you right now. And then if we have such an entropy characterization of the null energy condition, I would like to define a synthetic null energy condition such that we again have these three properties. So, I mean, it should be consistent with the smooth case. Be consistent with the smooth case. It should allow non-trivial consequences, like, for instance, the Hawking monotonicity theorem and the Penrose similarity theorem, and it should be stable. Okay, well, okay, and I will say something about stability at the end of the talk in case you want to come. Okay, so how do we do that? we do that so the the framework I want to consider is the one is our null hypersurfaces so since we cannot really take off the optimal transport framework I mean I want to now define a different way how we can interpolate measures in our space-time such that we can use this new interpolation to define an entropy convexity. Convexity that characterizes the null energy condition. And the basic thing here is that I look at null hypersurfaces. So let me recall what that is. So a null hypersurface is a codimension 1c2 submanifold H, such that the Lorentz metric degenerates on this null hypersurface. And then for such null hypersurfaces, there exists, they always There always exists a non-vanishing C1 null vector field that is future-directed and that has the following three properties. So let me first mention that. So since this vector field is null at every point, so the orthogonal complement of this is in fact the tension space of the null hypersurface. Of the null hypersurface, then tangent vectors of h that are not parallel to k are always space-like. And we also know that the integral curves of this k are null geodesics after we reparametrized them appropriately. And so maybe let me draw a picture here. So the picture here that I have in mind is, I mean, this is, so the whiteboard is our space-time, and this here is the hyper surface. And so we have this vector field that tells us in which direction the metric actually degenerates. And we have this flow lines of this. of this um of this um of the spectrum. Okay. And um and um the second point here is as soon as you have a vector here that um that is not in direction of one of these non-vectors, it's a space-like vector. Okay. So this is what we want to use now to define a new type of interpretation. A new type of interpolation between measures in the following way. So, what? No, K is not unique. So, I mean, it's only unique up to multiplication with small functions or up to multiplication with something. So, it is unique. And sorry, so because they come as integral curves of the vector field, they. Occurs in the vector field, they allegate this the knowledge of the surface, right? Yeah. Yeah, so and now to define a new interpolation between measures, what we do now is, so first, I mean, now I give you a bunch of definitions. So this is, I cannot avoid this. Cannot avoid this. So, given such a null hypersurface, we first define a transport set. So, this is a collection of pairs of points in our hypersurface, such that xy is in this transport set, if y is in the future of x, or so if they are causally related like that, and there exists a flow line such that these two guys. Yeah, such that these two guys are on the same floor. So X and Y are related to each other via the strengthworks that if they know if they are on the same flow out there. And what we also can do is, so we have the segment that connects these two points, and we can reparametrie. can reparametrize this segment finely so that we have a fine parametrized null geodesic between X and Y. Then the next thing is so that having this transport set we can define what is a null coupling. So pi, a measure on the product space of M is a null coupling. If there exists such a null hypersurface that is also R chrono. That is also R-chrono, such that the support of this pi is inside of this transport set with respect to this H. And having this type of couplings, we also can now say when two measures are so-called null-connected. So, two measures mu0, mu1, on our space-time are null connected, if there exists a null coupling pi. Coupling pi that connects these two. So there is a nyl coupling such that the two marginal distributions of this pi are mu0 and mu1. So then some more locations. So I mean we have this affinely parameterized segments for every pair of points. So we can define this map epsilon here that Epsilon here that maps every such pair to its corresponding segment. And we can push forward the null coupling with respect to this map. And this gives us a probability measure pi on the sine of these segments here. And we also can push forward this probability. Push forward this probability measures on the segments again via the evaluation at ET to get a family of measures on our null hypersurface again. And this is what we call null displacement interpolation. The A and B should be general sets, right? And the last A should be a B. Yeah. Thanks. So, um, yeah, so what. Yeah, so what so the picture is here now so that so I mean this of course is a strong restriction on the type of measures we actually can consider. So to measures mu0 and mu1, I mean they only can be nine connected if they are the same hypersurface. And so but if they are then the images that I mean the field image on the we can't see that you need different kind of There's a bunch of them over on the other blackboard, by the way. That's fine. Yeah, that's good. So and yeah, so we can now, they are null connected. So if yeah, if there is this null coupling that connects or that relates every point here to a point here via such flow curve. Flow curve. Okay. And I mean, yeah, and also what I want to say is that we have this interpolation now, so I mean, we can interpolate here. Okay. So this is already interesting, but now we want to characterize the null energy curve. I characterize the null energy condition via entropy. And entropy is this functional, is the rhyme entropy that operates essentially on absolutely continuous measures. So we need to think about what is the reference measure here. And first thing that we realize is that if we restrict the metric to this, I mean, since it's a non-metron I mean, since it's a non-met uh null hypersurface, the metric degenerates, so also the volume degenerates. So it so the we don't really have an n um n-dimensional volume here on this null hypersurface. But what we actually have, I mean, we don't have that because one direction generates, I mean, but what we have instead is an n minus one dimensional volume form, so which allows us to allows us to measure the volume of codimension two submanifolds or subsets of codimension two submanifolds in our null hypersurface. So here, for instance, we have a codimension two submanifold that is inside of H and we have a set A and S then and the volume of this A is given by integrating this n minus one form over H. This n minus 1 form over h. Okay, so this is in fact the reference measure that we want to use. And so now one more definition. So we call a measure mu on M r causal if there exists a hypersurface sigma that is r-causal and space-like and a C2 submanifold such that the support of this murius is inside of the sigma. Is inside of the seed mode. Okay, and then we, in fact, we only want to interpolate such measures. We only want to null interpolate such measures. And so at this point, so the next thing that comes with a lemma that tells us that these null displacement interpolations are induced by maps. maps. So for everyone who does optimal transport and synthetic Ricci bounds knows that this is one of the key points why Ricci lower bounds, in this characterization of Ricci lower bounds via entropy convexity, that we have optimal maps. And in fact something similar is true here. I mean it's much less sophisticated but it's anyway true. And the statement is the following lemma. So if Statement is the following lemma. So we consider two measures, mu1, that are causal and null connected via some null coupling pi. So that means this pi is supported on some transport set with respect to some null hypersurface H. And this already implies that these mu's here, mu1 and mu0, are supported in codimension two sub-manifolds inside of. Sub-manifolds inside of H. So the relative to M itself. So we actually don't have a situation like this here, but I mean we have our null hypersurface, we have and what we actually have is we have here some Some S0, and here's some other S1. And the measures are supported on this codimension to sub-manifolds. Okay, and so the and then we have one more assumption. So we also assume that, so now we know these measures are supported here on this four-dimensional sub-metifaults. So in particular, we can. defaults so in particular we can say that they we can require that they are wall age absolutely continuous so this means absolutely continuous with respect to this volume formula and then under this assumptions what we get is that there exists a map T defined on some open set U inside of S such that this T push forwards mu zero to mu one. So it's kind of To one. So it's kind of a transport map between these two measures. And more precisely, this map here is given as this exponential of this vector field here. And here k is again the vector field that induces the flow. And this is multiplied with this C1 function r here, which gives us a new vector field k tilde. field k tilde which tells us how we how we have to move the measures for a new so this is this is like k tilde here and it tells us how far we have to go on our um on our on our flow lines to move from from the measure to zero here to the measure near one. So you has full measure? I mean it just tells you there is this map defined on some u and we can and the support of mu zero is inside of that of that mu but I mean okay I mean it doesn't doesn't have to be everything okay. Okay. Okay, yeah, so this is now nice. We have this map and the map also has a familiar structure. So this is exactly the structure of the optimum map that we use to characterize richly lower curvature bonds. So and we can use that now. And so before I come, and what we also get is, I mean, we can now smargolate. Get this, I mean, we can now smuggle in here a T, we can define this family of maps T and push forward the measure mu0 with respect to these TTs, which gives us again a family of measures, an interpolation between mu0 and mu1. And it in fact is the same interpolation that you saw before. So I mean I mean, because these things are pretty much unique, I mean there is much not much room yet to change anything. To change anything. Okay. So now we can, we are almost in the position to formulate a theorem. So the final thing I want to show you is we have this reference measure wall h that lives on n minus one dimensional things. And we can define the n-Renier entropy with respect to this wall h pretty much exactly in the same way as we define a Rheni entropy. Way as we define a Rini entropy with respect to any reference measure. And then with all of this, now we can. This is now the main theorem that I want to show you. So it says that the following two statements are now equivalent. So if you have two measures, mu0, mu1, that are causal and are connected, then this entropy here, or more precisely the n minus 1 entropy, is taken. Is k convex along this along the corresponding null displacement interpolation, and this is equivalent to the null energy condition. Okay. And so how much time do I have? Sorry. Oh, um, we're starting about five minutes late, so actually you have about significant time just to. So, that's the end, but take a picture of just a few minutes. Okay, thanks. Okay, so let me talk very little about the proof. So, I will focus on the proof of one direction, so how two implies one. So, the idea here is, I mean, since we have this map now that has a very familiar structure. Map now that has a very familiar structure, we can follow the proofs that we know. But there are some important differences that I want to point out now. So and these differences don't make it straightforward what's happening there. So I mean, so we have this null displacement interpolation, μ T, and we have this family of maps, and we can push forward also this. Also, this co-dimensional two sub-manifolds with respect to this map here, which gives us a family of manifolds here on our null hypersurfaces, where these measures live. So, these measures are supported on this S piece here. And they are space-like. So, this is something one has to check. And then the first step is Then the first step is, so what we always do when we study these maps is we take the differential of this map tt. And in the variable t now, this thing, so it's a map from the tension space at some point at s0 to the tension space at some point in st. And it also satisfies Jacobi equation. So this is just So, this is just Lorentzian calculus so far. And it satisfies the Jacobia equation along one of these geodesics here. So then in the next step, what we do is we define a new operator, ux, which is the derivative of A here composed of the inverse of A. This is an operator that goes. This is an operator that goes from this tension space to this tension space, and this satisfies a Riccati equation now. And so still very familiar to people who do optimal transport, but also familiar maybe to people who do general relativity, because this equation, I mean, maps of the form that I showed you show up, already show up in the literature, and people studied them and derive also this equation here. Equation here, and it's in the GR literature, it's called optical equation. But the way how I get it is different from what you see in the literature, in the GR literature. So now we want to get the Ricci curvature, of course. So what should we do? We take the trace of this equation. So we trace the equation. So we remote. So, we want to take the trace of the equation, but one point here is now, so we want to get an ODE for the trace. So, what we would like to do is move this derivative outside of the trace. And here, something happens now that is maybe interesting and I want to point out. So, this is an optimal transport of measures that live on sub-manifolds. And so, in fact, I studied such a problem before with Andrea Mandino in the context of Riemannian manifolds. Of Riemannian manifolds. So, more or less the exact same problem, and we were able to relate this transport to K-Ricci bounds. So, this Ricci bounds that interpolate between sectional and Ricci. And what we observed is in general that, I mean, this here is not true. So, I mean, what when we when- Ah, sorry, yeah, the trace here is with respect to this tension space. With respect to this tension space. So, I mean, it's an n minus one trace. So, we take an autonomous basis here. Yeah, we choose an autonomous basis on this thing. And with respect to that, we take the trace. And it's an n minus one trace. So, what, but to come back to this problem here in the Riemannian setting, I mean, this is not true. I mean, you get an extra term here. True. I mean, you get an extra term here. And this is essentially the reason why, for instance, you don't have, let's say, a Brundi-Kowski inequality that is for optimal transport on sub-manifolds. Because, I mean, this identity is not true in general. But, I mean, in our situation here, I mean, we are on a hypersurface, and the good or the positive. The good or the positive thing that happens now is this additional term because we are on a null hypersurface, it vanishes. So we can move the derivative out of the trace. And we then first define this yxt, that is the determinant of A here. And so just to put that into context, this determinant of A really tells you how the volume is distorted along our transports. Is distorted along our transport. So, this is really the object we are interested in. And for this determinant, we get now the following ODE. This comes from tracing this optical equation. We get this ODE, where we can now apply two more inequalities. The first null energy condition here. And here we can apply a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality because, I mean, this UN. Quality because I mean this ux here is a self. I mean, that so the ux actually goes here, but after projecting it back to the to the tension space of S T, it's a self-adjoint operator. Doubt it's self-adjoint, but I think rather it's a product of a self-adjoint operator and a symmetric operator. And that's it for this. Okay. Okay, we can talk about it then. Yeah, anyway, so I mean I want to apply this inequality here and then we get this ODE for the Y here, which tells us how the volume distortion changes along our transport. And so this is which, and you see this is essentially convexity of this. Essentially, convexity of this function here in T, which is at the core of this entropy convexity. And so what is left is some standard calculation which I will not show you. Okay. So this is precisely as in the remaining case? Yeah. So from here it's precisely in the remaining case. Yeah. Okay. Um yeah, so I don't show you the other direction, so um but let me come to some some extensions of the theorem. So what we what we can also do is instead of we can now also consider weighted space-times. So we can look at a C2 weight or a C2 function and we Or is it two function? And we instead of the instead of the standard Lorentzian reference measure, we can multiply it with this weight here. And with this, we also can define a corresponding Backre-Emery null energy condition, which is analogy to the Bakri-Emory condition. To the Bachelor-Emory condition in Riemannian geometry, for instance. And so it looks like this here. And with this Bachelor-Emory null energy condition, we essentially can do the same steps in the proof that you just saw. And we also can characterize this year in terms of entropy, convexity, and we get the same results. So the Bachelor-Emory condition and null energy condition holds if and only if. If and only if for every pair of measures that are R-cause and non-connected, this N-rini entropy here is convex along the corresponding interpolation, where the reference measure is now not wall h, but wall h times this density here. Okay, so now it's so this is all experiments, and now let me finish. And now let me finish with some consequences which addresses some of the questions that I mentioned in the beginning. So we have now this characterization. So in a priori, I mean, this is, it doesn't look very robust because we need to have this notion of null hypersurface and everything. So therefore, it doesn't look like it's very. look like it's very maybe it's not very suitable for a for a very for this most general synthetic framework and I don't know but what we can do is I mean it is very robust in in in this in the choice of this of in the of this density here so the density before you saw was C2 but using this characterization now we can make the following definition so Make the following definition. So, such a weighted space-time where V is just C0, for instance, satisfies the synthetic null energy condition. If and only if, for every pair of measures, mu0, mu1 that are arc also are not connected, we have this convexity here. So this now makes perfect sense. And so, this is the synthetic version that I propose and we also have And we also can try to check the points that I showed you before. So I mean, so it's consistent with the smooth case, so this is what we just saw. Then we also can prove non-trivial consequences. So what we get from this here is, so we can prove a Hawking area monotonicity and a Hawking area monotonicity theorem and also a Penro singularity theorem. Starting from this definition here with the Starting from this definition here with this zero weights. And finally, also the stability, I think, is now true in the following sense. So stability is true in the sense that we can now change this weight here. I mean, let's say in a uniform, if we change the weight, let's say in a uniform way, then this condition is stable. Stable. And you may think, okay, this is maybe a little bit cheating because we don't change the underlying space-time. But I just want to say that the way how stability is formulated for Lorentzian length spaces is exactly in this way. So we fix an underlying space-time and we just vary the measure. And this is also the way how I see stability here. So, and therefore, it's also. Also, but also are the hypersurface ages fixed. Yeah, they don't change. They're not very variable. No, or this I don't know. I mean, like I said, for this one needs to introduce a more, yeah, let's say a robust way or robust definition of null hypersurfaces. It also works for post-Lorentzian length spaces. But again, I mean, this. But again, I mean this stability that was proved for the strong energy condition, it also doesn't change the underlying space-time. It only changes the measure. So in this way, the theorem here or the stability is not worse. Okay, and yeah, this is all what I want to tell you. Thanks.
