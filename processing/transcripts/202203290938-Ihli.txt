Um just one. So everyone, our second talk for the public rate will be given by Olva Eli from University of Illinois, my student, graduated. He will speak about generation and generosity. The book of Appleomorphisms of the Republic. All right, thank you. Thank you to everyone for being here. Thank you to the organizers. Everyone, for being here. Thank you to the organizers for the invitation. Um, it's great to be here in the lovely Rocky Mountains. Um, sorry, I couldn't be here. Uh, everyone says it's beautiful, but I'm from the plain, so I get vertigo just looking at it. Um, yeah, so we're going to look at this group of homeomorphisms. So, let's start by setting up our setting. Uh, everyone can see my slides okay? Yes, I guess. All right. Excellent. Excellent. So, our setting is Polish groups, right? These are the topological groups whose topologies also make them Polish spaces, which you've heard Swave talk about at length yesterday. Okay, and I'm interested in specific Polish groups, which is fun because as a logician, it gives me an excuse to look at other areas. So, the group that I'm going to be looking at, or one of the groups I'm going to be looking at, is I'm going to call it H. This is a group of increasing homeomorphisms. This is a group of increasing homeomorphisms of the interval 0, 1 with its usual topology. And I give this group the uniform convergence topology. So sequence converges if and only if it converges uniformly. Okay, this is usually written homeo plus, but that's a mouthful, so I just write H plus. And this is for topological group. All the group operations are, the group operation is composition, and this is continuous. Is composition, and this is continuous with respect to this topology. But I'm not going to be focusing on H. I'm going to be focusing on a certain subgroup of H, a few subgroups of H plus, but focusing on one in particular. Which one in particular? Well, I have to review absolute continuity. You will probably see this in your first semester course on measure theory. Right, so anytime I say something measure theoretic, So anytime I say something measure theoretic, if I don't explicitly say what the measure is, you can think of it as the Bayes measure on 01. Right, so a function is absolutely continuous if. Now I'm going to define it here, but just be aware that I'm not actually going to be using the definition. I'm going to be using an equivalent characterization that I will state later. Okay, so a function is absolutely continuous if for every epsilon there's a delta. So that anytime you can So, that anytime you can take a finite sequence of pairwise disjoint intervals in 0, 1, as long as the length of those intervals add up to less than delta, then the sort of finitary variation, if you will, the images of the endpoints, if you add them all up, they're no less than epsilon apart in magnitude. Okay, clearly, this is more general than uniform. More general than uniform continuity because uniform continuity is the same thing where there's only one interval rather than an arbitrary finite collection of them. Okay. More precisely, this falls in between Lipschitz continuity and bounded variation. Every Lipschitz continuous function is absolutely continuous. Absolutely continuous is kind of a mouthful, especially for a 30-minute talk. So I'm just going to say AC sometimes. If I say AC, it means absolutely continuous, not air conditioning. Air conditioning. And every AC function has bounded variation. Okay, so it's sort of this intermediate regularity condition on the function. Okay. And the canonical example or rather non-example of a non-AC function is the Cantor staircase or sometimes called the devil's staircase. It's a sort of jagged looking function here. And how do you define it? You take the measure mu. Take the measure of the interval 0 to x, where Î¼ is not the Lebesgue measure lambda, right? This is the coin flip measure, quote unquote, on the Cantor set. Okay, this is the measure on the Cantor set where each time you take a path, you cut the measure in half. So the measure of the whole thing is one. Each half of the Cantor set. Each half of the canner set is measure a half. Each time you go to a half, each quarter is measure a quarter, and so on. This is the measure you use when you're flipping a fair coin a bunch of times. Where if your heads, you go left on the counter set, and if your tails, you go right. Okay. So this is your famous non-AC function. Okay. But like I said, I never use a definition because it's cumbersome for my purposes. My purposes, I always use this characterization of absolutely continuous functions. So a function on zero, one is a c if and only if property two, it's differentiable almost everywhere. Its derivative exists at almost every point. Moreover, that almost everywhere-defined function is an L1. So the derivative is an L1 function. And three, you can use that L1 derivative to recover the original function by just integrating. Recover the original function by just integrating it. Okay, this is the fundamental theorem of calculus in suitably general form. Okay, I will say that being differentiable almost everywhere and having L1 derivative, this is automatic if f is monotone. Okay, this is just because monotone functions are very nice and not that deep. Not that deep. So, in particular, if you're looking at homeomorphisms of 0, 1, they satisfy this condition. So, if you have a homeomorphism and you want to show it's absolutely continuous, it's enough to just check this fundamental theorem of calculus condition. Quite nice. And this is equivalent to property three, where there exists a map G that does this. Okay, so if you have a map F and you want to show it's A C, it's enough to just find this G, you don't have to go through show. Find this g. You don't have to go through showing f is differentiable. You'll get that for free once you find g, because then f is the derivative of f equals g almost everywhere. So convenient, quite convenient. Okay. And so I want to look at the homeomorphisms which are absolutely continuous. And I define H plus AC to be that subgroup. It's a subgroup consisting of maps which are AC and whose inverse is AC. And whose inverse is AC? You have to require both of them. This is unavoidable, unfortunately. You can massage the devil staircase function that I showed two slides ago to get an example of a function which is not AC, but its inverse is. So, unfortunately, to get a subgroup, we actually have to require both f and f inverse to be AC. But once you've done that, then you have a subgroup, and the subgroup to plus Then you have a subgroup, and the subgroup top the subspace topology you inherit from H does not make this a Polish group, unfortunately. So we have to look at a different metric to put on this group. What metric will we put on this group? Well, the derivatives are L1, so just measure the difference in L1 of their derivatives. If f and g are homeomorphisms, they have to fix, for example, zero, they have to fix the left endpoint. So it's enough to just look at their derivatives. And if their derivatives are closed, then we say these functions are close. These functions are close. Okay. And so we just give H plus AC the topology it inherits from this isometric embedding into L1. Each such map is actually has L1 norm one because by absolute continuity, the norm of the derivative is just the difference between the endpoints, which because it's a homeomorphism is just f of one minus f of zero, which is one. And this topology does actually make H plus AC a Polish group. Does actually make H plus AC a Polish group. Okay, this was Dudaslavic from the 90s. He uses this group, introduces it, shows it's a Polish topology as a tool to show that the relation of measure equivalence, if you have a space of measures on, say, 0, 1, and you want to say that two measures on 0, 1 are equivalent, for all measures, if and only if they have the same null sets, this equivalence relation. This equivalence relation is not what's called classifiable by countable structures. You remember Matt Foreman's talk yesterday, he touches on this sort of idea. So you can use H plus A C to give a nice proof of this. It was proven earlier for a smaller class of spaces by Kekris and Sophronitis, if I remember correctly. So that's why people care about this group. And the topology is finer than the. And the topology is finer than the uniform convergence topology. If a sequence converges in this group, then it converges uniformly, but not necessarily the other way around. All right, so how does this play into the bigger picture? So we've imposed absolute continuity, a regularity condition, to get a nice subgroup of H. It is not the only regularity condition we could have chosen. So I'm going to fill in a diagram here. It's going to look silly. Diagram here. It's going to look silly early on, but as we go on, we will fill it in with more and more information. So we have H over here on the left, this is the biggest sort of parent group that everyone lives in. And we could have chosen continuous differentiability as our regularity condition. And this gives us the C1 diffeomorphisms of 0, 1 of continuously differentiable maps, whose inverse is also continuously differentiable. And you can keep going with all. And you can keep going with all the smoothness, the regularity conditions to get the C2 diffeomorphisms, you get the CK diffeomorphism groups for all K. This eventually ends in the infinite, the smooth diffeomorphisms, which is also a Polish group, but I didn't specifically chose not to include it on this diagram for a reason I will explain later. Okay. Now, Swavek showed that if we're interested in Polish groups, we can In Polish groups, we can go in between by this H AC group. Okay, this sort of intermediate between the C1 bifeomorphism group and the homeomorphism group. And similarly, a paper by Mike Cohen from 2020 showed that we can also, in between every CK diffeomorphism group and CK plus one diffeomorphism group, or I say DK and DK plus one, then we can Then we can get a dk plus ac. This is the, we'll define it for if one, and you can see the pattern for all of them. This is the set of all f in d1 whose derivative is not just continuous, but actually absolutely continuous. Okay. This has a nice Polish topology you can put on it, which makes this a Polish group. Polish group. And so this is a nice intermediary step between all of the CK smoothness conditions. Interestingly, in this paper, I refer you to it for more details on this, but if you take one plus bounded variation, one plus BV, where you say all maps whose derivative has bounded variation, that does not give you a Polish group. It gives you a subgroup, but its algebraic structure is such that Group, but its algebraic structure is such that no polish topology, Polish topology on this group can make it a topological group, which is sort of surprising. Same for Lipschitz continuity and same for Holder continuity. They do not give you a Polish group if you restrict them in this way, but absolute continuity is the nice one that gives you Polish group equalities, which is sort of surprising in its own right, in my opinion. Okay. Right, in my opinion. Okay. Right. And one thing I want to note is that each of these arrows is continuous, so the topologies get finer, but the image of each arrow is dense. So each subgroup is dense in the one above it. Okay. And these two facts have nice consequences that we will see later on. Okay. Any questions so far? Okay, by the way, I have the chat open here, so if anyone on Zoom has a question, I can see it there too. All right. So I want to start with one of the G words in the title of my talk, generation. Now, Polish groups have cardinality continuum generally. There's countable discrete groups are technically Polish, but they're the sort of nodding. But they're the sort of not interesting cases. We're usually interested in continuum Polish groups. So they can't be finitely generated. But the next best thing is that you can have a finitely generated dense subgroup, right? These are separable groups, so they can have countless dense subsets. And so it's natural to talk about dense finitely generated subgroups. And that's the direction we move in here. So we say a Polish group is topologically n-generated for a natural number, although you can also take this to be Camilla generated. Kamala generated, if it emits a dense n-generated subgroup. Equivalently, sort of rephrasing it a little bit, if you look at this set omega sub n of the set of all n tuples that generate a dense subgroup, if this set is non-empty. Now, phrasing it like this sounds kind of strange a priori, but what if this omega n is not just non-empty, but what if it's sort of big? What if there's a lot of n-tuples that generate a dense subgroup? Tuples that generate a dense subgroup. And that's what the next stronger property is. We say it's generically topologically n-generated, or just generically n-generated, because throwing in the extra word topologically is mouthful. If the set omega n is sort of as big as it can be, you can show that it's a G-delta set by unraveling the definition. So we say it's generically n-generated if it's dense G delta. So if it's co-meter in the product. In the product topology on G to the N. Okay, now G is typically Polish groups are not locally compact, at least the interesting ones typically aren't, at least interesting from my perspective. So we do not have Harr measure as a way to talk about the size of subsets. We can sort of talk about Harr measure zero through some other complicated methods I won't get into. But usually, the topological notions of big and small subsets through co-meager, meager, bare category type of arguments is usually the right way to talk about this. And so we have a notion of finitely generated subsets in a more general sense. So we have a notion of rank. So the topological rank is the least n for which you're topologically n generated. It's the smallest number of generators. It's the smallest number of generators that generate a denser group. Similarly for generic rank, generic topological rank, but again, we just, or I just say generic rank for brevity. Okay, and so I introduced these Polish groups and I introduced this rank. So where does rank fall onto this diagram here? Now, remember before I said each of these arrows is continuous, which means the topologies get means the topologies get finer and finer as you move to the right, and each one is dense than the one before it. Those two facts together give you that topological rank is non-decreasing as you move to the right. Okay, so if you show that this is topological rank seven, for example, that tells you that the topological rank of all these guys is no more than seven. So it gives you upper bounds or lower bounds if you go in the other direction. Okay. Same with generic rank. Okay, same with generic rank. And also, generic rank is always greater than or equal to the topological rank, simply because Kohmiger sets are never empty. Okay. So first of all, what's the topological rank of, say, the guy on the left? It's two. There are a number of ways of seeing this. Sort of the famous example is Thompson's Group F. If you don't know what Thompson's group F is, it's this sort of Know what Thompson's group F is. It's this sort of famous common canonical counterexample to a lot of group theoretic conjectures that group theorists have come up with. And famously, it embeds as a dense subgroup of H plus. You can phrase it in terms of piecewise linear homeomorphisms with certain properties about where the breakpoints are and so on. So the topological rank of this guy is two. It can't be one because every cyclic subgroup of H plus. Cyclic subgroup of H is discrete, but the next best case is two, and in fact it is two generated topologically. But something stronger is true. Azar Akhmedov and Mike Cohen in 2019 showed that, moreover, it's generically two-generated. Not only does there exist a pair that generates a dense subgroup, but almost every pair does, almost every in this topological pair category sense. Okay. In the same paper, In the same paper, they also show that the blue number, the topological rank of D1, is finite. Before it was not even known to be finite, because it's possible that you do not admit any finitely generated dense subgroups. Here it is, they do show that it's finite. They get 10 generators, a 10-generated dense subgroup. They say this number is almost certainly not sharp. Someone can probably get lower, but they. Can probably get lower, but they came up with 10 as an upper bound, which is a lot better than not knowing if it's finite at all. And then, using, and this is the same paper, by the way, between these two results. And later, Azer uses similar methods to get that all of the diff k groups, the dk groups, have finite upper bounds for the blue numbers. In particular, diff In particular, diff k plus is bounded above by 3k plus 7. This is, by the way, why I specifically chose not to include a diff infinity, because for diff infinity, it's unknown, unfortunately, or at least not known to me because it's not Yeah, it's not mentioned in this paper of Azer's, which, according to his website, is still in preparation. And also, remember, I said that topological rank is non-decreasing as you move to the right. So this gives us all upper bounds for the groups in the middle, these K plus AC groups. Okay. And also H plus AC gives us an upper bound of 10 for that one as well, simply because it has D1. All right. Unfortunately, for diff1 and up, it's unknown what the generic topological rank is. It could be infinite for all we know, which is unfortunate. But we do know for H plus AC, it's two. The red number is two for H plus AC. And because the blue number has to be less than or equal to, because the blue number is sandwiched between this number and this red number here, that forces the blue number to be two as well. That forces the blue number B2 as well. But as sort of a strong property, we have that almost every pair of elements in H A C generates a dense subgroup. I'm going to change topics slightly here. So if there are any questions about this, now would be a good time. Okay. So now I want to talk about the other G word, genericity. Genericity, and there are a lot of gen words in the title of my talk. So, I want to talk about generic elements. So, following a convention of John Truss, an element of a Polish group is generic if its conjugacy class is co-meger, if it's dense G delta. In particular, this is equivalent to saying its orbit under the conjugacy action is dense G delta. Okay. So, if such elements exist, we say that they're generic. And so, a Polish group may or may not have generic elements. So, we're often interested in when they do. Now, H plus is known to admit generic elements. This is a theorem that Greg Yorth says is folklore, and I take his word for this. So, the homeomorphism group does have. The homeomorphism group does have a dense G-delta conjugacy class. Moreover, more precisely, I can tell you exactly what the generic elements are. We have some properties about the map that say, if you have these properties, then yes, you're generic. Your conscious C class is the dense G delta one. And if you don't have these properties, then you're not. Okay. In particular, F is generic if and only if. If and only if property one, if you look at the set of fixed points of the map, just the set of all x in the interval, which are fixed by f, which I denote by fix of f here. And you look at its complement. Its complement is a collection of open intervals, right? And they're sort of naturally ordered, just because 0, 1 is naturally ordered. Okay. When you look at all of these intervals, they form a dense linear order without any. They form a dense linear order without endpoints. What that means is there's no maximum as you move to one, and there's no minimum as you move to zero. And it also means that for any two intervals, there is at least one interval in between them. As an ordered set, as a linear order, this also means it's isomorphic to the rationals, if you prefer. This is equivalent to saying, actually, that fix of f That fix of f is homeomorphic to Cantor set. You can say is a Cantor set. It has no isolated points. It's uncountable. Of course, it's compact. And it's nowhere dense as a subset of zero. Property two, not only are these intervals form a dense linear order, Form a dense linear order, but if you look at the intervals of positive parity, that's a dense subset of this order. And same with the orbitals of negative parity. And I have to define what positive and negative parity are. Okay, so say you've got your 0, 1 here, and this is the diagonal, the line y equals x. And say I've got a homeomorphism like this. Okay. I have a fixed point here, a fixed point here, sort of two fixed points here, here. I have an interval of fixed points here, and then the last one over here. Now I color an interval blue if its bump is above the diagonal, and I color it red if it's below. So this one's blue, this one's blue, this one's blue, this one's blue, this one's red, this one's red. It okay, and so that's all that means. So, any time you have two intervals, there's a red one in between the two distinct intervals and a blue one in between two intervals. It says I'm out of time, but I did start 10 minutes late. So, is this fine? No, I guess I need okay. Um, right, so All right, so the last result here is that HAC does admit generic elements. So it has a Kohmeger conjugacy class. And moreover, this is not true of every Polish group with this property. I can tell you exactly what the generic elements look like. Okay? So F is generic if and only if property one and two are exactly the same as they were for two slides ago. They're exactly the same as for H plus. same as for H plus. But also there's a third property that you have to restrict to, which is that the set of fixed points is a Lebesgue null set. In H plus, for this guy here, it's possible that your set of fixed points is a cantor set, but maybe it's a fat canter set. Maybe it has positive measure. For the generic elements of H plus A C, that's not the case, right? Your set of fixed points. That's not the case, right? Your set of fixed points has to be lobignal. Okay, and if you have two maps which satisfy all three of these, then they must be conjugate as well. Okay, so where do generic elements fit in on our diagram here? I've put these citations in these fancy colored boxes here to denote where they come from. Okay, remember this two here is because of Thompson's group F, this lesson 13 will Thompson's group F, this lesson 13, less than 16 here come from the upper bounds to their right. Okay. Now generic elements for H plus and H plus A C. The answer is yes. It's folklore for H plus and for mine is H plus A C. All these other guys do not have generic elements. Okay, this is simply because if you take F in any of these groups and match In any of these groups, and map it to the log of the derivative at zero, for example. This is a continuous conjugacy invariant function to the reals. So if it had not just a generic element, but if it had a dense conjugacy class, then this function would have to be continuous, or sorry, constant. It is continuous and it's conjugacy invariant. So if And it's conjugacy invariant. So, if there was a dense conjugacy class in, say, for example, this diff k group, then this map would have to be constant, and we know it's not because you can find maps with different values of this. And so that's actually my last slide. So I'm done. Thank you for your attention. Thank you very much, Napoleon. Any questions? I do see one in the chat that I can address right now. Which of these results can be extended to homeomorphisms of the circle? So I know, for example, this paper by Mike Cohen from 2020 that introduced the STIFF1 plus AC group. One plus AC group. This is he also mentions for the circle results there. So that would be a good place to start. I know, for example, that the group of homeomorphisms of the circle does not have generic elements because you look at the rotation number and any map with a, and this is conjugacy invariant, and the set of maps with any rational rotation number. With any rational rotation number is open, if I'm not mistaken. Don't quote me on this, but I believe it's something like this. So you can't have a dense conjugacy class in that case. But yes, this is something that people have looked at. Other questions? Yeah, so I wanted to ask you what did you look at what happens? Maybe it does not make sense, but if you replace L1 by Lp for P greater than one? Say that again? So you just replace this L1 condition by LP for some P greater than one. So in the definition of H plus A C here, H plus A C here right here. Let's see, I'm not sure the extent to which you would get something. Something different because for all of these maps, F, your monotone, so your derivative is automatically L1. Let's see, is it Really email too, for example. Always know, right? But then you can ask for the space of whether the results still hold for the same definition with LB spaces instead of one space. Or you could even look at the intersection of all this pathological angle. Yeah, there might be something there if you if you get a different subgroup. Yeah, I'll admit I've not looked at the relationship between. A relationship between this absolute, this characterization of absolute continuity in terms of having L1 derivative and maybe changing that to LP. But there's a traditional, you know, just take those for which the derivative is in LP. Right. We just have to see in your proof whether you can replace it just with an LP norm and everything else works. Yeah, that would be interesting to look at. Thank you. Any other questions? Audience, right? Well, let's thank the voter again and we resume at the schedule at the end.
