Thank you, and thank you very much for the opportunity to speak today. Right, so my talk is about the high degree cohomology of the special linear groups of a number ring. And it is related to both of the previous talks with Patston Miller. Uh, Patston Miller. I'll be discussing work that is joint with Brooke, Coopers, Miller, Pat, Sroka, and Yasaki. And to begin, I want to fix some notation. So throughout the talk, n is going to be an integer, which in fact it will range for the integers to and above. F is a number field. A number field, so I mean a finite field extension of the rational numbers, and R is going to be the ring of integers in F. And so in case there are any other topologists in the audience, I've given a few examples of rings of integers. We should have in mind rings like the integers, like the Gaussian integers, like the Eisenstein integers, through all examples in quadratic number fields. And the question. And the question that we're interested in is understanding the rational cohomology of the special linear group with entries in R. Okay, so this is review for those of you who are in the previous two talks. But a reminder that, first of all, the virtual co-homological dimension of these groups is known due to Borel and Sarah. It depends on the number. It depends on the number of real and the number of complex embeddings of the field F. There's a formula here, but notably this VCD is quadratic in N. And so if we look at this graph here of the cohomology of SLNR, the rational cohomology, well, first. Well, first of all, it follows from the definition of VCD that it's going to be zero for values above the V C D. And as Jeremy discussed in his talk, it's a result of Borel that we have homological stability. And so when values of n are large relative to the co-homological degree Q, we have stability. Degree q, we have a stability. So that the cohomology is known in this lower triangle of this graph. And what we're specifically interested in in this program is the cohomology close to the virtual cohomological dimension. So today I'm going to focus on trying to understand the cohomology of these groups in this range. In this range. Okay. Great. So our goal is to understand these cohomology groups when Q is close to the VCD. And the motivating question, I think this is an intrinsically interesting question, is what is the largest degree? Degree Q such that these groups are non-vanishing. All right, so this question is broadly open. And a related question is: how does this answer depend on ring theoretic properties of? Ring theoretic properties of R. Okay. So Jeremy mentioned in his talk this morning conjectures of Church Far Putman. Church far Putman. In the case when R is the integers, they conjectured that if we look at the rational cohomology of SLNZ I degrees below the VCD, so I'll call this the codimension I cohomology, they conjecture that this is going to vanish once. Once n is large enough. Okay. And so again, some motivation for this program. What we'd, well, one thing I'm very interested in is whether this conjecture is true, and then to what extent we can expect this conjecture to hold or fail if we were to replace Z with a different number ring. So let me go on. Let's go on to slide number two and look at the results that are currently known. So the first result is if we focus on the codimension zero case, so right now we're looking at the Zero case, so right now we're looking at the cohomology of SLNR in its VCD. It's a theorem of Lee and Sherba in the case that R is Euclidean that these groups, whoops, these groups vanish. So, if we look at a Euclidean ring R, and I look in degree equal to the VCD. So it's maybe worth mentioning that from the definition of the VCD, it implies that there is some possibly twisted system of coefficients where this group is non-zero, but knowing in the V. Uh, but knowing in the VCD, if we look at the cohomology with trivial rational coefficients, it may or may not vanish. And in this case, we see when R is a Euclidean ring, in fact, these groups are zero. Okay, so the next result I want to look at is due to Church, Farb, and Putman. If we look at rings that are not PIDs, then they showed Then they showed, in contrast, that these groups, these cohomology groups, are non-vanishing in the VCD. So in fact, they showed they put a lower bound on the rational dimension of these groups as a function of the class number of R. Okay. So, these two results leave open the question of what happens if R is not Euclidean, but not a PID. Okay. And according to Weinberger, if you believe the generalized Riemann hypothesis, then in that case, there are actually only four rings to worry about. That in that case, all of the rings are the rings of integers. Are the rings of integers in one of the following four quadratic number fields? Okay. And in work with Miller, Pat, and Yasaki, we gave a partial answer to this question, which is that if we take one of these three number rings, then we have a non-vanishing result. These groups are not equal to zero. Notably, here, this result is for even values of n. And this case remains open in the case when d is negative 19 and for in all cases when n is odd. Okay. So that is the co-dimension zero case. In codimension one, so now we're looking at degree one below the VCD. Church and Putman proved a vanishing result when r is the integers. So they proved this is the co-dimension one case of the Churchford-Putman conjectures. And in work joint with Coopers, Miller, and Putz, we also showed a vanishing result in the case of the Gaussian integers and the Eisenstein integers. So these are two other. In the Eisenstein integer. So these are two other examples of Euclidean rings. All right. So this raises the question of whether we in fact get vanishing in codimension one for all Euclidean rings. This question is open. This question is open. And in fact, the methods we used to prove this result involved calculating a certain presentation for the Steinberg module, which provably does not hold for all Euclidean rings. And so not only is the question open for other Euclidean rings, but genuinely new ideas are needed to approach that question. That question. Great. And what I will talk about by the end of this talk is the case of codimension two, so two degrees below the V C D, where we have made some progress. That's later. Okay. I am now going to advance to slide number three. Okay. Okay. Okay, so this is again a review for anybody who was here for the last couple of talks, but a reminder that these special linear groups satisfy virtual BRE-Ekman duality. They satisfy this twisted version of Poincar√© duality, which means, which means the following that That the codimension I cohomology of SLNR with rational coefficients, these groups are isomorphic to the degree I homology of the groups with coefficients in the following. In the following twisted coefficient module. So it's in coefficients in the Steinberg module tensored with the rational numbers. So right again, this group here, this is called the dualizing module. It's the Steinberg module, which is defined in terms of the T-building associated to. Associated to the number field F. Okay, let me review that. So the Tietz building, we'll recall from Peter and Jeremy's talks, the Tietz building is a simplicial complex where the vertices correspond to non-zero proper subspaces of Fn and a tuple of vertices span a simplex. span a simplex if they form a flag. So the P simplicies correspond to flags of length p plus one. It is a theorem of Solomon and Teeth that this Teeth building is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres in dimension n minus two. And so relevantly this simple This simplicial complex has only one non-vanishing reduced homology group. And by definition, that group is the Steinberg module. Definition, this is the reduced homology and degree n minus two. n minus 2 of the TEATS building. Okay. Great. So we said our goal was to understand the high degree cohomology of these special linear groups, which by this duality result is equivalent to the question of understanding the low-degree homology of the special linear group. Of the special linear group with these twisted coefficients. Okay. And right, the upshot is that one way that we could compute these groups is as follows. What we need to do is take a resolution of our rationalized Steinberg module by flat QSLNR modules. Here's our resolution. Here's our resolution. Take SLNR coinvariance, where by coinvariance, here's a reminder that by coinvariance, I mean we mod out by the action of the group, the largest quotient where the group acts trivially. Okay, and then we take homology of the resulting complex, and that will give us these homology groups that we're interested in. Great. Okay, I'm going to advance now to slide number four. Great. So the upshot is that I can restate our goal. The goal of this program as follows. We want to compute a flat resolution of the Steinberg module that is. The Steinberg module that is somehow small enough that it's possible for us to compute these SLNR coinvariants. And in particular, if we're interested in conjectures like the Churchford-Puntman conjecture, we want to know if these coinvariants, or rather, it would be enough to show that these coinvariants vanish to prove vanishing of the corresponding homology groups. Okay. And the general strategy is going to be to. The general strategy is going to be to construct simplicial complexes related to the Teets building with appropriate homology. Oh, I've misstated this here. So it's to construct associated simplicial complexes that are appropriately highly connected and then compute subcomplexes in such a way that we'll be able to use the relative chain groups. Be able to use the relative chain groups to construct a resolution of the Steinberg module. And I'll say this in detail, what I mean in just a minute. Maybe I'll pause and comment. Back in July, I gave a talk at the Cogent seminar, and I know I see there's some overlap in the audience between this talk and that talk. So in that talk, I spoke about the same program, but focused on the question of what it means. The question of what it means for a resolution to be small enough to be able to compute coinvariance. And the slogan, I think, from that talk is that if I have an SLNR representation and I want to be able to compute its coinvariance, then, right, the slogan is that this is possible to do if my representation. To do if my representation somehow comes from, is generated by things that look like bases for r to the n. And it's generally not possible to compute the coin variance if instead it comes from generators that look like bases for f to the n. Okay, so maybe I'll leave that comment there and just say that that was. Say that that was July's talk. In this talk, I'm going to switch gears a bit and instead say more about what we can do to actually construct these flat resolutions of our Steinberg module. Okay, so here is the strategy. I want to start by taking a Taking a simplicial complex k sub n that is ideally contractible, but at least highly connected, by which I mean I want its homotopy groups to vanish in a range. Okay, and then I want to find subcomplexes L sub n of K sub n with the property that, well, I want L sub n to agree on n minus two skeletons. Okay. Okay, and I want the homology of El Ced to agree with the homology of my teeth building, at least in a range, an appropriate range for an appropriate range of values of i. And then we can use Then we can use the relative chains to construct a resolution of the Steinberg module. All right, and this follows just formally. So we observe that from the long exact sequence of a pair, from the long exact sequence of a pair, our relative homology groups. Homology groups are going to be isomorphic to the reduced homology groups of the subcomplex L sub n. And those, at least in a range, will be isomorphic to the homology of the Teets building. Okay. So then this assumption that my complexes agree on n minus two skeletons is going to give me exactness of this sequence right here. And because the homology of this chain complex, well, is equal to the homology of the subcomplex Ln, which is. Subcomplex Ln, which is equal to the homology of this wedge of spheres, then at least in the range where these isomorphisms hold, the Solomon-Tietz theorem is going to give me exactness of this resolution here. This resolution here. And then finally, we have these isomorphisms here. So, this n minus one degree homology, relative homology group, is going to be isomorphic to my Steinberg module. Okay, so this construction in general gives us a method of computing a resolution of the Steinberg module. All right, and now I'm going to advance to slide number five. Okay, so this strategy was carried out in 1976 by Lee and Sharba when they constructed the Sharbley resolution of the Steinberg module. So, in that case, the vertices of this complex case of n were unique. were unimodular unimodular vectors V in Rn, okay, by which I mean vectors whose span is saturated, species for lines in Rn okay, and the simplicies in k sub n were just all subsets, so case of n is contractive. So, k sub n is contractible in this case. And the subcomplex L sub n was defined by taking all vertices and taking those simplices where the collection of vectors of unimodular vectors v0 through vp if these vectors If these vectors all lie in a proper direct sum and Okay, and then right as we discussed on the previous slide, we then get a resolution of the Seinberg module from these chain groups. I guess I would. Groups, I guess I will leave it as an exercise, not totally trivial exercise, to vary that, to verify that these complexes, L sub N have homology that agrees with the Steinberg module, with the Teets building. Great. And having done that exercise, right, we get a resolution of the Steinberg module where the terms in our resolution are the free abelian groups on Q plus N plus one tuples of span. Tuples of spanning unimodular vectors for Rn. So unfortunately, though, this resolution is somehow too big to compute coinvariance. For higher terms. And so that brings us to the next point in the story where we want to talk about how we can use the same strategy to compute somehow smaller resolutions, at least in the case when r is the integers. And to that end, I want to first. And to that end, I want to first define the complex of partial frames for Z to the n. So this is a complex where the vertices, the vertices correspond to lines in Z to the n. Though actually I want, I'm going to write my vertices as vectors. So, in fact, I would prefer to think of the vertices as being vectors up to an equivalence relation. They're equivalent under multiplication by units. Okay, and the simplicies in this space correspond to subsets of ACs. Aces for Z to the end. So, right again, this collection of vectors form a simplex if they can be extended to a basis. That's the complex of partial frames. I'm going to advance to slide number six. So Church and Putman in 2016 gave a proof of the Vykovsky presentation for the Steinberg module, again, using this general strategy of taking the highly connected complex K and the subcomplex L. Their highly connected complex K is the complex BA of B A of augmented partial frames for Z to the N. So this complex is defined by first of all taking the complex of partial frames and then adding in some extra higher dimensional simplices. Specifically, we're going to add in simplices of the form V1 plus V2 V1. V1 plus V2, V1 up to Vn where, oh, I'm sorry, I should make this a P where this is a partial thesis. Okay, so in other words, I'm adding in new simplicies where I allow a very particular form of linear dependency between. Of linear dependency between the vectors. This is the complex of augmented partial bases. So let's look at the example when n equals 2, an example taken from the introduction of Church and Puntman. So in this case, I can think of, I can identify a line in Z two with a line of zero. To with a fraction, maybe even a fraction in reduced terms. Okay, and so in this case, the complex of partial frames is exactly the so-called fairy graph that's drawn below. So, under this identification, I have all my lines. My lines drawn around the boundary of this picture. And there's a one simplex between two of the lines exactly when the numbers, there's a simplex from A over B, a line, sorry, an edge from A over B to C over D, exactly when A, B, C, D have unit determinant. This gives me the fairy graph. And so this complex. And so, this complex, this augmented complex, BA2, is exactly the two-dimensional complex that I obtain by gluing in the obvious missing triangles in this picture. So, it's the complex I get by filling in each of these triangles and And what I get is a two-disk. The complex in this case is contractible. Though for higher n, it is not contractible in general. Okay, so there we go. So what have we done? We've glued in more cells to our complex of partial frames in such a way that we've improved the connectivity of the complex. And now, in this case, we're going to define the subcomplex L sub n to be consisting of those simplices where the vectors span a proper sum and of Z V N. Of Zvn. Okay. And then, right from this, just for formal reasons, we get our resolution of the Steinberg module. And in this case, we really do need to tensor with Q in order to get a flat resolution. So, right, we only get this partial resolution. We only get a few steps of this resolution. We only get a few steps of this resolution since we only have an identification of the well, right? Two reasons. One is in general, the connectivity of BAN is not contractible in general. And secondly, we only get an identification between the homology of LN and the TEAPS building in a range. And so, for those reasons, we only get these steps in, we only get a Get a two-step resolution. We only get a presentation for the Steinberg module. But it's a presentation where now my chain groups somehow come from, again, bases and augmented bases for Z to the N. And it is really quite a simple exercise to verify that the coin variants vanish. Variants vanish. So, this is the presentation that Church and Putman used to prove that the cohomology of SLNZ vanishes in co-dimension one. Okay. Great. All right, so this is the co-dimension one step of One step of the church fire pumping conjectures, and it follows from this setup. Okay, so I'm now going to advance to slide number seven. And so I at last have gotten to the work in progress with. In progress with Brooke Miller, Pat Sroka, and myself on, well, the first thing we're attempting to do is to prove the codimension two case of the Church-Farbuttman conjectures for the integers. And I think Jeremy claimed that this was done. So maybe we've done it already. I guess it depends how confident we are in our. How confident we are in our work so far. I think it's looking good. I'm not confident in work that's been published of mine, so equally confident. Equally confident. That's the spirit. All right. Okay, so great. So we are going to repeat the strategy of constructing this highly connected. Constructing this highly connected complex k sub n and the subcomplex L sub n that we'd like to identify, identify its homology and arrange with that of the Tij building. Okay, and so to extend this resolution, we need to add even more simplicies to our complex of partial frames to increase the connectivity of this complex even more. And so we have, I guess, slightly tongue-in-cheek named the complex BAA for augmented simplices, augmented augmented frames. What we do is we take the complex BA of augmented frames and we introduce two new types of simplicies. We're now going to add simplices of the following form. Of the following form, prints, add simplicies of the form V1 plus V2, V2 plus V3, V1 to VP and V1 plus V2, V3 plus V4, V1 through VP, where B1 through BP is a partial basis. So again, we are allowing some prescribed forms of linear interdependencies between the vectors in these simplicies. Great. And again, we're going to take the subcomplex L sub n. subcomplex L sub n to be those simplices that span a proper sum and of z to the n. And right, the hard part in the proof of this result is verifying that this complex BAN is as highly connected as we need it to be, verifying that those homotopy groups vanish in a range. Groups vanish in a range. But once we do that, we obtain this partial resolution, which when we tensor with Q is a flat resolution of the Steinberg module. And let me state then the result is that, again, Result is that, again, because these chain groups are somehow generated by bases for Z to the N, or variations on BCs from Z to the N, augmented BCs. It turns out that it is fairly straightforward to verify that the co-invariants vanish. And so it follows fairly quickly from the existence of this partial resolution, the co-dimensional. The codimension two statement of the Church var Putman conjectures, which is the vanishing of SLNZ, the homology of SLNZ in codimension two, once n is at least four. Okay. And I wanted to at least And I wanted to at least briefly comment on the form, the structure of this partial resolution that comes from this argument. So here we have the generators for the Steinberg module in this resolution are symbols of the form V1 through Vn. Where this is a basis for Z to be n, these symbols are subject to the equivalence relation that each really, really, I should think of these as lines instead of vectors. So they're equivalent under multiplication by units. And because, well, right, because of because of the nature of orientation. Of because of the nature of orientations of simplices, they also have the property that if I permute the vectors in one of these simples, then that permutation acts by plus or minus one according to its sign. Okay, so the statement that the Steinberg module can be generated by elements of this form, by the images of these symbols, is essentially a result of Ash and Rudolph. And Rudolph. Okay, in the next step of the resolution, this gives me relations in the Steinberg module. This term is generated by these symbols V0 up through Vn, where V1 through Vn is a basis, and V naught looks like the sum of either two or three of these basis elements plus the symbol size. Um, plus these symbols satisfy the same relations as here, okay. And so, this result, the presentation that we get from these terms is essentially a result of Bykovsky. And what's new is this next term in this partial resolution, where here this term is generated by the symbols of the form V negative one, v0, v1 through vn. With the property that up to reordering v1 through vn is a basis and v0 and v negative 1 must be a sum of a pair of those basis elements plus the relations given here. Okay. And great, so I think I understand there are some for an oil complex experts in the audience. Complex experts in the audience, these relations or these simplicities may be familiar to you, which is, I think, an intriguing connection. And right, again, the upshot is that these somehow these terms in this presentation are small enough that it's tractable to compute the SLNR co-invariance. And so Coinvariance. And so this implies this vanishing result. And our hope is that maybe we can add a few more A's onto the end of this complex and augment our simplicities even more and obtain something that's even more highly connected and then use that to further extend this resolution and obtain vanishing in higher codimension. So thank you. That's the talk.
