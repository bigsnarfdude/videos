So, thanks. First of all, thanks to organizers for inviting me and thanks to all of you for coming to my talk. And I will speak about for Shawrson spaces in among the function spaces and some variations on that, usually weakenings. Good. So, this all joint work was. Joint work with Serhi Bardella and Yaroslav Shupina, now both from Kosice in Slovakia. And let me remind you some definitions. So, a space Y has the Fresh Euroson property, if and only if, if we have a set and the point in its closure, there is a sequence converging to this point from this set. This is like the best after being metrizable, right? You still kind of have full control of your space in terms of convergent signals. Terms of convergent sequences, but you don't demand the traceability or the first countability, things like that. Sequential probably is like the next best thing is like you say that maybe I do not really immediately get my point as a limit of a convergent sequence, but if I am patient enough, I just keep going, I will eventually reach it. So, sequential means that if a set is not closed, then you always find the sequence converging outside of it. And if you like, keep adding these limits of. Keep adding these limits of convergent sequences that it's not hard to see that after omega one many steps you get the full closure. So, if you're willing to go omega one many steps, sequential sequentiality also allows you to describe the closures by limits of convergent sequences. Now, Pitkayev property, maybe it's less known than the above two. It says the following: so space has a pitkeyev property. At some point x, if there is a countable family, what is very essential of infinite subsets of x, so some of them could have this point in the closure, some could be just outside, some cloud, such that if you are given any open neighborhood u of the point, there will be at least one element from this family which is totally contained in that neighborhood. So you may say that the cave property just says that. It just says that at any subset, any point in the closure, there is a countable network at this point in this subset consisting of infinite sets. But because if I didn't demand infinite, then if I allowed singletons, this would be precisely countable titans. Okay. Now, obviously, for chevron implies sequentials, sub-sequential, it's the property which is not that known, but I think it's in this context, it's worth being mentioned. It means that space. Mentioned it, it means that space is subsequential if it can be embedded into a sequential space. Now, subsequentiality implies pit K. Why is that? Because one can easily show that sequentiality implies Pit Kv. And another thing is that Pit K is preserved by subspaces. So that immediately shows that sub-sequentiality fits in between. And then countable tightness is again immediate. It just says that for any point in the closure. Says that for any point in the closure of a set, you have a countable subset of it, which also gets that point in the closure. Why? Because you just select a point from each of these dn in the definition of the pit-k property, and that's going to be a countable subset. Okay, good. Have some questions. So, motivation for the work was a question of Masami Sakai, which Which asked, does the pitk property imply the Fresh Rison one for spaces of the form Cp of X? And a bit of spoiler, we will come to it much later, but let me spoil it, that it's independent for metrizable spaces X. Okay. Now, first, let me mention how these properties relate for general topological spaces. There is actually not so much written about that. Everything is more or less summarized. Everything is more or less summarized in the paper by Malikin and Tironi from 2000. So they show that there exists a Hausdorff Pitkaya separable space of size 2 to continuum. Notice that such a space cannot be neither sequential nor sub-sequential because if a space is separable and you can describe everything in terms of convergent sequences, then it cannot have size modern continuum. And for some reasons, they didn't give any regular example. Regular example. I didn't think about it, but maybe it should be, maybe it could be harder. I don't know. That's what I said. These spaces cannot be subsequential. And for compact spaces, countable tightness is the same as Pit Kf. So the last two properties on the list coincide. And consequently, the statement that all PitKF compact spaces are sequential are independent because true under PFA, Hallandau proved it in 92 that. 92 That all complex spaces with countable tightness under PF8 are sequential. And then there are what? Ballock? Okay. I'm sorry, it was uh you see, I copied it from their paper, so uh so they made a mistake and they keep kind of yeah, yeah, it's. Keep kind of, yeah, yeah, it's so they, yeah, and falls under diamond. I mean, there is so Fedora 75 constructed under diamond, hereditarily separable compact space of size 2 to continuum. And these spaces again cannot be cannot be sequential. And hereditarily separable immediately gives you a Immediately gives you countable tightness. Good. So from now on, we consider very simple spaces of the form Cp of X. X is metrizable. Typically, it will be metrizable, separable, so you may think that X is a subspace of the counter space. Okay, so what is Cp of X? Just look at all functions from X to R which are continuous and look at this set with the topology inherited from the product. So P comes just. The product. So P comes just because that the topology of pointwise convergence, and then people to underline it write that P here. And for CP spaces of this form, they are all they all have countable tightness. So I immediately erased it from the list. It is known that for such spaces, Fresher Orisson equals, this is the same as being sequential. That's an old result of Fitkev. And subsequentiality, it's not known whether it is. It's not known whether it is the same property. It's still open to get it consistently that sequentiality could be different from the Fresh Rison and PitK could. So for CP we have much easier sequence and of course if you would like to distinguish these properties it's kind of very unconvenient to work directly with the CP because yes you said something quickly a question what was it what was the question What was the question about subsequentiality? It's not known how to get, let's say, under CH, if you want, a set of reals such that CP of it will be subsequential, so could be embedded into a sequential space, but not for sure. So if you would like to distinguish these properties, it's kind of not convenient to work directly with spaces of functions because it's kind of too much structure. It's always hard to handle. And instead, we will work with the hard to. And instead, we will work with the characterizations of these properties in terms of covering properties of the space X. And for this, we need some kinds of open covers of X. So an open cover of X is called an omega cover if it covers X in the following strong sense. If you give me a finite subset of it, I will be able to find a single element of the cover which covers the whole finite set. Gamma cover, it's an open cover, even in a more stronger sense. So any point must be contained. Any point must be contained in all but finitely many elements of the cover. And let's make some observation that every infinite gamma cover is an omega cover. Why? Because if you give me a finite set, each point can be can omit just finitely many elements, right? So altogether, they can also emit only finitely many elements of the cover. So again, they will sit in all but finitely many elements. If you is a gamma cover, then any infinite. A gamma cover, then any infinite subset of it is again a gamma cover because, yeah, kind of obvious. A thing which is maybe not that obvious, but it's like chasing the definition of p is that if you have a space of size less than p and you have an omega cover of it, then it contains a gamma sub cover of it. So let me leave it as an exercise, but you just look at the you just look at the You just look at the sets of subsets of this u, such that the given point is contained in them. So you get a centered family of size less than p. And since it's centered, it has size less than p, it must have a infinite pseudo-intersection. And that infinite pseudo-intersection is going to be just gamma kau. No examples. If I take all open intervals in the real line, which have length not more than three, then obviously it's going to be an open cover of R. Obviously, it's going to be an open cover of R, but not an omega cover, not even two points can be covered, like zero and three will never be covered simultaneously by one element of it. Well, if I take this sequence of intervals from minus n to n, this is a gamma cover, right? So each point is going to be covered by all but finitely many and slightly less trivial example of a gamma cover. So I take all open subsets of the real line such that their measure is less. That their measure is less than one divided by their diameter. Then it's obvious that it's kind of an omega cover of x because if you give me finitely many points, I can find such small neighborhoods around them that if you sum up their measures, I will still be less than the one over the diameter. And this open cover of the real line will never have a gamma sub cover. And it's again an easy exercise. Good. So X is said to be a gamma space if every omega cover of X contains a gamma subcover. So if you look at the previous slide, you see that every space of size less than P is going to be a gamma space, but the real line is not going to be a gamma space, as the very last example of an omega cover shows. And actually, no subset of the real line of positive measure can be can be a gamma space. Can be a gamma space. Okay, we know that gamma spaces must be zero-dimensional. Why? Because, as all covering properties, they are preserved by continuous images. So the real line cannot be a continuous image of that space, also not a closed interval. So Titiano spaces means being zero-dimensional. Yeah, we can restrict ourselves to clop and mega covers. Ourselves to clop at mega covers, we get equivalent definition, and it's a kind of celebrated result of Gerlitz and Neut from 82, which says that Cp of X has Fresh Aurston property if and only if X is a gamma set, gamma space. And it's kind of, yeah, proof of a partial case. Like there is a partial case of this theorem whose proof is more or less again chasing the definitions. Definitions. Let's take G, which is a subset of CP, but I consider not all functions to the real line, but just those which have two values 0 and 1. Okay. So it's kind of easy to see that 0, the constant 0 function, is in the closure of this family. If I look at the pre-images of zero across that family G, it's an omega cover of x. Why? Because if you give me any Why? Because if you give me any finite subset of the space, there must be a function which is in the family, which is on each of these points, has size less than one over two. But since it's zero and one, it must be just zero. So, right. So, that's an omega cover. And now, let's think what does it mean for a sequence to converge to zero? It just means that if you give me any point in the space, the sequence must be eventually zero at that point. So if I take the pre-images of zero, it's a gamma cover of x. So for this space, this characterization, if I replaced here Cp of X, zero, one would be just, that's the proof. But of course, if you allow for all functions, you have to be like work harder, but and it's actually not that trivial. There are several cute tricks that they invented back then. Okay. Now, what is a pie space? A pie space, it's It's space such that for every clope and omega cover, we get a family of infinite subsets, again, kind of essential infinite, that for every finite subset of the space, there will be an n such that this f is contained in the intersection of the family number n. So it's kind of contained in every element of u n. Good. So, you may think that we included being open into the definition of omega covers, but if I didn't do it, then you could think that this family of these intersections is kind of not necessarily open omega cover of x. And again, pi spaces must be zero-dimensional, it's kind of known. And the result of by Masami Sakai and Petr Simon Boaz Saban. So, Mosami Sakai. So Masami Sakai almost obtained it, but there was some kind of unpleasant wrinkle, which was then removed by the work of Simon and Saban. Says that Cp of X is PKF, if and only if X is a pi space. And the proof is just, if you would like to see that this is kind of a natural thing to the characterization is natural, you just again assume that zero isn't the closure in this space, Cpx. Closure in this space cpx01. And then, if you just think first, what does it mean to be in the closure? We have this, just means it must be omega cover. And then think what does it mean that there are infinite collection of infinite subsets of your space, like which form a pi network at the point. You will see that it gives you immediately this infinite family UN. Right. So just to check that it makes sense, we make again pass through CP0, CPX01, and just read off. And just read off the definition of pi. Good. Now there is a property in between pi and gamma, which is maybe at least for me was easier to handle. It looks as follows. So for a family V of subsets of X, we say limit inf of V is what is written here. But But you may think of it as just the maximal set which is gamma covered by our family. So that's the set of all points which are eventually contained in elements of our family. Okay. And now if you give me family v of infinite family of subsets of x, I can just keep playing this game with lim imp. I can first take all of its infinite subsets and look at the family of all possible lim imps of them and that's going to be. Possible imps of them, and that's going to be my first application of operator L. It's L1 of it. And if I had successor stages, I apply L1 to the previous one, and at limit stages, I take the union. So this way, after omega 1, many stages, it must stabilize. And at each stage, you just ask, what can I gamma cover by elements from the previous stages? And yeah, so that's stabilizes. It stabilizes, and x is said to be a delta space if x, you get x as an element of the very final. Maybe you get it earlier, right? And typically, if you get it, you must get it earlier, right? But we must get it in this process somehow before we reach the end. And obviously, gamma spaces, a delta spaces, because in gamma spaces, you demand that you immediately get a gamma subcover. So, in the being a gamma space, it says that in this process, Being a gamma space says that in this process, the x must be an element of L1 for any omega cover, because you take just a gamma sub cover of x, then you immediately get x as an outcome. So you don't have to go omega one many steps. And Masami Sakai proved that delta sets are pi sets. So we have this kind of sequence, gamma sets, while delta sets are pi sets. Like biceps and uh yeah, so you may think of this like a studying of these special sets of reals, so like sets of reals with some kind of peculiar properties, if you wish. And Gerlitz Nudj, back in that paper, asked whether every delta set is a gamma set. Yeah, this is the implication that I already mentioned. Good. So this is some piece from the Some piece from the paper from Gerlitz and Matthew. You may see how many properties they had, all named by Greek alphabet, and there are also their properties of Cp of X named by III and so on. And they asked indeed whether this is true. And yeah, actually, they proved that delta spaces must have all strong measure zero. So, you cannot hope for a negative answer in ZFC. And Arnie Miller in 2008 also noticed, it's kind of very cute, but as usually has in work of Arnie has some kind of trick argument that the same is true about pi spaces. So the pi spaces also must have strong measure zero. Which is funny is that about gamma sets, we can prove that they Can prove that they must have strong measure zero with respect to any metric which is continuous on them, but for pi spaces, his proof gives only strong measure zero with respect to any metric which is totally bounded. So for arbitrary continuous metric, to get strong measure zero is not known. Okay, so we have the good labor worked for us in 76 or 78, even before all the properties were introduced. Even before all the properties were introduced, and he proved that they are all the same in the labor model. So, if you would like to distinguish, you have to assume something, right? And now, what makes them all even more similar is that they all have critical cardinality P. So, in the work of Simon and Sabon, it's proved that so below P, each of the properties hold for spaces of size less than P, but this one, you can already fail this property with the space. Already fail this property with the space of size p. So, like lots of similarities, similar definitions, like your select from omega covers something, similar critical cardinality. So, good. And to analyze these properties, it's kind of that there is a good tool developed by Galvin and Miller back in 84. And let me explain how do this. Explain how they analyze it. So, if we have an omega cover of finite subsets, so we live in the contour set and we have some family of global sets, which is an omega cover of all finite subsets. Okay, then what is happening is that you give me any, so that I stick to the same notation, if you give me any. If you give me any natural number n and an infinite subset of omega e, I can find an element e in e such that any set which I can find an element e in that omega cover such that any subset of omega which misses the interval from n to e so it may have something here afterwards but it's not allowed to have points from n to e it must be It must be contained in that element v of the omega cover. Okay, so how does it go? Well, there must be an element which I take v in my omega cover such that the power set of n is contained in v. It's an omega cover of all finite subsets, so there is such v. And I claim that for this v, I will be able to find this number. Will be able to find this number e, and then the fact that I can select it in a given in advance or infinite set is just a joke because if I find one, I can always move it to the right. And then the condition gets even harder to have points in that interval. So it will kind of be even better for me. Good. So for each S here, so for any S which is a subset of N, there is a basic neighborhood of S. Basic neighborhood of S, which is contained in V. But how do these basic neighborhoods look like? You have to just up to a certain point promise that you are like S. So for every S, there exists some, let's call it NS, maybe ES bigger than N, such that the family of all those axes is a subset of omega, which up to this point ES. Which up to this point Es are precisely like S. That this is contained in V. Okay, so now we take the maximum of all these E ass's and even enlarge it to be in E. So let's E E B and they claim that it works. And they claim that it works. Now, why is that? Because if you give me any x in omega, a subset of omega, which misses that interval, let s be its intersection with n. And what I know, I know that my x up to e is the same as x, is the same as s. So it has no points from n to e. So in particular, To E. So, in particular, it has no points from N to ES because ES is even smaller. And everybody like that must sit in V. That's it. And now we just play with the kind of self-strengthening of this statement a bit. First, the second version would be just keep applying it. So it says that if you are given an omega cover of finite sub. If you are given an omega cover of finite subsets of omega, then there is an infinite subset of omega and the family of distinct elements of v such that v j contains all subsets of omega which omit the interval b of j to b of j plus one. And actually, here, as you may guess, I identify every infinite subset of omega with the increasing enumeration. So, b of j is just the j's element of b. Well, well, here I showed you how to make. Well, here I showed you how to make one step. You have one V. Well, then for the next step, you get another V, start already, then from the end of the first interval, it's going to be N, and you get another E, and you keep going, getting new elements of V. And another kind of self-improvement of the same thing would be that suppose that we have a subset of the P of omega which contains all finite subsets and it has cardinality less than P. Subsets and it has cardinality less than p, and we have an omega cover of it. Well, then there is we have the same conclusion like before, but in addition, we demand that the family of selected VJs is a gamma cover of the space. It's again kind of very easy because you first, oh, you first shrink your U to not U, you first shrink your V to a gamma cover, which is also an omega cover, and then apply to Omega cover and then apply two with two, you will get some subsequence of it with the same property. Notice that the property is just the same, but any subsequence of a gamma cover is again a gamma cover, so that's again nothing extraordinary. And now we are able to construct a delta space, which is not a gamma space, under assuming p equals c. So there will be just all details in two full slides. All details in two full slides. To fix the composition of omega into infinite sets, the set number n will be i n. The first claim kind of says that I have too much notation, but it's actually very simple. That if you are given two infinite subsets of omega, then you can shrink. Omega, then you can shrink the second one. The first one will be just measuring intervals on omega for you. So we can shrink the second one to some infinite subset of it, such that if I look at all n's for which I can find infinitely many j's in, such that a intersects the interval given by b for this j. Then I have just less or equal one such such ends. So let me draw a picture, and then it will be clear that this is trivial. So this will be my intervals given by b. So this will be typically intervals b of j to b of j plus one where j is in Where j is in I0, here will be intervals with indices from I1 and so on. And I have some infinite set C. I look which intervals from this C intersects. So if there will be one n such that my C intersects infinitely many intervals from with indices from my n. From IN, well, I just collect these blue points from this I n and throw away everything else. So these blue points will be my C. And then for this one specific N, I will have infinitely many J's in IN such that A intersects the intervals, but for everybody else, I will have nothing. Right? So there will be at most one. But if there is no such N for which my set C intersects, infinitely many intervals from the same. Intervals from the same end. Well, that I don't have to do anything. I already have that this set of these ends is just empty. It has size zero. So as you see, it's just kind of. And now we take any toll ideal. Tall means that for any infinite set, you have a subset, infinite subset of it, which is in the ideal. So if you think it's just the dual filter doesn't have a pseudo-intersection. Doesn't have a pseudo-intersection. And I enumerate all infinite subsets of omega in such a way that every set is repeated cofinally often. And we have another claim, which has the following, that we can construct a family of so I will play a very little role. The role of I will be just to make sure that at the end I take a union of finitely many elements of A alpha, which I construct. Alpha, which I construct, that is not the whole omega. That's why I can take any toll ideal. Yes, we get there is a tall set A of this form such that, oh yeah, okay, which we have a very similar property in S in the previous item, just A alpha satisfies the same property as in the previous item, but But not for a single B. In the claim one, we had it for single B, for single decomposition of intervals. But here, I would like to have that property for all B's with indices less than alpha. So for fewer than P many intervals. Okay, so this is again more or less using claim one and just use the fact that p equals continuum. So suppose So suppose, of course, A alpha will be done, will be constructed by transfer. And how do we get A alpha? We get it as the last element of a sequence A alpha beta, where beta starts from minus one to alpha. Minus one is just for the convenience because I would like it to be to start with an element which is a subset of B alpha. Remember that I would like it to be tall, so there must be something. So, there must be something which will enter the alpha. So, that's going to be my A alpha. Okay, so what do I do next? And then if I arrive at A, how do I get A alpha beta? A alpha beta will be a set which satisfies the property from the claim one, but for the for B beta. Well, I can do it and I can. Well, I can do it and I can even find it as a pseudo-intersection because I see I can claim one allows me to get such an A inside of any C. So when I would like to get A alpha beta, I take first the pseudo-intersection of all the A alpha gammas for gamma less than beta. That's going to be my C. And then I shrink it to A alpha beta to satisfy the property from claim one just for the beta. So the last A alpha will have the property from claim one. Alpha will have the property from claim one, but not for a single B, but for all the Bs with small indices. That's basically it. Good. And if you take these A alphas that we constructed and take a union with finite sets, it's going to be a delta set, which is not a gamma set. So, first, let's start contrary to all pedagogical rules from the heart part. Part that it is actually delta. Good. So you give me an omega cover of A. So that result, that lemma by Galvin and Miller allows me to find B alpha zero. That's the composition of the intervals and the sequence of elements indexed by J in that open omega cover such that. open omega cover such that if I omit interval number j given by the function b alpha zero well then I must sit in v zero j that's just a very direct application of Galvin Miller lemma suppose that we have now v i's for i less or equal m well v zero we have and we have some increasing sequence of ordinals alpha i i less m now what we do we Now, what we do is take v m plus one subset of v0 to be a gamma cover of all the a i's with the indices less than alpha m and finite set. Notice that this set has size less than p because we assume p equals continuum. So it's a gamma set, so we can find such a gamma subcover. And now we use the third item of Galvin and Miller. And we pick sets the m plus one j. So we just dm plus 1 j so we just index them by j in such and the sick and the decomposition of omega into finite intervals such that if I omit the interval number j given by the function b then I must sit in b m plus 1 j yeah and now we will see that a from this is sits in the third application of the L operator to V zero V zero and optimally, actually, if you work abstractly, you can do it even for the second application, but I couldn't get it in good details. Okay, so given A, it remains to note that A sits in limb inf of a family in the big black brackets, which consists of lim inf of families which sit in See it in slightly bigger or slightly smaller green brackets of families contained. Yeah, from these guys, it may look a bit like, but actually, that's precisely what we I guess there is nothing to plan to write something on the blackboard. Okay. So there are two cases. There are two cases. So let alpha star be just the supremum of this alpha m and the first case would be if A is a alpha for some alpha which is above alpha star. Notice that this lim inf you can easily eliminate it because you can replace each lim inf with for all but finitely many. That's the meaning of it, right? So what is written here? So, what is written here? It's just written that A, that for all but finitely many m in omega, for all but finitely many n in omega, and for all but finitely many j in i n my a alpha should be an element of what's that b and j The MJ, yeah, sorry M was missing, it was made me a bit made me a bit worried. Okay, so why is this true? So we have just to scroll back. Okay, so we know that there can be only one n for which you have infinitely many j's. In other words, it says that for all but finitely many, for all except for one n, for all but finitely many j's, I know that A alpha misses the interval from B beta of J to B beta of J plus one. Of j to be better of j plus one. But the fact that it misses that interval, well, just tells you that it is in Vm. Oh god, I lost the pointer. It is Vm plus one J. So it's basically this. Right, so yeah, and the proof. And the proof: if A is of the smaller in a smaller index or is just a finite set, you get even better results because there you kind of gamma covered all that in the course of the constructions. Good. So, how do we get that it is not gamma? The fact that it is not gamma is put in the following. That's where the ideal I, which we used to play some role. So, look at the clop and subset of the counter set, which Subset of the counter set which says x does not contain i. Well, then this is an omega cover of a. Why is that? Because if you give me finitely many elements of a, remember, I've chosen them from some fixed in advanced ideal i. So the union of these finitely many elements cannot cover the whole omega. So there must be some i that i is not in any of these finitely many guys. So then all Many guys. So then OI will contain all of them. So that's an omega cover of A. Now, why doesn't it have a gamma subcover? Because if it had a gamma sub cover, then let collect the indices this i for which it could be a gamma sub cover and remember that our set A is tall. So there will be a alpha, which is completely contained in those. Which is completely contained in those indices. But that means that this A alpha is not covered by infinitely many elements of that supposedly gamma cover, namely by elements of the indexes in A alpha itself. Okay, so that's more or less it. I guess the fact that it is so easy should mean that all the guys that I mentioned before. Yeah, didn't really think about it much, but uh what is uh like if you look at this, just what is written here and you like ideals on omega, it should kind of ring a bell that something happening here related to the fin ideal fin to the power three, right? You're saying that something for any element of some infinity. Of some infinite set which is in the sits in fin to the power of three, something is happening. So, this was kind of motivation to introduce into all these business ideals. So, given ideal i unaccountable set, and so we call v indexed by the elements of this set to be i gamma cover of x if any point x in this in the space misses only ideal many. Is only ideal many elements of the cover. So remember, what was the gamma cover? Gamma cover was just I'm allowed to miss finitely many. Here I'm allowed to miss I many. So this is just the definition is designed in such a way that gamma covers are precisely fin gamma covers. And the space we call space omega gamma i space if every open omega cover of the space contains an i. Of the space contains an i gamma sub cover. So, gamma, if I replace i with the ideal film, I get immediately gamma gamma spaces because then it would say that any omega cover contains a gamma sub cover. Okay, and if you just look at this formula, which is written here, the delta space that we have constructed is just omega gamma slash fin three space. Three space and uh well, is that a coincidence? Is there something special about three here? Uh, so actually, no, it would be true for any countable power of the ideal theme. And so, but we need kind of more notions for this. Uh, I think it was mentioned in many talks before that one ideal is catalog below another one if there is a map from the domain of. one if there is a map from the domain of the i1 to the the domain of i0 such that the pre-images of all the elements of of i0 must sit in i1 so you may think that kind of i1 is more complicated than i0 because inside you have kind of a copy of i0 well not precisely a copy but a kind of a simulation given you by pre-images of with respect to phi and And if you get more complicated ideal, then you get a weaker covering property. That's a tiny observation that if I1 is cut above I0, then the property that you get is a weaker one. So everyone which has the property for I0 has it for I1, and this is more or less chasing definitions. But the full details are here. And we need two operations on ideals. The product. The product, so an element of the ideal is in the product if so that the product ideal lives on the product of the domains of these two, and you say that you are in the ideal if for filter many elements in the first coordinate, the intersection with the vertical line must sit in the second ideal. But I guess it was also mentioned before. And we need a countable sum of the ideals. So for this, we need an idea. So, for this, we need an ideal, one ideal I, which lives on set A, and for any element in A, we need another ideal IA, which lives, say, on the A. Then the ideal I sum over of IA over A in A, it's just what is written here, but I better draw it. So, in this direction, you have A, and for every A in A, you have, you may imagine that. In A, you have, you may imagine that above it, you have the alpha on which lives, or dA, that's on which lives the ideal IA. And then that sum will live just on the disjoint union of these d alphas, and an element will be in the ideal, if and only if, like on i many points here. So here you may have i many points. May have I-many points where you allow to do anything, but outside of these I-many points, the intersection with the vertical line must sit in the ideal I alpha. And actually, formally speaking, we didn't have to define the product of two ideals because the product of two ideals, as you may guess, is easily realizable as the I sum of the copies of the second ideal. Of the copies of the second ideal. Okay, and below the constructions of countable powers of the ideal theme, I guess the oldest mentioning of this we were able to localize due to Grime Eisen and Katatov. Well, correct me if I'm wrong. So for any alpha less than omega one, fin to the power alpha is, if alpha is better plus one, then I take fin times. One, then I take fin times phi to the power beta. If it is limit, then I take the sum across k alpha of phi to the power xi for all smaller xi. But now what is k alpha? K alpha is the ideal on alpha of non-cofinal subsets. Good. And we have a lemma which says that if x is a delta space and u is an omega cover of x, well, then there exists alpha such that u contains an. That u contains and phen alpha gamma subcover. So you get a sequence in it such that if you look, take any point in your space and look what kind of elements in that sequence it misses, it must be in that ideal fin alpha. And in another direction, if alpha is less than omega one and x is omega chooses gamma fin alpha space, then it must be delta space. So there is one funny thing here. You see, in the first item, you know that any omega cover has some. Know that any omega cover has some sub cover, so there is some alpha, and the other direction you must fix alpha. So it would be nice if we knew that for any delta space, there is one alpha which works. But unfortunately, we're unable to do it. I know how interesting that, but is it consistent, at least from the CH, that we can get a delta space such that for any alpha, there will be an omega cover without any an alpha gamma sub cover. So it will be like a non-uniformly delta. Uniformly delta. Okay. And notice that it the now since we have ideal ideals as parameters, it's kind of very natural to ask, is it true? So they give you kind of stratification of all these covering properties, but maybe this stratification is kind of stupid. It's totally insensitive to the ideals. So the ideal, I use the word ideal too many. I use the word ideal too many times. So, the best possible thing that we can prove in this situation would be: suppose that I is not cut at all below j. If we could prove from that that there is omega gamma gamma i space which is not omega gamma j, then it would just show that the picture of the catheter order on the ideals kind of can be copied in. Can be copied into the covering properties. We would have like all the, yeah, would be like the best possible distinct way of distinguishing the covering properties. Unfortunately, we cannot do it, but sometimes we can do sometimes this happens. And I need some notation that. So if you have an infinite subset of omega, it gives you a map from omega to omega. gives you a map from omega to omega which kind of glues together intervals given by b so i b of k is n if and only if k is in that interval and they have two other versions of the catatov order which is well the first one i think may be found in literature it says that we say that i is katatov below plus j if there is a positive uh Positive set with respect to j such that i is catalog below the restriction of j to that positive set. Okay, and another one is that hog that we just invented just because it worked in our purposes, but I don't really know even whether it's a partial order. So I say that so the notation is kind of suggest that it is, but we cannot prove that it is a partial order. So we say that i is cut at of weakly cut. Is cut at of weakly cut it off, so it should have been w not omega. It's weakly cut at all below j. If there is a function, I define it for ideals on omega, but there is obvious kind of modification for ds living on arbitrary sets. I just didn't want to mess up with notation. If there is a function from omega to omega and the countable family of infinite subsets of omega, such that for a a we have the following property. If gluted, if A glued by IB for any element B in B sits in the ideal I, well, then the pre-image of it must be in J. So the yeah. Notice that this doesn't mean actually that A must be in I. We just glue it, so it may totally kind of destroy the properties, you know, like if you think of I being, I don't know, summable or yeah. Yeah, but it's something which works for for our purposes and that's why we have it. Obviously, if I is cut at all below J, then I is weakly cut at below j. And B witnessing that would be just the singleton omega. Because if you take singleton omega, what would be IB? Ib will be, you know, the interval number n will have just one point n. So this is like the identity map on the omega. This identity map on the omega. So then this property saying that ib of A is in I for all B and B would just translate to A in I. And then you get just the definition of catatoo below. So it's indeed a weak version of lesser equal k and well very deep logic says that if we negate weakly below then we get a strong Weakly below, then we get a stronger property than if we negate being catalog below. Okay, so let's what do we know about this relation less or equal weakly catal? Recall that ideal is a p plus ideal if any decreasing sequence of positive sets with respect to this ideal has a pseudo-intersection which is also positive. Okay, and we know that if J is P, If J is P, or it is phi alpha for some alpha less than omega one, then if I is catal below weakly j, then it must be below j on the positive set. So for this kind of ideals, this is nothing new, right? It just tells you this. Consequently, if I is weakly cut at all below phenof alpha, some alpha, then it's actually cutato below. So if the Catato below. So, if the on the right-hand side you have one of these powers of the finite ideal, then it's actually gives you the usual catato order. Why is that? Simply because fin alpha, you can prove it like by the caution, restricted to any positive set, is cut at equivalent to itself. It has this nice property. Okay, and what we can prove that if I is not weakly cut at below. If I is not weakly cut at all below j alpha for all alpha and omega one, well then there is a space which has the property omega chooses gamma i, which gives you an omega cover u which has no alpha gamma sub cover for any alpha. Okay, so not only, I'm sorry, not only this space X fails to have the property omega chooses gamma. Property omega chooses gamma i sub alpha, but you know, you get a single omega cover, which shows you that this implication is witnessed by a single omega cover for each for each alpha. So, in particular, it's actually not omega gamma alpha for one. Right, so we can kind of works in our context. And the corollary says that if i is not weakly capital below j, then there is a space with covering property corresponding to i, which doesn't. Property corresponding to I, which doesn't have it for the ADLJ. And another corollary says that if I is not cut to fin alpha, for all alpha in omega one, well, then there is omega gamma i space, which is not a delta space. Why? Because look at this theorem. Take this u, which is witnessing for each alpha that it cannot contain gamma alpha sub cover. But we have this characterization, not characterization, the property of delta spaces, which Property of delta spaces, which told us that we, from any omega cover of a delta space, we should be able for some alpha find a gamma fin to the power alpha cover. And of course, that would be kind of nice to know which pairs i and j this being weakly cathetal below is equivalent to less or equal catheter. Probably under CH, you can cook up, you know, some two arbitrary ideas. Know some two arbitrary ideals for which this is not equivalent, but for Borel, it would be nice to know, you know, at least a pair of two nice Borel ideals for which, let's say, less or equal, weak is not the same as less or equal. Cut it off. Yeah, or maybe it's true for all nicely definable ideals. We have no idea. Now, well, with all these, we can even distinguish actually the two. Distinguish actually the two later properties. Remember, we have this picture that gamma implies gamma spaces imply delta spaces, this imply phi spaces. We know already that under p equals c, this implication cannot be reversed, but we are left with this implication. Maybe these two guys are the same. Actually, not because again, it's more or less chasing definitions. If i is not omega heating. I is not omega heating. I is not omega heating if and only if every space which has the covering property with respect to oh sorry j with respect to j is pi. Now omega heating is the property which is stronger than being than being tall. It just says that if you give me infinitely many infinite subsets of omega, then there is a single element of the ideal which hits each of them at least in one point if that's enough. Good. And Good. And well, another observation that if you take any ideal, multiply it with fin, it's never going to be omega-hitting because you will have these countably many vertical lines that no elements of the product is going to intersect each of them on an infinite set. And if I take an ultrafilter, take the dual ideal, multiply it with fin, it's never going to be cut at all below fin of alpha for all alpha. Omega 1, this is like a nice exercise. I think it could be. Size. I think it could be given to students for mathematical Olympiad, it's not the length of all the definitions involved. If you know all the definitions, it kind of Olympiad problem. Okay, so what do we know from that? We know that there exists a pi space which is not a delta space. Why? Because remember that if you have an ideal which is not catal below any fin alpha, then there is a space with the covering property with respect to this ideal. Respect to this ideal, which is not delta. So this is my ideal. And it is not omega heating by the second item. Okay, but it's not omega heating. So there is an element. So each element, each space having the covering property with respect to it must be pi, as easy as it is. And of course, if you have the proof which works under CH and you don't know how to Don't know how to, if you don't see in the proof which cardinal characteristics are responsible for it working, right? You know, because in most of these proofs, you just look at it and see, ah, it must be covering of mega, equal, and equal, finality, whatever. But not in this proof. At least we were not able to see it. So it's a natural question whether must be true under MA. And there are actually kind of rare examples, which actually I know only one of them in this area of the covering properties where CH implies something, but PFA. ch implies something but pfa forbids it it's due to to to alan though so uh what no it's just i i mean the different thing the ball i mean the bollock the bullock thing is not about sets of fields yeah okay but yeah okay uh i don't know maybe we just don't see it or maybe there is something Maybe we just don't see it, or maybe there is something deep happening here that it's impossible to. And my favorite question, I have two minutes according to that quote. I'm sorry? We have several hours. This is a quote for optimists. So up by space is preserved by the coin forcing. So why is it interesting? Because no matter which direction I use. Because no matter which direction you solve it, it gives you something. It's like a win-win game. So suppose that you prove that they are preserved. Notice that gamma spaces is just one of many of these covering properties. So that's I took my t-shirt. You cannot read any name on that, but at least you see the shape of the diagram. So gamma spaces are the strongest property. And after we proved that, we realized that it's not known whether under CH. It's not known whether under CH being pi implies the weakest property, and as you see, there are lots of properties in between. So, you know, people were kept asking, does it imply the strongest one? Okay, we found an easy solution, but actually, maybe it doesn't even imply the weakest one. Okay, now how co-inforcing could prove that? If we prove that, yes, that it is preserved by co-inforcing, that it would be able to push the property pi all through the diagram almost to the best possible place to the The best possible place to the disjunction of the next two properties after being a gamma space. So we will know that it's okay, it doesn't have to imply a gamma, but it's anyway very strong property on this diagram. And suppose that you solve it in the negative. Suppose the pi spaces are not preserved by coinforcing, but the gamma spaces are preserved. It's kind of again the cute fact by Arne Miller. So if you give me a pi space which is not preserved, but Giving me a pi space which is not preserved by the coinforcing, it means that it was not the gamma space in the ground model, because if it were ground in the ground model, gamma spaces would be gamma spaced in the extensions, it would be pi spaced. So it would be a nice kind of alternative forcing solution to the question, does pi imply gamma? And which would be probably even more interesting than what we have. And here is like the ideals that we have in mind, had in mind when we worked with all these properties. I'm sure that. With all these properties, I'm sure that Michael knows 10 times more of this, but it was for me, it was already enough. So, yeah, so for each of them, you have the covering properties. And in many cases, for instance, if the destination was a sigma, and there are lots of them are a sigma, we were able to actually, from the fact that there is no catato connection, to prove that also we have non-implication in the covering property. So, thanks for your attention. So, thanks for your attention. So, questions for Lugomer. So questions for you, Lyvomir. Any questions? So you ask whether pie sets are preserved by co-enforcing. Okay, I'm going to strengthen your question in a way that's ridiculous, and maybe you could tell me if you know if this is false or not. So you mentioned near the beginning that Pi sets have strong measure zero. That's right. I know that if you do co-enforcing. I know that if you do co-enforcing, every subset of the ground model has strong measure zero. That's right. Is it conceivable that maybe you create lots of pi sets? Even the ground model becomes a pie set after co-enforcing? No, ground model cannot become a pie set because if something after adding coin reels becomes a pi set, it must become must have the Hurevich property in even in all finite powers. But the ground model, you know, it's unbounded. It's also in the extension, so it cannot. Also, in the extension, so it cannot have the Hurevich property in the extension. Okay, so you do not maybe you create, you maybe you do create something, but not such a fat piece. Maybe something very small, which was already kind of prepared in advance, was small, and then you kind of touch it with co-inforcing and it gets piped. Maybe that's possible, but I don't know such examples yet. Okay. Any other questions? So early in the first half of your talk, you gave this delta set, which is not a gamma. Exactly. Right. And it was, you said it was, there was this sequential almost order of being a delta set. Being a delta set. That's right. And so it was at order two, do you say? Or you said it was at order three, but maybe you could prove it's order three. It's very nice. Oh, what did I do? It did something wrong, but I think it's good for. Yeah, the liminth limit. So it actually appeared at level two, not level one. A gamma set means it appears at level one. And if you said that it appeared at level three, that's right. So under. Level three. That's right. So under CH, we have the covering properties corresponding to this like spine and this diagram and all of them are mutually different. So and notice that all of them would give you a delta set. So that was my question. So you have, for example, a level three delta set that's not a level. Like omega one maybe types of delta sets. And maybe there is one more type which says that, well, must say that for any omega. Well, must say that for any omega cover, there is alpha such that it's there is this gamma fin alpha subcover inside of it, but there is no alpha which works for any omega cover. Maybe there is this kind of top type of delta sets, but we were not able to construct it. That's not quite my question. Earlier on, at the very beginning of your, and the first half of your talk, the first counterexample you gave of a delta set that's not a gamma set. Yes, yes. Yes, ah, it's just this construction gave us three, but from the abstract approach, we know that it's also possible with two because fin is not less or equal weakly fin square. Right. So this would be an example which is at level two, not at level one. Exactly. So do you have examples at level three, not at level two? Okay, that's right. Level two and okay, that's right. Because, yeah, okay, because maybe I didn't mention it, but this hierarchy of the powers of Finn is strict with respect to the catalog order. So, no one which comes later can be catalog below the one which comes earlier. Okay, any other question for Leibomir? Well, if not, let's Well, if not, let's thank him for his talk.
