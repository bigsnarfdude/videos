So, I apologize if you came here wanting to hear about the Dolene pairing. But given the theme of the conference, this seemed, the moduli linear series seemed a little more apropos. But I changed the title again. I'll try and explain where that comes from in a little bit. Let's see. I should also say that this is very much a work in progress, and a lot of the things I will say are. And a lot of the things I'm going to say are definitely not of their final form. And, well, you'll see. There are a lot of bits that are just suboptimal. But yes, this is about linear series and degenerations of linear series. So let me just remind you what a linear series is. So if C is a smooth curve, A smooth curve, smooth connected proper curve over a field. Then a linear series of rank R and a degree D on C. On C is a lie bundle, L on C and an R plus one-dimensional subspace E contained inside of the global sections. Okay? And the question is: how do these data degenerate? And the question is, how do these data degenerate as C degenerates? So there's essentially three questions that one has to address. One is, since how does C degenerate? And this should be very familiar. This is, of course, Delina Mumford. It will degenerate to a stable curve. Second is the question of how L degenerates. L degenerates. And this, I think the answer is really given by Oda and Sasadri. But there's a logarithmic interpretation of Kajimara. And then an extension of that to moduli that Sam would do over some infinite period, as Sam would describe it. And then there's a third problem. And then there's a third problem, which is the degeneration of the vector space E. And this was done by who knows? So Diane's talk maybe this is closely related to the question: what should a tropical vector bundle be? So maybe that's talk should be giving us some insight here. So what's the issue here? Well, there are a few things one could do, but the big issue is that L can degenerate in many different ways. And what do you want to do? Do you want to pick one degeneration? You need some way of picking it. Or maybe you need to consider multiple degenerations simultaneously, but then you need to know how they're compatible. And that's kind of what this is going to be. And that's kind of what this is going to be about. But one option that I should mention is you could address some of this by rigidifying E. So for example, you could choose a basis. This might lead you fairly naturally to studying stable maps, which we've already seen used to great effect in this whole talk, for example. Sorry, stable maps here. Mass here. So that's, I don't know, that's one option. You could choose a splitting. There's a little bleaker than choosing the basis, and that might lead you to log stable maps to the toric log structure on projective space. So there are tons of things you can do, but when you rigidify E in some way, that sorts. By E in some way, that tends to privilege some key components of C in your degeneration. And we were talking this morning about what is your favorite curve, right? So what's your favorite component of the degeneration? But maybe curves should be like children, right? You shouldn't privilege one over another. You should love them all equally, even if you're degenerate. So yeah, so I'd like to describe some kind of approach to trying to love all the components of C equally as CP generates. Let's see, I'm erasing the definition. I think we've seen it enough times that I remember. So there are two important concepts that we need here. So one is the ramification sequence. So again, I have this linear series on C, and if P is the point of C, the, sorry, let's see, the vanishing sequence of L and E L E is the sequence of integers A0 through AR, R such that there is sigma in E vanishing to order exactly an I at P. A i at p. Okay, and generically this ramifications, or sorry, this vanishing sequence, I'm gonna make my mistake over my home. Generically, this vanishing sequence looks like this. And if you find a point P where the vanishing sequence does not look like this, P might be called a ramification point or an inflection point. A ramification point or an inflection point, depending on which source you're reading. So maybe we can call it a RAM reflection point, just to make it as confusing as possible. Okay, so the reason I introduce this now is for everything I want to say, I'm going to assume that the ramification for inflection always occurs. Namification for inflection always occurs at marked points. So we'll assume that all inflection is marked. I don't think this is going to be necessary in the final version, but for what I want to say. So if you choose a splitting, then. Then so if E is isomorphic to the k to the n, or k to the r plus one, then maps into E, or maps into the projective space of E correspond to, or sorry, let's just say, a map from E tensor O to some line bundle on the curve. On the curve, it can be identified with r plus one to L. And then this gives us some distinguished divisors inside of the projector space. So we can put a log structure there and study those logs if we'll map. Okay, so um Okay, so yes, so let me give you the definition. So most of the talk is just going to be trying to explain. Yes. Sorry, it goes into fields. Someone else would perform. Just sorry, choose a super die expression. What's the difference between the places of the split of the eye? Whether you actually choose an element of that one-dimensional subspace. Of that one-dimensional subspace, or you just say, all I care about is it's a bunch of one-dimensional subspaces, but the one-dimensional subspaces could vary in the family. Okay, so if I have a family of curves of pre-stable curves, let's say, C over S with markings. So this will be the stack. So it's going to be on log speeds. I'm not going to say much about what a log structure is, but for the most part you can ignore the word logarithmic when you see it. I mean, I will try and explain this. So it consists of a logarithmic one of the middle L on C. See. Second, a realizable vector bundle on the argument. It's a gamma of C. And so there's a map. I should say there's a map of the hotel from C to Can. To panel. And that will show up in this third part an injective map from E into tau or star L. And then I want to make sure that all of the inflection occurs at the markings. So the condition is that speed feed is The is logarithmically 100. I will explain. Yeah. I will explain. Is your gamma relatively zero-dimensional over S or is it over? Yeah, yeah. Gamma is the relative argument. I don't know. S argument. Relative argument, of course. And do you remember what realizable that funnels mean? We may get to that at the end. Okay. Yeah. So if I don't answer that question, it's because I ran out of time. And so please ask me so I can keep talking. Okay, so uninflected. So what this means in practice is that all of the inflection and ramification occur at the mark points in the notes. Is the vector bundle E? The vector bundle is E. Oh, I didn't say that. A realizable vector bundle. You can call it what you want, but you also have to change it here. Okay. Um Okay, so so yeah, my goal is yes what is tau? My goal is, yes, what is tau? Tau is this map from the curve to the arc of that. Again, I will try and explain what that is in a few minutes. Yeah, as I said, pretty much the whole talk is going to be explaining the words in this. All right. But, sorry, that's not the theorem, that's the definition. The theorem is here. But just to be clear, I mean, if I have a smooth curve, then that this equation. Then this E is the same E that you have. That's right, yeah. So for a smooth curve, a logarithmic line bundle is a line bundle, like an argument band. The argon band of a smooth curve is a point. The E is a vector space. And this is the usual linear series. Oh, and I left out something else. Sorry. Some more undefined words are necessary. So this, let me just call this a homothiny vector button. So a vector button. So vector bundle up to homothetic. And I'll try and explain the facts in the okay, so here's the theorem. This is with Logatistela and Firocci. It's a GRD of C over S. So it emits a log smooth cover. Cover by a log scheme. So it's not actually representable, but it's kind of algebraic in this weak sense. It's proper over S. So proper over S and has a two-term abstraction theory. It's over. It's over an irreducible stat, algebraic stat, called V star. So the significance of this is that there is a virtual fundamental class, or a logarithmic virtual fundamental class, I think it would be more appropriate to say. appropriate to say. And it lives in dimension g minus r plus 1 squared times g over s. No d? No d, but that's because I absorbed all of the ramification into the market. Yeah. So it it is there. So it is there, but if we forgot the mark points, you would say it. And you also get a regeneration theorem. So because of this obstruction theory, all irreducible components have dimension, of relative dimension, the same number, or at least the same number, g minus r plus 1 squared g. minus r plus 1 squared g over s. I mean, so this is negative, but the idea is if you forget the mark points, then you would get something with some positive relative dimension over some other base. Okay, so those are the main consequences. Is there a minimal choice for the colour? Is there a minimal choice for what? For what? So it emits a cover. You mean you have a specific cover? Yeah, so these correspond. You can find these covers by giving stability conditions for the space of line models. Will that change B star? Not really, not in an important way. I mean, you could make it change B star, but those are kind of an anodyne from a long run of research. Yeah, yeah. From the long run of the market. Yeah, I guess it doesn't take that. Do you know how your vector bundles are related? I mean, the short version is not really, but the building showed up in Lynn's talk, and it'll show up here. So when you said earlier, in the definition, the stack. In a definition, it's stacked on log scheme and reached topology. We can, there are probably many choices, but let's say the strict et al. topology speak probably. And do you have logical descent? Yeah, I mean the obstructions are all in the line bundle. It's kind of algebraic relative to the line level. Okay, so. Okay, so excuse me. So in this definition one, two, three, so where is the data of the ramification points? Hold on. So the ramification points, you can see them in the Argentan. They're marked in the Argentan. And this vector bundle on the Argentan knows about them in a sense. So for a smooth curve, then Gamma is the divisor of all ramifications? Effectively. Effectively, CPU. But you have not specified the ramification sequences yet. You have taken the union of all possibilities. It's not funny. No. Yeah, yeah. So fixing a ramification sequence is like, it is a locally closed condition. And those could be components of these things. Yeah, so we'll see how those ramification sequences are encoded in just a second. Yeah, so what we Yeah, so what I want to do is talk about the Eisenberg-Harris definition of limit linear series and maybe tell you the story of how we should have come up with this definition. So how interpreting the physical hair is in the linear series might in a modular way might lead you to this. So this is a beautiful, simple definition. So for C, a curve of compact type, meaning it's notable that the dual graph is a tree. Um in LLS oh sorry, I ignored the notician. So let's say V is the, or sorry, C V is the curve associated with vertex, the dual graph. Right, so as we can this. This, and what does this have? We've drawn it in good order, something like that. So, one of these vertices, B, might give us a component, CB. So, for each CB, we give an L V and E V, which is a GRD and C V, and then there's a condition. CB, and then there's a condition that the ramification sequences, so if A0 less than A1 less than AR and B0 with DR are the vanishing sequences at so V and W, these are connected by an edge. By an edge. So these are the vanishing sequences at this edge. And then, let's see, B, let's write it this way. A i plus b r minus i is equal to d. And I should have said refine in a linear series here. Okay. So let's just So let's just try and take this definition and make it more categorical. Um okay, so uh Okay, so the linear series EV on C V, this map, gets us a filtration and the edge EV give us a filtration on EV by vanishing order by vanishing order so At E. So at this node right here, that response to E. Okay, so let me write it this way. So we have EBN plus 1, so we have a similar filtration on W. So the matching Of vanishing orders, this condition, let's just put this here, this condition star is equivalent to saying that if I take the associated graded vector space of EV with respect to this variable, that's isomorphic to the associated graded. Graded W, but I reverse the grading and shift by D. Just like those vector spaces are isomorphic, and this is a, I don't consider it's a graded isomorphism. Because the graded degrees in which you see something non-zero here are exactly the vanishing orders. Um oh no. That AI plus B R minus I equals D condition, is that just saying that the ramification map is the usual free deformability condition? Yes, essentially. Encoded with options. I mean, just yeah, based on short answer, yes. Okay. Okay, so let me digress for a few moments and talk about Arden Cons and try to answer the question about what an Arden fan is. Okay, so Art and Cohens. So there were only two Artin Cohen's. Alright, so there are only two articen codes that I will need. Uh the first one is theta. Um so this is this portion of A1 by um G that's a stack. Wait, we had a different notation for this. Yeah, that's true, we did. This is Halper Leisner's fault. That's right. Yeah, but it came from Olson, so from uh I mean, there are too many things called A. There's too many things called theta. There's two disease called theta. This is the only thing called theta. I'm going to call it A theta. Okay, maybe this is an appropriate moment to tell the story about them. For some reason, the organizers didn't invite me to talk at Dan's conference. So, the story about these art intenses, Dan and I were writing this paper, and Dan started talking about these art intensities and what they do with these art impensions. I figured this is something that he didn't. I figured this is something that he and Mark had cooked up and talked about for a long time. So he wrote this paper about Barton fans. Oh, God, that's a stupid name. They should have been Olson fans, right? And then some years later, Dan and I were talking on the phone, and Dan said, you know, we really should have named them Olson fans. So apparently we named them, and it's our fault. But yeah, somehow in our hearts, I've heard the name Mark. I've heard the name Martin fans, Justice. Yeah, I know that. It's a little painful. M, because not in anything to call M, right? M? Yeah. Okay. All right, so what this thing looks like is it has two points. One of them has GM has gone on work as a huge. Has GM has not an orphan drive, so this is a BGM seen on the side. And the other one is just an ordinary point. And I drew it this way to say that this ordinary point is open and it specializes to the PGF point. Another way of thinking about this thing, which I think is helpful, is as pairs LS, where L is an invertible sheath, or a line vertical. And S is a section. So a map into theta gives you a line bundle on whatever the domain was and a section of that line bundle. So this point over here is where that section is non-zero, and this point over here is where the section did zero. Okay, the other art and cone that I need is built from theta by gluing it, another copy of theta, along with Another copy of theta, along with BGM. But BGM is moduli space of line bundles. And so this has an automorphism by minus one. So the line bundle goes to its dual. So that's how we glue those. Is this somehow thought of as P1, quotient GM? No. Think of it as a nodal rational curve. Okay, cool. This is A1 union A1 over 0 divided by G acting with opposite weights. Okay, so the theorem that already came up the other day, I guess yesterday, is this theorem of Klyashko, which classifies the vector bundles on Vector bundles on theta. So a vector bundle on theta is the same thing as a filter vector space. So a space with a filtration indexed by the integers, increasing filters. Oh, okay, so I wasn't careful here when I wrote this, because I wanted to make this an increasing filtration. But you need to negate the dimension order to do that. But when I think about the vanishing order filtration, the increasing filtration so that it matches this. In other words, this EB is the vector bundle on figure. Okay, so the next observation is that when I have a vector bundle on theta and I restrict it to this s equals zero notice, what this does is to take the associated gradient. So this is the gradient, if I think about it, as a filter. So we have this here. So we have this here. This now says that if I take EV, thinking about this as a vector blend of 1 theta, and I restrict to this S equals 0 locus, let me just write the PgM, that it's isomorphic to EW, restricted to the PGM, as long as I'm reversing the order of the grading. So what that corresponds to is this negation isomorphism, except there's also the shift. Uh except there's also the shift. So this is actually twisted by L to the D. In other words, if I take EV and EW twisted by L to the D, this pair is the vector bundle on this other. This other argument, theta, union theta. Okay, so this starts to suggest another way of packaging the data in Isaacled and Harris's definition as some kind of system of vector bundles on something that's glued together from a bunch of these thetas. I should say that now. I should say that now. Okay, so talk about Argenteans. So I don't want to talk about this in general, but if C is a nodal curve, We can build the Arden fantasy by gluing together theta for each marking of C. Uh X C and theta union theta code is PGM for each node. This is different from the way we put A2 modulo. No, this thing is a base change because it's a fiber of that A2 modulo gm squared. Oh, you're taking it fiber whatever X. Yeah, I just want to describe one of a point. Yeah, so it's important. Yeah, so it's important that this works in families, so what Dan is saying has to be done, but just for simplicity of the presentation, I'm going to do this just over the point. Okay, so maybe some kind of a picture. So maybe if we had a curve like this, what you would do is This, what you would do is you have one point for each component, and then for each node, you would have a BGM. So there would be a BGM here, and those will specialize. And then for this self-node, you'll have another BGM. But you need two specializations here to reflect the two different brands. Reflect the two different branches here. Then HAL topology, you can build two specializations, two HAL specializations, right? And that's what they were doing. Okay, so this suggests that the Eisenberg-Harris data give a vector bundle E. E by gluing together by the procedure described there, E on gamma argument. But I mean, if you want this to be really canonical, there's something still a little bit annoying here. I wonder if anybody spotted it. But there was a little bit of a choice. This was not symmetrical. What happened here when I was doing this gluing? I chose to adjust W, EW, rather than to adjust NB. So I would like these actually to be isomorphic rather than to put in this twist. And this is where this homothety idea comes from. Okay, so this. Okay, so this suggestion I just made depends on the choice of the vertex in order to get a single vector bundle on this table. The army fan that you've defined here, because of the way that you've glued it together, it's not actually an artifact in the old definition. No, that's okay. So it's a fiber of an ardent fan. Yeah, but it's not. So it's not that. No, it's a relative ardent fan. It's not lock smooth in the absolute sense. It has two irregular components. Over a point, it's not. No, it's not an art in the way two torque varieties go to. No, it's not a torque. No, yeah, okay. So yeah, it's not an absolute art. It's a relative art and fan over a point of block size. Over appointment blocks. Over appointment blocks, right? Yeah, yeah. But in that case, I've confused myself. Sorry. I'm confused because I'm an art fan, I feel like I know what the vector moments are. But here, I don't know what the vector moments are. If there's topology in the dual graph, I don't know. Uh-huh. Yeah, that's a problem. Okay. It's a problem. And yeah. Well, ask me later and I will try and say more about that. Try and say more about that. Okay, yeah, so for each vertex, we get a vector bundle on gamma, but the problem is I want this not to depend on the vertex, you know, I don't want to favor my children over others. over others. So what are what are the using the vertex to orient all the edges and then using that to decide where to put the L? Is that the idea? Yeah, that's right. I pick one vertex and then I twist every other EW by whatever I need to to make it agree with the starting one. Then you're so you're also using compact type again. I mean When you're having many physical stuff. Yeah, that's right. So, what was the introduction? Are you assuming C is compact type? Well, at this point, yeah, we're still doing Isabel-Harris limit linear series, so yes. But let's rectify this by making this a homophytic vector bundle. So the definition is that a homophytic vector bundle On the scheme is a torsor. It's not necessarily a scheme. Yeah, okay, a log thing is a torsor under MX group tensor GL. GL, let's see. I'm going to make it r plus one right now. O, and this is tensor over O star. So the tensor is my notation for the push-out of groups. So I don't want to try and define all of the things that go into a blog structure right now. The people who know about blog structures will know what. Will know what this thing is. But what you need to know is that this implies that this L of the VGM is trivial as a sort of induced MX group torsor is trivial. So that this gluing, the one I just erased. Uh tensor with this L to the D. This gluing is actually, I can suppress this if I make this an isomorphism from the queue on this. How far is this from like the Osserman perspective? How far is this from the Osserman perspective of the linked gross finalists? Yeah, it's very much inspired by that. In fact, that's kind of where this all began. You can interpret what Austrian does in this language. And what's interesting is this realizability condition. He kind of gives a different perspective on the realizability condition than we have. So, if I get to the point where I can explain what's going on there, I'll try and say something in the word also and perspective says as well. Okay. Okay, so now I've explained the homothertic vector bundle. I should explain the logarithmic line bundle. Oh, one more thing about the, which I think is. About the, which I think is. I lost track of what L was. What's that? What's after the definition? What is it that implies L on VGM? Which L? Oh, I'm sorry. I used L in two different ways. This was the tautological bundle of the VGM. This was the moduli space of line bundles, and this tautological one becomes true. But how is that related to the homothetic vector bundle? The homothetic vector bundle is glued together. Vector bundle is glued together using transition functions from here. This L is twisting by L. I can think of it as transition function coming from M glu. And then the GLR plus one is neutral vector from transition functions. I kind of smash them together into one thing. So in case this notation doesn't make sense, let me just write it a different way. So I have O star inside of GL plus 1 of O. Oh, uh, and then uh I can put that inside of mgroup, and I push out. And so this is the thing that I call the mgroup type script, which is the workplace model. Can I say this in terms of something? Can I think about this in terms of some kind of determinant being trivial? No, I don't think so. I don't think so. Isn't it because L comes from the PL function? Yeah, yeah, exactly. So L comes from the log structure here. I'm trying to hide the log structure as much as I can, but you're not letting me. Okay, so the one more thing I wanted to tell you was this was a push-out, so there's a map to mbar group, just the quotient m group by O star, mbar group. And the consequence of this is The consequence of this is that E, so if E is a homophetic vector bundle, it has an associated land bar group torsor E bar and And E-bar is a more familiar thing. So E-bar corresponds to a line limbo, a tropical lime limel on Troston. And so a way you can think about these data is saying, so for every distributor section, Section of this tropical line bundle, so alpha, we get an honest vector bundle near alpha. And so this homothetic vector bundle is a system of vector bundles that are indexed by piecewise linear sections of the tropical lineman. So, a system of vector buttons in the honest sense are indexed by these visible intersections. Okay. In the Eisenman-Harris case, this is just the twist. It's very interesting. Yeah, so this thing now keeps track of every possible twist. Every possible twist. And Eisenhower and Harris focused just on the twists that concentrate degree D on one component and degree zero on every other component. Then this is really closer to the ostrich. Yeah. Yeah. Um okay um okay so I have a question to like mobile and look at like something a bit similar to the Something a bit similar to the founder condition. Yeah, so that's that is kind of the realizability condition that I that I keep referring to. Yeah. So yeah, so let me defer that for a few more minutes. Let's see if I can say a little bit more. So a few remarks. So one is that this homothety vector bundle This homothety vector bundle gives you a tropical linear series just by itself in the sense of Jensen and Payne. So you don't really, the rest of the data of the logarithmic linear series aren't there. This thing by itself is enough to find this character linear series. The other thing is that The other thing is that by this paper of Kadman and Mannon that came up at the Anstock, the realizable homophetic vector bundles with a fixed realization are the same thing. Are the same thing, CDs data are the same thing as maps from the tropicalization of C into the building PGLR plus R. The reason it's PGL and not GL is exactly the homothety. The home 30. With fixed realization. So fixed general funders. So you imagine some deformation of this vector bundle. This was over this Arden fan, this graph. You deform that out to a smooth Arden fan, so where it has just one point. And if you want to specify the vector bundle on that smooth fiber, then you look. That smooth fiber, then you look at the homophetic vector bundles that have that particular smooth fiber, and those correspond to maps. Do you work on what Johalberg Meisner calls? Oh, I forget wh what uh he calls it. Uh the the uh tech uh arc XY model of the thing. What will look theta? xy minus 5? Oh, yeah, so that's the theta union theta thing. Yeah, that's right. But this kind of object is building is a special case of a general thing that Public MyScript does for a general stack in place of EPGL R plus 1. I just can't remember the Woody calls it. Okay, so with the time that remains, I want to say something about semi-stable reduction for the line bundle and where this homothy vector bundle comes from as you degenerate the curve in the linear series. So let's title this semi-stable reduction. So we're going to be over a base, which is definitely more. And let's imagine we're trying to generate a line bundle on this frame. So this is C over S. And I have some line bundle, L eta, over the general parameter. So this is Eta, so we'll see. Eva, this would be C. So this is a line number. So if we try and degenerate this, I'm sure you're all familiar with the fact that you have many different limits that correspond to twists by the two components here. But there's an interesting way to think about this. So if I let's call this point Call this point. Let's call the generic point here Q. And let's think about our line bubble, which is built from transition functions. And just think about what are the limits of those transition functions as we approach this point. Q is a generic point of C eta? Yeah, that's okay. Yeah, so let's think about those transition functions. So a priori, they live in O C. O C Q star. Oh, sorry, let's write it on the cube. Yeah, that's the star. OCQ star. But I kind of want transition functions that live in OCP star. I mean, that's not what I have. But what I can do is divide this by the kernel of O C star O C Stars star O C T star to sorry this means the stalk and then this one needs the fiber. So I divide by this kernel and this thing is exactly the thing that shows up in block geometry. This is So in log geometry, this is MC group at the fiber. So X. So what I do is I take the units in this general fiber, and then I divide out by the units that go to 0 that are regular, like the regular units that go to 1. And that gives me some collection of things. And effectively, what this does is this includes Includes the usual OC C star plus zero and infinity. So you can have gluing that could be a zero or pole. And it remembers, when you have a zero or infinity, it remembers the order of zero or pole and a leading coefficient. And a leading coefficient. Okay, so this is sort of like a canonical sort of transition function that you get for degenerating line bundle. And this suggests that maybe you should define the limit of the line bundle to be just a thing whose transition functions come from this instead of from O start group. So that's the definition of a logarithmic line bundle. Jonathan, how much more data is it to get a charging free sheep on this question platform? So I d it feels almost the same. I've never worked it out really carefully, but yeah, it seems like if you sort of forget this order and mean coefficient information, just remember it was zero to infinity, it seems like that might work. I'm not sure. So, the definition for the microphone is a very good thing. So the definition for a log line model is, let's just say, a realizable MC group. So we have this realizability thing. This is the founded monodrome that came up a minute ago. Okay, and Okay, and a fear with Sam is that logarithmic white bundles are parameterized by something you can call y pick. And this is proper, smooth kind of group. But our the and has a log smooth cover. By the load scheme. So it's not representable. I'm sure you know that there is no compactification of PIC. That is representable by a scheme, but if you allow this sort of log-smooth cover idea, it's sort of oh yeah, not even by an algebraic Zach of the log. Okay, so. Um okay, so uh so similarly, uh uh L has this associated tropical line bundle L bar. And one way you can think about L is L is a system of invertible sheet of line levels indexed Indexed by piecewise linear sections on the point okay so so the the last thing I want to tell you is is how you get the The vector bundle up to homothety from the degenerating line bundle. So we have this degeneration. We have some EDA and L Eda. I would like to watch them degenerate and see what we get. So we got this log line bundle, L. And the question is: how do we get the vector bundle on the vector here? And it's really a straightforward procedure. So this system one knows then called the alpha, and next will be specific intersection. And if I pick some point P here, specialized to by Q, so maybe Q so generic points. So I can look at One of my aspects of the line bundle, L alpha. So this is just some line bundle that extends L. And this sits inside of, and I'm looking at its stock at P here. So this sits inside of, well, eta, but I could take its stock at Q. So the structure, the local ring at P is a dBr, and this thing is. And this thing is a, therefore, a lattice in this vector space. A model of, so this is a vector space over the fraction field, and this is a module of a DBR that sits inside. And we had E eta sitting inside of here, right? This was a linear series. So I just take the map to L and restrict to the canary point. Strict and canarify. And so that sits inside of there. And then I just take the intersection. So E alpha at P, I just define for the E intersection. It'd be eta intercepted. Sorry. So what I didn't understand the question. So So it is a space of sections, right? So E eta is, so this is the general fiber of this homothety vector bundle. In the general fiber, the curve is just, the trolley curve is just a point, so this is just a vector space. And I'm going to give you all of these different, remember, the vector bundle of the homothety is a bunch of these different aspects, a bunch of vector bundles indexed by these b-squeeze linear sections of E-bar. So I'm going to. So I'm going to give you that bunch of vector spaces for every piecewise linear section. And this is the way I build the vector space. I just take the things that restrict things. So for compact type, alpha is just a twist? That's right. It's just a twist. It's just a unique confusion. Yeah, even in the non-compact type, it's just a twist. It's just a choice of line level that represents that extends that. So for every choice, I'm giving you. Every choice, I'm giving you a vector space. Yeah, so think about this as the sections. I have this line bundle here, and I take the sections that these sections of EEA in general fiber that are regular, that fit inside of this particular model of L, this particular aspect. I used the notation, somehow the notation is suggesting that E eta is like a sub-bundle of L eta. So at P, the start at P. So at P, the stock at P. Yeah, so I'm just looking at the stock. So I have these global sections and I restrict them to the stock. So I'm just giving you this bundle by giving you all of its stocks. So at this point, this was a PBR, but at this point, at a node, it's a little more complicated. You need a little more work to make this full thing free, but this is essentially the procedure. And okay, so I take just a moment or two more. Just a moment or two more. So, the point here is that the aspects, the different choices of piecewise linear functions, the tropical line model that will index the aspects of E, is the same as the tropical line model that indexed the aspects of L. That is, E bar, when I pull it back from the tropical curve, or from the argent hand, to the curve. To the curve is the same as the stellar bar. So if I can return to the definition, I don't have it written anymore, but the definition had this part 3 that involves the map E to tau upper star of L. What this really means is we give an isomorphism, tau upper star E bar. E bar isomorphic to L bar, so those two tropical line bundles are the same. And for all piecewise linear sections, alpha of that tropical line bundle, you should give an honest map of modules from E of alpha into L R star L of alpha. So this is so that's what it actually means. Okay, I guess I'm out of time, so let me just end by showing you a picture of one non-trivial calculation we've done of these things. So this is the space of G13s on the On the um the genus worker. Yeah, so this is this is the picture. Uh so what I what we did is to tropicalize the picture. So down here are the The pictures down here are the G03s. And every G13 you can draw inside of the space of G03s by just all of the G03s that are inside of that G13. And so this picture, each one of these little things shows you the corresponding shape of the family of G03s inside of the corresponding G13. So this is the space. Thank you very much. Question. So in this picture, you're just showing us the cross-classizations of the gene entries. And there's some algebraic thin motor line. So there is something I missed in this. So, in the definition of this arcing cap, you took care of all the ramification at smooth points, all the smooth points and all the components. Yeah, so do not allow any variation anymore. Right. Right. Yeah, so we fix them all. I mean, eventually. Then you are going to get something over an NG, a huge NG with a large number of points. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you can forget them, and then you get something. But eventually, I think. Yeah, eventually I think we'll get rid of that, but but that just made defining stability for this modular problem much easier. So hopefully we'll get rid of that eventually. And what is the two-stim expression? Oh, that's just the easiest. Yeah, so it's easiest to get it over this space. So this is going to confuse the thing. Can I put away the picture? The obstruction theory, yes. So you so the obstruction theory is relative, and this is one of the things that's unfortunate about this. So you have this GRD of C over S, and this maps to this B star of gamma over S, which is the realizable. Homothetian vector bundles. So it's relative for this, and actually I'll also fix the line level. And since these two have the same tropicalization, I need to put this over tropical print. All of this. All of this is this. This you can basically ignore. So I'm fixing the vector bundle and the line bundle. And so the obstruction theory is for deformations of the map. So this thing is the collection of C, L, and E. Here we have the collection of C, L, E, and Phi. So we want to figure out how many ways there are to deform phi while we're holding what we're going to. Deform phi while we're holding the remaining data fixed. And this is classified so I have this map from E to tau lower star L. I can think about that as going from tau upper star E to L. And then this is the same thing as a section of how we start E dual. Answer that L. Answered with L. And so we're deforming this section. And what's neat about this is since these have the same tropicalization, even though this thing is a homothetic vector bundle, this thing is a logarithmic line bundle, this tensor product is just an ominous vector bundle on the curve. And so we're deforming sections of a vector bundle on the curve. So the instruction theory is h1 of c with coefficients in that vector bundle. So in the in the thing that you erased uh with the with the properness, so that E eta in the general fiber, that's like a vector space over a valued field. And so is it the PGL of uh the building of the PGL of that vector space that I get the by mapping so it's like um in particular it's like an affine building, right? Particular, it's like an affine building, right? Not the yeah, yeah, well, okay, so logarithmically or shopping, the athletic building and the spherical building could wrap together into the same object. The spherical building is the general fiber of the whole thing. And it's the PGL of that microwave that is relevant. And so, if I were to think in like a Berkovich analytic point of view, I'm really mad. analytic point of view. I'm really mapping the analytification of the general fiber into this analytification of PGL and observing that the skeletons. Can you make sense of tau low star L as a homophetic quality and then just taunt tau low star L is just a macro cheat? Oh. I wish, yeah, so I made that mistake. Yeah, so I made that mistake for a long time. Yeah, but Tyler Star does does not commute with base change. So yeah, it's I mean, just to some extent you can do that, but I don't know. You can easily make a lot of mistakes that way. I made a lot of mistakes that way. Okay, so I should add mistakes. Okay, I suppose. Yeah, so if I remember correctly, Osirman can give an explicit description of what these limit levels are should be. If the if when you contract all the multiple edges of the dual graph should be a tree. Yeah, the pseudo-compact. Yeah, can you like work beyond that? Like can you tell me if the dual graph is a cycle explicitly what the yeah so I don't know I don't know how explicitly I mean the big the elephant in the room here is like this this V star because it's it's kind of inexplicit and to the extent that you And to the extent that you can make this explicit, yeah, you can describe what they are. I mean, you can, so they're clutching maps for these things. And so you can start with linear series on the components and just glue them together using clutching. But then you have to worry, did you actually get something realizable when you did that? And yeah, that I mean, that's probably a hard thing. If if you wanted to write a computer program to check it, it's probably harder. Him to check it, it's probably harder. And practice better. Alright, so let's thank Jonathan for attending. And we'll be back here at two. You can do the power cut for once. Everyone's like, we have a bunch of this.
