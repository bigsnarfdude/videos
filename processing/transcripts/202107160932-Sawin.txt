For the final talk of the workshop, we're very happy to have Will Sawin from Columbia University, and he'll be speaking on the geometric Mannin's conjectures. Thank you. So I'm going to begin my talk sort of where Adelina left off, which is talking about Manin's conjecture and what it means for geometry. And I'm going to state some different questions. And at the end, I'll talk about some actual Talk about some actual results. So, I want to first briefly go over the conjecture in the number field setting, and then the conjecture in the function field setting, and then the geometric versions of the conjecture that we can make. So we're going to start with a number field K and a smooth projective final variety over K, which we'll call X. And the most important invariant will be R, the rank of the Picard group of X. Of the Picard group of X. And we can state the conjecture kind of laconically as the number of rational points in X over K that don't lie in a thin set whose anti-canonical height is less than T is asymptotic to a constant C times E to the T times T to the R minus 1. Okay, this is sort of a bad statement. Gonna have to explain what all these things are, explain what is the anti-canonical height, what is C, and what is. Canonical height, what is C and what is a thin set? So in the number field setting, we could define the anti-canonical height error K log theoretically. We'll fix a proper model of X over the ring of integers OK. We fix a line bundle on that proper model, which is isomorphic to the anti-canonical bundle when you restrict it to X. And we'll fix a metric on L at each infinite place, which is the R commitment. Infinite place, which is the Archimedean analog of fixing a model. And then we can define the height of x as by taking a non-vanishing section of s of l at x and summing over each place v the logarithm of the vadic absolute value of the section, which is the order of vanishing at the finite places, or this absolute value at the This absolute value at the metric we took at the infinite place. C is a constant, it can be made explicit, but it depends on everything else in sight, in particular depending on L, L and the metric. And the a thin set, by a thin set, I mean the union of the images of a bunch of the k-rational points of a bunch of varieties yi. K-rational points of a bunch of varieties yi, which are either proper sub-varieties of x or irreducible covers of degree greater than one. And you can ask which sub varieties and covers I take. And there's two things to say. One is I can say the list that was given by Lemon, Singupta, and Tanemoto. And the other thing I can say is any sufficiently large finite list should do the trick. When you say a non-vanishing section, Vanishing section. What do you mean by non-vanishing? I mean, it's on S's and non-vanishing at X. Like not so not, you mean vanishing nowhere on the model, X? No. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Just vanishing at this one rational point, non-vanishing at this one rational point. So it could vanish on the integral model of that rational point, it could. Model of that rational point. It could vanish at other rational points, and I don't care about either of those. So if it does vanish into a model of a rational point, that will give me a contribution to this height at that place. Yes. So, but I'm going to go immediately to the function field setting where that part of the definition can be simplified. The other two parts will remain the same. That part can be simplified. So, in a function field setting, we're going to fix. In a function field setting, we're going to fix FQ a finite field, C, a curve over FQ, and X a smooth, projective, simply connected funnel variety over FQ join C. And we'll let R be the rank of the Picard group of X. Then the number of FQ adjoints the rational points, which are outside a thin set, and I should have anti-canonical height less than T. Or I should say, this should be equal. Or I should say, this should be equal to z, maybe. Well, it's the same thing. It's asymptotic to c times q to the t times t to the r minus one. And so the way we're going to define anticonical height now, the first two steps are similar. We're going to take a proper model of x over c and a line bundle on the proper model, which is isomorphic to the anti-canonical bundle of the generic fiber. But then we define the height by extending this rational point. This rational point to a section of this proper model, and just pull back the line bundle along that section and take the degree. So, that can be the definition of anti-conical height. You can express this degree as a sum of local terms if you want, but it's just the degree of alignment. Oh, do I know an example? Uh, oh, do I know an example of a smooth projective fauna variety that is not simply connected? Uh, I don't off the top of my head. I thought that I mean, the theorem that a smooth projective fauna is simply connected only works in characters, I think the proof only works in characters zero. And I assume that there was an example, but I don't know if that's actually true. Um uh but um you sometimes have to be careful about this simplicity. Sometimes have to be careful about this simply connectedness. Yeah, okay, it's open. Well, anyways, let's try not to make too many like open questions at once. So let's separate this simply connectedness question by assuming things are simply connected. Although maybe I'll forget that later in the talk. So this has shown up to an extent in previous lectures. To an extent in previous lectures, I want to go over how we can now interpret that formula as the geometric statement using lang phi. And so the first step is to make the moduli space of sections of x where we restrict the pullback of this line bundle to have degree E. And we'll call that sec E of x. Whenever I put a prime on the moduli space, I'm going to restrict to sections where the generic point does not lie in a thin set. Set. And then just by definition of moduli space, the number, and I guess by the violation of the criterion of properness, the number of FQ points in sec E prime of X is going to equal the number of FQ adjoined C points in X that are outside a thin set and that have anti-canonical height E. So then we can apply line Z, which roughly says that irreducible varieties of dimension N have Q to the. Varieties of dimension n have q to the n f q points. And we conclude that the number, the sec E prime of x should have roughly a constant times e to the r minus one irreducible components of dimension e plus o of one. Because we only gave a formula up to a constant for the number of rational points. Now you can, by examining carefully that constant, you can make these both more precise. You can figure out what the O of one factor is. Figure out what the O of one factor is, and you can figure out how many irreducible components there should be. But it's easier to figure those out by looking at the geometry. And it's especially easy if you just work with constants. So if we assume that X is defined over FQ, we'll take our model to be just X times C. Can I ask a question about the previous? I mean, you're not claiming. The previous, I mean, you're not claiming this conclusion as a you're not saying it's a theorem or anything, you're just saying there are concepts of consequence. I mean, you could have more irreducible components of lower dimension, maybe. I mean, a priori. And in fact, have irreducible components of lower dimension, as I'll explain on the next slide. Yes, so this is only, this is like, what is the nicest possible geometric explanation for this arithmetic phenomenon? For this arithmetic phenomenon that we believe for arithmetic reasons. Okay, okay. We're going to look at what would be a really nice explanation and not with a necessary consequence. And so, but there will be a separate geometric reasons for believing it. So the so we're just working with the moduli space of morphisms from C to X, where the pullback of the anti-canonical. Where the pullback of the anti-canonical bundle has degree E. And so the tangent space, we can apply deformation theory. The tangent space to the space of morphisms is global sections of the pullback of the tangent bundle. And so we can calculate by Riemann-Rock, the expected dimension of the global sections of the pullback of the tangent bundle is equal to, we expect it to equal the Euler characteristic of the pullback of the tangent bundle, which is n times 1 minus g plus the degree of. times one minus g plus the degree of the determinant or n times one minus g plus e. So when I say this is the expected dimension, it's a theorem that the dimension is at least this. So we know the dimension can't be lower than n times 1 minus g plus e. And it's reasonable to guess that h1 should probably vanish for a typical curve. And therefore the dimension should equal n times 1 minus g plus e. And so that's the right prediction for the dimension. And if we're looking at components, the way to figure out the number of components is to find some invariants that break the moduli space up into smaller moduli spaces. So what you can do is if you have a curve C mapping to X, this has a numerical class beta. We can look at its intersection with each divisor. With each divisor. And this is constant on each component. And if there's a Brouwer group on X, then we can integrate Brouwer classes on X over the curve. And that will be a topological invariant as well. So we'll call a class beta giving the data of the intersection numbers and the Brouwer stuff, a numerical class beta. And so for each of those, we have a component. And the only ones that will be not. And the only ones that will be not, that will give us curves of degree E will be the ones where the intersection number with the anti-canonical bundle is E. And we also want these classes to be nef, because if their intersection number with the divisor is negative, that will force the curve to lie in that divisor. And so the component will be contained in the fin set. So we're looking at the number of nef classes beta with intersection number. With intersection number with E. And so the NEF classes form a cone, and the intersection number E is like a slice of the cone, and you get a space whose side of dimension r minus one, slice whose side length is proportional to E. So the volume is proportional to e to them are r minus one. And then the number of possible classes is like the number of lattice points in that, which is Which is e to the r minus, which is proportional to e to the r minus one. So that explains, so we explain why it should be e plus o of one dimension, and we can explain why it should be proportional to e to the r minus one, both using geometric ideals. So the simplest explanation for why there should be this many components is if each class beta, or at least most classes beta, have at least one component. So this is one formulation of the geometric model. So this is one formulation of the geometric Mones conjecture, which I think is essentially what was worked out, what was written down by Lemon and Tanemoto, building on work of Baharev, which is that, could it be true that for most NAF curved classes of beta, whose intersection number of the anti-canonical bundle is E, the moduli space of morphisms from C to X of class beta is geometrically irreducible of the expected dimension n. Of the expected dimension, n times 1 minus g plus 8. I think Brower is for when there's torsion in the H3 of X rather than for when C is behaving weird. In response to Jason's question in the comments. So this is one possible, this is one nice geometric statement we can get by thinking about Monin's conjecture. And but there's more. So the way I'm going to generalize before I talk about the case of Before I talk about the case of an arbitrary non-constant family of X, I want to talk about one special case, which is when we take the constant family and blow up. So this is a case where X, our variety, is defined over FQ. But our model we choose is X, we sort of choose an intentionally weird model. We're going to take the product X times C and blow up at endpoints. Endpoints. And so, what that will split this modulized of sections into two components, depending on whether the section goes through the exceptional divisor or the rest of the fiber at these endpoints. And we're interested in the more interesting one, which is the component where the section does go through. The section does go through the exceptional divisor. And so, this is the same thing as a moduli space of maps from C to X with a given curve class, which send some fixed list of points X1 through XM in C to some fixed list of points Y1 through YM in X. And if you like thinking about this modulized space of genus G curves in degree with M marked points on X, With M marked points on X of degree beta, you can express this as the fiber of the natural map from that modulized space to the moduli space of genus G curves with M marked points abstractly times the M natural evaluation maps to X. And so the expected dimension in the setting, we've added N conditions at each point, at each of M points. So the expected dimension is N times 1 minus G minus M plus E. Plus E. And the one thing I like about this example is it's very straightforward to see that this is not always irreducible of the expected dimension. It does not always do the ninthest possible thing, even when like E is very large. And so the reason for this is that when X is a product, say X is just P1 cross P1, in that case, a curve class beta is just a bi-degree. We're going to tell the degree of the map to the first P1. To tell the degree of the map to the first P1, degree of the map to the second P1. And so, this modulized space of maps from P1 to P1 cross P1 with extra conditions supplies as a product of two different spaces. One of them will have expected dimension 1 minus G minus M plus 2E1, the other one 1 minus G minus M plus 2E2. And so if I, or I guess there's no, okay, well, from a curve gen is G, right? From a curved unit rather than from P1. So, if either E1 or E2 is small relative to M, then the expected dimension of one of these two mod value spaces is negative. So it can never be irreducible of the expected dimension. It's always either empty or it has dimension at least zero, which is way too large. When we take the product, we know that the other one must have at least the expected dimension. So the product is also either empty. Product is also either empty, which it will be most of the time, or have dimension way too large, which it will be occasional, depending on the values of x. So you can see very clearly that we get problems here, and we get problems specifically when E1 or E2 are small, when we're close to the boundary of the NEF code. I think the point is that you have to be away from the boundary of the NEFCON. Yeah. Yeah, so I'm just this is the simplest explanation I can think of of why you have to be away from the boundary of the NEFCON. Okay. And I'm yeah, I'm just trying to motivate that. But also, I think, I also think that this example is very interesting. So let me try to make a conjecture or at least ask a question, which is specialized for this example. We'll take x, it's moving. We'll take X, this smooth projective Fano variety. We'll fix the natural number M and we'll take beta, a NEF curve class on X, which is far from the boundary of the Nef curve, and how far should depend on X and should depend on M. So like if we choose a metric on the space of curves, which was translation and invariant, we want to know that the distance is at least some function of n. In this case, Of m in this case, are all fibers of this evaluation map from mgm x beta to mgm times x to the m geometrically irreducible of the expected dimension and times 1 minus g minus m plus beta dot kx inverse. So I think this is an interesting kind of test case. Test case of geometric forms of Manny's conjecture to look at. So there are some varieties where this conjecture is not very, where this is not very hard to check. So for projective spaces, this is very easy to check because you're just looking for tuples of polynomials, which take some specific value to some specific points. And it's very easy to do that. And so then one thing I want to point out is I think this behaves very differently when you look at. Behaves very differently when you look at two different methods of answering these kinds of questions about modulated basis of curves on X. If you look at this geometric from arithmetic method that was used in work of Browning and Vischer or Browning and myself, then it seems to me like this should give a positive answer for any X. If it basically, if it works for M equals zero, then it should probably work for all M. For all m um because what arithmetically what this condition that passes through a particular point corresponds to is some kind of congruence condition. And normally, if you can solve a number theory problem, you can solve it together with a congruence condition in some reasonable level of generality. Or rather, so I should say here that I guess Adelina did the case genus zero and m equals two for hypersurfaces or for cubic hypersurfaces. Hypersurfaces or for cubic hypersurfaces, if you look at curves through passing through exactly two chosen points, that was in our talk from yesterday. But for like for larger values of M, I don't see kind of any obstruction to using this method. But for geometric methods, other than the kind of kind of the most elementary ones, there does seem to be a significant obstruction, at least to getting this for arbitrarily large values of M. This is for arbitrarily large values of m because the sophisticated geometric methods usually involve some version of bend and break. They involve studying not just the moduli space of smooth curves, but the moduli space of curves allowing singularities. And so the natural thing to do is to compactify these moduli spaces by allowing stable curves. But when you do that, the fibers have the wrong, can easily have the wrong dimension. Have the wrong dimension if you look at components where you have two different stable curves intersecting and one has a very low degree. So I would be interested to see how far you can get by geometric methods on this kind of problem. I guess in particular, you could try the method that Jason Starr was talking about in the very first talk, where you randomly slice and you get a Randomly slice, and you get a generic hypersurface. And then, probably, if you randomly slice, you can also treat your points as generic points, and maybe that will be helpful. I don't know. So this is my kind of okay, so this question is like a natural stopping point before we go to the next case I want to talk about, which is about an almost arbitrary family. So, I want to think just about an arbitrary proper variety over C where the generic fiber is smooth final. But it's actually really nice to make the assume this variety is regular so that all the sections have to lie in the smooth locus. And we're looking at sections, but all the sections lie in the smooth locus. We may as well. The smooth locus, we may as well pass the smooth locus and so assume our variety, our variety is smooth, and then stop assuming it's proper. So get rid of all the singular points in the special fibers. And so then our fibers might have multiple connected components. Every section is only going to go through one connected component at a time. So we could just like restrict attention to one connected component, delete the remaining ones, and just assume that the fibers are connected. Connected. And then in this setting, we can form the moduli space of sections of this map X to C whose image has a given class beta. And this will be empty unless the intersection number of beta with the class of a fiber is one. So the nice cone to work with is the cone of classes that are nef and have intersection one with a fiber. And so we'll be staying. Fiber. And so we'll be staying away from the boundary of this cone. And so, because the relevant tangent bundle, relative tangent bundle shows up when we're calculating the tangent space of this modulate space by deformation theory, we're going to use the relative anti-canonical bundle here to define the degree. It seems like the nicest bundle in shoots. So let me try and ask my question in a more Ask my question in a more in this context. We're going to take a smooth morphism with connected geometric fibers where the generic fiber is projective and final. We're going to fix a curve class on X whose intersection number with a fiber is one, which is sufficiently far from the boundary of that cone. And we can ask: is this modular space of sections of class beta outside a thin set geometrically irreducible of the Geometrically irreducible of the expected dimension n times one minus g plus this intersection number. Um, and then in addition to that, we would like to have some information about the classes which are close to the boundary of the cone. We would like to know that those moduli spaces are not of such enormous dimension or of such an enormous number of irreducible components that they swamp the total count. But they swamp the total count. So I think the reasonable thing to ask is that for arbitrary beta, is the dimension going to be a most expected dimension plus big O of one, you know, depending on x, a constant depending on x? And if we look at the number of irreducible components that lie within an O of one distance of the boundary of the cone and have degree E, should that total number of irreducible components be little O of E to the R minus one? Little O of e to the r minus one. And so, if those were true, if you kind of plug in this naive line V, where an n-dimensional component corresponds to Q to the n rational points, you would get the correct asymptotic. And so I think this is similar to the conjecture made by Sho and Tanimoto in some of their recent work about Menin's conjecture for vibrations, but is also But is also maybe different in some of the details. So, okay, with response to Jordan's question, so is there a way to think about which points of X with Q are close to the boundary of the NEF cone? Okay, well, Emmanuel Per is answering it because it's his idea. Answering it because it's his idea. Let me maybe say quickly because it's important. And if you want to give more details in chat, the point is you choose a bunch of different height functions on X for associated different line bundles, and you can graph the height in like the values of those n different height functions. Each rational point gives you a point in Rn, and those will lie in or close to the Neph cone, and you can throw away the ones that are near the cone. The ones that are near the boundary of the NEF code. So there is a very close analog, which Emmanuel can tell you about. So the next thing I want to talk about is how do we make this statement more? More precise, give a more exact formula. Because it's not literally true that a variety of dimension n over fq has q to the n rational points. The correct statement, it is q to the n times 1 plus big O of q to the minus 1 half. And so that's an error term that's pretty big. If you look at forms of Vinny's conjecture with pairs of Of Vinni's conjecture with pairs explicit constant, they're usually true with error terms much smaller than that. So we would really like a geometric statement that explains this more precise arithmetic statement. And so a version of this was done by Ellenberg and Venkitash, who said, well, we should instead of using like Lang Wei, we should use cohomology because the Leshit's. Because the Lefschetz point formula gives an exact formula for the number of FQ points of a variety in terms of its compactly supported cohomology groups. And what the cohomact is supported cohomology groups should be, we're already sort of guessed at this point. If you look at, which we've all discussed previously, if you look at Cohen, Jones, and Siegel, they said that the low degree cohomology of the moduli space of maps from P1 to X should look like the Should look like the low-degree cohomology or the model space of continuous maps from the complex points of P1 to the complex points of X, which is the same thing as the space of continuous maps from the sphere to the complex points of X, which is something that topologists like to study and have already given formulas for the cohomology of. And so if you take And so, if you take these formulas by topologists for the cohomology of the space of continuous maps from S2 to X of C, and you pretend that these make sense, not just over the complex numbers, but over finite fields, and then you make some kind of plausible guess for how Frobenius should act on the cohomology groups. Then they match exactly via the Lefschetz formula, Peris' explicit constant in Manin's conjecture. Conjecture. So, do you mind if I ask a question? Of course not. So, these, I mean, low-degree coherency is something it's much with. I saw that when we compute like a paired concept, what matters is like a top degree, no? But I'll talk about that on the next slide. Okay, great. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, somewhere in the middle here. So, okay. So, let's talk about. So let's talk about how to do that in greater generality. And so if we have a smooth morphism X to C of varieties over C, and we have beta class on X, we can look at the space of continuous sections from the complex points of C to the complex points of X, whose image has a given homology class. And we can certainly map the modulated space of. The moduli space of algebraic sections or the moduli space of holomorphic sections to the moduli space of continuous sections. So we can pull back cohomology classes from the moduli space of continuous sections to the moduli space of algebraic sections. So as show pointed out, what we care about, we don't care about the low degree cohomology of the modulate basive sections. We care the high. Sections, we pair the high-degree cohomology with compact supports because compact cohomology with compact supports appear in the Lefschist formula, and it's the high-degree terms that give the biggest contribution because of the Lean's Riemann hypothesis. So, we don't want to ask necessarily if this is an isomorphism in low degree. So, for a smooth variety, concurrent duality gives a relation between the high-degree compactly supported cohomology and the low-degree. Cohomology and the low degree usual cohomology. So, if this modulated space of sections were necessarily smooth, we would just want to know about the low-degree cohomology groups. But it's not literally smooth. And so, a natural thing to do is that there is to observe that there's always a pairing between the low-degree cohomology and the high-degree combat supportive cohomology. They may not be dual, but there is still a bilinear form on them. So, another approach you could take is. So, another approach you could take is to pass to the smooth locus, which is a closed analog of the stuff Pear was doing with freeness. And you could try that also, but I'm not going to talk about that today. Can I ask really quickly? I mean, on the previous slide, I mean, you don't actually expect this continuous map from the space of algebraic sections to continuous sections to be something like a homotopy equivalence because you have. Homotopy equivalence because you have obel maps, right? To the, like, for instance, if the relative Picard is one, then to the Jacobian of C, and you're not seeing that on the continuous side. I mean, that's why the classes of the Jacobian of C show up also in those motivic formulas. But maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe for the chromological degree range you're interested in. If you look at the moduli space of continuous sections, but I don't have a good explanation off the top of my head as to why flat bundles or something. Who knows? Yeah. I mean, if you have a continuous, yeah, if you have a continuous section. Continuous section, and you pick a divisor in the target, you can pull back that divisor, and you get, there's like local intersection numbers, you can get a bunch of, you can get a divisor on C, which might, if your continuous section is like at least smooth, you should get like finally many points like generically or something. And then, and then you can, you get a divisor, and then that will map to the Jacobi. And I think you'll get a continuous map. Jacobian. I think you'll get a continuous map from the mollusphas of continuous sections of the Jacobian. If I just kind of do the same thing. So I think this is right, but it is a question, not a conjecture. So if it's wrong, then you didn't disprove my conjecture. So I think the statement we want has something like the following form. We'll let X to C be a smooth morphism over the complex numbers with connected geometric fibers. With connected geometric fibers and projective phono geometric fiber. We're going to fix an F curve class on X with intersection number with F1. And we're going to look at this trace pairing between the low degree cohomology groups of the moduli space of continuous sections and the high degree cohomology groups of the moduli space of algebraic sections outside of the thin set. So, which degree is determined by Polynque duality, which depends on the dimension. Which depends on the dimension. And so I put the formula for the dimension in the exponent here. And then subtract off. So I want to know: is this pairing a perfect pairing? Is it the case that every class on one side pairs non-trivially with a class on the other side, which would give an isomorphism between each space and the dual of the other? And then the range where it's reasonable to believe this is a perfect pairing depends on how far beta is from the boundary of the NEFCO. And the simplest depends. To the NF cone, and the simplest dependence it could have is an affine dependent. It depends like a constant times it's just debated from the boundary of the NF cone minus some other constant. And so this is, I think, the nicest statement we can hope for. And then we would also like a statement controlling the other classes, in particular controlling the case when beta is close to the boundary enough. Beta is close to the boundary in F con. And so, what we would need there is just a bound on the dimension of the cohomology groups. So, we might hope that the dimension, the cohomology in degree H twice the expected dimension minus I is at most some exponential function in I. C3 divided by I times C4 for constant C3, C4. So, and then if we had the second question. Um, we had the second question in the finite field setting, then you could see that by the left-hand fixed point formula, all the cohomology groups not covered by this first statement would have a small contribution to the count of rational points as long as Q is sufficiently large. Because Delean's Riemann hypothesis bounds the eigenvalues of Rubenius and cohomology, this theme bounds a dimension, and together they bound the trigger. A dimension and together they bound the trace. And so, if this space of individual sections, it unfortunately doesn't exist over the complex numbers, but if this were made to work over a finite field instead of over the complex numbers, I think this statement would give a geometric explanation of Mani's conjecture. Many's conjecture should be a formal consequence of like the finite field analog of this statement, which is like a This statement, which is like a nice, a nice strong property for a geometric conjecture to have, is that it actually just implies the arithmetic analog and isn't merely an analog of it. If anyone has any more questions, I'm happy to discuss them. But in the last span of the talk, I'll say something I actually did. Instead of answering, making much requester. Answering making a bunch of questions, I'm going to try to get some answers. Um, and I'll talk about my joint work with Tim Browning from a little bit ago, where we gave something like a positive answer to question four for low degree hypersurfaces. So, we proved that statement with two caveats. So, the first caveat is that we worked with an affline hypersurface, not a projection. Affine hypersurface, not a projected hypersurface. It was technically a little bit easier for the methods we're doing to work with an affine variety. And you can interpret what we did in terms of a model of this affine hypersurface over P1, which is constant away from infinity and does something a little bit weird at infinity. And it's defined so that sections of this model are the same thing as polynomial maps from A1 to A. thing is polynomial maps from a1 to x of a fixed degree with fixed leading term. This turned out to be the easiest thing to study by the methods we were using, and the paper was already hard enough that we decided to do only the easiest thing. And what we didn't quite show that the compactly supported cohomology was equal to the cohomology of the moduli space's continuous sections of x. What we showed is equal to something that behaves a lot like the model. Behaves a lot like the cohomology of the modulated phase of continuous sections, but might not necessarily be. So, more technically, we show that this high-degree compactly supported cohomology is computed by a spectral sequence. And if you set the differentials in the spectral sequence to zero, then it computes something which looks exactly like the cohomology of the modulus pace of continuous sections. It has the same betting numbers. And certainly in this setting, the Frobenius action is compatible. Trobanius action is compatible with Manini's conjecture because the conjecture is actually known in this set. So in the last few minutes, I want to say a little bit about how we did this. So the first step is to prove the arithmetic statement, to count points on this moduloid space of On this moduloi space of sections of this particular bundle of affine hypersurfaces, which is the same thing as counting tuples of polynomials in one variable over the finite field, satisfying a polynomial equation. And this is by the function field integer analogy we thought a lot about. This is closely related to the problem of counting tubes of integers satisfying a polynomial equation, which was solved in this case by Birch using the circle method. And so we're going to use Method. And so we're going to use the analog of Bursch's strategy to prove the numerical statement. And what we would really like to do at this point is to deduce the cohomological statement from the point counting statement. But this seems totally impossible to me. I have no idea how you could ever do this. And the reason is because you can, you. Is because you can, you know, the cohomology of variety always tells you the number of rational points, but knowing their number of rational points only tells you about the cohomology in certain special cases, like smooth projective varieties and a few other examples. And our varieties are not smooth, not projective. They don't fit into any of the other examples either. So it seems totally hopeless to start in the arithmetic world and to like end in the geometric world. So instead, what we have to do is to take the more or less classical arithmetic strategy to prove the theorem and translate every step into an analogous geometric statement. So every time a function appears in the arithmetic setting, we want to replace that function with some kind of sheet, or maybe a complex sheet. And every time a sum or an integral appears in the arithmetic setting, Sum or an integral appears in the arithmetic setting, we want to replace that with a sheaf cohomology group. And then we want to replace every analytic statement that appears in the formula with a geometric statement that and then usually the way we do that is we want the geometric statement to formally imply the analytic statement using the Left School fixed point formula and using the Riemann hypothesis. Riemann hypothesis. And somehow it's not quite true. The geometric statement will apply a slightly weaker form of the analytic statement, but by kind of an irrelevant factor. So that's the tool you can use to sort of guess what the geometric analog of any statement should be. Like, what's the nicest geometric thing that implies the original arithmetic statement? Okay. Okay, I'm not going to be able to go into more detail in the last like three minutes. So now is probably a good place to stop. Thanks for inviting me to speak. Are there any questions for the speaker? Can I just make a comment, Will? So I think you presented this in the last slide as if the actual step two is a sort of expedient you have to resort to because you can't do what's called a potential step two. But I think the actual The potential step two, but I think the actual step two that you do is way better. I mean, like, what's really of most interest is not sort of like so much which facts about geometry you can prove, but the advent of a kind of fully geometric analog to the circle method that presumably can be used for other things. That's much more interesting. So, I endorse actual step two. Oh, well, thank you. Yeah, I mean, it was a lot of work to do. It's a very messy paper. So, I see. Paper, so I certainly and uh, but that's the goal. I care more about the development of that technology than I care about the answer of the irreducibility of those multiplications. That's just a personal, I'm just saying my view on it. Okay. I have a question. So I think you say like it's coincidence. So if we special sequence generates, then you say it's coincide with like a cohomology of a modularized. Is like a cohomology of a modularized space. So, this, I mean, you mean the cohomology of a space of a continuous.
