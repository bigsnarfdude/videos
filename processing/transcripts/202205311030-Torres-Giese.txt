We will going to talk about bidirectional sequential motion plan. So, you want? Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for the invitation, the opportunity to participate in this conference. The plan of the talk is to present the material in a simple way. So, I'm not going to try to go over To go over, let's say, technical calculations at the level of cohomology. So it will be more on presenting basic ideas, in a way inviting to come back to some calculations that were, I guess, active a few years ago, or maybe like a decade ago, and for some reason, people have left behind. And I think this is perhaps a good opportunity to give some inspiration and come back to some of the calculations I'm going to show you. I'm going to show you. So, the title, as you can see, is about bi-directional sequential emotion planning, and I will be focusing on the first keyword, which is a bi-directional concept. So, I'm going to be explaining, of course, what that means. Just to get started, let me just recall some basic definitions. For instance, the sequential topological complexity of a space. Is essentially the sectional category of the multi-evaluation map, and in this case, there are two versions that can be considered. One of them was given by Rudiak. And essentially, the idea is to take the space of trajectories and then essentially select a number of special points in the unity interval and then use them to evaluate a path in X to propose or to provide a tuple in the Cartier. A tuple in the Cartesian product. So that's one way we can define the sequential topological complexity. And there's another version that provides the same invariant. I'm just going to call this E prime for the evaluation. And it's essentially by using multipaths. So J sub S is essentially the joint of a number of copies of the unit interval. And in this case, what we are doing is evaluating. Interval, and in this case, what we are doing is evaluating the endpoints. So these are standard constructions, and of course, the two are related by some simple constructions. Like, for instance, if you have, let's say, a copy of the unit interval with, let's say, just one special point, perhaps at the middle, you can wrap this or fold this into the joint of three copies of the unit interval by simply taking. Simply taking these three special points to the ends by essentially just wrapping, folding the unity interval. And that's essentially the construction that allows you to connect these two constructions. And of course, it can be extended to more points. So the question that I would like to propose here to start off as a motivation is the following. So we have this beautiful invariance, and well, people have. Invariants, and well, people have computed many of them and found many nice connections, for instance, to the immersion problem of projective spaces and so on. But one of the questions that I think is nice and important to come back to and consider is how do we use symmetries to study the motion planning problem. Problem. I'm going to write it as MPP. And of course, the use of the word symmetries can be interpreted in a number of ways. And well, there are three possible answers that we can give to this question. So number one is to say, well, how about if we think of the word symmetries as group actions? Okay. So I'm just going to think of group actions. As group actions, or essentially a group action on the topological space X. And perhaps what you would like to do is to propose, make, require the motion planners, sections, local sections to be compatible with the action of a final group or potentially a league group acting on the space X and at the same time, of course, on the space of trajectories. Space of trajectories. So, answer one: think of the symmetries as group actions and require the planners to be comparable with the group action. And well, this idea has been explored, of course, and has given rise to a number of concepts, like, for instance, if we run Like for instance, equivariant T C is one of them, invariant, another version that uses this approach. And there's another one I know, and perhaps there are more, perhaps I'm not aware of. This one is called strongly equivariant TC. So there are. So there are at least three versions, perhaps there are more, who knows? People have perhaps thought about these in different ways, but these ones essentially take into account this concept, this requirement of making the planners be compatible with the group action. So second possible answer, again, coming back to how do we use symmetries to study the motion planner, is to try to incorporate into the motion planning when I write MP so this idea is nice essentially the the main characteristic here is that we want the group elements to be part of the planning part of the motion there are at least two versions and perhaps again there could be Versions and perhaps again there could be more. One of them is called effective easy. We have this three over here and at least two over here. One that is more recent, which is called effectual. And again, the idea is that we want to use the group elements to be part of the motion planning. My favorite example is, for instance, when you take, let's say, the plane minus the origin, it's the unit of a point. And then you pretend that you put a crane revolving around the origin. And that crane is essentially allowing you to act the group of orthogonal matrices of size 2 by 2 on the plane minus the origin. And that's essentially, in a way, making use of the group action to study the motion planning problem. So that's something that has been done. That's something that has been done. But today, I would like to go back to something more simple, and is to use the concept of symmetry at the level of the planners in the following way. So, answer three is to require the planners. The planners to be symmetric. So, one of the main constructions, the first one perhaps, is a construction due to Farber and Grant, which is known as the symmetric topological complexity. So, I'm going to explain what that is with a little bit of detail. So, this one has been around for a while. This one has been around for a while. And the construction essentially is simple. So you start off with your evaluation map, essentially the version with only two points on the left-hand side. And then what you do is that you restrict these vibrations to the configuration space for their two, and then take the Of order two, and then take the pullback of this vibration. I'm just going to call it P restricted here. And then you say, well, there is a natural action here of the cyclic group of order two acting on this vibration on the right-hand side by swapping the factors, and then in this case, at the level of the paths, by reversing the direction. And well, that gives you, because that action is free. gives you because that action is free a new vibration quotient the definition of harbor and grant is essentially the sectional category the definition of the symmetric tc is the sectional category of this new vibration perhaps we can call e bar so i'm just going to write it here this is the sectional clarity sectional category of E bar and then plus one because I'm using my apologies unreduced T C so for me in this conversation T C of a point is not zero is one okay I hope you don't mind okay so that's a construction has been around and of course there is a connection between that construction and the regular TC and The regular TC and another version I'm going to mention in just a moment. So, one of the things that we should mention here is that the symmetric TC is not a homotopy invariant. If I recall correctly, there is an example somewhere of a contractible space showing that this is not a homotopy invariant. I think it's in a paper of Esus. I don't recall exactly. Of resus. I don't recall exactly the location of the example, but there is one showing that this is not a homotopy invariance. And in a way, I think that perhaps made some people to lose some interest in this construction. So a few years later, we have the following construction due to Basave, Gonzalez, Rudiak, and Tamaki. So what they said is, well, how about if instead of going to the level of the configuration space and all of that, we demand the domains of the planners. The domains of the planners here in the Cartesian product to be symmetric under the action of the symmetric group, and likewise the action, we want the planners to be compatible with the action at the level of the space of multipaths. So essentially, that gave rise to what is called the, let's say, or perhaps we can define the higher version. I'm going to use N from now on, I think, of the symmetrize. Tc and again the construction is at the level of this multi-evaluation map and there is an action here of the symmetric loop of order and factorial acting on the space of multipaths by just essentially flipping each of the legs. And that action is comparable with the natural action natural action on the Cartesian product and essentially what On the Cartesian product, and essentially, what we want here are symmetric domains and sections that are compatible with these actions. So, that is the definition of the symmetrized TC. This one happens to be a homotopy invariant. And there are some important properties I would like to mention here. So, one of them, I'm going to write it in the form of a theorem in the same paper by Gasabe, Gonzalez, Rudiak and Tamakibi, GRT. Rudy Akentamakibi, GRT. They show that this one is very close to the symmetric version defined by Faber and Grant. And the relation is very simple. It's essentially the following. So hopefully it will fit here. Let me just calculate the location. So Tc2. In this case, the symmetrize is in between the symmetric and the And the symmetric of the space x minus one. So it's very close to the value of the one defined by Farber and Grant. And well, as I mentioned, there is a number of properties that they proved. This one happens to be a homotopy invariant, satisfies a number of properties in terms of For instance, they should have some calculations for Cartesian products and other things. Okay, so this has been around for a while. And one of the, I think, honest questions is, how is this related to the motion planning problem after all? And I think it's hard to say, yes, it's related. If we come back to the illustration of the multi-paths, we could say, well, there is some kind of Paths, we could say, well, there is some kind of agent, a robot trying to reach a number of targets. And perhaps we can think of the common point to be some kind of like source for some, I don't know, supply. And then the robot, the agent is trying to reach a number of target positions and so on and so forth. But still, I think it's maybe not so clear or natural to see the connection between that connection and the original motion. And the original motion planning problem. The one that I mentioned at the very beginning with the space of paths from the unit interval to the space X. That one, I think, is more natural to say that it's connected to the motion planning problem because essentially you have a source and a target, and then a bunch of intermediate points that you would like to visit with the robot. Now, the thing. Robot. Now, the thing that I think is one of the main reasons why people kind of like lose a little bit of interest on these invariants is that the calculations are not straightforward. They require quite a bit of technology. And besides that, again, the connection to the motion planning problem, the original motion planning problem is not so, so, so transparent. So let me. Um let me continue with a few more comments on properties and then make the connection to the bidirectional setting that I want to present to you. Okay, so a few years later, or perhaps I should say a few years ago, Grant, Mike, Mark Grant, he proved the following. He went back to this He went back to this invariant, the symmetrized one, and then he proved the following nice property. And it's essentially the usual bound in terms of dimension and connectivity. So let me just write it here carefully. And it's this, the symmetrized Tc is essentially bounded by n times the dimension of X plus one over the connectivity plus one and n plus one again. Connectivity plus one and then plus one again. I'm using the unreduced version, so C stands for the connectivity D or the dimension of X stands for the homotopy dimension. So this is, I guess, well known. So he provided this. He went over the formalities of the argument to show that this bound also applies to the symmetrized TC. By the way, this is. This is not part of the theorem, but a property that is also important to mention is that the T C symmetrizes related to the regular T C in this way. So that's also nice. And well, we have this same upper bound for the symmet for the CMIT for the regular TC. So, in a way, it fits in between that well-known upper bound and, on the other hand, by the regular TC. Okay, so now I'm going to start talking about the bi-directional settings. So, as I was saying a few seconds ago, the symmetrized context is perhaps too much to ask. So, how about if we go back to the paths visiting a solution? That's visiting a source and a target and a bunch of intermediate points. And this time, instead of using the full action of the symmetric group, we use a simpler action. And in this case, what I'm going to do is to use the following notation. So I'm going to define here a permutation using a classic notation of permutations. Permutations so hold on. So this should be one and n and then two and minus one and then continue. So these are essentially two cycles. And this product is defined in a permutation. In this case, this is the permutation when n is even okay. And then the definition for the case when n is odd is similar. This is similar essentially. What we are doing is swapping the elements in a tuple in a Cartesian product using this. And the other one is essentially the same. So we go like this. And then there is one that we're going to leave fixed. And it's the one in the middle. So this is a permutation of the symmetric group. And what I want group and what I want is to come back over here to this construction and say well don't use the full action of the symmetric group don't use the join instead use only the unit interval with a bunch of special points and use the permutation beta which I guess is compatible with what I want to define as bi-directional sequential motion planning so Planning. So we proceed in a similar way. We say u an open set or any set of the Cartesian product is beta symmetric or invariant. When you apply this permutation, you get essentially the same set. And once we have this in place, we can define the bidirectional PC. Okay, so this is going to be the smallest number of open beta metric domains on which that cover the Cartesian product on which there is On which there is a beta equivariant section, essentially what we could call a bi-directional planner. So that's the definition. Is that a question? No. Okay, by the way, any questions so far? Comments? Okay. So now I have this gadget here defined. And well, this happens to satisfy, of course, very similar properties. Very similar properties. And well, the plan of the purpose of the talk is to try to sell this as some sort of approximation to the symmetry. This is someone explaining that along the way with more detail. So let me also mention that there is a version of bi-directional TC that, in a way, is compatible. That, in a way, is compatible with the definition of symmetrized TCO fiber and grant. So, the way to go for that, I'm not gonna get into the details of what else could be said about that one, because it's very likely, I do not know exactly if that's the case, but it's very likely that there is not going to be a homotopy invariant like the case of Aberdeen Grant. So, the construction would go like this. So, again, you take your multi-evaluation. A map, and then you take the let me see if this color is slightly red. That seems perhaps, I don't know. Hopefully, you can see. So, instead of taking, of course, only configurations on only two points, I'm going to take configurations on endpoints. And you pull back the multi-evaluation. Pull back the multi-evaluation for the configuration space, and then you say, Well, again, there is an action of the group generated by beta, and that gives rise to a quotient over here. Let's say by beta, like this, and then this is also a quotient by beta, and then here we could define using this. Using this fibration, the TC bidirectional. In this case, I'm not going to use beta again. I'm going to just use B lowercase sub n of the space X as the sectional category of that function over there. And I mentioned this because there is again a connection like over here between the bidirectional, like in this case, we have the symmetrized and the symmetric between the bidirectional. Symmetric between the bidirectional that I define in terms of beta and the one that we have over here in terms of b, which is essentially in terms of the configuration spaces. So let me write it down because the idea I'm going to show you is something that we will be seeing later on. Okay, so perhaps we can write it as a proposition. By the way, something I forgot to mention in my talk, all the spaces I will be using are non-pathological. So, for let's say general purposes, I will be thinking of CW complexes, finite CW complexes, everything connected, everything the way you need them to be. Euclidia neighborhood retracts and everything. So, CW complexes, finite CW, finite CW complexes will do. So, what I have is this. So, what I have is this: the Tc bidirectional, let's say the one with the configuration spaces of X minus one, remember the minus one in the observation, the result of BGRT, is less than or equal, and here we have a new gadget, the sectional category of the map going from X using a diagonal construction to the Cartesian product modulo the action of beta. Modulo the action of beta and this is less than or equal to the Tc bidirectional the one that is a homotopy invariant N and this one is less than or equal to the T C bidirectional using the configuration spaces. So we have this chain of inequalities and again we see that there is a very close relation. That there is a very close relation, and on top, we have this one over here, which is also a homotopy invariant. This guy is also a homotopy invariant. I will be making a few more comments about this. And again, potentially the ends may not be a homotopy invariant. I'm not going to get into that. So let me just make a few comments about how you can see this. The idea is to take again your evaluation function. This is Is kind of now the name of the game, and then you go to the quotients, and then here, of course, if you have something that is beta invariant, let's say a section, you can induce, of course, one by taking the quotient here at the level of this new map. And of course, let me see if I can fit it maybe like this. You can take some sort of like pullback. Some sort of like pullback like this. Of course, here we restrict trajectories, paths to the configuration space. And then we take the quotient, and then we have a new map over here. And there is another couple of maps I want to use here. One of them is going to go from X in here, and it's by using. Here and is by using essentially a construction of a constant map. So you send the point x to the trajectory that is constant, and that one is essentially a homotopy equivalence, and that's going to be compatible with the diagonal. So hopefully this is not so much confusing. So we have this construction, and let me just make a few comments about how. And let me just make a few comments about how you see these inequalities. So, this one assumes that X is an Euclidean neighborhood retract. The idea, roughly speaking, is that if you have something here at the level of the configuration space, since you know that the space, let's say, is nice, you can construct a neighborhood, a beta equivalent neighborhood of the diagonals that we are taking off. And that's essentially what you can use to show this inequality here. So, that's kind of the idea. It's very much what The idea is very much what Gonzalez, DGRT do, and I think Farber and Grant also do as well. Here, this one, again, I mentioned that if you have something that is equivalent, you can construct something at the level of this map. And because this is a commutative diagram here with an equivalence, you have this inequality here, the one in the middle. And then for the last one, the idea is just to come back over here to this screen. Come back over here to this square and the minus one again is because in the definition of the beta, no, beta, the bidirectional with the configuration spaces, we got one plus. Did I write that down? Okay, just checking. Might be somewhere over there. Okay, so this is basically the main tool that you would use to prove these inequalities. And perhaps what I would like to do is to do this. Perhaps what I would like to point out is the introduction of this invariant, which again is a homotopy invariant that is in between all of these constructions and could be used again as some sort of approximation of these invariants. Okay. Perhaps again it would have to be something like a pathological space. Something like a pathological space, or maybe some kind of like a special construction. Perhaps even the construction that is in the paper of BGRT might be adjusted to this setting, but I haven't sort of a careful example. The problem is this with the calculation of this gadget here. Okay. Let me try to go slightly faster. Okay, so I'm gonna try to go slightly faster. So in this case, of course, if n is equal to 2, the bidirectional 1 is nothing but just a regular symmetrized Tc, so they are comparable, of course. So again, that's why I mentioned at the beginning that this could be thought of as some sort of first approximation of the C. As some sort of first approximation of the symmetrized TC. Of course, so this is one observation, another observation, if n is equal to two. This quotient by the action of beta is nothing but just the symmetric product, which is a very interesting space to study. And another important observation is this: that the Tc. This, that the Tc n, the regular one, is less than or equal to the Tc n bidirectional, and this is less than or equal to the symmetrize. And the construction or the main tool to prove this is again that diagram I mentioned at the beginning using the folding map. So let me perhaps just mention that the folding map or wrapping map, whatever you want to call it. Or wrapping map, whatever you want to call it, let me just call it capital F or folding, can be used to construct the following diagram. I know I'm abusing the notation because I'm calling all the maps the evaluation maps E, but you know which is which. And this is essentially the main tool that you need to show that if you have something that is fully symmetric or symmetrized, well. Symmetric or symmetrized, well, that will do to give you something that is beta-infinite, bidirectional. Okay, so we have this, and again, this is again trying to sell a point that this can be thought of as an approximation to the symmetrized TC. Okay, so that is that. Let's see. So, a few more remarks. The bidirectional, like the symmetries, is a homotopy invariant. Let's make sure that here T C N beta is a homotopy invariant. That's a nice property. Another one that you can sort of some sort of monotonity. How do you say that? I think it's just monotonicity property is that the Tc2N bidirectional is less than or equal to the Tcn in this case on an even number. In this case, on an even number of points, that one is less than or equal to the TC bidirectional on 2n plus 1 points. The idea, I think, is clear. If you know how to, let's say, go bidirectionally on three points, well, you should, of course, use that to go bidirectionally on only two points, for instance, by just forgetting one of them or introducing one for the construction of the planners. Okay, so that's nice. That's nice. And well, one of the test calculations that people usually try to explore first is the case of the calculation of the T C for the spheres. And well, in this case, using these observations I mentioned over here, you could say, well, for spheres, using those inequalities, we have that the regular is less than or equal than the less than or equal than the bidirectional and the bidirectional is less than or equal to the fully symmetrized and here you can use the inequality of dimension and connectivity that was proved by mark grant and well if you go through the calculations carefully which is just a basic exercise you can see that this is at most n plus one and of course the one on the One and of course, the one on the left we know is at least n. Again, I'm using unreduced TC. Okay, so how about this guy here in the middle? And of course, the main price would be to try to say something about the fully symmetrized TC of the sphere, which is not fully known. I will make a few comments about that in a moment. Okay. Do you have a better bound? Have a better bound, of course. If the sphere is even, this is going to rise by one, and that's going to sandwich everything to the same value. So, my contribution to these calculations is the following. And is this that the TC, and it's just one calculation, the full calculation of the bidirectional Tc of the sphere is not known, it's incomplete at this moment, is that these values n. at this moment is that these values n when both m and n are of i'm going to create a chart so that you can visualize all the values that are around this calculation so give me just a second so perhaps we can tabulate them in the following ways i'm going to have n over here of course to be even or it could be odd the dimension of the sphere to be even or Or it could be odd, and uh, where is what we know? Well, if the dimension is even, everything is sandwiched to n plus one. In that case, the result that I have here, which I'm gonna show you with only one basic calculation example of a motion planner, is telling you that the value over here is just n. The value over here is just n and this case is open, but there is some information that was calculated by Grant. He says that the Tc2 symmetrize, which is the same as the bidirectional of any sphere, it doesn't matter what is the dimension, at least this number has to be one. This happens to be three. So the conjecture perhaps would be that this might be a very different. Conjecture perhaps would be that this might be equal to maybe again. The table is for the bidirectional. Perhaps we don't know. Perhaps maybe this could be also n plus one, or maybe it could be lower. So that's something that we don't know. So I'm going to come back to higher cases in a few more minutes. Okay. So that's what we have. Now, let me see. One, two, three, four. Done. Try. In the definitions of the regular versions of TC and the symmetrize and all of those things, we usually use open sets, but we know there are some technicalities, of course, that one has to suffer, that it's possible to replace the openness condition of the domains by, let's say, ENRs if your space is nice enough, let's say a finite CW complex. And that's something I will be using in the Be using in the illustration of an explicit motion planner that will realize this value when n is equal to three. And that would be an example of this calculation here. Sorry. So I must say that the planner I'm going to present, I got it from the nice comments of the referee of the paper where. Of the referee of the paper, where this paper, this talk is based on. So, the referee was so kind that he made, of course, some observations about the paper, and he also made a comment about how to go about the following motion planner. And I thank him. And well, the case that he provided was the simplest case, and that happens to be extendable to any case in terms of n, the number of points. So, the idea. points so the the idea again is simple is to start off with the following so you take v naught as triples um in this case points in the sphere and then in this case we want x1 to be different distinct from negative x2 and this guy different from x3 and then you can see the pattern from here And then you can see the pattern from here. The next one is also triples. And in this case, we are going to require x1 to be equal to negative x2, negative x2 different from x3. Or in this same set, we allow the cases when x1 is not negative x2, but negative x2 is the same as x3. Three and then the third domain that will realize the case when n is equal to three, this value would be three, of course. In this case, is when you take again triples. And in this case, you want the three to be the same. That is x1 equal to negative x2. And then these are equal to x3. Okay. Notice that I'm assuming also that M is OTH. So, with that in mind, you can propose a following construction that will be stable in each of these domains and is to say, maybe I can come back over there, or maybe here. Let's say you have a triple like this. And remember, the idea is that we want to travel bi-directionally, by the way. To travel bidirectionally, by the way, you can check mentally that these sets are bidirectional or beta-invariant. So, the idea is to say, well, go from x1 to x2 through a geodesic, if it's possible. That is, if these two guys are not antipodal. But if they are antipodal, because we know the dimension of the sphere is off, take advantage of the existence of a non-vanishing very. A non-vanishing vector field. So perhaps I should mention that here. So take the non-vanishing vanishing vector field, m is oth, so we can do that, or use a v of in this case, negative x2, no, of x1. I'm going to use x1 in this case. And the same idea here for the next step. For the next step, use a geodesic if that is possible, or if not, use the vector tangent to, in this case, x3. So I'm using the ends, x1 and x3. And well, I'm not going to spend a few seconds on checking this, but it's easy to check that this is what you need to show that you have motion planner realizing the upper bound. Planner realizing the upper bound, and that can be extended to higher cases. And well, that is this part. Now, I'm gonna turn to more, let's say, cohomological stuff and then try to sell again this idea that this thing is some kind of like first approximation to the symmetrized TC. By the way, there are very few calculations of the symmetrized TC. If I recall correctly, there are values known for surfaces. Surfaces. The Tc of the sphere, the symmetries is not fully known. And there are some values calculated by Jesus for some projective spaces. And again, all of those are only for n equals 2. And perhaps in some cases, depending on the connectivity of the space, perhaps a few more things can be said for other spaces. But very few calculations are available for symmetrized TC and of course, likewise for the bidirectional one. The bidirectional one. Okay, so now turning to something more, let's say, technical. I'm going to go back to one of the diagrams I had over there. In terms of this construction, I mentioned it's important. So you have your evaluation, and then you can take the quotient of that map using The permutation beta, and you have the constant map here, allowing you to construct a moment of the equivalence compatible with the diagonal. So this construction can be used easily to show the following. And of course, it doesn't have to be beta all the time. You can use a sigma or you can use perhaps a smaller subgroup here. So, of course, I'm assuming here that we have a symmetric symmetrized motion planner. So, the point of this diagram is that you can use this to show that the, for instance, the invariant, the bidirectional, my apologies, Tc is greater than or equal to than the sectional category of these. So here, this guy beta Pn of X is essentially just what we could call the symmetric product in the bidirectional sense of X of order N. And as I said here, you can use a different symmetric group, subgroup of the symmetric group, and essentially see the same here. In this case, the symmetric product of order n. So, those are observations coming from here. My time, maybe? Okay, I think we agree that if you need a couple of minutes. A couple of minutes? Can it be three? Just kidding. Okay. I'm going to waste a few of my seconds. I remember I was one time in a conference and the speaker said, A conference and the speaker said, Okay, do you have two minutes? And then he asked another person, Do you have two? And then he went like that through the people in the room and he said, Well, adding them up, I have like 20 more. So I'm not going to do that, of course. I know it was a bad joke, just to wake you up a little bit. Well, perhaps I should just mention a few more things. Yes, just to, I have a few more things here to say, but just perhaps to. Things here to say, but just perhaps to complete my ideas, the calculations at the end of the day again turn out to be complicated because there is not much knowledge about the symmetric groups, sorry, symmetric products, like even, for instance, the bidirectional one. Happens to be actually a bit more complicated. I can maybe in a discussion tell you why in the eyes of cosmology. But one of the main tools here. Main tools here are the calculations back to the I think 1950s of Naka Oka. And what he says is that if you have a finite CW complex, you have a map, essentially the diagonal, that happens to be trivial in modulo two cohomology. So this is one of the main tools. So, this is one of the main tools to get some calculations completed. Some again, I know I'm running out of time, and perhaps my last comment will be just to say that, well, going over that diagram, as I mentioned, you can use different subgroups. And well, you don't have to use all the time just beta. Perhaps you can use another one that is adopted to the motion planning problem that you would like to study. Like to a study and say, Well, if we repeat the same, but instead of using only one subgroup, for instance, in my construction, it was the one defined by beta, you take a chain of subgroups interpolating between the trivial group and the full symmetric group of or their n factorial of degree n. And say, well, the same ideas give rise to a bunch of invariants that relate to the regular TC. A regular PC, and then, for instance, you could say maybe the bidirectional, depending on what is the subgroup, and you can label them accordingly and try to use these, and again, this is my last comment, I promise, to approximate the symmetrized TC. Of course, the technicalities at the end of the day will boil down to knowing something about the corresponding Something about the corresponding, for instance, in this case, G1 symmetric product of X, knowing something about the cohomology of this, very little is known, but perhaps in some cases, simple cases, one could do something for the purpose of the calculation. So, I'm going to stop here. Thank you. Thank you, Andrika, for your talk. Other questions here? Yeah. The three domains do not seem to be topologically disjoint. But I guess even if they are not topological disjoint, the planners the stability is what is important in this case. Yes. Yes. So the point I was making is that you can replace the openness condition by. Replace the openness condition by ENRs and they satisfy the ENRs condition, so you're ready to go. But still, usually, you need them to be topologically disjointed so that the closure of one is disjoint from any other one of the domains. And in this case, for example, the very first one, its closure may convert one of the inequalities into equality and then intersect some of the other domains. The closure of this could be. The closure of this could be having issues with this is what you're saying, right? But I suppose that in that case, the explicit instructions would be the same. Exactly, they will turn out to be compatible. Okay. Any questions? So when you were talking about the TCB, not TC beta, you used the configuration. You use the configurations page. Does that implicitly assume that all the points that you visit are different? Yes. What if you didn't want to do that? What if I was allowed to start somewhere, go to one gas station, go to another gas station, and then go back to the first gas station? It seems to suggest pulling back not to a configuration space, but to a related space instead. Related space instead, yes, I guess one could propose a different sub space for the targets, right? It doesn't have to be the configuration space. So the construction I was proposing was just somehow to extend the symmetric of hardware and grant. But there could be other adjustments and constructions. Maybe you could just read a few questions. What jumped into my mind was some of these cyclic configuration spaces that show up in billiards problems. Where the first guy is different from the second guy is different from the third guy. Yes, and that could give rise to some sort of like cyclic TC with a nice action or symmetry condition. Right. More questions? More questions? I have a question. Can you hear me? Yes. Yeah. Nice talk. Thank you. So if I remember, for the calculation for just the ordinary symmetrized TC, so n equals 2 for odd spheres, the key point was something like that the symmetrized version agrees with a monoidal symmetrized version. And so that you can replace like zero divisors in this symmetric product for the chromological lower bound with relative chromology classes. Okay. Yes. It's okay. I think I can follow your comment. I know in your paper you rely on identifying these two constructions, but the calculation, I think, can be also completed by using these ideas of Naca. By using these ideas of Nakauka, that the map in this by the diagonal is trivial in modulo to cohomology. I think I can perhaps direct you to the argument. But it's possible to go through just cohomological calculations without having to go through the connection that you made in your paper to the monoidal version. I see. So, you don't think that, like, considering the Think that, like, considering the sort of bidirectional symmetric product relative to the diagonal and the cohomology might simplify the calculations. No, I was planning on, and perhaps maybe in some discussion, I can tell you that the cohomology of the bidirectional symmetric product of a space could be, the cohomology could be more complicated than the cohomology of. Than the cohomology of the symmetric space. Yes, in fact, the cohomology of the symmetric product, my apologies, injects into the cohomology of the bidirectional symmetric product. So you have potentially, of course, more classes, maybe more relations, so it could be more complicated. So in the calculations that I have completed, the key point is going back all the time to the observation. Back all the time to the observation of Nakawoka, that the map, I don't know if you can see it. No, in cohomology, in this vector diagonal, that one is driven. That's a key ingredient for the calculations. Thank you. You're welcome. Any more questions? First of all, thank you for your talk. My question is: when you were talking about the TCS of X, which is not a homotopy comparison, is there any known examples for which are homotopy and with the TCS different? What I can recall is that the What I can recall is that the the only calculations um available are the one that shows that it's not a homotopy invariant and I think in the same paper by Farber and Grant I think there are some calculations also for the sphere and I think those are those are the only calculations for TS the the original symmetric one I do not know of any other calculations but it would be perhaps a good project so just my last last comment again I mentioned Last comment. Again, I mentioned at the beginning that perhaps this could be sold as a motivation to maybe come back to some calculations that were, in a way, left behind over the years. Okay. Just a comment. The example about the non-combat invariance of symmetric asymmetric DC is due to well it's supposed to be well known but uh but the Jose I think is the one that grows. Jose, I think, is the one that wrote very explicitly. Yeah, I noticed that he noted when I was saying something. So I wasn't sure. I couldn't recall if it was in whose paper. It's very well done, but nobody knew the actual idea. Okay, yes. No problem. Okay. Or questions? No? So let's send the speaker then. Thank you.
