And he will talk about bi-differential query geometry and the engine. So, welcome. Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. It's wonderful to be in Oaxaca, and thanks for the invite. And also, many thanks to my main collaborator in this, Peter Schupp, who is with us in Zoom, although it's really late in Europe. So, yeah, I decided to talk today about something which is. To talk today about something which is not really in my main line of research these days, but it's something we did with a number of people, and I think it's more suitable for this event here. So as I was saying, this is mainly work that initiated by discussions with Peter Schupp and later also with my former PhD student, Jorgos Karayanis, but also with other people that I would like to acknowledge. Yeah, Fexenku. Yeah, Fexenku, Yorkos Manoulakos, Arash Ransba, and Diderik Rust. So I'm going to be talking about not about non-commutative geometry, but about graded geometry, in particular about bi-differential graded geometry. What is this sound? Nice sound. Okay. Okay. Works. Thank you very much. So, I will start with a small graded geometry teaser. So, we are very familiar. So, graded geometry, I will mean that we will be dealing with coordinates which have some degree. So, I will be just keeping it simple. I will have different types of degrees for my coordinates. So, we are very familiar with this kind of ideas in physics. Ideas in physics, in particular, when we study supersymmetry, we have Z2 graded geometry. So we have degree zero and degree one coordinates. And if you don't like supersymmetry, it's not a problem because we encounter graded geometry very naturally in Gates theories in the context of the BVBRST program. So this is the most general way to do a quantization of a Gates theory that can feature a very general Gates algebra. Can feature a very general gauge algebra that perhaps, for example, does not close on shell or it has other features like reducibilities and things like that. So in the BVBRST formalism, we always have to introduce some kind of graded coordinates, this time Z-graded coordinates. So these would be coordinates that capture eventually the ghosts, the anti-fields, and the anti-ghosts, and all these things in the theory. And from a more mathematical perspective, More mathematical perspective, graded geometry is very prominent in the context of differential graded manifolds, or sometimes called Q manifolds in the literature. So this is a very general way to treat Poisson geometry, Lie algebraids, Quran algebraids, and even more general higher structures like L infinity algebras and L infinity algebraids. Now, these stuff are very heavy for six o'clock in the afternoon. So in this talk, I'm going to talk about nothing like this. I'm going to talk about nothing like this, but I would like to advertise the talk of my colleague, my collaborator, Larissa Jonge, tomorrow, maybe, who will be talking more about these kind of things. So in this talk today, I would like to talk more about some bi-graded Z times Z geometry and explain from my point of view, what is it good for. So I will give you first a quick tour of what I'm going to talk about, although I will probably never get really Although I will probably never get really very technical. So, the first, so initially, the reason we started discussing this, our main motivation, was that we were trying to understand the so-called Galilean interactions for different types of fields about how you can systematically write them down in a very simple and universal form. And this is one of the things that I'm going to discuss later, but the main But the main thing that we are going to be looking at is to try to find a universal formulation for tensor film theories that involve mixed symmetry tensors. Mixed symmetry tensors means that you don't have only differential forms, for example, but you can have tensors that have multiple slots of indices which are anti-symmetric. I will come back to this later. So we are trying to develop some universal. Universal formalism that involves scalars, it treats p-forms, but also gravitons, the cartride field, which is a two, one mixed symmetry tensor. So two, one here, I don't mean covariant quadravariant. I mean only covariant indices. So three indices, which two of them are dissymmetric, the third one not. So this is usually called the cartridge field. And it appears, for example, as a dual graviton in five dimensions. In five dimensions. So, what I'm going to be looking at is how can I write kinetic terms or generalized theta terms or mass terms, but also importantly, healthy higher derivative interactions for such kind of theories. Mostly, I will be looking at linear theories here, but also one can work out the case of non-linear p-form electrodynamics, for example. For example, second reason to look that I personally was motivated to look at mid-symmetry tensor fields is dualities. So in principle, the main motivation came from string theory, where you look at the different types of brains that you can have in the theory, you see that some of them are exotic and they couple, especially when you start performing T-dualities, for example, or rest dualities, or U-duality in more general. They, or U-duality in more general, they can coupled to mixed symmetry tensor fields of the form that I have been discussing. So I would like to find a systematic way to treat various dualities also at the offshore level, so at the Lagrangian level, for single field and multiple fields. And I will discuss how we can write down a parent action, so an action that depends on. So that depends on a first-order action, that it's universal and leads to different dual theories and implements, in particular, duality relations and leads to general duality rules. One thing that I'm going to mention now, but I'm not going to discuss, is that in theories that feature dualities, you usually have some global symmetries that match from the in the two different duality frames. From the in the two different dual differences, right? So often when you have higher tensor fields, these are generalized global symmetries. So they involve conserved currents, which are p-forms, for example, right? So one of the features that we have found, but I'm not going to discuss it later, is that you can think of these generalized global symmetries as isometries on suitable graded manifolds, like the ones I'm going to discuss today. And this can Discuss today. And this can actually be very helpful in tracking the Troft anomalies that you can have in this kind of theories. And finally, I would like to discuss also in the context of duality how you can understand the off-shell implementation when you have gravitational duality. So when you have a graviton with a theta term, which was proposed about 20 years ago by Chris Hall at the on-shell level. I will come to this and I will try to discuss. I will come to this and I will try to discuss how you can implement this off-shell. And in particular, this will lead me to the more physics part of this talk, which I like to call action gravitodynamics, which has to do with adding a theta term to gravitate electromagnetism. And it's a theta term that, as we will see, it's actually induced by torsion. So we heard yesterday, for example, about the teleparallel equivalent general relativity. Teleparallel equivalent to general relativity. So, we found we heard about a theory that has only torsion but no curvature, but it's equivalent to GR. So, in a way, I will, action gravity dynamics will be related to this teleparallel equivalent observativity, but with a theta term that involves a torsional invariant. So, this kind of action gravity dynamics we will see that can have even observable consequences. In particular, I'm going to discuss about potential. I'm going to discuss about potential corrections that it can give to the Lensteering effect. But first, let me move on and go to discuss a little bit how we can, what is the main idea behind our approach and behind this graded geometry. So we want to think, first of all, simply of differential forms as functions on something. So this something will be a graded supermanifold. So the basic idea in general. So, the basic idea in general is to think of tensor fields as functions on a graded supermanifold, because it's much easier to work with functions after all. So, I will be considering what is called the one-shifted tangent bundle. So, you take the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold M, and then you assign to its fiber coordinates of degree one. So, you shift the degree of the fiber coordinates by one. Of the fiber coordinates by one. Essentially, this means that you have your ordinary even coordinates, x mu, and you have also odd coordinates of degree one, theta mu. Odd coordinates means what? It means that they don't commute, they anti-commute. So they satisfy this relation here. Very simple. Now, if you want to think of functions of degree p on this graded manifold, these correspond precisely to p forms on the manifold m. So. them so in particular if you think of this taylor like expansion so you have a a function well a general function you can expand it in this way in in the degree one coordinates so the coefficients here will be coefficients of a p-form right they will be automatically disymmetric and in addition on on this graded manifold you have you have naturally an ipotent vector field of degree one what is called the home Of degree one, what is called the homological vector field, which is given like this. So, this is nothing but the Durham differential, essentially. You just think of the Durham differential as a vector field on this manifold, right? And then, of course, it naturally squares to zero because theta and decommutes, right? So, this generates the usual chain complex. I will come back to this, but first I will discuss a little bit mixed symmetry tension of so if we want, I will focus today in my talk. I will focus today in my talk on what I call bipartite tensor fields. So they will be of degree p, q. Again, p, q means all lower indices. Okay. It says that p of the indices are at this metric, q of the indices are at this metric, but you don't have other symmetries. So we will consider functions. So there's a model, as a simple model. We will take this copy of the shifted tangent bundle and we will write functions of these. So we will have this double. Of these, so we will have this double copy of this tangent bubble, and we write functions of these in terms of two different sets of odd coordinates. So, here you will have the ordinary bosonic coordinates that we discussed. You will have two degree one coordinates, which are anti-commuting, like this. And then I will choose the convention that these two different sets commute. So, you can choose them to be also anti-commuting, but I'm going to choose commuting because this actually leads to commutative diagrams. So, then any function of the So then any function of degree p, q, you can expand it like this. And then these coefficients here naturally get this mixed index symmetry. So they are at the symmetric in the first p indices, in the second q indices, but but nothing else. In general, it's useful actually to think of differential forms as mixed symmetry tensors with one trivial slot. We will see with one empty trivial slot, right? We will see that this is actually useful later on. Is it something going? So, this you can generalize it to empartite tensors without a problem. And this is actually, there is an even bigger generalization that Pavel Schevera suggested many years ago, which goes under the name of differential gorms and differential worms. I'm not going to go there. These have coordinates also of mixed degree. This is not something that I'm going to do today. Now, in this case, you have two natural homologous. Case you have two natural homological vector fields of degrees one zero and zero one, right? These are just as simple as that, so it's like having two duram differentials, essentially, right? If you want to think about it like that, so they both square to zero and they commute. Okay, so since this is what is going on, you actually have a double complex. So I'm going on the blackboard now. So you have a double complex. So first I write here the simple complex. The simple complex of differential forms. So these are p minus one forms, p forms, p plus one. So this is the deram, I think, of these in terms of in the in the in the graded sense. Then one can write also the codifferential, right? It goes to the other direction. You can write it in this way here in terms of the degree one coordinates that I introduced. This is the same, I guess. So then. This is the same, I guess. So then you can start going down. So you see that we have this other differential, d-twiggle. So it goes in the other direction. So it creates this double complex. Of course, there is also the dagger of this, right? The codifferential. So we start having this picture here. So all squares here now are commutative diagrams, right? Because the D and D tweet will commute. But another thing that you can do is that you can go diagonally. This is something that you can. Go diagonally. This is something that you cannot do for differential forms. Diagonally means what? It means the yellow thing means you see that you go, for example, from a p, one to a p minus one, zero. So this is a trace. So the trace is implemented in this context like this. So you take out by derivatives one, theta and one chi, right? E temu nu here is going to be the Minkowski metric. I'm going to discuss Minkowski in this talk. Then there is the opposite arrow. Then there is the opposite arrow, which, well, essentially is the Migowski metric written in this funny form. It's a one, one object. You see a theta and a chi. It goes from here to here. And there is also the other diagonal. It has two more operators, which are interesting. So I will denote them as sigma and sigma twiddle. So the blue one takes you from, for example, from p1 to p plus one, zero. So it increases the first. zero so it increases the first decreases the other so you see it's a it's a theta with a derivative with respect to chi the other one that goes the other direction is the other so this operator is very important in clarifying whether the tensor field you will be considering is reducible or irreducible. So there is a reducibility criterion which is controlled exactly by these operators sigma and sigma tweet. So actually when sigma acting on a tensor field is zero, then the tensor is Tensor field is zero, then the tensor field is an irreducible representation of the general linear group in the dimensions that you are working. So it corresponds to a Young Tableau representation. Okay, so now eventually I want to end up constructing Lagrangians. So to construct Lagrangians, I first of all need the suitable inner product, right? So, well, when we have differential forms, the inner product is given by the hot star. Now we need to construct a suitable hot star here. Hot star here. And well, I give you directly the answer. So there is a generalized hot star operator that takes a P, Q mixed symmetry tensor, and it gives you a D minus P D minus Q defined like this. So I take this operator eta a suitable amount of times. So into this power. And then I take the transpose mixed symmetry tensor, which is the q, p one. So this means that I take So, this means that I take, I exchange all thetas with all chi's, okay? So, the two sets get completely exchanged. Now, note that even though if you think about these mixed symmetry tensors as forms with extra indices, you can perform actually Hodge duality separately in its set of anti-symmetric indices, right? So, I will denote this by star star twiddle. Now, this operator here is not. This operator here is not just this product. It's more general than this product. So, this operator here that we have defined, actually, it's related to this product in this way here. So, you see that it contains all traces of the mixed symmetry tensor. And of course, we want that because we know that when we have Lagrangians that involve mixed symmetry tensors, traces usually appear, right? So, this is actually the good inner product is given in terms of this generalized hot state. This generalized hot star operator. So, this is a symmetric inner product. If I take two mixed symmetry tensors, I put it in the middle, I have a good product, and then I integrate. So, this integral is Berzian integral. So, I integrate the thetas and the chi's, right? So, this is a shorthand notation to say that I integrate over the thetas and over the chi's, right? So, this is the inner program here. Good. So, now let's go to look what we can construct. Go to look what we can construct. Things are getting very simple here. So, take any Picomatu mixed symmetry tensor in Minkowski spacetime. There is a universal kinetic term and a universal mass term. And they look as simple as that. So, you take the D of the tensor, the generalized hot star with the D of the tensor, or this extremely simple term here. So, what does this give? So, if you do the Perez integration, Do the Perizi integration, it gives you, well, anything that you want in terms of linear theories. So, for differential forms, if you take q equals zero, it gives you p formulodynamics, of course. And then if you consider p equals q equals one, what it gives you is the linear Eised Einstein-Hilbert term. So actually, you perform the Berezin integration, you find this with the correct factors. You know, that this, of course, is very sensitive to the factors and the signs, right? So, it gives you. Sines right, so it gives you it knows about these factors and signs, and the mass term it will give you exactly the correct Firtz-Pauli term. It knows also what is the correct Firtz-Pauli term. If you take P equals to Q equals one, you find exactly the Gates theory that Thomas Cartwright found in the 80s for the Hooke-Yang tableau, so for the Tacuma one. So the kinetic Lagrangian in that case is this complicated expression with Expression with multiple different factors and signs, this formula knows this. So it's just the Berzin integration of this formula here with a generalized hot star. So actually, this is very nice. It's perhaps a little bit boring also, right? It gives theories that you all know. Of course, you can do this for any picomatic tensor. You don't have to do complicated stuff anymore. You take this, you put it in a computer if you wish, it gives you the result. Now, as I said at the beginning, what we were interested in initially was to. What we were interested in initially was to understand whether we can write in a very simple way the so-called Galilean interactions. So, I remind you that the Galilean interactions are higher derivative interactions such that the resulting equations of motion are still polynomial in second order of derivatives of the field, so that you don't introduce Ostrogradsky ghosts, right? So, in our approach, let's start from like Let's start from doing something very simple. Let's take the kinetic term we wrote and replace it, replace the field by this combination here. So, this combination here, so dd tweedle is not zero, right? So, these are the two homological vector fields, but their product is not zero. So, we take the dd tweetle of the field, we raise it to the power n and multiply it with the field. So, I will call this omega n plus one. Okay, it has n plus one appearances of the field domain. Plus one appearances of the field omega. And then for any bipartite tensor in any dimension, I'm going to write a universal interaction term, which is this here. So it's the same as the kinetic term. It just has this omega n plus one. And of course, for n equals zero, it is the kinetic term. Okay? So actually, if you know, so this is this is, of course, for a single field, and this gives you strictly second-order polynomial equations of motion. So, if you expand this now, if you do the Berezin integration, you will find all the horrible formulas that have been found for scalar Galileons, for P-form Galileons, but also it will give you sort of tensor Galileans. So for any P-commature tensor, it will give you all types of Galileo interactions you can write. Well, up to the following cuts. So you have a special case when P equals Q. So this is the case of scalars, gravitons, et cetera, to command. Et cetera, to comma two, for example, the window, the window tensor field. So there is an enhancement. Actually, there are more interactions in that case. This is known, of course, in the literature. And in our case, this is written in this simple form here. So there is this. So you notice here that only even field appearances, because these are m plus one, so the total field appearances are two m plus two, right? But in that case, you can have old field appearance. It's also something that you would expect. Is also something that you would expect because you know, for example, there are Lovelock terms that have, for example, cubic, right? So, this is the way that we write all these interactions in the P equals Q case. This includes this and adds all the additional ones. Now, I'm not going to write you, of course, expanded forms of that because they look awful, but if you wish, you can do it. I mean, you can do it for any picobacter tensor. And it gives everything that is known in the literature plus what. That is known in the literature, plus whatever. It's not known. In fact, one can just as a quick comment: one can play this game also for higher spins. Actually, you have to rightly correct the suitable generalized hot star in that case. Of course, the one that I introduced is not enough because you need more sets of odd coordinates. So actually, you can directly get the formulation of Franci and Sagnotti of the higher spin kinetic. Of the higher spin kinetic term, and in principle, you can also directly write in this way here what would be the Galilean interactions for higher spins with the unfortunate outcome, of course, that this would be non-local. So I'm not going to discuss it further here. Okay, so now I will switch gears a bit and discuss about duality. So the next thing we started looking is how we can write How can we write first order? Yes, please. The fact that you do not get a higher time derivative, is this something that you consider in the construction or does it appear that itself? Well, it is in a way you could say, yeah, of course it's in the construction because in the way that everything here is constructed, you see only second derivatives. It's quite obvious actually in this case. Actually, in this case, because when you write things explicitly, you start having a box of this, square, this, this, and you have to be very careful about it's very sensitive in the mutual combinations of factors and signs. But this is not because it's constructed to be like that, because it has just second derivatives, right? You have field times second derivative. So, of course, it will be polynomial in second derivatives. It's no miracle. No. No, what do you mean? I mean, the equation of motion will be secondary. Yeah, yes, yes. Yes, sure, sure, yes. Yeah, yes, of course. But in the action, eventually, you will end up having just second derivatives. Or up to second derivatives, you can also do generalized Delhi's in this sense. Uh, no, but it's just five minutes. I think I started a bit later. Okay, 50 minutes now. Regarding dualities, let me tell you very briefly some main things because I took too much time in the introduction. So, typically, when you have a duality between two theories, you can realize it at the North Shell level, at the Lagrangian level, with a parent action which has two independent fields. And then you integrate out one of the field or the other field, and you get two different secondary. Two different second-order theories which are dual to each other. So there are various types of dualities of this style. I mean, the standard duality is between a P minus one form and a D minus P minus one form. So this is implemented in terms of field strength with a star, of the field strength of the other. However, there are also dualities for gravitons. These were suggested by these people. By these people and at an on-shell level by Chris Hall here, which look like this. So it's dualizing the Riemann tension, right? But apart from this, there are also exotic dualities where you can have a two-form which is dualized to a mixed symmetry tensor, which is d minus two, two. So this was found by several people in the previous years. And then there are all sorts of other types of dualities, and all of them require kind of All of them require kind of different treatments. But in our approach, actually, there is a universal first-order parent action for which you can treat all these dualities in one go. And it looks extremely simple, moreover. So it's an action, it's a Lagrangian, as I wrote it, which contains two independent GLD reducible bipartite tensors, F and lambda, with these degrees. And it contains also an operator which we know in closed form. We know this operator, which plays the role of giving you the final second-order theory being an irreducible field. Okay? So the operator usually involves these sigma and sigma tweedle maps that I introduced in the beginning. So this was the other diagram, right? So then if you scan all these parameters P and Q, you actually get all single field dualities at the offset level. Dualities at the offset level. So, this was one of the theorems in our basic paper on this topic. And then one can ask: can I do this in the multifield case? Can I do generalized theta terms? Can I find duality rules for background fields? And the answer is yes. We have done all these extensions, and there are essentially two sets of duality rules, which look very much like the Bush rules that one finds in string theory, but these are not string-theoretical. string theoretical rules. Actually, these you encounter every time that you have a duality for some mixed symmetry tensor, for some p-form at least. So, and for mixed symmetry tensor fields. So, there are two sets of duality rules. The first one is essentially the Boucher rules that you find for two-dimensional sigma models in string theory, but these are not actually only for two-dimensions. So, scalar fields, which are the two-dimensional model, are the same as Are the same as any odd form and generalized graviton. And then for one forms, you find a different set of rules that also the corresponding generalized gravitons follow. Now, let me make things simpler and try to understand these two duality rules, or at least the first one, that were proposed by Chris Hall for gravitational duality with theta term. For gravitational duality with theta term. So, if you try to do this off-shell, and we did this, we found that these duality rules are implemented in a parent action that involves a term that can be traced in a quadratic torsion invariant that we heard about in previous talks, which is the Nie-Yang term. Now, two minutes? Yeah, thank you. So, I'm not going into the details of this. So, I'm actually just going into the Into the so this duality singled out for us a particular term that if you want to think about the similarities between linearized gravity and electrodynamics, so in electrodynamics you have a kinetic term which is E square minus B square and the theta term which is E times B, right? So in linearized gravity, if you want to write the kinetic term in terms of the gravitoelectric and the gravitomagnetic field, for example, when you do the decomposition akin to the Lenn's steering effect. Decomposition akin to the Lenn-Stiring effect, then the kinetic term looks again E squared minus B squared. And in fact, one can add the product of these two as a theta term. So note that this does not come from a curvature square. Okay, so there are three reasons to add this theta term. The first is that this is exactly the term which was singled out by our off-shell formulation to Halt's duality. The second is that it's the same term that has been used to study the gravitational. To study the gravitational response of topological materials in condensed matter physics. And the third maybe is that this is the linearization of the unique torsional topological invariant in 4D, which is this Nier-Yan term. So now, if you think about this as a Balground field, then you can write down the field equations in a Maxwell-like form. So the field equations of the theory of action gravity dynamics would look like this. So note that these are not electromagnetic equations, right? Are not electromagnetic equations, right? I mean, this is the Poisson equation for gravity corrected by the gradient of the theta term. So you see now that if one wants to see the effects of this theta term, one good arena is to try to test the Lenstering effect, right? So in fact, if you look at the GR's prediction to the Lenstering effect and the precession of geoscopes. Effect and the precession of zeroscopes in that case, you see that there is a correction. And in fact, the gravitomagnetic field that you find by solving our equations for a homogeneous spherical source of radius R that rotates with angular velocity omega, at least for theta being a function of time, then you find this gravitomagnetic field. And then the GR prediction for the gravitomagnetic field is this one here. So you notice that, well, okay, I don't give you the. Well, okay, I don't give you the function, the form of the functions here, but this in the limit of the scale we introduced in the theory, it gives really the GR result, but it also includes a further component which is new, which is not predicted from GR. And actually, there is a very similar prediction in Chern-Simon's gravity theory that was studied by these people here. And we have a similar prediction, but it's actually a stronger effect. I will stop here. Okay, thanks. Sorry for our. For our you were very kind, you know. I can discuss uh more details uh in the break, yeah. But there's no break, that's a problem. So, there is a big break, yeah. And then that will be questions so we go if not, thank the speaker again. Yeah, that's what I hope that we can do. So, we have one one speaker more before dinner. So One speaker more before dinner. So you started 50 minutes late. You started 15 minutes late. All good. All good, man. No worries. No slides. No. I knew what would happen. Email, yes. Uh, my name is the last name, so only no extra new tool. My name is Long. I'm not good at answering the chapter. Yes, I mean. Copy book? Yes, okay. Hello. This is okay. This is back. This is the point. Okay. Ready? And never make it twice faster than the point of changes. So yeah, our last speaker of this 20 minutes delay is Abrimok, and he's in talk on how we expect to start from this.
