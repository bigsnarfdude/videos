Here and being there. So, I will be talking about term problems. So, let me just basically quickly set a notation and give an angle for this history which I care. So, this notation standard, the external number of with forbidden graph F, denoted by X and F, it's the maximum number of edges in any graph G. any graph G which is contains no copy of F and has n vertices. All right okay we all we probably all know the usual Ordish stone theorem in terms of giving asymptotic giving asymptotic for this practically all the time. So this is the this plus some little one term and choose two and the meaning of that is that it's the number of edges in a complete chi f minus one aparthite graph with about equal number of parts. Plus if you Plus a few edges inside the parts, but few meaning the little of ants. Okay. And the main unresolved question is what happens if you grab this bipartite, this term becomes zero, what's left is little of n squared, and it's not an asymptotic anymore, it's just another one. Okay, so the basic result that Um the basic result there is the probary shows uh Turon which says that sorry so thank you thank you Josh which says that okay if we if we forbid a a bike link A by click, so a complete byparte graph, okay, with marks s and t, so I said s and t, then the number of edges is at most some constant which I will omit to the power 1 over. And again, this constant will depend on s and t, like in a manner which I will not worry about at this time. And later in the talk, I will skip the subscripts and all these constants. Okay. And of course, this is true whether for S less than T or T less than S, but you better apply this where, okay, so that this right-hand side is small as possible. So that's it. You should choose S to be less than T. Otherwise, the right S less than T to make it better. Okay, and basic, as I said, basically. It's a basic result because every bipartite graph is a subgraph of this. So this result implies that if I put a bipartite graph here, I get little of n squared. It's actually a bigger of n to some power less than 2. And the question is, is this sharp or is it not? And this is a basic question which has been open forever and it's still open. This token does not announce a solution to this. This token is not announced the solution to this progress on this. Okay, so let me tell you what's known about that and then tell you what's what's new. And by the way, if people have questions, don't worry about stopping me in the middle and asking questions or making comments. I mean, even about spelling. All right. So what's known? It's known to be sharp. It's known to be sharp. Well, okay, so if s is equal to 2, and t is anything. So really, the problem is kind of nested because if you know that it's sharp for say s equals to 2 and t equals to 2, it's going to be larger for bigger values of s because if you don't contain k st for some values of s. KST for some values of S and T, you don't contain a KST for every larger values as well. And since the bound depends, well, if you can all the constants, if the bound depends only on the smaller of the two parameters, okay, so you really need to only worry about the smaller t. So it's known for IT equals to 2. This is all due to order Schrannen Schosch and Brown from 66. Josh and Brown from 66. And I will quickly sketch how it works, of course. I mean, just to explain that. S equals to 3, it's also known for all values of t, the to brown. Then for larger s, so general s um so the best result um is that it's known for t Is that it's known for T bigger than approximately factorial. So this is an exact formula. And this comes from so-called norm graphs or projected norm graphs. And that's basically due to Alan Cola Roniasaba in a sequence of two papers from the late 90s. Alright. So So the constructions, all these constructions, you know, for this here, here, here, and also many other constructions which I don't tell you about. For example, I've been asking about this constant, and then you can, you know, like it's a graph from South Blind node for s goes to 2 and MET, and there are other related problems you can ask, for example, for performance for the other perpetrator graphs. So, anyways, all the constructions that you should know in this general area. Constructions, as you should know, in this general area, they are of somewhat similar flavor. They are algebraic constructions, and I'll show you examples to give you an idea of what I mean by algebraic and algebraic specific, they're just points of some algebraic varieties. And the we so the so this talk is really about how to make some new kind of cluster constructions, still the same. New kind of classic constructions, still the same general shape. Okay, so what's actually the new results? Let me just tell you. So here is a new result. So this is going to be sharp for S, which is exponential. Sorry, oops, C to be exponential. For T, which is exponential. Okay. Okay, so I'm not. This little of s isn't actually explicit. It's something like practice like cash to the power two-thirds with some constants thrown in, but let's not worry about that. It's exponential. Okay, so my plan is I will show you these constructions, the old ones, which many of you have seen, I'm sure, and I will tell you basically the ideas which goes into that. If people have questions, good time to Good time to stop. No, I had a question, but it's kind of a very high-level question. Is there a way to make even projective play DBC4-free graphs without any kind of algebra? Without any algebra, without any algebra. Okay, I'm coming to this. So, Dhruv is prompting me to move to my next step in the talk. All right. So, yeah, so you mentioned Bridget. Yeah, so that's so he mentioned projective planes, etc. So I will let me tell you what those things are. I'm not sure, yeah, so second part of the question, no algebra. Okay, I hope that I will answer that, but whether it will be special or not, we will. Okay, so let's go to the graphs without K2. So there was no four cycles if you want this angle. So here is a construction. It's not the optimal construction. Again, I can add a few more edges to make it better, but it's a construction which is kind of easier to conceptually think about. So construction goes as follows. So it's a bipartite graph. On the left, we have a plane over a finite field. A plane over a finite field. So let's take a field of prime order, it doesn't matter. And so there's a point in this, so this is. And on the right, I will have lines in the same plane. So if you think what a line is, remember it's just, you know, it's a it's uh something of having this equation, okay. These aren't all the lines, okay, these are all non-vertical lines, but it's again, uh not a huge difference. If you're not Not a huge difference if you're not concerned with getting exactly the best possible result you can possibly write. Okay, so what's the graph? Okay, so here I have a point, here I have a line, I need to tell you when do I put an edge between that point and the line, and this is essentially the only one sensible distinction we could have made. It's that whenever you have point, line, and a line, this is when you have an edge between the end. That's a draft. Anyway. That's a graph. So let's basically see what's going on. So the number of points is about p squared here, and again, not p squared here because each line is determined by a pair A and a B. So basically there are something two P squared vertices and again which kind of reflects this because this is two dimensional. P squared is two dimensional. Two dimensional thing here, two dimensional thing here. And degree of every vertex is about P. Every line contains P points. And why doesn't it have a K22? Well, if I take two points, look, this P my P1, this is my P2, and I'm interested what are the L's which are the both adjacent. What are the lines? Both of them adjacent. In other words, what are the lines containing both of these points? Well, okay, it's okay, right? Two points, there's only one line going through. Okay, it's again, you can write of course equations, but it's always symmetrical. All right, so this is the construction. Now, so if you like, maybe I will write for the formulas. So basically, I'm saying the point xy on the left is adjacent to the point AD on the right. Adjacent to the point AB on the right, if a certain equation holds, namely this equation which I've written. Okay, some equation. Now, what does the construction for the K33 look like? Fairly similar. Now we go, you know, we replace twos by threes. So on the left, we have points again, and on the right, we have unit spheres. So, in other words, here I have x, y, z, here I have A, B, C, and the edge is going to be given by an equation x minus a squared 1 minus b squared plus z minus c squared equals 1. A unit sphere. And again, um You can see that this should work again on a duit level without doing algebra. It's like, okay, imagine an ultimate situation if this is not a kind of finite plane, but our usual familiar plane where we have real numbers. Sorry, not planes, there's free space, sorry. So analogous situation in free space would be, okay, you have a free space, usual free space which we live in. Oh, I forget the Einstein. And we take a sphere here, a unisphere, another sphere, we intersect them. It's going to be a circle, usually, if it's not empty. And now the circle determines what these two spheres are because they say unispheres. They are fixed sides. So if you take a third one, you can clearly imagine this. You're going to have two points. So three points, neighborhoods in the same graph will intersect just in most two points. Okay, this is a proof by hand waving. By hand waving. But if you actually were trying to write this proof formally, what would you do? You would just say, okay, fine, let's introduce the partition coordinates in our free space and write equations. And it's easy exercise, and we all can do it. And the point is, since we are working on the field, you can do the same exercise by just working with FP. And you will get actually some condition on the negative one should be non-residue, but okay, it works. Is there any place where it is written now on a readable finite thing? Sorry? This construction, this is Brown's construction. Yes. So is it lecture notes where it is actually explained for non-algebras? Brown's paper isn't definitely here of the strategic equations. Uh I try to look, it's uh at least a bookmark. Too low, but uh okay. Um Okay. I can't give a reference off the top of my head. But I'm sure probably after after this topic is finished, probably I should build it fine. Okay, so this is kind of the construction. So now constructions for the along caller on Saba. Okay, they also, again, they replace freeze by X's, they write some equation, which is more complicated. The writes of the equation, which is more complicated, and there is a kind of argument why it works, it's more complicated still. Okay, so I will not go there. But the point is it's the same kind of spiritual construction. So let me tell you kind of different class of constructions. Instead of writing equations explicitly, I mean, I want to tell you that you can actually, okay, these essential equations are trendy, and why should it work? So, what's the general shape of constructions? We have. Constructions. You have Fp to the S. You have Fp to the S, you have some point, so this is my X, and you have some Y, and again, X is a vector now, so X is a vector. So P to the F on the right. F T to the S, thank you. So this is a vector of length S, this is a vector of length S, and these edges are given by equations of the form. Some polynomial equals to zero. This is the open graph. And why should so why should Why should it work? So say my degree of f is some d and let me say pick f at random among all polynomials of degree d. Just so that that's the majority. So a neighborhood of a point, so neighborhood of some point F is just set of all the y's which satisfy this equation. This equation, it's some kind of hypersurface, right? It's just one. And now, what I'm interested in, I'm interested if I have some S axis like this, and I want to know what the common neighborhood of this axis is. So, I want intersection. I'm interested in the intersection of bunch of hyper surfaces. So, basically, what are the y's which satisfy a system of s equations? And there is a basic result in algebraic geometry, which is one of the first things one learns if one learns algebraic geometry. It's Bissouse's theorem. It basically says that the intersection of a bunch of hypersurfaces, so Of hypersurfaces, so the intersection of a bunch of hypersurfaces, and in our case it's going to be that, will have as many points as the product of the degrees of defining equations. So as degree to the s points, I mean, actually, it's actually equality, it has exactly that many points if you count them correctly, the multiplicity and etc. Simplicity, etc., but let me just say because it knows the points, if you don't come correctly, we don't worry about multiplicities. Provided, there is an important condition, if this intersection, this intersection is zero-dimensional. Again, you should get don't think about algebra. It's easy to it's easy to get confused with algebra, but think about geometry, like you know, like you Like, you know, like if you were working over reals, you would know what the dimension is, right? It's like, you know, you have these hypersurfaces, the sections again, again, locally with some manifolds of some dimension, which means you have some patches, including patches of proper dimension. That's a good intuition. And basically what happens, you can actually j you know, make analogous definitions of it algebraically, which basically are equivalent. Uh, you can find dimensions in there. Uh okay, you can find dimensions in okay. So, point is okay, if it's if it's zero-dimensional, then it's accurate. But if it's not zero-dimensional, then yeah, it will, but you have more solutions, usually. So, so really what happens again is you can make constructions, you can choose a random polynomial of some degree d, and then you're going to get that the neighborhood of any S point is as sides bounded by the D to the S. Assuming you can show that the intersection is zero dimensional all the time. Zero-dimensional all the time. And this is a bit of a sticking point. So, what's the kind of problems with these constructions and why we're getting somewhat new bound? It's in order to show anything, in particular this dimension is small, you need to be interested in the values of the functions. This function. So, for example, what do you want to show? A simple thing. You want to show that, for example, that intersection is not a line or doesn't contain a line. Because if it's zero-dimensional, it shouldn't contain a line. So, for example, let's call this intersection N. So, for example, you might ask, pick some line L, and you ask yourself, is this line contained in this intersection? And the problem you're facing is the following. Let me draw my line L. So this is my line L. And I say I take some couple of, say some points on it. Okay, so I set three points or something. Then if the functions defining my the functions defining my graph, this function f, is a linear function, for example. Just so again. For example, just to again think simply: if it's a linear function, then if I know values of this function at two out of the three points, then I will know the value at the third point. So they are not independent. So it's similar. So that means. So that means it's if it's again, it's kind of geometrically obvious. If I have a bunch of f my degree one, I have each defines me linear subspace and if I have a discussion, it's going to contain, it's linear. But so we have similarly, if we have a degree, if degree, so if I have if here we have d plus two points, so if remember degree of f. The member degree of F is D, then these points are not independent. So values of F aren't independent. So when you are thinking about estimating probability that you are going to contain this line, it's going to determine basically whether your function vanishes at z plus one of them, any of them. So this is basically what we'll control the probability. It's probability that some function, random polynomial, will vanish. Random polynomial of polynomial participating plus one point, and again, probability function of an union point is one over p, because it's like a random value. So this is basically what dictates why you have to take degree large. You have to take like degree large, because you need enough independence to make those probabilities small to make the union bound argument. Because your union bound needs to show that for every Need to show that for every s vertices here, something holds. So, your union bound is over p to the s, choose s many tables. You need to kill this term. So, you need probability to be very, very small. And so you need a lot of independence to make this work. And so, roughly, you need to basically in order to k do this, you need to kill to the p to some, well, 2s, so you need the degree to be b about 2s. Degree to be about 2s to have enough independence. Because if you have S independent, if you have D as some number of independent points, you have probability speed of negative that many points. So that basically tells you that you need to take D, something like 2s, to make random wall. Okay, this is kind of, I'm just, this is old stuff. I'm just explaining basically some old ideas, and then I'll tell you what's the new trick. And this basically gives you a bound of about. bound of about t is about s to the power 2s because this is this is this besus bound if you actually work everything up so it gets s to the s and it turns out to 2s quick question yeah so you explained in the case of a line but i guess these polynomials are now degree you care about varieties of degree of s and absolutely josh you're absolutely right i care not only about lines i can also I care not only about lines, I also care about if it contains, let's say, a curve of some the same idea holds. I mean, I don't I want to have no relations. So, yes, absolutely. Is it obvious the numerology is working in your favor? Because I mean, now there's just so many more curves that you're screwing. It does. So, basically, what happens is that the Hilbert function is going to be larger for more curvier things. This is the idea. So, basically, it's The idea. So basically, it's okay. It's definitely works in my favor, yes. Okay, there is something else that needs to be said, but let me do it after the talk. Alright, so what's the trick? How do we reduce this degree? The trick once you phrase it this way is obvious. I don't want to have this worry about, say, tuples of points which are collinear. So, what I'm going to do. So, what I'm going to do, I'm going to take this picture and I'm going to erase this and I'm going to put something else instead. So, I'm now going to know my space is not going to be any more fp to the s. It's going to be some set which does not contain a tuple of collinear points, for example. It will not also contain these more complicated things which Josh alluded to. Like, for example, taking points on a circle, you know, there's a container. Um, you know, there's circles of low-degree curves and actually low higher degree things. So it will not contain all the things I do not like. Okay? So that will basically allow me to run this argument where D is fairly small, actually. It ends up being 3 is the threshold where I can end. Well, actually, it's 2 plus epsilon, but there are no polynomials of degree 2 plus epsilon, so I had to take it 3. So. So let me tell you what this set of points is. So this V, which I'm going to take, is going to be itself is a random variety. So V is also a random variety. In other words, a random variety, which is to say, zero set of Of some set of polynomial equations. So basically, some set of the form y, some g1 equals y equals 0, blah blah blah, up to some g, I know, my equals 0. And again, I'm going to choose peags at random again. Again, there is some algebra to be done, and some it's not trivial algebra, but It's not a trivial algebra, but there's some algebra to be done, and which will convince one self that if you do that, and the degrees of this are properly chosen, then this V will not contain things you do not like. Well, this will not contain many of them. How small does it become? How small does it become? Well, how small? I mean, you're restricting, so how much? How many words is this? Oh, no, what I know. It's I this means. It's I. This V, okay, so great, great question. So this V is in some higher dimensional space. So this is R. This is, so for example, okay, if you want to think about, like I say, think of this del F of P, and this is S plus M. Okay, so really, okay, so before I was working in S dimensional space, now I work in S plus M dimensional space, and I intersect with M hypersurfaces. So on average, this still has roughly P to the S points, but it's still S dimensional. Some curved space at the same time. Yeah, it's very curved. It's very curved. It's not rational. So you cannot just change coordinates and get your usual flat space. The degrees are somehow constant? Okay, at this level of sketch, yes, this is going to be degree free. In reality, I'm skipping one important thing. So actually, you need to do this thing kind of twice. So one, you're going to have to prepare things. You can have to prepare things, like what I'm just saying. So, this is the degree-free, same degree as you're going to be using eventually. And then, actually, there's another thing you need to worry about and to kill some extra stuff at the end. And for that, you just add a very few extra polynomials of high degree. But this is kind of the main part. Well, both. This is what you need. So, there are going to be linearly many of this. So, M is going to be. Many of this. So M is going to be, M is linear in S, and this degrees of VGs is constant. So now, if you try to estimate how big the neighborhoods are, we're still going to be using Visouse theorem. So, and Visus says as follows, I have now neighborhoods, but they are living now inside this V. So, what I'm doing. Inside this V, so what I'm doing, I'm really intersecting this N, which I wrote on the left, with V. V itself is an intersection of a bunch of constant degree hypersurfaces, so I still get a bisou-type bound, but now I have a basic. Okay, so this is basically one of the main ideas, and this is the end of my time, and I thank you for your attention. Any questions? Any questions? Is there any hope for an inverse theorem of some sort? So if I just give you a bipartite graph that extremizes great structure on, you could find some sort of algebraic structure, some sort of variety. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Even in the K2 case, I mean that. K22, if you okay, so for K22, we know that you actually achieved exactly. You actually achieve exactly maximum mean, exactly that number of pages, not minus one, that number, and it's gonna be the construction show is not actually not the best thing, but we should improve it a bit probably. For the number of vertices is also just right, then we know that construction. So this is kind of level of stability we know. And it's uh you know uh hoping for a great level of stability for a case or two case is probably going to hope nearly hopeless because they cannot Nearly hopeless because you can get constructions of K223 graphs from what somebody calls seeden sets. So any seed set gives you a K22 graph. And again, so now, after a long, long time, there isn't actually some kind of conjecture what the stream of season sets might look like. This is the Manners and Eberhardt paper. Very nice, highly recommended. But again, this is still very loose as that. But who sets back minus x not x stability? Uh no, that's more general. It's not GDP. Well, it's again the entire integers. Not in like uh integers or not to no, I think I'll not do that much, because it's my mind separation for that second. I thought sense you can construct uh non-byte byte versions of something. Let's not even discuss what happens for now. But I mean, just it's a yes or no question, practical, because by the standard construction which is in my mind, that you have a like a rouget networks with all set of z3 and then you construct a pipeline. Yeah, but right now. In general, you are not talking about pipelines. Yeah, yeah. I mean, like, discussing these constants, yeah, that's. If you don't worry about the constant, I don't know. About the first number, it doesn't matter. But if you're doing well, yeah, exactly. But if you don't worry about the biper title, it's very constant. Okay, what might be easier, going back to your question, is going to the, let me say, self-k22, it's going to be harder. If you want to shoot, k to the three is going to be easy. Kf4 is easier still because they're nested. Because every construction of K2, say K23 contains constructions for K22. You can just take a link over an edge. And so they nested problems. So they nested problems. So maybe it's easier. It should be easier proof to deal with that, but again, still, we have or nothing. So just like the dummy version of the answer is conjecturally, yes, everything goes from algebraic. Conjecturally do not exist, for example, for KSS regards. That's a very conjecture. But aren't there some like non-designed projected planes or something? Yeah, but for example they're not very stable. I mean if you to ask them to occur everywhere. To ask them to occur everywhere. For example, one thing which is classical results is that there are no non-disargian three-dimensional projective geometries. Every three-dimensional projective geometry is disargient. For example. I had one last comment. Go ahead. Yeah. No, you go first. Here's our plan. He decides who goes first. I mean, it's just that really, this is some trend that. And really, this is some trend that has been successful in the last few years in some extremal problems. In Ramsey theory, also it happened. That you take some large structure which is sub-optimal for the extremal problem you are considering, and then you restrict it to an induced subgraph. That's really what you are doing. If you took a structure with P to the, Fp S to the S plus N, F P S plus N, you would have a lot of these things, but you just restrict question how you restrict them. That's, I think, nice. And that's, I think, a nice thing to know. Basically, we have this big structure, it has the bad things, but you take an induce subgraph quite early and somehow kill the whole. Is that correct? You're going to think of it as a problem. Yeah, and so can you do it over the complex numbers? Yeah, yeah, a paper is written working over FP just because I want to keep the algebraic jumbling to the minimum, and I could do when I do over FP, I could do the make some of the arguments as counting arguments rather than as. Arguments as counting arguments rather than as uh dimension. Dimension. But yeah, I'll work over anything. Let's be careful though, because over to the reals, these are now semi-algebraic graphs which have different Correct Terra numerology. No. No, it's dimension. The statements is not statements is again different. Dimension, we're not counting number of points, we're not stating a bunch of points. Number of points, we're not stating a bunch of points, it's like measuring a variety here, the measure of variety there, and you have some variety, edge set variety. You're thinking about graphs, like an alpha finangraphs. But isn't that the dimensional angle here? Or are you somehow letting the dimension become very? Oh, but you need to learn. No, it's going to be a different problem. Let's think the speaker. Zero minutes.
