Work in progress. We have published some results with Jorge and Roberto. Okay, so let's start. Here I'll just consider a finite group G, and I just consider L2 of G with the usual pointwise addition and the usual inner product there. Semination that I will use, I denote the I denote the as EG as the element that maps h to one if g equals to h and zero otherwise. For each element in L2 of G, I can write it as the sum over G in capital G of alpha G of E G. Sometimes I use the notation alpha sub G or alpha of G depending on whatever is more convenient. G, depending on whatever is more convenient. Okay, that's just a standard. Just a note on these spaces, of course, L2 of G is isomorphic or actually unitarily equivalent to CNN. This is because once I fix enumeration of the elements of G, well, I can give this unitary isomorphism. And well, for the bounded operators in L2 of G, I have In L2 of G, I have a corresponding unitary isomerism. Here I'm just using the bracket notation that I think everybody is familiar with. What else? Oh, yeah, yeah. The main point about this note is that even though we have these identifications, I will keep L2 of G and B L two of G because the group structure is important for my calculations. Okay. Okay, the thing that I'm going to consider there is just the lap regular representation. This is just the theorem that says that any finite group is a subgroup of a group of permutations. So I denote more notation, sadly. So I have E of G, it's the boundary operator defined on the basis that I just defined in L2 of G as U of G maps EH to maps EH to EG. Oh, yeah, yeah. UG maps EH to EGH. Then for an arbitrary element alpha in L2 of G, the value of alpha at H gets mapped to actually alpha of GH. Well, we can think this action just as a left shape of the entries of the elements of L2 of G. What else? Well, I can express this U as a linear combination of my matrix units. Let's just note that the conjugate transpose of or the adjoint of UG is just UG inverse. Okay, having said this notation, now it comes this left G circle, circulating quantum Marker Symming group, and it's essentially that. Group and it's essentially that at each element I map it to the conjugation by the unitary matrices here, and then I put some coefficients there here, alpha. And the conditions, no, the conditions over my coefficients are that all of them are non-negative for all the elements and are not the identity group element. For the identity, that's going to be equal to one here. Here, no, that's not negative one, and then the rest of them will add up to one, essentially. This is also known like a Q matrixing for Markov chains, essentially. And then, well, and small observation remark is that if I take Lg as the square root of alpha G times UG for G distant from the identity group element, then identity group element, then and h equals to zero, then this is indeed IAGKL as generator of a quantum Markov semi-group. Okay, also the motivation behind this research was that, well, an example, the circulan quantum Markov semigroups, which covers the case when G is Z. My introductory matrices become just these shift matrices here. And if I have now the canonical basis in Cn, Basis in Cn, while this G matrix just shifts the basis secretly to the left. Okay, just the semiconditions on my circular length GKLS generator. And the important thing about this example is that it motivated this idea that these quantum marker semi-groups have a block. A block diagonal structure. For the case g equals to z, my operator L dot is isomorphic to C tensor and identity. So, and just ah, yeah, this is important. Where each block is simply a circulating matrix where the circular vector is just my coefficients alpha 1, alpha 1, alpha 0, alpha 1, up to alpha, and minus 1. To alpha and minus 1. There are a lot of material on this subject, especially we have the discrete Fourier transform that essentially diagonalizes all the circular matrices at once. So we can make explicit calculations. And actually, one of the main motivations about these things is that we want to exploit the graph structure so we can perform explicit calculations and still have some kind of robot. Still have some kind of robust structure there, too. Okay, so this is the motivation. So, what we found is that, well, this block structure is preserved for just a general group gene. Again, now my operator is not isomorphic to a block operator, Q tensor the identity on L2 of G. And now this Q is just a linear combination with the same coefficients as. Linear combination with the same coefficients as before of my unitary matrices. Yeah, it should be noted that this operator we call them the G-circling matrices. In some papers, they also call them patterned or convolution matrices. The unitary equivalence holds under this unitary symmetry that maps the element E of E of G. of uh EFG to simply the tensor EF tensor EG okay um what else okay yeah just a note I have the coefficients alpha and then I can just consider the places where those coefficients do not vanish that's going to be the support of the function alpha it turns out that if I consider the support and then I consider Consider the support, and then I consider I denote by g of alpha the suit group generated by this support. Then I can refine the block structure of my generator L. And essentially, I only so instead of having Q tensor the identity 1G, I have this Q tilde, where the Q tilde is now computed under a smaller group. And actually, this Q tilde is just a left G alpha circulant matrix. Anyway, but and then we have, I think we, most of the results we have can be taken down to this refinement. But for simplicity, I will just assume that G alpha equals G. And well, just note that we might still have that the support is not. Still have that the support is not all G, but still the support generates the whole group, the whole group. Like, for example, if we have ZP and then we just take any non-zero entry. Okay, here. Yeah, so as a consequence of the block diagonal structure of my generator, it turns out that I have some invariant subspaces. And one question that we have, and we have an We have, and we haven't answered yet fully. Is that if this condition is characterized, this kind of possession, more other conditions, of course, will characterize our love G circuland generators. Well, if I restrict the generator to the subspace BG, where BG is simply the span of EFG running with fixed G and then. G and then we just let run off. Well, this is unitarily equivalent just to my circle and matrix. And then because I have this block structure, then oh, then the semi-group also has a block diagonal structure. Now I replace the q part by a e to the tq. Yeah. Here. Yeah. Okay, so these spaces, just a note, these pieces, BG, are throwing their exam of Hiram in the Hill versus Mich sets. Again, this is just a reminder that these unitary coolances are hold under this unitary map. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, this is what something that I mentioned at the beginning. So G circular matrices are also. Circulating matrices are also referred to as a pattern or convolution matrices. And we exploited some results on Fourier transforms for finite groups. One of the references that we saw was by Perceviaconis that essentially like via irreducible representations of a group, one can construct a Fourier-like transform. The main idea is that. The main idea is that with this Fourier transform, lots of G-circular matrices can be blocked diagonalized. Okay, so using this, like this Fourier transform, we were able to prove that Q is a left circular matrix, so is E to the TQ for each T. And more concurrently, And more concurrently, if I have the Q matrix given as such, then et to the Q takes this form, and the coefficients can be explicitly computed. In this sum, I'm summing over a dual of unitary irreducible representations of E. That means just I take a representative of each unitary irreducible representation. And bro is the Bro is the dimension of my representation. And what else is missing here? Yeah, yeah, okay. So this matrix D bro is just a linear combination. I recycle the coefficients A alpha alpha G and basically I create a linear combination of the values of my irreducible representation. Anyway, these guys can be computed in theory. What else? What else? Ah yeah, yeah, yeah. It depends. If we ask for more structure on the coefficients, each of these matrices become a diagonal matrix. In principle, there are blocks, but if I have more conditions on the alpha coefficients here, each of these D row becomes diagonal. Okay. Now, Now, exploiting this, and just because as a consequence of this lemma, it follows, and the unitary equivalence, it follows that my quantum Markov semi-group also have this structure, and just the coefficients are as before. And then the conclusion or the idea here is that the asymptotic behavior of TTX is essentially then determined by the coefficients alpha gt that I described. Alpha GT that I described earlier. Yeah, so at first, one of the conditions I mentioned before when you have a diagonal matrix for the D row matrices is that alpha must be a class function. That means that, well, alpha of G one equals alpha of G two G one. And that's equivalent to asking that alpha is constant on each conjugacy class of G. Each conjugacy class of G. If this is the case, then the matrix D rho becomes diagonal, and then we can make more calculations on the alpha GT coefficients. And doing that, what we found is that, well, if alpha is a class function and I have this generator, L, G circle on K G K L. Circle and K G K S L generator, then the set of limit points, which is defined as such, coincides with the set of right circle, G circular matrices. So before I mentioned that I was mentioning just left circular matrices, and now right G circular matrices are just the same thing, just that the shift is just performed on the right. Okay, this is an explicit description of those. This is an explicit description of those such matrices. And this guy here, G that maps G to V G is just the usual right regular representation. So right G circular matrices are just linear combinations of those V G. Questions? Okay. Thank you. Okay, so more concretely about the limiting behavior of this semi-group. Behavior of this semi-group. Essentially, because remember, I decompose BL2 of G as a direct sum of BG spaces. So for each X there, I decompose it in this direct sum, explicitly given like this. And what happens when I let my semi-group act on this X is just that it takes the coefficients that correspond to the space Vg. correspond to the space Vg in the decomposition of B L2 of G and then they just take the average and once you take the average uh you just put it in front of your right right circular circular well the right right regular representation okay what else yeah this is just a reminder of a state Of a state of what it is. I think most people, I guess, here are very, very familiar with this, and also with the notion of pre-dual of LNOT. So an interesting, a very useful fact about these generators is that if I have a left G-circle and generator, then the pre-dual is also a left G circle. A lab G circle engineer. Now, here I have added the word perturbed. So, this is a definition in terms that if you, I'm just gonna, the definition just applies for the lab guy. And the perturbed is because now I'm adding this Hamiltonian there. Okay, so so far so good. Um, yeah, yeah, okay, this is important. So Okay, this is important. So just notice that the coefficients are reversed here. And well, the Hamiltonian just take the negative value there. Okay. The set of... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So since this guy takes this, the predual takes this form, and I have that if an element belongs to the kernel, the predual, then it's going to be, no, no, the other way around. No, no, the other way around. You have an invariant state and I have the predual, then that invariant state needs to be in the kernel of the predual. Having said that, because I have this form, it turns out that we were able to compute explicitly the invariant states for the non-perturbed case. And as you can imagine, it turns out, or you might guess, the same. The set of right circulant matrices coincides with the kernel of NAG circulant GKLS without perturbation. Yeah, and that's because the pre-dual also has the same form. And then as a consequence, we have that if we are given a state, this state is going to be invariant for my generator if and only if has the form of a G circulant, G right circulation matrix. G-write circle and matrix. Okay, so we were saying, like, well, it turns out that these guys are a lot. And the reason for that is because, well, we went back to the cyclic group. With the cyclic group, we have the Pourier transform matrix. How am I doing on time? I think I think 20 minutes, right? Yes. Yeah, okay. How much time am I? Yeah, okay. And how much time am I? 25 minutes? Okay, that's okay. Um no, no, it's okay. Uh let me see. Uh anyway, because for anyway, you just for this guy, there are a lot of invariant states because this essentially you just take a group element there and you construct a block circle and matrix and using just And using just the usual Fourier transform on Zn, you can compute these guys there. So essentially, we have lots of invariant states for this G-circulant. Anyway, this is just a summary. So we have lots of invariant states. And the next step that we wanted to take was, well, what's going to happen if we add the Hamiltonian? We wanted to investigate invariant states, asymptotic. Investigate evariant states, asymptotic evolution, spectroglap, entropy production gate, right? I think we computed this for the guy without the Hamiltonian and all the alphas non-zero, non-equilibrium states, and perhaps a characterization of these guys. Anyway, long story short, we tried this perturbation or Hamiltonian. G-circular matrices, diagonal perturbations. Diagonal perturbations, of diagonal perturbations, and just general perturbations. And I guess anyway, we kind of, so we use this paper, this proposition on the paper by this Charms Fagnola, Sasson, Umanita, that essentially, because we always have the identity as a faithful normal invariant stay there, then a fixed point of this semi-group with this. A fixed point of this semi-curve with this generated row must belong to the content of this guy here. And that means that essentially, again, we go back to write G circle line matrices. Okay, some cases, I guess, increasing success in a way. So if we take a lap G circle line matrices and these Matrices and this doesn't affect the set of invariant states. On the other hand, if I take an Avelian subgroup, and now I take this as a right sequence matrices, then up to positivity, this guy is also always an invariant state or a level. So those are not very successful cases. However, it turns out that if we take a non-diagonal A non-diagonal Hamiltonian. Well, with these conditions here, essentially we boil down to the identity in some cases and some other case we have an additional guy there. I think going back to the question about characterization of these guys, well, it turns out for diagonal Hamiltonians, it turns out that the generators are again a The generator is again a block diagonal, but now each block is different. Before it was just Q, and now I have a dependence on a group element G. And then again, E to the TL distinctory equivalent to this sum here, direct sum. And this is going to be very important because we found out that, well, let F be a subgroup of G. Let F be a subgroup of G. I have a diagonal Hamiltonian. And if my coefficients of the diagonal Hamiltonian are constant in Latvia sets, and this means this condition here, I should add there is a typo there because I need that the function h has takes a value in one cassette that is different from the other cassettes. Having said that, well, I reduce. Said that, well, I reduce the set of invariant states to just regular matrices that run over the subgroup G. And conversely, if I take another try H and then I just compute the values of G where basically conjugation by V lives in variant H, then this group. then this group, which I denoted as f tilde, is the maximal subgroup of g where this function hg is constant on lab cassettes. So essentially, so you take a group and now your invariant states kind of have a hierarchy or a partial order depending on the partial order given by inclusion. Yeah, as an example, Example, um, yeah, as an example of how you boil down these two the identity as the only invariant state is that you take a diagonal and then you just require that one of the coefficients of your diagonal Hamiltonian is different from any other entry. And then you just have the normalized identity as an invariance state. And I think that's it for today. Do we have any questions? Well, let's thank the speaker again. Thank you, Siri. Well, with this
