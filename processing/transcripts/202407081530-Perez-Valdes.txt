So let us continue. It's my great pleasure to introduce our next speaker, Viktor Platvaldes from the Yokuku University in Kyoto, who will talk on differential symmetry breaking of operators for principal series of this video. Thank you very much for the introduction. And before I start, I would like to give a special thanks to the organizers for inviting me to this wonderful workshop and for letting me give it out here. So thank you very much. So, thank you very much. Okay, so the topic of this talk is differential symmetry breaking operators, which is a topic that already appeared in the morning sessions of especially Professor Kobe Ashi Stock and Dr. Kubo Stock. So, some concepts that I'm going to talk about in the stock already appeared this morning. Okay, so I will start just by recalling the main setting. And I sorry, I will try to go slow. So, suppose that we have a manifold X, a smooth manifold, and suppose further that we have a sub-manifold Y. And further, suppose that we have two lead groups, real lead groups, G and G prime. G prime is a subgroup of G acting on these manifolds. And suppose further that we have two vector bundles over the manifolds X and Y, respectively. And so here we think. And so here we think about equivariator bundles. So we have natural actions of the groups only smooth station spaces. So we have two natural representations of the group G and G prime. So it is natural to think about, well, G prime equivalent maps, G prime intertwining maps between these two representations, which are the so-called symmetry breaking operators or SBOs. Breaking operators or SBOs in short. And these are the main characters of this talk. Okay, so one ambitious problem would be to think about, well, given a tuple of two L groups G and G prime, two manifolds X and Y and two vector bundles B and W, the problem would be to construct all symmetry breaking operators for a given tuple. And well, this problem is really hard and it has been solved for concrete cases. And solve for concrete cases, but it's not solved in the general case. So instead of thinking about all symmetry-breaking operators in this talk, I'm going to focus on a subclass, and that subclass is going to be the subclass of the differential, sorry, the symmetry-breaking operators that can be written as differential operators. So the differential symmetry breaking operators or the SBRs in short, which is a subclass. Okay, and here I just Okay, and here I just recall this morning, sorry, this morning's definition, and by a differential operator, we just we mean a continuous linear operator satisfying this property that it preserves the support of the functions. Okay. So, if we think not about all symmetry breaking operators, but the ones that can be written as the variable operators, we can think about We can think about this problem too, which is analogous to the problem one in the previous slide, which is given a tuple of two lead groups, two manifolds, and two vector bundles, well construct all these operators, all these differentials and integrating operators between these two spaces of smooth settings. Okay, so this problem has been solved during the last 10 years or so by a lot of people in several cases. A lot of people in several cases. But one classical example that also appeared this morning is the classical example of the Lacingcoin bi-differential operators, which is an example of differential symmetry breaking operators for the tensor product of two holomorphic discrete symmetry presentations of SL2R. Okay, so in this talk, I would like to talk about a special case of to the A special case of two lead groups and two manifolds and two vector bundles, and I will try to solve the problem too in this concrete case. Okay, so this concrete case is the pair of the groups G and G prime are going to be these conformal groups, SO0401 and SO031. The manifolds are going to be this 3-sphere and this two-sphere. And here, well, we have that this. And here, well, we have that these spheres are homogeneous manifolds. So these are flag varieties represented as G over P and G prime over P prime, where P and P prime are just two parabolic subgroups of G and G prime respectively, with Langeland's decompositions as follows. So for example, in the case P, we have MAN, where M is SO3, A is SO011, which is just R plus, and N, the nil potential radical is And the nucleophilic radical is isomorphic to R3. In the case B prime, we have the same A, but N prime is SO2, and M prime is isomorphic to R2. Okay, so from now we are going to define the vector bundles. And the vector bundles, so we would like to think about any pair of irreducible equivalent vector bundles, V and W, which are just denoted by V lambda 2n plus 1 and L Î¼. L so we just think about two vector bundles associated to any infinite, sorry, any finite-dimensional irreducible representation of the parabolic subgroups P and P prime. And we form the individual representations by parabolic induction. So in the case of the parabolic subgroup P, we think of this order just reading it in the same order as the Language decomposition. So in the M plot, we have So, in the end plot, we have SO3, and any finite dimensional irreducible representation of SO3 has odd dimension. So this is why we have 2m plus 1 here, when n is a natural number. In the part A, we just define the character by exponentiation, C lambda, where lambda is a complex number. And in the nilboten radical, we just define the representation as a tribal representation. So the first vector vandal, B lambda 2n plus 1. B lambda 2n plus 1 is just a vector bundle of rank 2n plus 1. But on the other hand, when we define the induced representation here, since we have that the m frank part is SO2, which is sabelian, we have that any finite dimensional irreducible representation is one-dimensional. And it is defined by the character Cm, when m is an eternal number. We have that actually this picture bundle is aligned. Vector bundle is a line bundle. That is why the notation L. Okay, so these are the vector bundles that we are going to consider in this talk. And we are going to try to solve the previous problem too, which I just write it here with a different name as problem A, which is the same problem. And it is just the problem of constructing n class. Just the problem of constructing and classifying all differential symmetry breaking operators in this concrete case for these two Lie group G prime, this the three-sphere and the two-sphere, and this concrete two-vector buttons. Okay, so the conclusion is that this problem, we have been able to solve this problem when the absolute value of m is greater than n, but when the absolute value of m is small, this problem still remains unsolved. Uh, remain unsolved. Okay, so in the next slides, I'm going to talk about first theorems that we have by uh solving this problem. And at the end, I would like to talk about the proof itself. Okay, so the first result that we have, which gives us a complete characterization of this space, says the following thing. So, for any parameters, lambda nu, complex numbers, and natural. Than new complex numbers, a natural number, and m, supposing that the absolute value of m is greater than n, then the following conditions are equivalent. So, the first condition is that the space of differential symmetry rate calculators is non-zero. The second condition is that this space has dimension one. So, the space has dimension either zero or one. And the third condition is just a necessary and sufficient condition on the parameters that so that for that condition we have. So, that for that condition, we have that this space is non-zero, and that condition is. So, we have two cases in this condition. The first case is when the absolute value of m equals n. In this case, mu and lambda can be any complex number as soon as mu minus lambda is a natural number. And in the second case, we have a more restrictive condition. So, if the absolute value of m is extremely strictly greater than n, we have that lambda n mu half. Have the lambda and new have to belong to these subsets of the integer numbers. So, in this case, too, we have that new and lambda have to belong to a discrete subset of C2, but in the first case, we actually have a more continuous subset. Okay, so this is the first or first theorem. And in the next result, so this theorem gives a complete characterization of this space. Characterization of this space based on the parameters, but we can actually do a little bit more. We can actually construct explicit generators of this space, and that is what we are going to do in next results. Okay, but before doing that, let me fix a little bit of notation. So, we write this generator instead of writing it in these two little section spaces. Uh, little section spaces, we just uh write these operators in coordinates by using the compactification of R3. So, by using the pullback of this map, we just write these operators down here in these two spaces in coordinates, in the coordinates R3 and R2. And here, one more notation we just identify R3 as C plus R, where we are writing Z as X1 plus I times. As x1 plus i times x2. And the other coordinate just remains like that. Okay, so the result itself, so this theorem is in the case where m is positive, but when it's negative, we have a similar result. So for simplicity, I just wrote the positive case here. So the generator of this space, the differential symmetry brain. piece of space, a differential symmetry breaking operator space when it is non-zero and for m greater than n is a differential operator of order a when a is nu minus lambda which has to be a natural number as the previous theorem states and it is given by the following formula so here for any f any section here we can make coordinates so this we have two m plus one components here these different Components here. This differential operator is given by this pairing composed with the restriction x3 equals zero, where in any well in each vector component we have a q of something, which is just a polynomial. I'm going to explain it right now, composed with the normal derivative from certain power of z. So here these q functions are actually, so these. functions are actually so these q d x y are homogeneous polynomials into variables of degree a minus m plus d minus n and just for simplicity i didn't write the definition of these polynomials but these polynomials can actually be uh constructed explicitly and we construct these uh polynomials by using a bauer polynomials which just omit the formula but the the formulas is like this Is like this. Okay, so these are the main results. And from now on, I would like to talk about the proof, the main theorems. So the proof relies on, well, the so-called method that appear in this morning talks and Professor Tobayasa talk and Professor Kupo talk. And I'm not going to enter in the details here, but just I recall the statement of the method. The statement of the admitted. So if we denote by n plus and respectively n plus prime, the complexified Lie algebra of the nilpot and radical of the parabolic subgroups E and B prime respectively. Then we have a linear isomorphism between the space of differential symmetry by operators with this solution space, where this space is just the elements of this space, which are just M prime A. Which are just M prime, A equivariant number systems. These are just the two representations of the parabolic subgroup P and P prime. And we have just in the right hand side, we have a polynomial space. So the elements in this space satisfying this differential equation. So, well, the notation of this operator is d by New Hat, which is, I'm not going to say the definition here, but for any C in N prime. For any c in n prime in n plus prime, sorry, n plus prime, this just defines a differential operator. So this is a differential equation. So in order to apply the F method, one so the EF method can be thought of doing the following two steps. So the first step, we have to characterize this space of, well, calculating this m prime n equivalent homomorphisms of these two representations. Representations. And the second step can be thought of as solve this differential equation. So, this is what we're going to do from now on. So, first, the first step, well, the first step is actually pretty easy by using finite dimensional representation theory. And I'm just going to talk about this step. But before that, let me just fix some notation. Notation. So, first, let me recall that M prime is, sorry, M plus is isomorphic to our C3. So, we identify this space of polynomials as just the space of polynomials in three variables. So, for any n natural number, we define, so we denote these two spaces. So, polynomial with sub-script B is just a space of homogeneous polynomials of degree B. And this other space, polynomial subscript B, T, even, is just the span. B t even is just the span of these powers of t. Well, the powers are just numbers which have the same parity as b. Okay, so one more definition for any g polynomial and any b natural number, we define this function in three variables by using this b and this g. And this in general is not a polynomial, but it happens that if g belongs to this space that we just defined, then Space that we just defined, then T V D is actually a polynomial of three variables and is actually a homogeneous polynomial of degree D. So, by these notations, let me state the result of the first step of the F method, which is the following one, in which we can characterize completely this space, which is the goal of this first step of the F method. So, for any multiple of Well, table of parameters. We think, well, we fix here just one degree A. So we have one more parameter here, A, a natural number. So this proposition says that the following two conditions are equivalent. So this space is non-zero if and only if A is equal to n minus lambda. And this is why n minus lambda has to be a natural number. And the other condition is that a has to be greater than m minus n. m minus m and moreover any element in this space is of the following form so it can be written as this t b g something where this uh tb is just the the polynomial that we defined in the previous slide or some polynomial g k n in this space so this is these are sorry the first terms in each component and the other terms are just harmonic polynomials like this Play values like this. So, this is the first step of the method. And the second step would be just to try to compute, to try to solve this differential equation once we know the concrete expression of these psi elements in here. And so, in the second step, we can say the following. So, suppose that we have f minus n to f n to m plus 1 plus. To fn two n plus one polynomials, and suppose that these polynomials belong to this state. So these polynomials f plus minus j are just the same as these j k's, but we just change the notation. So suppose that we have n two n plus one polynomials belonging to this space, and suppose that we have an element psi here in this space, which by the previous proposition is. previous proposition is of this form, then this polynomial, sorry, then this differential equation is satisfied if and only if these polynomials satisfy a system of ordinary differential equations. And these equations are called aj plus minus and bj plus minus. And these equations I'm going to talk about this in the next slide. So excuse me, what is the dimension of n plus in this case? or n plus in this case n plus is three it's three three dimensional dimensions three dimensional which so we have uh that is why we have here uh it can be identified as this polynomial with three parameters to mention that the the the theorem works fine under some restrictions and multiple m has to be leaguing up or something Has to be the for something you mean the f method itself or this no no your result uh these results um these results depend on the on the value of m so when m is a small so when m is small we don't have that any element can be represented these ways in the in for example when m is close to zero we have two options so if we don't have Options. So, if we don't have just one candidate, so we have two candidates. So, in the case where m is small, we may have the dimension of the space of differential symmetry breaking operators may jump to two. But it can be computed similarly. Okay, so as I was saying, sorry, so this differential equation by using this concrete expression is satisfied if and only if this plate. Satisfied if and only if these polynomials satisfy some system of ordinary differential equations. So this differential equation, which is a partial differential, a system of partial differential equations with three variables, is simplified as just a system of ordinary differential equations. And this system is just the following one, which is a little bit complex. So let me introduce some notation. So this system of ordinary differential equations is defined by equations is defined by, well, two types of equations, aj plus minus and b j plus minus. And these equations are defined by some differential operators s b f prime and f2 prime and are of this form. Where s is the gigampauer differential operator that it is written like this and it is a so it is a second order differential equation and the other differential operators are just first order differential. Are just first-order differential operators. So, equations of type A are second-order differential equations, and equations of type B are first-order differential equations. And I'm not writing here the definition, the concrete definitions of the operators E, F, F prime, N2 prime, but can be defined easily. And these operators are written symbolically, but they all depend on the parameters lambda and j. Okay, so in conclusion, by using the FMA. In conclusion, by using the F method, we have an isomorphism between this space of differential symmetry operators and this space of solutions of this system of ordinary differential equations. So, in order to solve this problem A of constructing and classifying differential symmetry gradient operators, it suffices to solve this system of ordinary differential equations. Okay. And So, the resolution of this system can be done in a nice way. So, there is a nice structure in this system, and we can actually solve the functions inductively. And there's a good structure of the system that can be represented as diagrams. So, we can actually, if we If we represent the structure of the system in a diagram, so we have diagrams like this, where the red segments represent equations of type A and the blue segments represents equations of type B. And the arrows represent the ordinary in which we solve each equation. So we can actually start by solving these extremes. So the Fn and F minus N, and we can inductively solve the following equation. inductively solve the following equation until we arrive to the middle and i skip the details but uh what we obtain is that this system has a non-zero solution if and only if the tuple of parameters satisfy one of the following conditions which are just the same conditions that we have in the in theorem one and moreover uh this system has uh up to constant and unique solution so this uh proposition So, this proposition shows the first theorem, which tells us that the space of differential symmetry break in operators is non-zero if and only if the parameters satisfy one of these conditions. And moreover, the dimension of this space is one, which is equivalent to that the solution is unique up to constant. And in order to prove the second theorem, we just have to take the concrete expression of the solution, and this solution can be constructed. And this solution can be constructed by using the expression of Geban-Power polynomials. And by using also the concrete isomer piece of the F-method, we can construct by using this solution all the operators that we have in the second figure. Okay, so that would be all. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Other questions? So I made this at the end. So, in the case that n is less than n, you have some operators, but maybe not all of them. No, I don't have any operator in that case, but I think that maybe, as I said before, maybe the space of differential symmetry between operators may jump to two. So we may have. So, but you think it jumps to two, but you don't have any operators. I don't have any operator gladders. I didn't have any operator, but so the thing is, in the case when M is smaller than N, I have completed the first step of the method. So I completely characterize the space of M prime and homomorphisms. So sorry, this first Sorry, this first step is done when n is smaller. And we have, instead of having one candidate of generator of this spin, we have two candidates. So that is why we may have two. But we might have none? Yes, that's true. It depends on the parameter type. I mean, would mean that for each of them you have to figure out what the differential equations would be and try to solve the solution or not. So I don't have I still don't have the concrete system of differential equations, so I can say anything about this case. And this seems like a lot of work. So how deeply does it depend on the fact that you're working with SO4 or SO3? What if bigger groups would be more different situations? Would be more differential, more so. Um, so the answer is that I don't know, but uh, for example, it is known so in this case, the dimension, so the number of equations is the same as the rank of the vector bundle. Okay, so the rank of the vector bundle is 2n plus 1, and in this case, the number of equations, sorry, is 2 times. Number of equations, sorry, is two times that, so two times two n plus one. But in other cases, for example, in the case of differential symmetry operators between smooth forms on spheres, which is a work done by Professor Professor Kubal. Although the dimension of these of the vector bundle is big, the number of equations is a small. So I don't know if there's a pattern depending on the Uh depending on the economy. So this is part of my questions where I should shut up at this moment. But sometimes I like the speculation. So you have a sub-manifold of a bigger manifold. And so your differential equations come from looking at the conormal value and the conormal directions and killing the solution. Yes, so you're the the things that refact with you. Things that they cut with you, the differential equations come from what? The normal dimensions will have variety, the normal dimensions they have variety in the different. So the differential equations, where do they come from? So they think geometrically. Yeah, so almost all the differential operators can be written in terms of the normal derivatives with respect to the No, no. So still he has the geometric function, and then all the algebra acts as vector Fourier. But this differential equation takes the Fourier transform. Transform and on that the vector field turns into the second order information. So if you for example think of the shredding module of value representation and then the Lie algebra may add Then the Lie algebra may have second or defined for it. And isn't the same idea? So geometry actually is somewhere there, but then taking the forest transformer. Then working on that side is easy. So it's not no bad developer. I don't need a table, but. In this particular case, is it known? There are no non-local operators. So, this is a conjecture. I think when the absolute value of m is strictly greater than n, I think that all symmetry greater operators are differential operators. But it's just a conjecture. Okay. I haven't been able to recruit it yet.
