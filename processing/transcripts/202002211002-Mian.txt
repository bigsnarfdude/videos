Okay, I have somehow got the chat on the side of my screen share. So, hopefully, if you do have any questions and you don't want to unmute, you can just hold spacebar and unmute and dive in. It's more than welcome, honestly. But if you want to say or contribute or ask anything in the chat, please do. Ask anything in the chat, please do. So, we're going to straight away get started. I want to introduce a family of patterns before we do the family that we're going to construct. So, this, I would say, you could describe as a family of six-fold patterns, but it's a very specific family of patterns. They can all be constructed on this. So, although I've got circles involved, inherently this is just an isometric grid. That's what we call it in the UK when we have sheets and sheets of them in our cupboards. Sheets and sheets of them in our cupboards in our maths department, just kind of languishing, waiting for the units on 3D drawing or kind of the things that we use this for is minimal, but it's got so much potential. So each intersection is equidistant to the six around it. So you end up with this grid of equal lateral triangles. And for Islamic geometry, it can get you to drawing a whole range of patterns. So I like that and I love that it's expansive. I like that and I love its expansive nature, but I also like the fact that it's such a simple starting point. So you don't have to use the paper, you could construct everything. So behind all these colours, I drew all the circles and drew all the lines I needed to get that grid of triangles and then created this pattern. So this pattern from the first slide, it was from two places, from Delhi in India, it was the 14th century and from It was the 14th century and from Samargand 17th century. So, one way to get drawing these patterns is to just build it up on an existing grid. But I do like process and I like using my hands. I've got like an essay I could write about how important I think it is to use our hands. Once somebody told me in her, she was a primary school teacher near the bottom end and she said that the children didn't know how to use their hands or they got tired from writing. Hands, or they got tired from writing because their manual dexterity just wasn't what it was, maybe however many years ago, when we were less inclined to tap and swipe, and it kind of blew my mind and it made me appreciate using our hands with tools, whether it be for cooking, whether it be for drawing, whether it be for carpentry, whatever it might be. So, anyway, I got distracted there. Apologies. So, this grid is me drawing one unit, and within the unit, it's not the minimal unit, there's actually this. Unit: There's actually this triangle that has been rotated, and because it's the same three-way symmetry, you know, it's an easy one. And this one, this tile, if I then tiled it across the page without having to rotate it or, you know, it's fine. So it's like each of these lines is a line of symmetry in a local point. And then you can just fill the page. So this one gives you a certain idea. I love the idea of. I love the idea of extending the process, so hence me painting and so on. So, tracing it and then transferring it to watercolor paper. Voila, I quite like this one. And it's just this idea that you can start enjoying the pattern and the symmetry on a different level, just elongating that process so much more by, you know, drawing it and then painting it. And before you know it, so much more time has passed in this process of creativity. And yeah, I really enjoy it. As you'll see, I've created a lot. See, I've created a lot. If you reduce the scale, so I took a tracing at a smaller scale, then you can get so much more of a repeat, and your creativity can just go wild. And I have this kind of two-pronged attack, I suppose. I like the patterns to have correct and authentic proportions, one that can be found in architecture from way back when. But when it comes to adding colour and painting and creating, whatever materials I have, whatever colors I love, my Whatever colors I love, my mood dictates that, what I own dictates that, I just go for it. And I think that kind of capacity for the creativity to kick in in a kind of controlled way, it just allows for so much variation. And I really enjoy that. Okay, now that was one set of patterns. From the same isometric grid, you can see other patterns. And these are just examples from architecture. So all of the photos I took from patterns. I took from Pattern in Islamic Art. It's a website compiled by David Wade, who's written some books on symmetry, on Islamic geometry, but on geometry in general and all his manner, all his many interests. Very fine chap, but he's got these brilliant, this brilliant resource that has so many photos on it. So when I first started drawing these patterns, I literally lived on that website. I still do to an extent, but you can just see the many examples. And every time you sort of zoom in to see. Every time you sort of zoom in to see what the shapes are, they're made up of triangles. On this scale, on this one, if you can see the six-pointed star, the unit, the triangle that would be the absolute smallest triangle would be that one point. And then everything is built up from that. Samira, I think in the chat, and I also have the same question, would it be possible for you to pop that, to mention that website mentioned in the chat? Yeah, I shall do. So it's Patron in Islamic art. Let me just type it in actually before I. Type it in actually before I move on and get distracted by something else. Thank you. This is already so exciting. Oh, good. Okay, can somebody test it? Because sometimes I forget whether it's patterns, plural or singular, but I'm pretty sure it's pattern in Islamic art. So please test it and feedback and then off we go. All right. So, um, yeah, the other thing is colour, the way it's used. So, for example, oh, thank you, Maliha, saved the day. Um, so So, with colour, the way it's used to pick out different scales and repeats and different symmetries is in itself an intriguing world. So, for example, here, this rhombus shape is what's been kind of tiled like a checkerboard, and it's the same sort of a rich sort of a simple palette of colours. And black and white, as part of that colour palette, is really quite powerful. And I think when we're painting or when we're doing something where we don't have to consider every Something where we don't have to consider every single space. We might dismiss black and white, we might not think of it. But as soon as in my painting, I started adding black or white as an actual color of a shape, it really, really kind of elevated what I could do and how I could think. So it's definitely one to add in. Just more examples. This one's upside down. So from Uzbekistan and from Turkey. And again, this idea that from this isometric grid of triangles, you can produce many patterns. I'm probably going to Patterns. I'm probably going to say this a lot, but this is one of my favourites. I have so many favourites, given different day, different mood, could be a different favourite. This is again a favourite because of the palace in which it was, because it was a palace in which my friend happened to live. Imagine, you know, living there. And we had such a good time. So those walls surrounding us and just that elegance and that regal quality of this palace. And then these patterns on the wall, I was definitely in heaven. So a beautiful panel again from that same grid. Just a few. From that same grid. Just a few more. These are quite early examples, and I always think when I see the early examples, you get a sense of what came before, what patterns, what decorative arts existed before, and how they kind of took on that quality before they took on a more distinct quality. Another one. I'm going to speed up here. And yet, another one. So, we've been to many corners of the Islamic world, but so far everything we've seen has had a reflective symmetry. How about A reflective symmetry. How about if we take our unit and start thinking about how it could have rotational symmetry? So, something like this, again, I've constructed it, but every rotation you can see is the same thing. I don't know why, I guess it's my 80s childhood that I call these ninja stars, but this is tri-stars that remind me of the things that ninjas used to use. I don't know what reference that is, but anyway, this is a really good one to use. So, you can see it as a, not quite a single unit, but a hexagon. Unit, but a hexagon, so a unit, and then how it's repeated. And where would we see this in architecture? So this is from Cairo. And I might just put them side by side, actually, just for a moment. Sometimes figuring out the pattern and how it looks and how you can draw it, it's good to see which direction the stars or the shape repeats in. So here, once I've figured out, oh yeah, they're all in this horizontal line, I can then put this up. I can then put this up and then repeat it accordingly. Okay, it gets more ridiculous and more complicated. So, this is from Turkey, and it's such a boggler of a pattern. But again, you can reduce it to just this unit, which has these six pointy out bits, and they're just being rotated and tiled accordingly. And I don't know, I think this is one of the ones that is really interesting to create because you need to. To create because you need to get into some sort of rhythm, whether it be in turning the paper or how you draw the line. It reminds me of the very first computers I knew as a schoolchild where we had to just program it. I think it was called logo. I don't know if anyone remembers, but you had to program its steps. And this reminds me of that. Finally, in the family of isometric patterns that have rotational symmetry, one of my absolute favorites is from India. And again, you get this idea that this Again, you get this idea that this single unit you can think of as a six-pointed star, and these L-shapes are surrounding it, and that is then repeated and tiled. But then, between you do have these hexagons. So, of course, I had to paint it. And that kind of whole process is something that I definitely enjoy. So, so far, we've just looked at just this idea that from a starting point, the isometric grid, which is quite universal, something that we're all maybe familiar with, you can All may be familiar with, you can really create quite a lot of patterns. I made a video on this on my YouTube channel, and I talked about how you can draw the grid, and then from it, you can extract different patterns. So perhaps it's something if you want to do an activity, activity, activity you want to do with students, then yep, do dive in. If, actually, let me just show you this. I do love my tracing paper. I've often been accused of loving tracing paper too much, but it's very powerful. So here. It's very powerful. So, here I just want to show you that idea of this repeat unit and how you can extract different things. And once you have something enclosed in a hexagon, thus allowing you to reflect it over those short lines, then it's really quite powerful. And all the patterns so far would have been related to one of these. Oh, Benoit, you remember logo. Oh, see, this was okay. I might have a young. Was okay. I might have a young face, but I'm quite old. So when I was at school, seeing a BBC logo robot drawing on the floor blew my mind, and it just, I don't know, it gives you that idea of the potential. And even as a child, oh, it really was fascinating. I was actually going to say, I wonder, I mean, if I remember logo right, you could only go parallel to the sides of the screen at like 90 degrees. I don't remember being able to. It would be fun. It would be a great Python project to get a student to program. Project to get a student to program a really simple version of logo that allows you to go at 60 degrees, and then you could make all of these beautiful patterns, or you could try and tell people, Hey, this would be a great challenge, program one of these gorgeous designs using logo. I mean, I can imagine it as well. And when, you know, the short overlap I had of when I was a school teacher and when I knew about these patterns, when I had an activity in the classroom, we used autograph, which is very similar to GeoGebra, but the idea to Algebra, but the idea to recreate something, you know, in a software and just, you know, the things they brought to it, because they had they were studying other subjects. So they were like, Miss, how about I draw it in this? And God knows what this was because I can't remember, but it was something where they programmed something up. And I thought, what? This is amazing. So, you know, my limited knowledge and then them studying, you know, whatever they were studying elsewhere and bringing it in, I was thinking that again, much potential. Okay. Go on. My comment was more about how it was thought, right? So, we were told, okay, this is like we were given a sheet of paper, and then, okay, write this in the computer and observe what it does. And we would do exactly what we were told. There was no creativity, nothing like that. But I could imagine if we had been taught at the time, look at some of the very beautiful things you could draw and try to create your own stuff. That would have been really interesting. Been really interesting, and I would have more engaged. But we were given a little more freedom, Benoit, when I was looking at the logo, so maybe that we had different feelings coming away from that. But I think, Benoit, your description is quite accurate of school of a certain era and time. For me, I definitely remember being told, and then, you know, here's this, do this, here's this, do this. But I think also when you see a technology for the first time, that feeling of you, you know, your mind being blown, especially as a child, is really powerful. Being blown, especially as a child, is really powerful, so sometimes it can like override the teacher and their kind of approach. Sometimes, and Samir, I know you have a lot to get through, but I just wanted to say one amazing thing, seeing the images and the range of places they're from, it just goes to show you how beautifully interconnected the world was. I was just seeing the last one of the Itmatul Dalla in Agra. Yeah, Itmatul Dalla was the father-in-law of a Mughal king and was, in fact, And was in fact Persian himself, and then you know, moved to India with his family. And then, um, and so you know, there's just all of these connections between the places. You know, there was a very connected world from Samarkand in Central Asia to Granada in Spain. It's just an incredible speaking of just this network. And we think of a globalized world as something recent, but it really isn't. Yeah, I really can relate to that. Like, so for me, my family are from Lahore in Pakistan. Family are from Lahore in Pakistan, and I always, I don't know, I didn't necessarily know what happened because Pakistan's a new country, right? So, 50 something, 70 years old. Oh, gosh, I let my family down there, but basically, it's a new country. But when I went to Uzbekistan, I was like, hold on a second. These monuments and this architecture and this style of infrastructure of a city, it's literally Lahore. And I was like, well, you know, and it was so powerful to feel so connected. Powerful to feel so connected in such a strong way to these places that I didn't necessarily know. And when I looked at how you know Islam would have reached Lahore, especially, yes, it would have come from the Persians, but the Persians and it was sort of a Timurid empire, you know, they were all involved. So then I felt this real connectivity to being Uzbekistani. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. What a lovely story. I'm so, this is so wonderful so far. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay. You. You're welcome. Okay, so the thing we're going to draw is this. And this is now us talking about an eightfold pattern. So this is the underlying grid we're going to draw. So a little heads up. And from it, although you can extract many pans, please do look at my many tracings. So you could take an eight-pointed star. From it, you can also take this, let's get this right, four-pointed star. And if you notice the eight-pointed star, You notice the eight-pointed star appears at the center on a smaller scale, so this idea of repeating motifs at different scales is really powerful. You can then, in a way, embellish that eight-pointed star. And the corners, I'll talk about in a second, because we're not just tiling a sort of central unit, we care about the entire square and what happens along those edges is really important. And one surefire way to see if somebody Away to see if somebody isn't that aufe with patterns is they neglect corners and joins and sides of things, they just kind of like let it be in a very strange way. Whereas actually, everything should be resolved. Every corner, the central space, the thing that attracts your attention and everything in between. So, here's another one. You don't have to have the eight-pointed star at that scale. You can have just one square because the octagon, sorry, the octagram or the eight-pointed star is made. Octagram or the eight-pointer star is made up of two overlapping squares, so you could extract just one. You can get very fancy. So, this is a little hint of what's to come. So far, everything I've shown you in this little pile has been a tile that you can just repeat and you don't have to rotate it at all. And if you did, it'd make no difference because it'd be the same pattern in different just the orientation doesn't matter. But for these next ones, the orientation does matter because already it doesn't necessarily have four-fold symmetry in its own. Fourfold symmetry in its own right. There's a line of symmetry there, and I've labeled that C for center. But if you were to take this and then reflect it and then reflect it and then reflect it, you would get a far more interesting pattern. So this idea that you can take your unit, so the same lines, same circles, and from it take something which is a quarter of a pattern is really powerful. So here's one, and then here's a slight variation where I've just added a little bit extra. I've just added a little bit extra. So let's have a look at what they look like in terms of what we'll be drawing. So this is what we'll draw, hopefully. But you could also, from the same underlying grid, draw just the eight-pointer star. I love the idea of making things look three-dimensional. So I'm forever, wrongly or rightly, adding shadows. I should really study this more carefully, but I just kind of play and see what happens. But yeah, this idea that you can extract more patterns from the tile and sometimes. Patterns from the tile. And sometimes you don't have to tend to the corners. Sometimes you do. Okay, I'm going to say again, this is a favorite of mine from Seville, but when I saw it, I just fell in love with this building, the Alcazar Seville, which had so many layers of history. So as you walked through the building, you went from Islamic era architecture to Christian era architecture, which are so distinct. And it just felt like the building was in itself a history of the region because of the architecture. Of the region because of the architecture. So it was a wonderful experience. And it was very empty, which is a really strange thing when you're in these amazing places. They're normally jam-packed. Okay, so that was one unit. If you take your idea that you want to draw rather than tile by tracing, then you can repeat by drawing four units. And again, in the links that I think I put on the description on the BIRS Burr's website. The BIRS Boroughs website. There's links to how you can construct two by two, three by three, four by four, five by five as well. And then if you then... Oh, Samira, just a moment. Can you go back one paper? Yeah. What's that little graph you have there at the bottom right corner? Oh, you're going to love this. This is my comedy moment. So this is time. And this is construction. Oh, no, no, this is joy. So when you start, you're This is joy. So, when you start, you're very joyful. There comes a point where you dip your joy, I'll call it what it's supposed to be. It's really, really sad. So, there comes a point where you're overwhelmed by many lines. So, this is my visualization. Then at the end, you construct and you're happy again. I always have to add that in when I feel people are waiting. But, um, the lines that we drew in one unit, if you drew them four times, you'll then be able to construct the pattern four times. Now, some people. The pattern four times. Now, some people I have this conversation with them, like, why would you want to draw it that many times? There's something meditative and beautiful and wonderful about drawing and using our hands, which I've mentioned already. So, I am a big fan. And it doesn't mean I'm like a complete pedant. I don't use computers. I do. I just think the richness of experience comes from both. And so, I value both of them. I'm not a pedant. So, here's some more. One more. And I'm going to flick through a little bit quicker. And I'm going to flick through this a little bit quicker so I can get to the drawing and some paintings. So, again, this idea of enjoying the process. Each of these I've had a wild old time painting in the most untraditional colours. And it's just enjoyable to see, you know, like the fact this one, I thought, let me change what's going on at the center. So there's these subtle variations. And so I've got sometimes a cross, sometimes a pointed star. I also love this idea of repeating or sort of. Of repeating or sort of replicating what's in the architecture. So often you see weaves. So this idea that this channel has been thickened up and it looks as though it's going under and over the other lines is really effective and really powerful. So the Seville patterns actually in these colours, and this is my just drawing of it, but this idea of a weave and this interlacing is really beautiful and effective. And again, lifting up the pattern from this flatness to something that's kind of 3D. That's kind of 3D, another obsession. And then, this finally is the pair, I guess, that I showed at the end. That this is the repeat unit, and then by rotating it about the center, you can get this pattern. And then, if I throw in the weave as well, this is another one where you can see it's a quarter of a pattern. So, enough chit-chat from me. Well, I'm still going to be talking, but I'm going to now draw the pattern. If you've got your compass and ruler at hand. Compass and ruler at hand. I'm using A4 paper and I'm going to be using like felt it pens so that you can see what's going on. But please do let me know if anything isn't clear. I'll also try and refer to the handout that I put in the description of the website, the workshop. So this is the step-by-step guide that I'm following. So I'm just going to angle it so you can actually see. It's very bright. See, it's very bright, but that's a bit better, but we'll see. So, these are the steps I'm following with just a few interjections as to what pans you can extract at any one time. And so, yeah, feel free to follow along now or just kind of watch and have a kind of pressure-free experience. Okay, I'm going to catch up with the documents. Sorry, the chat while I speak. So, oh, thank you, Carol. I hope the chat is saved. I hope the chat is saved somewhere so I can. Maliha, is that the case? Because I feel like I'm a bit behind on the chat. We might be. Yes, I think we have a we'll have a copy of the transcript. Okay, so we've got to the logo. Okay. Oh, nice. NCTM. Interesting. These figures also remove the fractals. Yes. I mean, you know, this is where my limited math knowledge comes in. So I can see how fractals have this property and I can sort of sense it, but I don't know. I can sort of sense it, but I don't know enough about it to explore it further. Okay, all right, so we're going to begin with our paper in a portrait orientation. And I'm going to just judge the center and draw on horizontal line. By centre, I mean halfway down, because it's good to have your construction have a little bit of leeway space above and below. And I'm going to mark the center. You don't often need measurements. measurements on these constructions. The limit comes from, or the need for measurement comes from the fact that we have limited size paper. So with that in mind, I'm going to suggest a radius of seven centimeters because then that allows us to do what we need to do on this paper at a decent size and take advantage of the space above and below. So seven centimeters, the distance between the Between the compass and the point. If you haven't used a compass recently, let me just give you a few pointers. So I tend to say don't hold your compass too much. So by that, I mean just hold it minimally. Don't kind of put all your hands all over it. It's an object with moving parts and you don't want to be the one moving it too much at all, in fact. If I just use my finger and thumb and slightly give it a tiny bit of a lean, And just notice my hand is actually rotating as well. So it's like it's stirring a pot or something. So by allowing my hand and my arm to be free, I can move my hand around. If I hold it too much, if you try this, your elbow locks. So therefore, holding it minimally, applying a little bit of pressure through the pin arm, you can then draw circles happily. Okay. All right. All right, I'm going to draw my circle and this radius that I've picked of seven centimeters, I'm going to use it further two times. So this intersection I've just created on the left and on the right allows me to draw an arc at the top and an arc at the bottom. The only condition for this arc is that it should be wider than the circle. So if you go off the page, do not worry too much. That is exactly what we want. It's more of an irritation. Exactly, what we want. It's more of an irritation if you stop too soon. And we need to just cross into the circle so that we can use these two intersections for the next step. So we have our line that's dividing our circle in half. We want to also divide it into quarters and then eighths. Okay, so using the two points at the bottom, bottom even, I'm going to do two arcs. Do two arcs, and I want them to cross so a perpendicular bisector, and you'll see it's lined up vertically with the center. So then, if you repeat at the top, you can have three points, these two and the center, which allow you to construct your pattern. So, the drawing of the circles, really good to be very careful with them every time you position. With them every time you position your compass at an intersection, make sure it's at that intersection. The second thing to be careful is lining up with your ruler. Um, one thing I would suggest, let me reach over and get a pencil, is if you're using pencil, you can put your pencil down and push your ruler against it and then pivot and get exactly the position you want. And it's a really useful thing to do. I would say 90% of your drawing activity is just checking everything. Activity is just checking everything's in place in the right position and so on. And then drawing is that last 10% move. Okay, so these two have done their job. We don't need them anymore. We're going to refer to the circle now and in its north and south position. We're going to put our compass there and a quick check to make sure it hasn't moved. And then if it hasn't, you can complete this intersection in the corner and this intersection in this corner. And this intersection in this corner. This little thing that I've drawn, it's actually not that necessary, but it has a useful little checking point later. And I love it when you're doing one thing and a previous part of the construction comes up and says, hi, I'm helpful now. And these two will be helpful in a moment. So we have the corners of a square. And what we're going to do is we're going to draw the diagonals and we're going to draw the outline of the square. We're going to draw the outline of the square as well. So, doing this so that our square touches the corners and the sides of the center is really important. So, take your time. And even I would suggest if you need to rotate your paper, do so. Just so that you can get a good view of what's going on. I always wonder how I would cope if I had to actually work at an architect's table or something where everything is a little bit. Table or something where everything is a little bit fixed because I'm forever moving my paper rather than moving myself so that I can get a good view and see over my ruler and see all the intersections. So maybe I should one day try and have a go at drawing in a more constrained way. We'll see. I don't really think I would. I'm too stuck in my ways. So actually the other thing with Roche. Actually, the other thing with rotating the paper is really valuable, is you see the same point of view in terms of the symmetry again and again because it's a square. This side is exactly the same as this, as this, as this. And when you're first learning to see intersections and lines and certain positions, your eye will get trained by seeing them that many times. So, it's very useful to kind of take advantage of that symmetry to train your eye and learn to see. It's something I say a lot with Islamic geometry because the page gets very. Geometry because the page gets very crowded very quickly, and picking out one intersection out of a choice is just knowing which ones they are because of knowing the diagram and the drawing. Okay, so we've done our outer square. We're also going to draw a second square. Now, never in my teaching years did I have to mention the orientation of a square. But in Islamic geometry, it's quite useful to have a vocabulary. To have a vocabulary or terminology for these two orientations. So, this one is a dynamic square because it looks as though it's going to topple over. It's dynamism and it's static square. And I remember the first time I started learning about these patterns was with Art of Islamic Pattern. Maybe Meli here, you could put that in the chat. So, artofislamicpattern.com. And that's by Richard Henry and Adam Williamson. And when Richard had mentioned dynamic and static. Richard had mentioned dynamic and static. I was like, What are these words? I'm a math teacher. Why do I not know these words? And I realized how useful terminology was in the realms of these patterns, but not necessarily anything I'd come up with or needed before then. So it's a very useful thing. And if I draw one more thing, quite rough, but when you combine them and overlap them, that's when you get the classic eight-pointed star. And you can do that with squares to get this, sometimes referred to as the khatam. Sometimes referred to as the khatam, mathematically octagram. But if you did it with triangles, you get a six-pointed star. If you did it with two pentagons, then you get a ten-pointed star. So a lot of the stars that you arrive at can be, especially the simpler ones, can be made up of overlapping shapes, but not all of them. Okay, we're doing all right for time. We're going to draw in this dynamic square and its corners. Square and its corners are on the north, east, south, and west intersections of this circle. And oh, my ruler moved, that's what it will look like. And I've already mentioned that it has a partner, the static square. And this is where me circling intersections might be useful because there's a lot going on. So the diagonal hitting the circle, thank you for putting in. Thank you for putting it in the chat, Maliha. This is the four points that will be the corners of the static square. Now, I've already mentioned how it's important not to neglect these corners. So, although these will be the corners of the square, when we draw it, imagine you're going beyond those corners to make sure that all your construction lines go to the very edge of the tile that we're going to repeat. So, you're not neglecting any area. So, you're not neglecting any area of the pattern. So, these are going to be pairs of horizontal lines. I'm going to just introduce one little slightly fancy tool, a ruler, which has parallel lines on it. So if you have quilting or cutting rulers, they have plenty of parallel lines and it allows you to double-check your drawing by making sure that the lines underneath. Making sure that the lines underneath are indeed parallel and perpendicular. So, if your intersection is slightly out, this allows you to correct it. I kind of didn't use this for a while and it has, it's got a real thickness to it. I'll show you. So, the thickness of this ruler, I don't know if you can see, it's quite a lot compared to my typical ruler. But somebody else was drawing in my class, and I just got this envy to get my ruler out. So, if you do want a ruler, Ruler out. So, if you do want a ruler like this, it's best to look in haberdashery or cutting or craft departments. I've got a list of resources on my website under equipment, and I do go into a lot of detail about things like rulers, even sharpeners, as well as compasses and so on. Okay, so we've got right now enough information to be able to draw our eight-pointed star, and I might just reduce the brightness of this. I might just reduce the brightness of this thing a little bit because it's very. Oh, oh, that's better. So, there's the construction, and once we take away the construction, we have the star. I often get a little bit irritated, and this is my pet hate actually, is when people tile a pattern, you can see these invisible lines that are the edge of the tile. Just consider them tools to enable you to tile. What you want is every shape to be beautiful in its own right. To be beautiful in its own right and not necessarily have those lines, those tile lines, the patterns should stitch together invisibly. Gosh, I got tongue-tested there. So that line, this line, and this line, the tile lines are the invisible tool by which we stitch the pattern together, not part of the pattern. And when I see, I see them in the most ridiculous places, and it really frustrates me. But okay, we won't get frustrated. So we're now going to draw what we need to get the To draw what we need to get the four-pointed star, and what we need is a pair of vertical lines and a pair of horizontal lines. I'm going to take a different colour and I'm going to pick out eight points and they're going to get a good amount of usage. So they're either side of the horizontal, so the intersection is either side, they can also be described as the two corners of this triangle and this triangle being repeated eight times. Being repeated eight times. How do we arrive at that triangle? We arrive at it because it's the overlapping points of those two squares. So, on my dodgy drawing, these eight points are the ones I'm referring to. They are therefore also the corners of an octagon. So, there's many ways to refer to the intersections and their properties. So, sometimes, you know, you might call it one thing, I might call it something else, but it's the same thing. It's just whatever clicks with you in terms of, yep. Clicks with you in terms of yep, I got it, that's the one. So, we're going to draw a pair of vertical lines and then a pair of horizontal lines. And again, I'm using my very fancy ruler to make sure it's parallel. Having multiple rulers to hand is very handy. I seem to now have on my table permanently a 50 centimeter, a 30 centimetre, a 15 centimetre, and then this gridded ruler. So, four rulers just, yeah. So, four rulers, just yeah, always there. I never thought I'd be that person. Okay, so we have now drawn enough information to be able to draw this eight, sorry, I said eight, four-pointed star. And what's really beautiful, and you start seeing now the gorgeousness of these patterns at a kind of more detailed level, is the eight-pointed stars are now in between the crosses. So, if I was to seamlessly tile them. Was to seamlessly tile them, you wouldn't be able to tell which one is which. So, this one is the one that I constructed previously, but now by just by adding those four lines, I've constructed that. And this pattern, you can see an example here. And this is surprisingly the Grand Mosque of Paris. So, who knew this beautiful kind of gem of a Moroccan architecture was in the heart of Paris? And when you find out about this mosque, it was basically built after the First World War by way of Built after the First World War, by way of thanking the people who fought from North Africa and Spain. What have I written here? Oh, yeah. So it's in the style of Moroccan architecture. So these tiles, you might refer to them as Zelige tiles. I've been really cocky on my handout, and I said sometimes it's wrongly called mosaic. I must have been feeling harsher that day. I don't think I'd say that same sentence now. But yeah, they're cut to shape. Yeah, they're cut to shape and they're seamlessly tiled together. And you find them in Morocco. And recently, I've been having conversations with people about Algeria, and I was like, I didn't, it didn't really come on the radar. But yeah, the North Africa has buildings with the Zelish from many years ago and as a living, breathing craft and art now. So I stayed in a Riyadh in Fez, and my landlord was like, I made this table because you can go to the market and buy sacks. Because you can go to the market and buy sacks of these tiles and just stitch them together, make tabletops, not stitch them together, put them together upside down, cement them, and then turn them over, and you've got a tabletop. They're called Zalish in Morocco. The same style is called Ali Qatado, love my pronunciation, in Spain. And both of those words have Arabic roots. And recently, I've been having a conversation about the etymology of the words. And there's a Of the words, and there's a word for tiles in Spain, Spanish, and Portuguese that I can't pronounce, but I'll find it somehow. And that also has Arabic roots. And it then gives you this idea that the, you know, although the word in Portuguese no longer is used to say Zilij, they use it to say tiles in general, it just gives you a hint of the kind of ancestry and the etymology of the word and therefore that society. I love that as well. Okay, so we're going to get a little bit more complicated. Okay, so we're going to get a little bit more complicated. We are one, two, yeah, four, eight lines away from the end. So we're going to do this. Now, those two we're going to use, sorry, that pair and that pair we're going to use to draw a diagonal pair of lines and another diagonal pair of lines. So I'm going to do this in a different colour just because I want to do something on the next move. So what we did vertically and horizontally, we're just repeating diagonally. Now, I don't know if anyone's drawing along, but perhaps if we can have a little show and tell at the end, that would be great. Otherwise, I'll just hold mine up repeatedly in all my many paintings, and then in the other direction. I think if you were in yourself and you wanted a cleaner drawing or diagram, then obviously you don't have to circle these points. It's fine. Okay, now these last pairs of lines, the thing I want to do in the end is kind of square them off or rectangle them off. So we're going to draw just where they meet the horizontal and vertical in each corner. So it's a very short line. Let me just show you one. And it's very important to make sure you pick the intersections you've just drawn because there's You've just drawn because there's quite a few points in that corner, in every corner. So, this is what we're after, and we want it to be perpendicular to existing lines. We want it to be parallel to other lines. If I turn my ruler that way and come in at it this way, you can see how it's parallel to all the lines on this diagonal. Or it will show you how dodgy your drawing is and how it's not diagonal. So, can you see my gap there? My thick pens are very. Gap there. My thick pens are very forgiving, but this last line is often where you realize things haven't quite lined up perfectly. And when I kind of teach this, I always think there's two things going on. You're learning a process and you're then going to learn to bring in accuracy to that process. If you are a gifted person who can draw accurately the first time, bravo, hats off. But that's not everybody. Most of us achieve that by plenty of practice. And doing it again and again isn't a chore. And again isn't a chore if you appreciate and enjoy the process. I keep coming back to this little mantra of mine. Okay, um, right, so we've drawn everything we need, and from these lines, we can extract several patterns. Let me just show you some examples. So, here I've got kind of the eight-pointed star that has been decorated, but I've left the eight-pointed stars quite large. So, this is attractive in its own right. However, you know, the proportion of that shape maybe is a bit too. Portion of that shape. Maybe it's a bit too big. Somebody might say, you know, I want smaller, more intricate patterns. So you can break down the pattern a little bit further. Actually, this is a slightly different one where you have a smaller eight-pointed star, but this now is even bigger, this four-pointer star in between. So the one we're going to do is this one. So we're going to outline just what we need for the pattern, and it will be this. And from that, we will achieve. Achieve this. So rather beautiful, and all of a sudden looking quite complex, I hope. And you can find this literally, I would say, everywhere in Morocco. It's a very common pattern. I wouldn't attribute to any one particular place because I've seen it so many times. But it's really beautiful. So I'll just have this on the side so you can see. Actually, let's have the tile. And either you can do what I'm going to do, which is outline the pattern in a Is outline the pattern in a different color pen or in a um I'm gonna go wild and use a very thick pen just to show that I oh if I can reach it that's given me to have my pen so far away okay here they are so I'm going to outline the pattern um using my very thick calligraphy pen and a short ruler so I can just move around and I'm going to start with what should I start with I'm going to start with With. I'm going to start with these lines. And if you can see, if I include the red bits, there's a gap just here, and then it's the same line. So if I show you where it starts, it actually starts not quite on the edge. So it goes from the circle point and then it stops one intersection short of the edge. And that's how we get this quarter of an eight-pointed star. So I'm going to do that. Star. So I'm going to do that all the way around. And I would again say there's so many ways to pick out the pattern according to what you see. I need a drink of water. One second. That's better. So if again, the way you see the pattern is slightly different, I don't think it matters too much as long as we leave the gaps in the correct. As long as we leave the gaps in the correct places. Okay, next, I'm going to show you how that dynamic square, we just need a short part of its corners and then we leave a gap. So let's put that in. You know, all that concentration on, you know, what's happening inside the octagram and the eight-pointed star kind of has made us perhaps not quite notice what's going on along the sides and in the corners. On along the sides and in the corners. So we'll have a look at that in a second. So in this corner, I've already said it's going to be an eight-pointed star, but it's a quarter of it. So what we're going to do is just put in the two diagonal lines and you can see that's a quarter of the eight-pointed star. I might do this freehand. Oh, wow. That feels good. So we've completed everything outside. So if you just look back at this for a moment, we've actually ended up with Actually, ended up with perhaps a slightly new shape. So it's got this arrowhead shape, and to make sure that it's not a full four-pointed cross, it's got the star in the middle. So it's just introduced itself in creating the four-pointed star. Okay, let's do the actually let's do the verticals. And the starting and the stopping points of the verticals is either side of the very small octagon at the center. Now, can I just say I've no. Center now. Can I just say I've noticed how uneven my triangles are? That's not cool, but I have a thick pen, so I'm going to get away with it. It will look all right. But the idea is that these lines, they kind of don't really look as though they're going to complete anything until you put in the diagonals that they start completing each other. And here we go. The last lines for this pattern. So there we have our eightfold Islamic geometric pattern. And if you were to repeat it more fully, you'd arrive at something like this. And when you introduce colour, then you can really start, I think, enjoying it more. So this one I think is coloured quite simply, but. One, I think, is coloured quite simply, but it just can be such a joy to add colour to. I think I might have said we'd be constructing it four times, or I'd do it as a demo, but I think we've run out of time, which is fine for me, which is good. I'm just going to stop sharing my screen and see if anyone would like to hold this up. It all went very quiet when I said it. Almost there. Almost there. You have to share your screen again because I don't, I'm missing lines. Oh, no, really? One second. Let me do it for a moment. Oh, wow. Nice work, Gwen. Nice work, Risha. Okay, I'm just going to share it for a second, just so if anyone else might have been just at that last moment. Yeah, so I don't know if it's in the corners or on the center, but yeah, that's how terrible does that look. Terrible does that look? It's really funny. Sometimes, you know, when you're demonstrating something, you're getting caught up in the enjoyment of it and the process, and then your own accuracy isn't so meditative. If anyone wants to say anything or ask about how they can look at this further, I've really made quite an effort with my website to put as many resources there as possible. So do visit it. And there's books there, I've reviewed them. There's books there. I've reviewed them. That was quite cheeky of me, but I, you know, wanted to make sure I gave an honest feedback on the existing materials. Lots of links and resources to other geometers and artists who I consider my friends, my teachers, colleagues, all sorts. It's a really nice community to be part of. If you're not on Instagram and you might be repulsed by the idea of Instagram, it's a really fun place for when you have a niche interest such as this, we all kind of hype up each other's work and progress. So it's really a nice. Work and progress, so it's really a nice environment for Islamic geometry. So, do come and check it out. I'm sure I'll be posting this at some point. But, yeah, any questions? I just wanted to say thank you, like Vladmodu Shukriyapko. Like, this was an absolutely fabulous, fabulous presentation. And the other thing I was just going to say is, so I study something called translation surfaces. I study something called translation surfaces in my research, which are what happens, for instance, if you play, for instance, if you take a square and play Pac-Man on it, right? That's you're actually playing on a Taurus, right? So you glue the left side to the right side and the top to the bottom. And of course, you can tile the plane with squares. But if you take, so a lovely question is if you take this eight-pointed square that you drew or eight-pointed star, right? These two squares overlaid on top of each other, and you glue and you glue opposite parallel sides in an appropriate way. Actually, I have a postdoctoral. Actually, I have a postdoctoral fellow, I can send you the paper, who, in her PhD thesis, studied this surface that you get from it. It's a genus 3 Riemann surface that has beautiful connections to something called the Fermat quartic. It's really, it's really remarkable. And of course, I was lucky enough before last summer, my wife and I were able to go to Morocco and we saw this thing. And I don't know if this tour guide was just telling us something, but he said sometimes it's called the Square of Solomon. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So it was sometimes called the seal of Solomon. Now, this is the thing: you know, the language which people describe or describe these shapes now or historically, it's over so many centuries, in so many languages, there's not necessarily an agreement that, you know, this is the word for this. But in this 21st century, where so many people have started getting interested in it, I feel there's a kind of a unison in voice somehow. So, for example, Voice somehow, so for example, this particular shape, um, the eight-pointed star, I would say a lot of people would call it the khatam, and that's the word for seal in the term seal of Solomon. So it'd be khatam Suleimani in Arabic, and sometimes it's just called seal of the prophet. But when you used to Google seal of the prophet or seal of suleiman and see what is the shape of this and the nature of it, you'd get multitude of results, sometimes a six-pointed star and sometimes an eight-pointed star. And sometimes an eight-point star. And I'd guess now, if I was to Google it and in images, I would get probably a more narrow definition just because of how many people are practicing this and they're using more or less similar terminology. I mean, that's like the internet and social media summed up and its power, really. But that's fascinating. It is. And my, I've got a friend, his name is Hamza. He's called Craft Draft Fez. And his father has been in. His father has been in brass making for years. And so they have the words they use in the local dialect. And so it's, you know, the Moroccan, the Arabic in Morocco is a little bit distinct, but you can see some overlaps. And there's a lot of Persian artists who have well-established books of vocabulary. So it's so interesting to see what they're named after. And when I realized they're just named after objects, like household objects or celestial bodies, I thought, oh, I could name them. Celestial bodies. I thought, oh, I could name them. So once I had a pattern and it had a shape in it, I thought, that looks like a burger. That looks like a burger to me. So it's the burger shape. I mean, I regret it to an extent because I cannot shift it out of my head. But yeah, no, it's really fascinating. So Seal of Solomon, your tour guide, was kind of spot on. Thank you. Excellent. Excellent. That's really lovely to hear. And yeah, of course, as someone who's, you know, speaks some Hindi and then, you know, just Hindi and Urdu, like all, it's really fun to hear these words and realize. Fun to hear these words and realize how many of these words in Hindi and Urdu are coming from Persian and Arabic. Yeah, especially the mathematical words. Yeah. Oh, so fascinating. Like the amount of times words are familiar to me, I'm like, oh, that's what we call it. It's really good. I mean, like, Urdu especially has, you know, words borrowed from Hindi and from Arabic. So from both sides. So it's like a real rich language. You're very welcome, Bob. Okay, I think. Okay, I think even in my attempt to finish. I am yes, I am Professor Mohammad Sahasim University, Saudi Arabia. So with these type of pictures, 20 years before when I started my PhD in fertiles, and I have seen many books, those are in Islamic geometry. I am also from India, so I know very well this type of architecture. Of architecture. These are in our old buildings in India. This type of telegraph is there. Yes. Arts and this thing. So nowadays I do, I work in fractals and chaos field. So factors are, we generate almost same as this, these factors. One of the factors I have already uploaded on this today, yesterday on the Google. So, you can think just like these types of pictures. Yeah, it's so fun. So, this that old ancient, yes, ancient graphic we can generate through computers. So, we can implement these ideas and we can arts through computer same. Everything you see, we can say versus fractals. See, you know, when people say about using software, I always think, but don't let go. Software. I always think, but don't let go and don't neglect the compass and the ruler. You know, like do both, do both, because there's something to be gained with both. And like, I'm a big fan of sort of analyzing my patterns when I've got a new one to figure out. I do it all on Geogebra, but the ultimate test for me when I construct it is, can I draw it with a ruler and a compass? Is it the most efficient way? So it's very interesting to kind of be able to do it. I think Sarah did something. Sarah Brewer is doing the main presentation. The main presentation. Complexity of fractal, we can study by fractal dimension. Yes. And if we know the fractal, what kind of structure may pass through? Perfect. Thank you very much. Okay, this is a good idea. And just very welcome, Ala and Risha and Gwen. Thank you. You're very welcome. Oh, thank you. You're very welcome and good. I'm glad you drew something that you weren't having drawn before. Okay, I'm going to wrap up because, oh, no, please hold it up. One second. I need to see it. Oh, brilliant. Oh, well done. I'm going to say we wrap up because if you're going to be headed to one of the other rooms, you've got like a short break to sort yourself out. And I want to make sure I am sorted to enjoy the next segment. I don't know about you guys, but I'm really enjoying this weekend. It's been like such a. I'm really enjoying this weekend. It's been like such an educational, rich experience with like-minded people. So, thank you for organizing it, Maliha and Co. And see you guys in another room.
