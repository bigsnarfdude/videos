Good and we see very well your screen. So and you can hear me? Very well, yes. Okay, great. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to start by saying thank you to the organizers because the workshop is great. I've been really enjoying the talks these last two days, and I just wish I could have been there in person. But today I'm going to talk about the role that pulsatility plays in the adaptation of biological. In the adaptation of biological transport networks, especially in terms of loop stabilization. And these transport networks, whether we're thinking about the xylem and phloem in plants or animal vasculature, they really form the fundamental building blocks of complex life. And throughout the lifetime of an organism, these networks evolve in response to changing environmental signals in order to optimize their structure. In order to optimize their structure to the important functions they perform. In particular, loops are found widely in these networks and they are understood to be beneficial structural elements because they can help mitigate vessel damage and also deal with source fluctuations. And another important consideration, which I began with, is to remember that a large class of these networks, namely animal vasculature, is driven by a centralized heart. So you have pulsatility. Centralized heart. So you have pulsatility in the flow. Now, whenever you have pulsatile components in the flow, it necessarily increases the energy, net energy dissipation in the network. And if the vessels are compliant, then pulsatility or the pulsatile components of the flow can be damped at a certain distance from the source. And yet, pulsatility is never really completely done away with. And in fact, there's ample evidence to show that both an increase or a decrease. Both an increase or a decrease in arterial pulsatility in animal vasculature can lead to detrimental pathologies. So, it is not even just that pulsatility is important. It seems that maintaining the right levels of pulsatility in the flow becomes really crucial for biological function. So at this point, we could ask the question, why is pulsatility so important? Even though there is an energy cost, why does evolution select for pulsile driving? And one simple answer to this question. And one simple answer to this question could be that this is the best biology can do. Building complex network architectures that do not need pulsatile driving to maintain flow is just beyond the capacity of what biology can build. But as it always turns out, you can do a little better than this. And it can be shown that a decrease in pulsatility, even though it brings an advantage in terms of lowering energy. In terms of lowering energy dissipation, it also increases the response time to sudden changes in the steady state flow. So, for instance, if you have an abrupt increase in your heartbeat. The other reason why pulsatility may be important, and this is the subject of my work, is because it can be shown to stabilize beneficial architectural elements of the networks like loops. So, moving on to how these networks actually adapt. These networks actually adapt. A very general, widely used adaptation rule looks like this. It's being used to study vascular development in plants and animals, even for the slime molephizarum. And actually, this is identical to the evolution rule for conductivities that Mache was showing for the coastal river system right before this. So, this rule, what it does, it governs the evolution of the radii of each vessel in the network. And the driving signal is, can you see my? signal is can you see my cursor okay so the driving signal is the vessel mean squared current q squared and here gamma characterizes a metabolic or material cost which competes with energy optimization so for instance gamma equals two-third corresponds to flow volume conservation so this is an important constraint for animal vasculature now the way that this adaptation rule is has been typically employed in adaptation Has been typically employed in adaptation models is by considering vessels to be rigid on short time scales, which means that at every point along the length of the vessel, the flow relaxes instantaneously to the average value of the source current. And of course, this is not very realistic because in reality, you have fluid inertia, which opposes the changes to the flow, but you also have compliant vessels, which can expand or contract to accommodate changes in the flow. Accommodate changes in the flow. And this has an important effect on the signal that you observe for remodeling at the time scale of adaptation. But the rigid vessel approximation ignores that and it predicts that for gamma greater than half, values of gamma greater than half, you cannot stabilize looped architectures, which is a problem because gamma greater than half is almost entirely the range of physiologically relevant. The range of physiologically relevant metabolic cost parameters. And in fact, in this talk, I'm just going to restrict myself to investigating these gamma values greater than half. So to deal with this problem, what we proposed was an improved approach, which uses the same adaptation rule, but which determines the driving signal for adaptation, which is the mean squared current, by explicitly considering the short-term pulsatile dynamic. The short-term pulsatile dynamics that arise because of vessel compliance and fluid inertia. And so, the question we are asking is: can this short-term pulsatility actually stabilize loops? So, first, I want to very quickly go over a brief description of how a single compliant vessel is treated in this model, starting from the Navier-Stokes equation for incompressible flow and making the standard simplifying assumptions like rotational symmetry and a parabolic. Symmetry and a parabolic flow velocity profile, you can write down a set of coupled equations for the current and pressure at every point along the length of the vessel. And here, C is the vessel compliance, which is basically how much the cross-section can change when the pressure changes. L is the fluid inertia, and R is the flow resistance. Now, an important thing to keep in mind is that the time scale T prime here of T prime here of local flow relaxation is much, much smaller than the adaptation time scale T, which means that at every time step of adaptation, you've already encountered multiple cycles of periodicity and the flow has relaxed to a stable average value, which can then drive remodeling. Now, from these three network parameters, C, L, and R, you can construct two very useful scales. One is scales. One is the first is a characteristic length scale lambda and the second is a characteristic length scale tau and both of these scales can be written as a constant times the area of cross-section of the vessel. And the constants lambda naught and tau naught turn out to be very important features for qualifying the behavior of this model. Firstly, lambda naught sets a damping length scale for a vessel of typical radius. So for instance, you have vessels that are much Instead, you have vessels that are much longer than lambda naught, then the effect of the pulsatile components are significantly damped, and pulsatility plays a smaller role. Similarly, tau naught is basically the time it takes for the flow to relax in a vessel of typical radius. And so it sets the short time scale of the problem. We can use this down naught to rescale the driving frequency of the source, and when ohm. Source and when omega tau naught goes to zero, it basically shrinks this short time scale to zero, meaning you get instantaneous flow relaxation. So, basically, what I'm saying is the limit of omega tau not going to zero recovers the rigid Bessel approximation that most adaptation models currently use. Now, the good thing about these equations is that they have exact solutions, and as long as you know the current or pressure boundary conditions for each vessel. Pressure boundary conditions for each vessel, you can compute exactly the vessel mean squared current for every vessel in the network. And that's basically all you need to drive adaptation. So now I'm going to show you some of the results of adapting networks with this model. And as we do, we start with this very minimal network, which just has two vessels and a single loop. And it's driven by a sinusoidal source current. If you look at how the If you look at how the vessel mean squared current behaves as a function of the frequency, well, there are two examples here. The first case, you have vessels of equal length, and in the other case, the vessels have different lengths. And the colors here correspond to two sets of radii for the two vessels. And the solid and dashed lines are basically the mean squared current in vessel 1 and vessel 2, respectively. So, just to clarify what we are looking at here, the first thing you notice is that the vessel... First thing you notice is that the vessel mean squared current is amplified at certain resonant frequencies. And when the vessels have equal length, they also have identical resonant frequencies. But then when they have different lengths, the resonances for each vessel can occur at different values of the frequency. Now, this is about the signal at the time scale of adaptation. Now, let's look at what kind of long-term steady-state structures can you actually Term steady-state structures can you actually get by adapting networks with this model? So, first, I'm going to talk about the rigid vessel limit just to compare with what we already know from models of adaptation. So, in this case, the vessel mean squared current basically reduces to this simple form in which the current is just splitting proportionally between the two vessels in the network. And for gamma greater than half, if you look at the flow diagram in the space of the two radii, what you notice is that for Two radii, what you notice is that for most initial conditions, the steady state lies on the boundaries, meaning one or the other vessel shrinks to zero radius and you get shunting. There is an unstable steady state or a saddle point on the diagonal, which corresponds to a symmetric loop, meaning a loop with vessels of equal radius. But the only way to stabilize it is by starting with exactly equal initial radii for both vessels. So for all practical Both vessels. So, for all practical purposes and for most initial conditions, the loop is lost for gamma greater than half in the rigid vessel approximation. But what happens when the vessels can, in fact, respond flexibly at short time scales to the pulsatile drive? I'm going to talk about the situation with gamma equals two-thirds, which, as I said, is important for animal vasculature. And this is a case where we are looking at vessels of equal. Where we are looking at vessels of equal length, but we'll also look at vessels of unequal lengths a little later. In the rigid limit, as I said before, you already expect that you wouldn't get loops for gamma equals two-thirds. But for a finite value of omega tau naught, like this example, you can get a situation where the steady state with the broadest basin of attraction is actually a symmetric loop. Then, again, you could get for a different value of omega tau naught. a different value of omega tau naught, a finite value of omega tau naught, a situation where the dominant steady state is actually an asymmetric loop, so finite but unequal radii. And so this already tells you that when you consider the short-term pulsatility, you can in fact stabilize loops for gamma greater than half. But in order to do this more systematically, we define a quantity Z, which is basically for each initial condition, you can define a quantity Z, which is the minimum of Z, which is the minimum of the ratio of the two radii at steady state. And when you average Z over many initial conditions, this acts as a good candidate for an order parameter to characterize the transition from looped to loopless structures. So let's look at what the phase diagram for structure looks like in the space of the metabolic cost parameter gamma and the Reak scale frequency omega tau naught. As you can see, As you can see, the critical value of gamma, above which you don't get loops anymore, shows these nice orderly periodic modulations as a function of the frequency. And for a particular value of gamma, if you looked at the steady state flow diagram, it oscillates between loopless and looped structures. The other thing to notice about this phase diagram is that at resonant frequencies, which are shown here by these vertical blue dashed lines, because Dashed lines, because the dissipation in both vessels is greatly amplified, you can get loop stabilization for the largest range of gamma values possible. If you increase the length of each vessel, what you end up seeing is that you get shorter and more frequent resonant peaks. And this would make sense because increasing the length of the vessel in comparison to the damping length scale means that you're effectively reducing the effect that pulse deliveries. Reducing the effect that pulsability will have on the long-term signal. And in fact, if you look at the phase diagram for the critical value of gamma in the space of frequency and vessel lengths, you notice that the critical gamma, again, the critical gamma is the value of gamma above which loops become unstable. The critical gamma oscillates with the frequency and the amplitude of these oscillations monotonically decreases as the length of the vessel increases. And but then, of course, the amplitude is always. Of course, the amplitude is always greater than half. So you can always, to some extent, stabilize loops, even for very long vessels, for gamma greater than half. The next scenario to look at is what happens when you have unequal vessel lengths. And here are two examples. The top row corresponds to vessels that are both shorter than the damping length scale. And the bottom row, only one of the vessels is shorter than the damping length scale. And in both cases, once again, you see robust loop stabilization for gamma greater than. Loop stabilization for gamma greater than half. And if you were to compare the results of the compliant vessel approximation with the rigid approximation, you find that when vessels are allowed to respond flexibly to the pulsatility, you always get either equally or more loop structures for every region of the space diagram in comparison to the rigid Bessel limit. Okay, so this is. Okay, so this is more or less a broad description of the results that you can get out of a very minimal network like the one I was showing. But then you could also consider what happens when you have hierarchical networks. And I'm going to look at two relatively simple example. The first one has five vessels and a primary and a secondary loop. And then, you know, you also have one with eight vessels with the primary, secondary, and a tertiary loop. And just for the sake of definition, when I say higher level loops, When I say higher level loops, I mean ones that are proximal to the source or more directly connected to the source. Now, here are all the possible steady states in these two networks, and I've color-coded them so that going from red to blue, you're going from the least loopy to the most loopy structures, right? Now, we can look at what fraction of each steady state you get as a function of the frequency for a particular value of gamma. And of course, again, I want. Gamma, and of course, again, I want to focus on gamma two-thirds because it's an important constraint. What you find is that at resonant frequencies, you mostly get the full loop structure, but then you also get some steady states where the primary or the higher level loops are prioritized for stabilization. The opposite is true at anti-resonant frequencies. In this case, you mostly get shunting, but then you also get. Shunting, but then you also get some situations in which the lower level loops are stabilized. So you could get a combination of the secondary, of just the secondary or the tertiary loop, or just the secondary or the tertiary loop by themselves. So what this tells us is depending on the driving frequency of the source, you could get very different structures, even in hierarchical networks. Resonant frequencies will prioritize either the full loop structure or higher level loops for stabilization, whereas anti-resonant frequencies. Whereas anti-resonant frequencies will prioritize lower-level loops for stabilization. Okay, so the last thing I want to talk about is actually how this model can be extended to make it more realistic for actual vasculature. And the first consideration is the flow dynamics model that we've used. So, everything I've shown before this, we've had an assumption where the velocity profile was considered to be parabolic, but for compliant vessels, For compliant vessels in the presence of pulsatile driving, the velocity actually has a Wormsley profile, you know, characterized by this Wormsley number, which is a ratio of the inertial and viscous forces in the system. And as the driving frequency increases, the Wormsley number is bigger and the deviation from the parabolic form becomes more and more important. The second consideration for modification is what is the correct adaptation rule for pulsatile flows? Rule for pulsatile flows. And unfortunately, as of now, there doesn't seem to be a consensus in the adaptation community of what this should be. But the thing that is generally accepted is that vessels remodel themselves by responding to the wall shear stress that they experience. It cannot be just the average shear stress, but it has to depend on the shear stress that is registered at the walls. That has to be part of the signal. And so, what we propose is. So, what we propose is an adaptation rule that is more realistic for biological flows is actually one that considers the average of sigma q. Sigma is the Ball shear stress, by the way. So an adaptation equation where the driving signal is the average of sigma q instead of q squared, because well, you could show that this is really the dissipation term that comes out of a pulsatile, sorry, flows that are driven. Flows that are driven by a pulsatile source. But then for steady flows, sigma has this very simple relationship with the current. It's just Q by R squared. So for steady flows, you can recover the general adaptation rule that we've been using so far. So this is more an extension of the steady flow adaptation rule for pulsatile flows. And we have tried both these modifications in an improved model for adaptation. And I want to. And I want to sort of clarify that the results with our old model seem to be robust to the exact form of adaptation equation. So just this, just the second consideration by itself does not really change results very much. But the flow model definitely ends up being important. So if we go back to our favorite minimal model with just two vessels and a loop and look at the structure phase diagrams that you find for various different vessel lengths, you once again find You once again find robust loop stabilization for gamma greater than half. Of course, you no longer have those very nice orderly modulations, periodic modulations of the critical gamma with the frequency. But in terms of the area over which loops are stabilized, this is actually more robust. And importantly, for omega 2 pi and gamma equals 2 third, which is a point in this phase diagram that's relevant to human vasculature, you get a prediction that loops would be stabilized. A prediction that loops would be stabilized. Now, of course, this doesn't say everything because this network is really the spherical cow of biological transport networks, but it's definitely an important test for an adaptation model to pass for a prediction of loops for these very particular sets of gamma and omega. So, to conclude, what I hope I have convinced you is that short-term pulsatile dynamics is actually very important for the long-term structure that you get. For the long-term structure that you get as a result of the process of adaptation, there are resonant frequencies that can stabilize looped architectures, and depending on the driving frequency of the source, even in hierarchical networks, you can stabilize various different kinds of networks from more tree-like with more primary or not tree-like, with more primary loops or with more secondary loops away from the source. With that, I thank you for listening, and I'll take any questions. And I'll take any questions. We have five minutes. You're right on time for questions. If you have questions for Urban, please speak loud. Go out and microphones both ahead. Yes, please. Hello, Urban. Very nice talk. When you talk about the When you talk about the equations for the slope, like the one of the compliance, I would like to know what means the term in what is your R. Like the first equation comes from like Navier-Stokes conservation of momentum, the second from I guess mass conservation on a hook type of law. Can you tell me which is this L and which is this R? Like, okay, there, there, but. Okay, there are turn. But did you derive this second equation? How do you derive it? So the way to derive these equations is to basically start from the Navier-Sooks, like I said, but for incompressible flow. And then when you impose the conditions of rotational symmetry and also impose a particular form for the velocity profile, you know, the axial velocity, which is parabolic, it allows you to rearrange the terms of. Allows you to rearrange the terms of, and you're right, it really is the momentum and mass conservation terms. So the first one just corresponds to the incompressibility condition, and the second one is actually the Navier-Stokes. And so you can read. The first one is Navier-Stokes' perturbation of momentum. Oh, did I say the first one? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I meant the first one, so that I was aware of. So the first one is mask. So, the first one is mass conservation tools and kind of hook law or something like this, right? I'm sorry, could you repeat the last part? I couldn't hear properly. Yeah, the first one is mass conservation class kind of book claw for the walls. Continuity, yeah. I feel like I'm the next question is coming. The next question is coming. I have a question about the amplitude. You stressed a lot, the role of the frequency and of resonance, but I think more in an individual, you have bigger vessels and smaller vessels, smaller, smaller vessels, damped capillaries. And as far as I can fancy, there are likely more loops at the small scale than at the big scale. The tubes are really nicely. Really nicely branching trees, the bigger transport vessels, and it's generally at the very small scale that you see loops. And at that scale, the amplitude of the hard beat is much less significant. So my question is regarding your talk, if you felt like looking for loops into a real system, at what scale should we look for the loops? Look for the LIMPS? Well, you know, first of all, the point of, I mean, I sort of treat what we have done as more a mathematical problem of trying to understand whether the short-term pulsatility actually has an impact on long-term structure. And for instance, we have these symmetric sources. So there is really no sink. So you have basically equal and opposite current. So this is not a very real. A very realistic model of vasculature itself, but it's supposed to be a demonstration of the fact that incorporating or not incorporating the short-term dynamics actually has an impact on what kind of structures you predict coming out of the process of adaptation. And I do agree that the loopiness of especially vascular networks is more in the microvasculature where pulsatility. Vasculature, where pulsatility obviously is very much reduced, but you also have vessels which are of very small length. And so, I guess this damping length scale allows us to assess the scale of, or I guess the scale at which, or the scale in proportion to which pulsatility would even be important for a more reticulated structure. Articulated structure. But yeah, this is more a proof of principle to show that these, that the dynamics is actually important. You cannot just look at the macro level signals that you would expect. So at the smaller scale, there's probably different mechanisms for stabilization that you would expect in larger scales to not be there, and yet one larger scales. While larger scales still have lobes, and this is a potential mechanism where it's closer to the heart. Right, and I also wanted to add that, like I said, the question of what is a good adaptation rule for the entire spectrum of architectural phenotypes that you get in vasculature is still an open question. I would presume that, for you know, if you also wanted a model that explained microvasculature, you would have more terms. Microvasculature, you would have more terms in the adaptation equation, which is also, I think, what Eleni is saying. Different mechanisms to stabilize. Also, I want to add that, and we can say this in the discussion, this model is in disguise very, very related to the geomorphology talks that we have heard because it's a linearization of tides, the dynamics. So, it might be relevant to tracking tides. It might be relevant to tracking tides and how tides stabilize loops, but we haven't gone in that direction. But in this particular case, although the source is in phase, always, let's say the tide that we saw in the previous talk, it moves as a wave through the system. And it is the resonance of that wave of how the Resonance of that wave of how the channel is, there is a particular frequency of tide if it is in resonance with the geometry, the capacitance, especially the geometry of the channel and the fluid inertia, the fluid inertia. If the conditions are right, allegedly this is true, it can play a role in stabilization of loops. And I don't know about the islands which we saw on Monday, because those I think are Too short for this to play, anyhow, but I guess no, before we get an answer from Nicolo about the items, maybe we could transition to the discussion and first thank Ulva at least because doing the hard work without the key. The hard work without a key, the free food. So, now the discussion is open to all the four speakers for this action. The courts will start. The tessellation and the organoid, the loops that came out there were so. The loops that came out there were so apparent, but then I wanted to know what set where the centers were.
