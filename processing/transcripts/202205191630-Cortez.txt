Maria Isabel Cortez, a queridad migamía y de tos nosotros acar in this group of women, Latino American Matemáns interest in general. Well, María Velopú doctoro en la Universidad de Burgón indigón, their doctorado de Matemáticas in 25 and I sabía y su doctora in escale. I don't know, it is a doctor in science of engineering with Matemán Media in the University of Chile. The central Matemán de Chile of Nero Junior of 2022 and Isabel work dynamic groups and very active and work in general mathematics. But the But the Chile of Matemáticas and General Mathematics, and good aquí este has many academic, but work in the Mathémámétic department, the Pontificia University Catholic University of Chile, and well, because a gusto presente, Isabel, and this aquí, the gusto mayor sería que estudiaras aquí de manera presencial, pero bueno. Decua quier manera es un gusto verte y este. Un gusto verte y este bueno nomas introducion. Gracias, Isabel. Welleno veryas gracias por invitación. Meguira gustado estar ayá, pero si este dis decidu bijar uya sio problematico, because with COVID. I don't have a perovira voyage. If you have the opportunity to cuartuna, because I think the veto. Me paso leveto. Voya con partiro pantaya. No se como se ve eso, lo émbien. Talveja yí, como lo veen. Perfecta mente. Bueno a lo mejora aílo puestemas grande. Ahí no se ahí lo tengo al maximo y computador. No se como lo lo veenos Tedes. Ah, no, no, a lo mejo aca lo buanaponer. Alo mesjo a calo vana poner. Yeah, yeah, listo. Subuero. Well, um, very segura about, y, because some various interests are investigating, not that much, but a mesh of various things. Because Gabby Racien with some company in Chile, Andrea DeCo que estálla presente. We are involuntary in investigation, we have generated, particularly with social, but also we are involved, we have also involved in public policy. But I think we can context of what we are having, and I will start with Voyage that for you did not know that basically a problem of the case, how super conscious. And so that preferring photos, for example, have a photo of a conference of the two military conferences, marketing women who have a conference in the most ah, 20 marte, the The scenario is repeated, also in the women's conference, can be not the pandemic, and not in more recent photos. But we are not the patron that repeats, and that when one is part of this community, well, in pregnant, they are like the first question that are very in Fin. Now, I don't know between the datasets here, we have datasets of Chile, but mimachino son. My machine that is not distinct in our part of the year with the creo, a virtual virtual in France, and the numerous and exactly how Chile and basically what numeros in Chile can respect the proportion of mate working academia, more elsewhere of academic conductor in the department of mate. In the Matemáticas are much in all the areas salvo en las relación con edución, for example mate, the majority are homes. In Chile, the project of external aqueous time to obtain a project. To obtain a project, if you want to organize conferences, you have students, etc. And if you are terminating these projects, that are more basic or what is oriented to basic science there, the proportion of women is more vaccinated from the proportion of women in the academy. Mujeres that have women between the people who are projecting mathematical. And in general, what I can observe, and this is also in Chile that the general break when general and many generidades, and I can observe that they have some mathematical components, Mathematica, mathematical, physical, engineering, between physics, and different physics, there is no theory that the application, for example, in this discipline with mathematical components of general especially. That are how there is what they are doing. This are data from Chile, but what do we do? They are perfectly extraordinary. Because important diversity and the mention of one day, if I pass more rapidly, the mention and one can pop the economic racation because the mathematical components are also the mejoras, but also very problematic that we have because this generate a diversity. The study, for example, is. The study, for example, there is cognition, the typical feminine issue, and not only producing a segment of the study, but also in the interpretation or in the experiment, in the algorithm, etc. The example classic that is also mentioned, and also the paso are the segments of the algorithm, for example, the Tinder is the typical tender. The tender is the typical, which is there else that there is the choice that also mentioned Andrea. So if we are clarity, that is a problem, that is that there is something that has there, initiative whatever this phenomenon is, and I think we are a absolute clarity here, the things that function. Absolutely, here the things like mathematical function that every logic and everything, but one could have a need that is happening, which is what explains and what we clarify also is that the problem simplement of the indicators. We simply measure the indicators or if we. Indicadores or decimosar more like all severe numeros the men majority. So that pensar is that this breach is to data that are not made. So, the question that you can decir more of the access, more of the ah, women. You have to see that and that one. And for that, And for that, well, here is a situation, this Elin Fox Keller, who plants the general terminal of some manner we have questioned the practical question of the scientific practice. We have entrusted this term. And a France of Foxquiller that we have many. And if we can. We can propuest our possibilities, for example. So, important, for example, Lunes, Carla Fardela, having the cuids. And of the experience of women experienced academia, through and that is that one of the pilots, which is the cuid or cuid, or if you have women, but not the unique problem. But this unique problem, the time of cuids, is the unique problem that is observed. So, in this aspect, more general management, we could have learned from the experience. So, how is the experience of women in the academic carrier, as the experience of the minority academic, and a perspective? There is a study interest that some. And what is this? Is that the experience of women in general? No, they are possible. No, this is positive as the varieties in the experience of the women who are in certain communities. And academia, how doctor, post-doctorate, etc. And many of these negatives in relation to the climate lateral relationships. For example, in particular, there is a question that has relaxation with how this relationship is also good, or that we are good. This relationship, or what are good relations with director or director of TECI, and the variants have tendenciated tendency to contest that very well, not yet the women. It is typical of the experience of women positive as possible, and also the sexual and violence of gender. So, there are relative experiences that one of the verse: how. In mathematics, I think what we have is in the nihilo, that we also have the experience of women in particular, in matemática experience also different. So, the experience of women is not the same that of the homes of the mathematical community. It is for the two variables that we are and women. So, for example, For example, perspective of the Niño, that is why I don't know why much is there. It is a illustration where, so here we go, that is the end, and the project of this concusable nosotra with three mathematical and three sociology postulated investigations. On the project of investigation social to study the campus of mathematics a general perspective. Today we are working or to work focus groups, mixed groups, homes and women and principles to women to understand that they pass between this community. So, for example, So, for example, the terminal of the experience of women experiences various things that document to this sensation of extra sensations of extra, but in various ways, not only extra because there are many homes and I am extraordinary, also there experiences that in relation. Experiences that have relations to a form of sexism that difficultizing. It is in general when the focus groups or interviews radioid, and I do much problem, but what is experiences that are difficult to classify. It is experiences that do that in there, and that is one when there are linear. There is this linear of vivalent, and there is going to be a part of Jemplo, and also the experience that one is neutral in mathematical, like pizza. It is the mathematical piece, that the pizza comes to work, and discuss with colleges, and if the pizza are neutral, we are. So, for example, respect the radio extra purpose the extra of all the mathematical communities of sense of what parallels are not mathematical, what mathematics and mathematical mathematics, but. But women are this sensation to the unica, so in France, as I was the unica or this world of homes, but also the sense extra respect the norm that this community. For example, it is allusion to the idea, to the Olympiadas, Mathematica. And the women, the entrepreneurs. Mujeres, the entrepreneurs perceive more like this validity of geniality verse 2. So women are the works, and the homes of genius. So also there are extra logic, emaculino. And respect of the sexism, ambivalent. Ambivalent experience that are difficult to verbalize that the majority, as negative, but also as experiences of product fantilization of my protection of the license. Of licensed licenses, things of esteem. But also in cosa, a little more clarity like the sexual attention, but also a little pad, and a vision is the feminine feminine no question that the people are. Las yas are responsibility of the madre y que polanto las women in mathematica or general academy more properly and for the pizza that this works that we have in neutral relationship with the pizza tampación with the pizza tampoco is the same. So, this is also a frac. France that has, but example of the women la pizzara, or in the collection, the millions no one lazars, and I miscompañeros que está discutiendo la pizar, but I don't know my circo in Finland, or hombre delivering the women as very timid, respect that the pizza. So the experience is there much different. There are many different things. There when one can conversar, and that is qualitative study because one will track the CIFRA. What if we go a study qualitative study? They are one of understanding that what CIFR are the bodies planted. We are del Cifra, the study quantitative study, allowing visualization that a problem and the study quality of the world. And what we are doing is. Audia, who is located and cosa que en que trabajamos con un grupo de compañiras en Chile, Andrea, Vera y, Mariel Say, Y Andrea Carnales, que del Instituto de Sociología de la Universidad de Trabajo. Y estuimo rebisando. Rebisando bibliography respects the order, chatting with what these data in this studio and master and podium discuss the proposed classification that promote. Propuesta que promo evan el ingreso a career STEM universitarias de womeres principally a career of matemático gerar medías de apoyo para la trajectorías académémicas womeres orientad to progression to retention idir con interruptions de care, for interruption expenses, not only because of the term with natal or because. Or with natal, or because also in interruption, for example, for problems of liberal because in the moment of investigation in Finn. And also that has relationships with the climate change. It will be with problems, violence, sexual, but also educating that. Educara que form part of the community just so that also the media understanding implementing. And we are not implementing implementing really queues that we are having. So, for example, when we affirmative action that is in the ingredients of the mathematical component, Mathematico a catal vezba dependent much of the rally department, as the university in Chile, the university work of tandarizada, which is national, you independent of the point that is tandem here that university is opted, and there is a system of ranking system, etc. Etc. Producing many segments, and not that we also have classes, but also that completes, we are resolving that problem. So, there is someone here that rejuvenates a book of many implementing this affirmative action. Implementative action, for example, as we are in the university work implementing this, like ingredients special together, in mathematics, and physical rejuvenate also the progression and retention in the sense that here know that we have received the conditions so that they continue. We are not with receiving and that it is, for example. So, So if we put affirmative actions, also the progression and the retention. Also, this is effective. Tambien has discussed the lugaries of work in our university, which are a little more initially. This type of initiative, for example, the University of Chile, the engineering faculty, is a program that contradicts students of doctoral students. So, with the promise that when there is terminal doctoral, there also de Mexico because a Chile, I suggest, but a investigator of the NATO. But a investigator of the Unam record an initiative that created implemented implement to contract women, but the final initiative function because what is contracted to the women's immediately doctoradas and a part of a year of work academic work, but an evaluation or postulate complement. And the result that when this is. When the postulate can have the definitive post, with my studio, it is working the university, and I was a postdoc. So, clearly, we are in condition and the final terminal perjudicial. So, here mention this in this initiative of contributions to mentality that tomorrow is factors in 2020. That factors in 2020, because the effective strategy of support progression would encourage academic system, for example, to try to trace the reloss of tenure track in case of embarrassing or interruption of general, for example, visibilization of three dimensions of sexual culture, the famous iceberg, which they have created in our In other slides, and this because the mention because it was very visible or just the most important thing when we were cosyxambo, and not necessarily that they are socially septed, much vece and queen of what we are sexual. Capacitación esgero para toda la communidad notes not only for mujieres, not only for people who work in a department and here, if not that also for the authorities. Tamiene is important that the authority is incapacitated and well, that we also mentioned the challenge, the importance of establishing this demographic, this passion segues, financially, also to red. Financiamento also, as we have a conference part of this, the Committee for Women of Mathematics, for example. There is the iceberg of the general violence because icebergs because the iceberg is what CB sexual, violation. And when we don't see when a voice is a piece of things that do not clear, but microchimo, exit, invisibilization, etc. So, it is what violence is general. And there, for example, the migrant matching includes what focuses on the mathematical in Chile. Of women in Mathematica in Chile, two estasi, like not clad, if not, for example, like the France that is negative, like the total like minister of licensing, when they were women adult, or that the miscerries. Osay que que que refer sancerto histiotibo, o que o que infantilizan a womer. So, y como comentario final está algo que también. Final estate, which is also not important to the men in Chile, not the particularity of discipline. For example, when we have and we have to go. We have parity, so that we have these types of people, we can discipline where numerical parameters. But we have disciplined as mathematical disciplines, where the 20% with 13%, we are going to recognize if they are recognized, for example, with the book, more recognizable with this administrative law. So, here we are particularly the policies of implementing all the department, university, investigation, etc. And the other collación que much taxa functions segregate from the garrot, or in the fund so that they implement, there is subject. There is subject of condition. And there is a plot that I think Andrea mentioned the moment, the event that rebuilt the sexual discrimination of general violence in the superior education in Chile. And there has been this institution to do is that condition university is. Condicion, the university is that implementing politicians of integral with sexual violence and discrimination of general discrimination because the institutional accreditation. The institutional accreditation will need to receive financing receivers. The implementation is political, this is received financially. So, now I'm seeing there, as a poco. University logo chato de circosa implementaro, because in the point of debil, but implementation that initiative and that the discussion will be the luck because. I created Pedir que silo with me because I worked, but there are a slide there, and it is photography as the initiatives. Photography, like the initiatives and city initiatives. And what we want is a debate, pregnant, and platinum from all the people. So, no, I think. Because Because I don't know that they are violence. If you don't see how to platform, I am expert in Violence of General, but I'm going to try to demonstrate the case to do. And what is the idea of trash? Ay, Love. Yes, puedes the idea when this riba is visible, what is put in dudes that is general, here we are not the category of feminism, for example. And I think that we will When we talk when we are superficial, we can recognize how violence because they generate their activities hostile activities, valorizar, depression, ignorance, emotional, public, sexist, sexist published infinite. But when we pay the term of the micro match, we have alternate things that are not clarified if they are not. And the mejora and the micro matchimo appear in this case that the mention that appears in the challenge of the interview with mathematical things that are in the same way. That when the dominance in Chile could interpret what is like, if you want to concern, and if I do it with malintention, but that But this is a idea for example that the women have here infantilizar, for example, or for example, this other thing of but more. It is a priori that I think is on the map, but it is a map. Plus, what this is perando there is a sexual, so that. So it's what it is of the comportamento of one woman, for example. So that's what they are clarifying, and I don't know if I am doing that in no situation, of not clarity, if this is, but I'm not saying when I start extra, if one could say, there is already a little bit of a little bit of a little bit and the mejorial. And the lo mejor una no sedad media, but reflection, conversing with other people seed that in this category, for example. No sesi soya del una manira responder y de escho ay una pericula muy buena que habla del liceber. No, it's the para de 'cause we don't have all these things like. I think you're a scientist. I think you're a scientist. And this tradition comes in. And it is super rutile for the study of many cosas. Algien, more commentario. Muchas draces porto platica. That's the first thing I want to say. That first quiet. And so if we have very points when they are the sexes of the pizza, there are many attention that is the gustas corregir, but no passing the pizza. Mellamo attention queen enuncia and that entity is the gustas corregir. Mucha addresses. Ah, yes, a fracy, I guess I can do not tragic, and the tragedy as textual text because. Textual text because I sustained it because of the same community, and it was not there yet, but it was the name, a nombre focus group and a academic group, and referring to that of the gusta corregir nosalena la pizara, se refería aque la universidad qui en es a que sería en que. Teaching assistants and other parts. So, realizing classes of Jersey, one vecement, and other groups of students that are in this corridor examine. So, what this academic is that is that the students, the women, don't want to do teaching assistants, but not the class of justice, and preferring correct. Correct, that is an activity through vambling, or exposition. So, the same thing if it is mineral queue observables that are all in this character and permasculina, this personality that is in a general class, where very, and the proportion is like very important. Tamil dad women. De que las womucheres condo salíana de lante la pizar estaba muy expuestas because companios las mirada en fin. There is so if you say we are here the people who are in the zoom Adi volibarte levanta que tal buenas y una pregunta. Bueno comentabas de que pues y Because we cargo the man in this. But In this, but other things like exposions in the condresses, obviously, like there are more solicitudes of various things, but more variants is perover as pivot with many events that are here, because you know the comments of some companies that are. Company, we don't have to do it because they combined, so that men and our pupils can be your opinion because I think it's a good manera that others can also visualize what we do because we are not. We are a proportion, because we form to inspire women to certain mathematics, and opinions all respect. If that point, when I say that of the paradigm, we are thinking about it. That because in general, the target in general is evaluated by. Evaluate positively porous detection. And also, that is passive to make investigation, for example. It is also the Congress, I think, as to argumentar or explicit because it is important in a Congress of visibilization to women. Just what? This is what the capacitations of general capacity, the civilization, so that they understand, so that the community is coming to the community, not only women, so the community because we are doing that, so that's what the women have community conditions that are. So this experience, the experience of the same, but more than a moment of track, that will be this queer track of the. And the manera of educating people to understand because I don't know because I'm only commentaries from how we do discuss much. And we trade that in relation to the end, because we are visible a group that understands this in fantasy. So, I need to create, and also have a dice, or pass, but I'm inviting a conference implementation because it needs to be because a conference that is. Nada que ver comitema, yesodam. Thatima grada, for example. So, if the uno tiene que vero como como jugar va sigamento, pero sisto ya cuerdo contivo compledamente. Gracias muchas gracias. E tamien por aque una questiona de karen karen Cerna. Y, buenas tabes. And this type of definitions like microbiome. Abime reflection mucho una descriptor Mexican que sella Claudia de la Garza, the quality that can do not micro because a problem normal. So the terminology utilized as a microscope as a chick when it realized no, it is a situation that to reflection. To reflect that personal manner, you generate a society. So, these aggressions that exist influence more in the decisions that we have the idea and in our projects for people. So, that is a reflection to localizing utilization of terminologies like a micro and ignorance like a. Yes, completely aware. If I want to micro, like evolution that is invisible, or what is difficult to verbalize, for example. And Not a chasm for space, a lot of graces for the plateau is a gusto saludar lasso. I don't know if you also have the reflection of these instruments, like the protocols, with general values, and just mentions that we can obligate for example. Instrumentos, obligatory instruments, for example, and a university or possibly the private as cajo to theirs, for example. But also in our Commission, you plateau that. But no there is company that explains the people of where I think many documents is what the institution wants to resolve the problem. problems of evil because you can generate their documents that are a theory and also a practical experience that is actualizing but the aquatic feeling that the end like austile and also platform that for example the processes are working for example in the indicators where there I have the parts of investigation of sanctions that go in the protocol because you can create a barrel, so that repentance is problema like indicators, I don't know if you have no inclusion, also trust, no? So I think all these documents are a document. All these documents are a very important advance, a signal of a feminist movement, and a banana can be positive, but also with many limitations and not accompanying us because there are concrete universities, if there are internal organizations. Internal. Gracias. Yes, good point. I don't mention, but it's in Chile salient for the oppression of the feminist movement. It's for the feminist movement in the university of 2018 and basically there are associations of investigators, it is a yama. Investigators, yuna que sí yama la sociación de investigador, que foro la que estuero na yí empujando. Osa, hai medal impersión buena, cancile tamene vendo de universidad de universidá moslandi, but the impression that is alert, they can be in pujando, and if it is not funcion. So we don't want this there in Sima Miran. There in Simirando that is well, that is that if we don't have no passage, no passage. Important to the colleges, so that you have the capacitation. But if I go for the moment, Alguna otra pregunta aquí alguna documentario pregunta aber aquí tenemos ajabi hola marí Isabel quital quital gracias por la charla perspecto de la división sexual division el trabajo mateémático porí. There as respect of this compromise by general cotton, and the targets because the legimo between them is there as a paradox of difficulty, and the legiment is otherwise, but. The investigations that we have more, but we cannot sufficient or not the different competitions, how work needs to be here that we have women investigation and telling this passion, but that also is very difficult. What if it is? What if it's a little more porous for all this? But what type of actions can we have the respect? For me, this obligation directly. Yo, my, I don't know if, but not function because the same university. Because the university, the student, have the work to interior of the university, superdivident, women, documents, and principles of investigation. So, this is working as a species of manual evaluation of evaluation, but of manera que laugh. Manera que laugh or a distribution quit of the story because the university has contradict to serve everything, existing investigations only. It contradicts the investigation of science and some special puzzles that are solo for 2020, but this como laudinari launch the The people that investigation there, the reality that passes that women have been carried out, and the homes more charged with the investigation. So, that's like a specific evaluation of events, but I don't know if it's not functioning now in terms of the projects, also, for example, this. For example, this is interesting in Chile that has to see with this investigation. In Chile, it is two things to a general department of the Minister of Institute and also a studio respect how decided this of the investigation, the fund of situation. So that study that also has very clear like that. What have you very clear as well? That studio is working from situation, of productivity, of a experience, the women can evaluate that homes at the moment of obtaining the fantasy. So there the moment of evaluation can obtain this project that is crucial to sigura investigation in Chile. Investigoción in Chile avión sego. So I don't have clear because it also independent of groups, and the group that evaluates discipline, so don't have clear queuing products elsewhere, but the evaluation, but not the evaluation, but there also means the garden of meters. It's illegal that this passing there. So I believe that it was there. Because if effectively if the university will chat and populate this fund of investigation, that will be a legitimate investigator, results that much of the evaluation, but there is also no problem. So that we have, but also clarity asolver, but if it is. Comoros alvere so, but we have to do it. Gracias, Isabel, that is other two commentaries bueno un infography que les comparto Andrea in English de la y lua di vo libar dice. I visto que manyos colegas varones queen que todo estabien y le restaan importance else de quida de gender enconcientemente está teniendo actitudes encontra de las womeres. Seiente como remar encontra de la coriente todo los días. The correcte all the días. Hace mucha faltes as civilization all the community, but the problem is that they do not interest. Yes, like the problem if I pass the semana passage of the two semayo que organizamos jalgo, the university achieved with the results of the nino invite proposito a unique hombre de la nihno aqueous there the departamento de Mathematica. There, the department of Mathematica, and the obligation that was like the most a new idea, no sex, but this rule.
