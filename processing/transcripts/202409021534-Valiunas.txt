So I'll talk about header groups of the levels that everything is joined with Daniel Asylum. Okay, so I guess I'll produce header groups because no one has done that yet. So hello groups are groups I can generate doing header graphs, so I will produce hellograph. And so I draw And so I dropped Gamba is Heli if whenever you have I have a collection of balls in my graph and I take which have pairways intersect, then they have among empty copper intersects. The balls in the graph satisfy the hello property. So if for any collection of balls uh let's say B R i of X i in gamma. In gamma, I is I, so Ri is the radius, Xi is the point. A graph is yellow, but now we have a collection of holes. If B R i of X i inverse the Rj of j of x juman LP then the whole intersection so yes I is my mix exception V R I X I L my And I forgot about the recording. Oh I didn't. Okay. It's important. It's important. Okay. So, right, so HARAF is HALY if it satisfies the property. And I'll also use coarse HALY property. So this is a coarse version. So drop is delta coarse helli. If, well, this might be empty. Well, this might might be empty, but if I increase all the balls if I add delta to all the radius radius of the balls, then then they intersect. Okay, and yes. Yes, so okay, a graph for me is a combinatorial graph, so I just think about vertices as the underlying set of the graph and of the matrix phase. Graph and what the metric space. So it's so yeah, so everything is discrete here. Okay. And the group G is helly or coarse helly if If the group axiomatically on a helio-chorse helicopter, the heli groups were introduced by Damien. Introduced by Damien and Victor and three people who I think are not here. So yeah, okay, I should mention everyone. So maybe, okay, let's first do some easy examples. So we have, let's say, trees. So, Sagamma is a tree, so free rules, for instance. So, this is already something alluded to in Pyotr's talk, saying that if you have a collection of sub-trees, then it pairs intersect as a whole collection. So, this is specific case for the balls. So, free groups, for instance, you could take gamma to be Gamma to be the the square grid on so the slides are square and P is that squared as a group for instance so this generalize to to to to well no okay I think I should be more careful. It's can you be more careful? Probably. It's a squared with an infinite metric. So you don't take a one, you take your diagonals to things. And this generalizes to gammas which are. I want to say thickening, but it's not the same as thickening in NEMA stock. But I'll say thickening anyway. Anyway, so thickening of a K02 complexes. And here by thickening, I mean I replace each cube by a simplex. So I just add all the diagonals, all the possible diagonals, the cubes. Some compact accubulator groups are here. So this is, okay, I guess here is what I can mention that people. I can mention the people. So Jeremy Shalopan, Dan Victor, Shopoy, Antony Senawa Rosharai, and Daniel Seiner. So these are the people who introduce. So, these are the people who introduced the Hen Groups and started talking about them. Okay, another thing that I can do, I can take gamma, well, I can take G to be hyperbolic. So, this is a generalization of the free groups case. Okay, so this is uh vector was still and yeah, okay. Uh uh right um so it was uh this result uh and okay, if we want to generalize this further, there are several directions. There are several directions. We could go to okay, I should probably put it like this. Okay. We know if it trees are equal to the hyperbolic. So for those who have been here in Maine know what this is, which is million dollars, I think. I think then we know that T acts properly compacted on an injected on a force injector. Uh space, but we don't we know that these groups don't need to be heli. We don't know about coarse heli. So coarse an injective space is like a heligraph, but a metric space, a metallograph. Basically, the same definition as a coarse heligraph. Okay, this is a class of Halley groups. So Halle being Halle is closed under several things. So things like amalgams or HNM extensions. Extensions over finite subgroups close also in the graph products and so on. Oh, and I should say probably it's not closed under finite text. Undefined extensions. So for instance, I'm using examples cox that would call 333 triangle. This is not cost anything. And this is from my email. Okay. So, okay, basically we want to know which crooks are those, and we want to relate this to relatively hyperbolic crooks. And given the time of problem, let's Given the time of problem, let's assume that people know what relative level groups are or not. Who knows of a relative level rubberism? Okay. Whose favorite definition is Farb's definition of relative electricalism? No one's okay. Well, I'm sorry then. Okay, I'll be mostly using far off definition, so with cool located graph and bonus penetration property. But okay, maybe I'll just say that here and there's space for that. Um okay. So uh let G be hyperbolic relative to some subgroups, H1 up to HL then G is helling if I'm only if I'm Each of these outputs are heavy. Oh, I can add cores to there if I want. Oh, yeah, maybe I should ask a question which I don't know. I don't know the answer to, but maybe the audience will answer me. Is every or selling repelling? Just to make my talk easier to read so I don't need to say ports for everything. Okay. Um any questions up to here? Any answers? So JG it's not Halley, it's the one that's not bi automatic. Okay, I should say Halley groups are bi automatic. So the one with that last time is instructed. And these were this is one group that we know. It is ggbood. But we know it's it's digital not automatic. So yeah, it's you can act on like a three cross of hyperbolic space and and still not weak away. Sorry, the three cross is two so three cross uh So three profile of the length. Okay. So the rest, I guess, the second half of the talk, I'll go a bit into the proof of the theorem. And it basically goes via course version of Kelly's stuff. Can be tough. So, I thought I need another definition. To have what it means for a graph to have stable intervals. So, graph has stable intervals. If basically, if you take two neighbors in a graph and take a third point, and then you take an interval between this point and this point, and an interval between this point and this point, so the union of all the geodesics here and here, then the house of distance will be one. So maybe I'll just draw a picture. So if I have two neighbors, X and Y, X and Y, and I have another vertex Z. I draw a geodesic here and I pick some point here. Then there will be a trades going from X to Z and the point on H the difference between these two things, one of them. Right, and the nice thing about this is the following proposition: is that if you have group, if you have, okay, if T acts on gamma geometrically and gamma has stable intervals Intervals underscore value then G is having so basically we can upgrade actions on roughly stable intervals which of course heavy. Which accords heavily to an action on a haragraph. And this goes to some things which I might mention later. So it goes to constrain by Hallehov of the graph, which is kind of a universal graph satisfying some universal property. In my guess, category of graphs and isometric embeddings. Okay. So, so I'll start maybe showing why hyperbolic groups are handy. And the idea is that any hyperbolic graph is as stable intervals and score 7. So, proof of this. If gamma is hyperbolic, Well, then it's clear why it has stable intervals. Basically, this is the easy triangle between these three things. So you know point here, the distance to this edge is to move delta, maybe delta plus one, if we don't like it. So g is delta hyperbolic, then g has delta. Has delta plus one stable intervals. Delta plus one stable intervals k stable intervals means there's a square k and right and now if we pick And now, if we pick a point, so pick any point, say X in my graph. And let, so I have given a collection of balls. I want to show that if I increase the balls by some delta, which will be two delta in this case, then these balls, if they always intersected in the biggest. If they always intersect at the beginning, then if I increase the radius, they intersect. So then, so if I have my collection of poles, let my index, which was there, be such that the distance between x and xi, well this x, anyway, minus our i. Minus Ri is maximal. So we can show that these distances are bounded. So by various intersection, you can pick one which is maximal. And then you look at the triangle x axis shape that is a triangle. So it's okay. Let's I decide that this is. Let I do such that this is its maximum, and then I draw the balls around xi of radius ri to the holes. So I draw these balls which I will not be always intersect and I let y to be this point. And then we can show basically that We can show basically that, well, we know that y is within distance delta either from this edge or from this edge. If it's distance within delta from this edge, then it's in this ball up to 2 delta. If it's distance, so this hole straight away. If it's close to this edge, then use the maximality of the distance to show again it must be to a point close to this ball. So basically, this from this picture, we can deduce that gamma is coarsely. Okay. So this basically shows why ever ball groups are challenging. At least the rough idea. Charlie, at least a rough idea. Okay, so now I want to construct a helicopter. If I have an relatively handful of group, I want to construct a heligraph on which this group counts. And instead of that, I'll construct a port heligraph with stable intervals. Stable intervals. And the idea, so that was for the for this direction of the theorem the idea is I want to um I have groups H uh H chain let's say. Hj, let's say, which act geometrically upon gamma j which this graph is, let's say, core Hilly, or Heli. Right, and roughly, the idea is to just take the well, the Well, the obvious thing. So, I want to say, I want to take a bunch of these drops and I want to glue them together at a point to have something where the free product of DCJ acts. Maybe I'll throw in another free group. So, okay, how do I do this? I let Let gamma be let's say I take each gamma J, I glue in some cells to make it simply connected, for the notice by hat, and I take motion by shape, so I have some. Ocean body actually. So I have some compact complex. So that's gamma 1 mod 1. This is gamma m modulus hm. And I add some edges and maybe I add some loops x1 up to xm So this So this, the fundamental, well, yeah. Then phi one of gamma, if I do everything correctly, this is just a free product free group on these things. And then I yeah, so so that this group acts on the universal cover of gamma. So I take this universal cover and then I take this one skeleton, just ignore these two cells that I added to make them single connected. So okay so that's all Let's call this F. F acts geometrically on the one skeleton of universal cover. And basically, okay, so I have this group F and also I have a homomorphism as a rejection from F to. As a projection from F to G, where G is my group that walls relative to the collection of subgroups. So these are subgroups of G and F and G. And this X1 of X1, I take the generating cell of G. Okay. So we have this homomorphism and this sort of gives me the Q acts geometrically. Geometrically on this module kernel of alpha. And you can check everything, it's nice in geometric at all. And for this, I guess uh the group roughly follows the the Herobol root case. I have a ball group case. So I want to show. Well, I want to consider geodesics in this graph. And geodesics in this graph, they're not obvious what they are, but we can show that. So this, there was an old paper of Jabo and Flauri Chavano, I think, who did this for Kaylee graphs. For kilographs of relative hyperlower groups. So we can show that the kilograph of a, in a kilograph of relative hyperbola groups, maybe after extending a generating set, also look at the finite kilograph of relative hyperbola groups. If you take a geodesic in the scale graph, then it would correspond to a nice quasi-geodesic in the Kondorf scale graph. So basically, you can deduce the geometry in the Kondorf scale graph from there. Condoff kilograph from the kilograph. So we can do the same for geometric action to say that if a freeze of all this rough something, so this I call this gamma bar. So if we are to adhesive then I have a corresponding path which does the go between the same well yeah it follows P but in the condof k graph so you need to do some some technical things to construct it but won't go into this but there is a corresponding path in the The color of the Hilligraph, so that's my generating set. And I count it off, and then this is lambda C positive possible universal ones like lambda C without type price. And yeah, we go roughly, we do the same thing as we did for hypo groups there. So we have some nice quasi-geodesics. So I guess table intervals again follow straight from boundary closed penetration. And this triangles behave also nicely. Also, behave also nicely due to one cluster presentation. So, maybe I won't go into much detail this. So, instead of that, I'll say a few words on the other direction. Okay, so in the other direction, we use a result that I think is due to end succinct. So it follows from their definition of relative probabilities, saying that if you have a group, so my tree is always group. So, my T is always grouped, relative relative to H1 of the Hn. So, now Hi, each of these subgroups is strong liquids of convex in G, and by strongly positive convex, what I mean. I mean that for all lambda and C, there exists k such that any so lambda sequence is your g z in some local finite scalar graph. In some local finite K Legraph of G. So in K Lebraph of T with some finite ending set with endpoints in K, I'm sorry, in each i are distance at most k. Most k away from HI. So the nice thing about this property is that it's generating set-independent. So even though you have some, even though some sort of convexity or positive convexity in this case would be dependent on the generating set, this strong behavior that for every Strong behavior that for every positive we have gives you, that's generally something dependent and would work for any graph on which your group acts are measured. Okay, and yeah, basically we want to show that strongly quasi-convex subgroups of strongly quasi-convex subgroups of helicopters are called its L quote. Of course, helly groups of course heli. I love healing groups like Heli. And this, how much time do I have? Oh, okay. Sound is going to be not called here, so I'm prepared. Okay. Okay, so this is also some we still see something about this graph. So this verb is this single vertex or is this the quotient and system? So which one? The one in the one. So here, yeah, I click a single vertex in here. A single vertex in here, and I just join it, fine-tune. And then the cover is the graph of this cover, and there's some stabilizing in these methods? So here I just mean the universal cover if I fill in the docel. So I made the, well okay, I try to write this down in as few strokes as possible, which might be confusing. So I think this So I take this. Okay, so basically, what I do is I take this graph, I take an orbit of, I take a vertex there, and I take its orbit, I'm very itching. And then for each vertex in this orbit, I attach an an edge to go to the vertex like this. And they sort of glue things together this way. Of glue things together this way. So, here another way of saying this is I fill in some two cells to this to make it simple connected. Then I take the quotient so that this is fundamental group HJ. I mean, okay. So this has more vertices. I'm assuming the action is free, probably, but which I shouldn't. So this circle has more vertices, but you choose one and connect it to the middle. Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. So this is a row, and I just choose one orbit of vertices paragraph. I mean, yeah, okay, I want this to act on a graph. So I take the obvious one that it does act on. And then I didn't have these. I didn't have these. If I just glue them at the vertex, then I might have some problems when the action is not, well, when, for instance, the HI have copy approach and then the action might not be proper. So I add these edges to avoid these things. And just take the obvious thing. Sorry, I'm the chat lap. So, I can the chat right. Um, okay. So uh this okay, so so what we can show is that a strongly was a convex subgroup of Of a core selling group or heli group is core selling for heavy and for that, what do we do? Well, we take a graph. Gamma and we take so gamma is a kind of corresponding graph and we take a subgraph delta of gamma which is strongly host convex. So it's the same definition as here, just for graphs. Okay. And I want to say several things. So if gamma is okay, then there are two things. Delta is Delta is core value as long as gamma is core value. Oh, sorry, I should say the one neighborhood of delta. So what to consider that? I'm lying at that, but I don't want to introduce too many details. So the one ball around delta. Around delta is called Halle. And we also know that if gamma is Helly, then this one also the neighborhood of delta, we don't know if it's real, but we know it's isometric lambda system. Um, right, and this way, if this ball is isomatically embedded, then okay isn't five minutes late that well, or maybe you'll listen to us. Okay, so I just say yes. He was that if you have this isometric embedded, then we have this heli-ho of this graph, which says that it's a heli graph that sits right. Right. So it's a heligraph containing this graph as an isometric subgraph, such that whenever this is inside another heligraph, then the heligo, so that videograph is also inside our graph. So the point is that we can have a heligraph sitting between this and gamma. And Uh yes. Uh and I guess that's that's uh what this shows roughly. Um okay, I'll lie a bit and also don't want to run over time and sorry for being so technical. That's not careful.
