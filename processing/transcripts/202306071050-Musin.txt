Excuse me. Okay, I'm going to discuss today some extension of Spernus Remma. Let me show my paper about related to Spernus Remma. And here I present. And here I presented because you know it's my presentation, last presentation 2019 that we discussed, I discussed my work together with Andrei Malutin, more related to Borsukulum. And maybe I don't remember, maybe probably I discussed like some of that, maybe this paper. I don't remember. Anyway, I yesterday. So, yesterday evening, I removed many slides about different extensions, different generalization of pernolema, namely for polytopos per nema. I said some, I keep some slides about polytopos per narrema, but not only examples, not like uh, but however, I'm not going to discuss that as well as uh. That, as well as a colorful spaniel, because it also there are some quantitative bounds for colorful speculum. Today I'm going to discuss only this paper. And it will be some short introduction. And only this paper, it's appeared, I submitted to archive almost three years ago. Archive almost three years ago, but however, it's still not submitted to the journal. The reason is I'll explain later because I'm not satisfied by one bound. It is important bound in three dimensions, in four dimensions. And so I just, I don't know, I have to decide what to do with this paper. Maybe you can give me some advice. Okay. Let's start from the beginning. Beginning, all of us know what this pernilemma is. Let me just to give an example: in two-dimensional case, when we have a triangle and we have a vertices, we have two labels, two colors, one, two, three. And the side one, two, we have all vertices can be labeled only by one or two, and two, three by two or three, and one, three by one, or three. And internal vertices can be covered by any one, two, or three. In this case, Pernilema guarantee that they exist rainbow triangle or fully labeled triangle. The proof is very simple, not simple, but tricky, but however, it is tricky but however uh this uh elementary i know this i know this uh proof when i was a high school student and now for no it is i'm not sure i'm kidding because for mass olympiad it is now the part of training all students who are doing olympiad at least in some countries like in russia they all they know and uh i i a friend on our friend a senior pan he he always every year he gave some every year he gets some uh uh he gets some they have a uh training for olympia people they they they consider it many extensions of pernolema okay i have no time to discuss but it is really very good uh very good proof um let me give the main construction the main construction what i'm actually not much using not much techniques but how it is labeled to topology It is labeled to topology. That's how it is related to topology. Suppose we have a triangulation, some sometimes it doesn't matter what it is. And we have some labels. Let us consider some labels here. And then we immediately can say, I don't know, any, it can be any. Then, if you have x that will be simplistic and complex, what's t let's let's call this t tanguation, uh, then the uh then they have a map. There's a labeling L is a labeling L and then we have a we have a they have a map by the following way: take a vertex, look at the label, send this label to the one. Uh, to the one if this has a label one, we send this to this vertex, and so this is uh this vertex goes also to one, and so on. So, we have a uh all vertices, we have we have an image, uh we have image for all vertices, so by uh we have actually this we have a map that is called simplicial map because uh if we have a if if it uh if it defined for if it defines uh defined for vertices. define uh define for vertices that we define for whole simplicity complex this is only one what you need from uh from uh from the uh from that i i'm considering only very simple case namely uh we have uh when when we have uh when we have uh when we have d plus one uh d plus one uh ripples that means when we have That means you know we have simplex the the dimension simplex yet we have the dimension simplex has uh d plus one vertices and so we have all labels are one two or d plus one yeah uh and uh uh the dimension of of of simplicity and copies can be can be actually considered uh greater or equal to d because it is no no sense to consider it is no theorems Consider it is no theorems when we have less dimensions than D. Okay, so topologically, this map F L topologically this map F L is a map from the simplicial complex T to the D-dimensional spheres Spheres, oh, actually, if you have all of them, it depends. Suppose we have more, suppose we have more, okay, not SDA, by the way, to the simple, it can be internal to n. But if you have some bounds, if you have some bound, and if you assume that the bound has no only. Has no fully labeled simplicities on the boundary. In this case, we have the boundary goes to the boundary of the simplicity to the sphere and internal points can go to the can and we have some of some of fully labeled sympathies can go to the also cover to To the interior of the of the simplex. Okay. Oops. Oops, sorry. Okay. What does I? Okay, I made a mistake. I just write pass. Oh, here. Okay, see. Yeah, yeah, it is a yeah, as it means, yeah, it is yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so no, no, uh, what is what is written here, if we have a if we take any any simple uh any simplex simplex s let us Simplex s letters will be, I don't know, once one two three. Oh, suppose we have four labels, right? And this uh this is one uh s is one two four. Then uh then the pre image of this is c right. It is actually it will be only fully labeled simplex. What is the written here? Uh the first extension is interesting. The first The first further Sperner lemma probably presented in this room how many seven years ago is the following. We can consider some actually any manifold, not necessarily to be sphere, to be a ball, and ten blocks a ball. And 10 plates of ball, and it's got to be any orientable manifold with a boundary. And we have labels, D plus one labels. And also in this case, we have defined, as we discuss, sub L. And we assume that sub L has no Has no, didn't have the dimensional, fully labeled symposis on the boundary. In this case, well defined the map on the boundary of T to the boundary of the simplex. So we have, if they have the same dimension, If they have the same dimensional, same thing to have the dimensional, in this case, define the degree of the map. If degree of the map is defined, in this case, the theorem says that we have contained not only one, not only one that guarantees Spenner lemma. Then at least we have absolute value of degree. We have the Degree, we have this number by the way, for Sperner labeling the degree is plus or minus minus one, and so it is just guarantee only one. That is the reason. Let me give example. Yeah. Okay. Let me explain how to compute the degree of this map, FL map, in the case in two-dimensional. F L map in the case in two-dimensional case. So we have a actually we have a circle, topologically we have a circle and we have some some labels one two three labels we have for instance we have this in this case we have like this example what uh how to find that it is easy to it is easy to understand uh from uh it is easy to find it it's easy to understand uh what does What does that mean topologically? We have to find two numbers. We have to find two numbers, a P star and N star, which is actually one pair, say one, two. And after that, we look at the pair uh and one, two, it will be uh assigned with a with a sign one and two one with a sign negative one, minus one. Negative one, minus one. In this case, star is a number of positive one two, just one, two, and n sub star is a number of two one. Then they count this number, and they give us a degree. This example, this is example, we have p star equals five, n star equals two, and so this number. n star equals two and so this number is uh five minus two equals three. Let's see what happened in the theorem guarantees that in this case we have we have at least three fully labeled fully labeled triangles. Look at these triangles let us let us find degree the degree we have only three one two we have no three one two we have more to one so we have uh substar is three degrees three and so we can we can see that we have in this case we have a three fully labeled triangle very simple it actually also can be this lemma also can be proved by uh door by the door and and uh door open door and uh rooms method also it is understandable for Is understandable for high school students. Yeah, the same, the same proof. And moreover, if you can substitute, it is not necessary to be triangulation of simplex. It can be translation of any manifold as a boundary. Yeah. Just a few words. I promise that not to give more details about Polytopol. It is a famous Uh, it is a famous extension by Jesus de laira Patterson and Francis Su. Uh, they they uh they actually they just uh they they expand expan expand this theorem for uh for polytopal, not necessarily to be, say, it can be, I don't know, octahedron or some more complicated polytope, ten-related polytope. In this case, we have vertices will be labels, uh, and uh in this case we have And in this case, we have. But my extension is the following. The theorems give the number n minus d, original Beloir-Peterson theorem. But we also can define a degree. And in this case, we have the following quantity type experimental lemma, n minus z times. Lemma and minus z times uh times degree equal to value of degree. Let us see to example. Uh, we have actually we have a octagon with two holes, quadratic holes, and we have four labels. And in this case, uh, it is we can found degree degrees. Okay, in internal, uh, it is a whole we have the different identities. It is a hole, we have the different orientation. If you consider rotation anti-clockwise rotation for internal holes, it will be clockwise. It is just because it has to be orientation has to be well defined only for this case. And let us found that. We have how many on the boundary? We have one, two. We have one, two, we have anticlockwise one. Anti-clockwise one, only two cases. And if we internal, each has only one because clockwise orientation, we have only two, it will add two more. So degree is four. N is four. And the G is two. So four minus two times four is eight. You can see here, you can see here exactly eight triangles for the label. Triangles, fully labeled triangles. So you can play this game, continue, and to find more and more, more and more cases. Oops, I'm supposed to spend only half of time, right? No, no, 20 minutes. Yeah. Okay, let me explain, and today I would like to discuss a more complicated case, namely what happened when we have dimension. When we have dimension, say 100 in only four labels, can we say something about because for this case? The answer is yes. If you have in this case, if you have four labels, we can say nothing because there are no non-trivial cases when the number of colors. When the number of colors is three, but for four or higher, you have interesting, we have many examples that is related to the topology, namely for the homotopy classes of homotopy groups. Okay, so what we have what we have just let us consider that okay, this is this is obviously. Okay, this is obviously, let me look at the second example. Suppose we have four labels and we have a triangulation of k plus one dimensional simplex. And in this case, if we have for labels of as we discuss as we discuss the on the on the labels, we have the map FL. have the map FL. In the boundary, this map, the boundary of the simplex is a sphere of dimension k. And so F L this F L on the boundary, if we have a map, S K to S 2. But it is known, by the way, that for all K, it is known in topological theorem that for any K greater or equal to 2, Greater than equal to when this homotopy group of PK over S2 is not trivial. So we know that there are labeling, since there are labeling such that can give us non-trivial map. And the question is, can we say something about can we say something in this case? The answer is yes. And just our main example is Main example is hop vibration, hope map. That is for the case k equals three. In this case, we have a map S3 to S2. Theorem. The first theorem, it only exists in theorem. That suppose we have a triangulation of Carpath's one-dimensional simplex, and suppose, oh, I probably missed that. that uh we we have to assume that no fully labeled uh fully labeled uh uh trahedron on the on the boundary uh oh sorry it is uh sorry simply oops sorry press and uh then if it is on the boundary uh we have non-trivial uh this map This map FL is not trivial, not equal to zero in this home topic group, then T must contain it, at least must contain at least one fully labeled M plus one simplex. We consider only case when number, degree we have to dimension has to be the same of the simplex and a dimension of T. Of t. And in this case, we have actually can be any, since we have do. So this theorem gives us some examples of the existence of at least one rainbow simplicity. And so let's again, let us let's again let us uh let us uh let us consider so we have a uh uh we have uh so we have a homotopy invariant uh any any labels give us a homotopy invariant uh in the homotopy group pm of a sn and the main problem is uh main problem one of the problem is how to how to find this because uh it is uh usually on topical It is usually homotopy group is not easy to find, but of course, it is for any, I cannot give you any method for all dimensions, but I can do that. I can do that for some dimensions. For instance, when m is equals n plus one, it will be our main example. So, what do we have? We have one case in one case. We have one case in one case we have actually when we have m n equals n in this case we have a degree this this invariant is a just degree of the map and in the case m m equals 3 n equals 2 this invariant is a is an element of homotopy homotopy group of p3 of s2 by by the hope by the hope result it is z it can be any hop invariant any Any hop invariant, any integer number, and so we have to first we have to understand how to find this number. There is also algorithm, it's not complicated. Oops, wow, I have only four minutes, right? Ah, sorry. I'm just sorry, sorry, sorry, because this yeah, we started. Okay. Ideas are following. Ideas are following. I did the following. The same, if you know how to find the degree. If we have a map, we can say, suppose we have a map, take any points, look at the pre image. And we have several pre images. Find the sign of that, like plus, minus, plus, for regular, of course, not for regular. For simplicity, map, any internal point is irregular. internal point is irregular right for instance like like plus and uh the sum of this uh weighted sum of signs sum of that of this uh this uh the signs give us exactly degree it is just it can be it can be the definition uh what they have in this case when they have a say dimension m3 uh we have a uh we have a uh three dimensional three dimensional three dimensional sphere Three-dimensional sphere. We have a central graded sphere, we have a map into the sphere, two-dimensional sphere. In this case, we have to take it again, some like in this case. But in this case, the premises will be some polygonal line, some simplex, right? Because it is a one-dimensional manifold. And it is a one-dimensional manifold. And actually, if you consider some. If you consider some triangles, it will be actually some, we have one, two, three triangles, pre minus of one, two, three, three triangles that we considered before. That form at Taurus. Actually, not on one torus, it can be can be several toruses, like we have here, several points. It can be tori, we have several tori. And the question: how to find this number? The answer is not completely. The answer is not complicated because it's a link. We have a closed polygonal line, and we look at how many rotations doing this one, two, three triangle around there. It is called also, in other words, it is linking number. It's one of the method. So if you go only if you have one rotation in the right, in the that is That is oriented in this case, it will be just hopefully end to one. If it is doing two rotations around this, the pre image of the point O will be two, and so on. Also, sign depends on orientation. Orientation, by the way, in this case, is uniquely defined. So, it is like not comparable. So it is not complicated. The question is how to define some theorem. How to find some theorem. Okay. Let us consider, let us invent one more invariant. And after that, I will try to explain how to find it. Okay, what do we have? We have two triangulations of spheres. triangulation of spheres, m-dimensional spheres, m-dimensional spheres, and we have a map, simplicial map, and take choose any n minus one-dimensional sphere or n-dimensional simplex S. Take internal point O and after that we have a preimage, right? We have a preimage we have a pre image uh uh we have a pre image uh in uh in sm of uh of the uh of of uh of the simplex s as well as uh as well as o uh uh the pre image of o of o is um is the m minus n dimensional manifold m minus n dimensional manifold and we have actually like and uh for s it will be uh it will be uh some uh some Will be some neighborhood. I mean, it will be around this manifold. I don't know how to call that. And so the question, and we have to let us define some new invariant, namely, I define by mu of mu of that depends on f and s at the number of in the number of internal n simplices in in uh uh in this uh uh in this uh simplicial complex because pi of uh fs it is a it is a pre image of uh pre image of uh of s and so we have it is a it will be a simplicial complex and we look uh we just look uh for the uh for the number of uh and separacies that that that labeled is the same as the as the s because we have As a s because we have in image, we have some let's say one, two, three, right? We are looking for only for number of number of triangles with labels one, two, three. Let's see. This is uh, you can, you can, it is, uh, can be proved that, uh, okay, it's not yet. Uh, and after that, we defined, uh, we found that we defined defined, we can define the new invariant mu of A, where A is the element of common talk. element of homotopy homotopy group pi or uh pi m of s n that is uh that is the all possible minimum minimum we can change s and f such that they give the same the same element a and looking for minimum for them okay looks like uh this uh uh well i don't know it is uh it is I don't know. However, it is a complicated problem. I will give you some answer. So we have, it's again, return to the case, to the case when we four-dimensional simplex label it by four labels. In this case, we have a group of pi 0 versus 2. We know that it's z. We know that is z and uh let us call we can we can find a mu one okay since we can actually element a can be uh uh can be uh can be uh just we can use just uh integer numbers one two three and so on and negative one but uh sign is not important because it is just to change orientation is the same number uh okay the first Okay, the first important answer that mu one equals nine and mu two equals nine. And what I found, I can prove it, I could prove it three years ago, that mu of d for any d is greater or equal to 3d plus 3. To prove To prove the theorem that mu one equals nine, it is not complicated. We have a paper, Madohari-Sarkare, the same Sarkaria what yesterday discussed by Florian, the same Sarkaria. They considered minimum triangulation for Hop invariant one. And they found that the minimum simplicial minimum number of vertices has to be. Vertices has to be 12. And moreover, they proved that it is a minimum, it cannot be less. And they have example. In this case, the mu of these numbers, I mean, mu of this map that depends on two parameters, h1 and cs, this map and simplex. This map and simplex is nine. And so it cannot be less than nine. And so the answer is so the answer is that we have here no answer. It's much more complicated to do to find mot two. Look at how many years they spent. Madakh published, that is published 2000 and Madakhar 2012. 2012 gives answer key proof that we have that the minimum simplicity simplicial map is also contains contains minimum contains 12 vertices. It is strange because you know 12 vertices the same answer but if you look But if you look in the look inside of the paper, it is for one side elementary. Was the kind of tangulation of torus boundary in the glue? I mean, the past, we have a total and using this to union of the tutorials give us 3Ci. And the triangulation is very, very Very, very sophisticated. I mean, very tricky. And also, moreover, it is not here, they consider it. So, to give some more information about this one, moreover, they found they proved that for D For D, for NAD, they found example with 6D, with 6D vertices. So that give us, they give us, for this one, we have numbers 6D minus 3 for mu. Yeah. However, if you look at that, they wrote that they are not true, that is minimum for D greater than zero. And I have this obvious, more or less obvious. this always uh more or less always bound 3d plus uh 3d plus 3 but however we have we have only this example for mu and so it's not clear and that is why i stop one moment i start to start to look at the in this paper my paper more carefully and i realize that it's very complicated like for one sound elementary nothing no no mathematical just combinatorics on the other side uh we went to it's also bad written i mean like It's also bad written. I mean, like this paper. Yeah, I tried to find. And I decided, okay, I will return for next month, next month, and after that, almost three years. It's still. By the way, this is my first presentation of this result. Okay. So what we have in dimension four? Let's see better angulation. In this case, if invariant Uh, if invariant FL is not trivial, that we have at least nine fully labeled three simplicies, tetrahedrons, and for D greater or equal to we have at least 3d plus three. I'm sure that this 3D plus three can be improved. It's bound. What about the general case? I'm sorry about this ugly, ugly. Ugly, ugly. Actually, it is a deeply, deeply, it is deeply involved here, so-called frame cobordism. You can what we can see here, it is a extension of Patragon's theorem because Patragon actually found some relation between frame cobordism and homotopy groups. And by I need for I need for to find this to do this here, I need actually also relative relative frame cobordism. I'm sorry about that, but what I can tell about that only that this is in some sense, this is an extension of Sperner lemma. Looks like ugly, and thanks, John Milner, because it's a very good written. Very good written about the Spotraggen theorem in his book topology from differential point view viewpoint. Yeah, it is. By the way, he published 20 books, Tomina, right? I thought that the best is a Morse theory. However, what I found yesterday in Wikipedia, that this book is most popular, differential topology. On this, two months ago, I also met. We discussed in the other. We discuss in the other work, so from very different, from very different points in this book. Okay. And the theorem is the following. Suppose a general theorem for any dimension. Suppose we have a triangulation of n plus k plus one disc, ball, and suppose we have n plus two labels. Suppose we have n plus two labels, then and suppose that no fully labeled and simply says on the on its boundary. If it is, then if and we assume that this invariant is not is not is not trivial on this group, p n pi sub n plus k over. Over Sn, then T must contain at least this number, mu of this invariant fully available at n plus one simplices. The point is, the problem is, okay, we have a very interesting case. P4s2. P4 of S2 is Z2. The question is, how to find this number? How to find this number, how to find mu and I have no idea even how to find because every if you look at the uh look at the pantragon some torus because he is a long story he at first he made he made a mistake and he he trivial and after that he found because he considered only only only spheres he considered some torai uh torus and they obtained this result This result. Yeah. No idea, but for other groups, it is possible, but I don't know how to compute because you know that is one of the most difficult problem how to find homotopy group. We know some tables, there are some tons of tables, tables, homotopy, but it's not not it is uh still not not the theory. Still not easy to consume. Thank you. Thank you very much. There are any questions? So aside from the further climate of some colourful versions of those multiple further colorings are the structural version, and you can find a triangle with where each triangulation is. Triangulation is a different yeah, you know, I know that. Yeah, yeah. Are there versions of those? No, of course, I have it. This version, no, I have the version, I have a theorem that published five years ago, probably seven years ago, called for version, but only existence. I'm not defined, invariant is not defined. Still, this invariant is not defined. But I have exact actually colourful version in the beginning because of spare nearly m if you if you if you have n-dimensional simplex uh simplex and and we have n plus one labels then contains n factorial different you know that if you use this then factorial um yeah it is bapat's theorem his name bapat and also gale no it is long story actually yeah and gale also proof for uh uh uh uh he considers the continuous version yeah Yeah, the KM, yeah, what not quantity version? I have no quantity version, but it is trivial quantity version because we have it, but such that when we have the dimension greater than then, I have no, just only the existence. Existence is just I can give invariant, but it is also an interesting question. Yeah, it's a big area. Yeah, it is a good question. It is probably next step to find something for. To find something for solution, yeah. Even for simple case, even it is known only for a degree, for degree, no problem, yeah. But for instance, when we have three and two, right, S3 to S2, that is this case, it's open. Why you require that there are no polyinerial synthesis in the boundary? Ah, because it is okay, it is not defined. Okay, it is not defined because we have a, it will be not. Okay. We have a boundary, right? Letters will be S2, right? Suppose we have here, we have a four-dimensional case, right? On the boundary is three-dimensional. If we have a fully labeled tetrahedron here that goes to the, that cover everything, not go to the boundary. So it is not elemental. So it is not element of pi 3 over 2 s 2 because it is not that the reason. The generated case. This is not good question. Are these numbers new anyhow related to the network and relations? Not related, but how it is a good question because I don't know. Oh, you can okay. Oh, you can okay. If you have a minimum, if you ask me, do you have a theorem that it has to be minimal triangulation? I don't know. Because for existing case, I give you cases. That is obvious. That is obvious, right? And moreover, because I need only upper bound. I mean, like when Madakart found 12, 10 bullies, 12, I have already. Triangulation is 12. I have already bound greater to equal to 9. I have now an example. In this case, it will give an answer 9. That was only 1. But how, I don't think it is, what I know what it proved, I would prove that it is always a minimal case. Minimum new gives it is always, we have only one connected component with not several Torah. Only one. I could prove it. And also, is that proof also? And also, they prove also they proved Madakara Sarkari in the beginning. They also proved that the minimum case. So it is a good question, but I don't know. I believe it is probably gives us some minimum. Thanks again for it.
