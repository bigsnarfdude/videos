So, I'm going to continue on from where I left off yesterday, talking about the turbulence and then vertical structures. This is things you saw in the exercises yesterday. So, that might help give you a picture of what we're going to talk about and a little better idea. I will then go on to sort of the last topic, main topic I'm supposed to be speaking about, spatial variability and complex terrains. That part's going to be maybe a little shorter than I hoped, and probably maybe a little more. Probably be a little more qualitative than quantitative, let's say, just because, as we kind of saw this morning, it's very difficult. It's complex work and it tends to fall down into very specific cases. And I don't think that's not really, I don't think we can do that well in a simple lecture, at least not in a half hour type lecture. It's more a thing that I'll try to lay out some background work on it, some ideas I needing to think about. Work on some ideas I need to think about when we're looking at specific cases. And I hope everybody online can hear me. If you can't speak up, I guess. All right, so this is a slide from yesterday that we had up talking through where we were talking on turbulence. What is turbulence? This irregular, rotational, multi-scale stirring flow. And what we ended the talk with lecture with was looking at buoyancy-driven turbulence in terms of potential temperature. And that was one of the exercises. Temperature. And that was one of the exercises. I'll come back to that when we look at the exercise this afternoon because that might have gone by very quickly when you were running through that R file and was just generating lots of plots, but there was a plot in there that detected how buoyancy forces could create a negative gradient for potential temperature and therefore be an unstable situation. What I want to talk today about is move away from the buoyancy side and look, we're going to talk quickly about the mechanical side. About the mechanical side, the momentum terms, and the moment idea of, well, I'm going to talk about the idea of momentum, turbulence generating, mixing, momentum. And this comes down to an idea, well, this is actually for both of them, an idea of Reynolds decomposition. Has anybody seen the idea of Reynolds decomposition before? Okay, a couple of you have seen this. That's good. The idea is supported by what we saw in this power spectrum picture that there's sort of two peaks. This is when the sort of main peak. Peaks. This is one, the sort of main peak of energy in the variability of wind is mostly around the one month, one day to one month scale, so weather. And there's a second peak at much smaller time scales and much smaller length scales generally that is turbulence. And there's a gap in between these. There's a low point in between those two that says these two behaviors are sort of separated from each other. And we can explain. And we can exploit that gap in an approach that says we're going to decompose our variables into two sets: the long-term mean variables and the short-term turbulence variables. So we do that, you know, mathematically. We can do this. What nice thing about it, we can do this really structurally, mathematically. So it's a little bit of a combination, as I think I might have mentioned, but turbulence is generally an idea that we analyze with statistics. With statistics. It's short-term interval answer because the frequency is large, right? Yes. Okay, yes, yes. Frequency is large, period is short. We can break down our variables. We take any variable. A is here representing any variable, velocity, speed, velocity, speed, temperature, pressure, anything you want. You break it down into two terms, what we often call the eddy term. The eddy term. This is the eddy term with a prime, and a mean term. And a mean here is some time frame usually that you agree to average your variable over. So for standard, we saw with the data here, it's usually something like 10 to 15 minutes for wind data. That small scale turbulence happens on scales less than 10 minutes. Longer than 10 minutes, you're starting to talk about behavior that you can attribute to weather or larger scale features. Larger scale features. And so that is somewhat arbitrary, you know, what length scale you do the averaging on. But once you've decided on that, then this decomposition of the variables is a very mathematical process that you can argue. And you introduce the average averaging operator, then you can apply not just to the variables themselves, but you can apply this to the entire equations that you're looking at. And you can break your equations down into terms that are related to this mean and to this any variable. And that's the idea of this decomposition. And that's the idea of this decomposition. Let's break our flow up into these two components. Good question, how would you really do though with such kind of decomposition? In terms of actual, actual data? Yeah, you do it by taking your data, calculating the average. So you decide on an average time and how you do that averaging. This kind of implicates a rolling average that you might. A rolling average that you might do. You might actually just break it up into bins generally with like wind and stuff. We just say, I'm going to average over this 10 minutes. So you calculate the average variable, and then calculating the perturbation is just simple. You take your full signal and subtract your average. And there you go. You've divided your variable up into these two components. Thank you. And it's a good question because it's a mathematical thing, not a physical thing. Like you can do this with anything and it's not guaranteed. Not guaranteed, you know. We're just calling the leftover, the residual appropriation, an eddy term, a turbulence term. But you, people do this at all scales, and they call things eddy turbulence when it's day-long scales, because what they're looking at is decade-long motion. So, this is done at all different time scales, and how you decide that averaging scale determines what this prime quantity really means. Okay, so here I'm going to take the averaging as 15-minute averages. Averaging is 15-minute averages, so the prime scale is all the motions that happen at scales smaller than 15 minutes. And this is a nice picture to have in your head. This is the type of variations we've seen over these two days of lectures. Lots of noise. You're doing some sort of smooth mean and pulling that out and treating all these little this amount. That's my eddy variations. And we call them eddies because generally in Adam. Eddies, because generally in atmospheric oceanographic sciences, when you do this from the mean flow, they look like little vortices and eddies. You can actually plot them and they look like eddies. Now, if you do them at the right scale, they look like turbulence. They look like swirling, rotating flow. After doing this decomposition, we might, at the same time, getting rid of it, getting rid of some periodic behaviors. It has going to be a problem. Getting rid of periodic behaviors? If you are original data. If your original data is periodic and your F-bar is sort of the same points, well, depending again, I guess, depending on what time scale you take for that average, I know I wouldn't say you're getting rid of periodic behaviors, but you can be deciding. So, for example, if you took your time scale to average over to be a week or something like this, the periodic behaviors, the diurnal day-night cycle that is sort of happens periodically, would become part of your. Would become part of your eddies. So you just shift that motion into saying, okay, that's my noise and my turbulence. So that's why I mean, when you choose that perioding time, you're choosing to define what your turbulence is. So if you don't want to avoid it, if you want to avoid that, you take your average time shorter. But that choice of averaging time is really important in this because it's deciding how you, and you really want to do it based on some knowledge that you're separating two things. That you're separating two things that are actually separate. When they're not actually separate, like the spectrum of points, right, then you're kind of mixing things together, and you got to be careful. Like even here on this slide, this one at 80 meters, it becomes a little less obvious that the, and the spectrum, that you really have a clear difference between the turbulence flow and the, and the mean flow, because the turbulence is weaker there. Basically, the turbulence is starting to disappear as we go up in height. So by this approach, when we get the eddies, but do we assume that they're IID? I'm not sure. I'm trying to think what the, I guess it depends on what statistics you're doing with it. Well, the A's will have their own equations of motion. Yes. Like you have to write down. Yeah, like I'm trying to, yeah, we're not when you're doing this, like, because I don't know, we're really going to do a lot. When you're doing like because I'm not really going to do a lot of statistics on this, uh, you can, you have to be careful. Depends what type of turbulence you're talking about, doesn't it? Are the Eddies IID? Are they really independent type observations? No, and eventually you're going to talk about the Eddies in terms of the result state through a parameterization. And so, you know, there will be some sort of temporal dependence in the result state that's inherited by the parameterized. I'm talking about I with respect to different. With respect to different times? Or you could draw to different times or different spaces? They're really, they're not independent in time, and they're not independent in space. I'm saying that, but you can go further. If you're really going to do this statistically, you can try to break down your eddies into more independent type variables, but it gets very tricky. That's why I was slow in responding. So we're going to break up the variables like this. Variables like this. The average of the eddies, and this is where the is zero. Now, it's by definition, it's zero if you do it the way we constructed it, because you know, you subtracted the eddies off, you subtracted the mean off the main flow. So whatever's left has a mean of zero. And this is the key thing, though. So this is important when we look at the very anything that's linear in variables, the eddy term will disappear out of the equations because you'll just, you'll be averaging a linear quantity like this. So when I average a linear quantity, Like this. So, when I average a linear quantity like this, this goes to zero. But if you have non-linear terms in your dynamics, when you average them, the eddy terms don't disappear, the perturbations don't disappear. And that's the critical idea that this is a process we apply to non-linear equations. And we saw yesterday, non-linearity, we have non-linearities in our Navier-Stokes equations, in our general governing equations. And that's really, these will play a critical role. I think that mathematically, it will be. Think that mathematically it would be more accurate to ask if those fluctuation process is something like a brownie motion because the IID, it's not a sequence, so what we have is a process. So is it something like white no, is it something like a brownie note, for example? Like that's a more mathematically valid question to ask. And I would say generally, no. This is, this is, these are, these are coherent structures. Coherent structures. These are not random stochastic processes. They are generally, that's the thing that sort of makes turbulence interesting. It has a stochastic nature to it and kind of how we look at it. But if you look at it carefully, it is coherent structures that obey laws of physics. So I would not. You can fit it to a stochastic system with laws of physics embedded. You can, yes, yeah. But I don't know if I'd call them just Brownian motion. I don't know if that's that's not the way I would. In motion, I don't know if that's that's not the way I would approach. Uh, I would approach that's you know, I'm usually thinking larger scale, so the things I'm thinking that are extremely coherent. They're not really stochastic. I can, they're not, they're somewhat stochastic. Maybe a more accurate way of saying it is that turbulence is deterministic, but highly non-linear, and as a result, very sensitive to perturbations and initial conditions. So, maybe. Yeah, results. So, maybe a chaotic system is more path. Yeah, now I should say that once a system is very chaotic, it's very difficult, it's deterministic, but our deterministic ways of looking at it break down a bit and eventually we turn to statistics and we treat it as stochastic processes often. Some parameterization is some ways of trying to account for the aggregate effect of these short time-scale processes on the longer-time scale process. Sort of saying, well, we know turbulence does two things, right? It stirs and it mixes. Two things, right? It stirs and it mixes, and it also is noisy. And so they actually parameterize it by like an enhanced dissipation, enhanced diffusivity, plus a noise term. Yes, that's a not uncommon parameterization, but the noise term can be very complicated if you want to do it properly. This could be non-Markovia and sorts of stuff. Yes. So, what we're going to do in the Reynolds decomposition is we're going to take our original equation. So, I put up here the temperature equation. So, I put up here the temperature equation written in terms of continuity equation written in terms of potential temperature, theta. And we're going to, in each of these variables, we're going to replace it with the decomposition into the eddy and the mean, and then we're going to take the average of the entire equation. And we end up with a new equation that tells us the evolution of the mean quantities. Any of the linear terms, you're just replacing the variable with the mean quantity. But the nonlinear terms are where it gets interesting. We see of a nonlinear term that relates. non-linear term that relates non-linear term in terms of the mean, but we also have a non-linear term that relates the average of the any quantities together. And it's like a covariance type term statistically, because you're saying, okay, what is the importance of this? The way we think of this often, it's the smalls, in this term, it's a small scale eddy velocities carrying around with them the small scale perturbations in temperature. And combined, they result in a term that contributes to the large. Term that contributes to the large-scale motions. What this thing in terms of wind is the little small scale motions you experience when you walk around in the wind and the small fluctuations in temperature do affect the large scale variations that are going on. They do have impact on, and then you can go up scale all the time, all the way up to the weather scales. And this is what makes weather forecasting difficult is because you can't ignore the really small scales. And you can't ignore any. And you can't ignore any. If you're going to do everything right, you can't ignore any really small scales. If you are, you're going to have to make some approximation. You're going to throw some information out, which is eventually what we have to do because we can't model all of these terms. There's just, like, I shouldn't say can't. It would be, I guess you could say can't. It's way too expensive to model all those terms. It's computationally too expensive. So at some point, we have to say, okay, we'll have to approximate those. And these things we call turbulent fluxes or turbulent stresses. Or I think about the next one. Oh, I guess. This is, I think I showed this slide earlier. This is an example of plotting those, of calculating those from data. This is a plot of that turbulent flux, I believe, if I'm reading the label there, right? P I T line R. So I think it's the turbulent temperature flux, plotting it versus beginning of a day, this is a plot of a day of turbulence. This is a plot of a day of turbulent fluxes versus height showing what happens on a sunny day. This is in Germany, so it's from Germany and it's UTC, so you probably have to shift the time a little bit backward because it's not your local time. What it shows is that when you're at the beginning of a day, when you're on a cool night, there is no turbulent mixing, there is no rising of warm air, essentially, this turbulent rising of warm air. As the sun comes out, we get a warm air. Comes out, we get a warm surface that generates heat at the bottom, and you get a rising of warm air, very turbulent flow, and then at night again, when the sun goes down, this disappears. So this is what we talked about the other day, sort of as an idea. You can calculate these quantities just by doing that decomposition. Take all your variables, take an average of a certain time, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, subtract them off, calculate the correlation, essentially, the average of the eddy velocity and the eddy. Any velocity and the any temperature values to calculate this amount. Sorry, in this spot, how can you tell in the middle the turbulence is maxing? What should I look for? The turbulent, actually, what we're plotting here is what we're plotting is this term. No, no, the turbulence intensity. Turbulence intensity? Is it turbulence intensity? Okay. What we're plotting is turbulence intensity. So we can tell it's, but you can tell that it's stirbin'. Okay. Yeah, we can't. We're plotting turbulence intensity. Yeah, we can't. We're plotting turbulence intensity is the size of this term divided by the mean, essentially. So we're just saying, this is just saying the size of those turbulence terms. We can't say that it's mixing, but we know those turbulence terms are stirring things. And we do see that it has a vertical component because it goes upwards as time goes on. What is the color? The colors is the intensity of the turtle. The colors is the intensity of the turbulence that's happening. It's a turbulence intensity measure. So, red is really large values, blue is basically zero. So, it's saying you see the turbulence developing near the surface as it gets larger. It eventually moves upwards because this is a turbulence intensity involving warm temperatures and they eventually end vertical velocities. And they carry, the turbulence carries warm air up into the atmosphere. Warm air up into the atmosphere. So those contours are iso, but they're constant values of, they're just the same as the colors. They're just constant values of turbulence intensity. So they're just plotting a contour plot of turbulence intensity. How strong is the turbulence? So we can do that also with the momentum equations. So this is just doing the same process with the momentum equations. We've talked about these nonlinear effective terms. These nonlinear advective terms as being key to this process. And all this shows is that when we do this turbulence decomposition, we get terms that are called Reynolds stresses up here. Maybe later. These terms are often called Reynolds stresses. There should be more, there's many of them in these equations. Adam has chosen in this writing to concentrate on the vertical gradients of the turbulent stresses. Gradients of the turbulent stresses they tend to be the most important in this aspect we're looking at and what we're focusing on. That's very important here: the averages with respect to z, right? The averages with respect to time. Yeah, it's about, well, but okay, but it's a shorter time. We're breaking time down into two different times, right? We're doing a 15-minute time average, but we're allowing the mean variables to add, I mean, they could be averaged with the. I mean, they could be averaged with respect to other things, but we have a short time. The theta bar is a mean, but it can still vary over long times. So if this way, we're thinking here, this variable is an average over, say, 15 minutes, but the equation is holding for hours. So we're allowing, we're not doing, yeah, we're not doing a, so you still have a time. You really probably should have, I guess you're really being accurate here. You'd rewrite the little T here. You'd rewrite the little t here as some new time capital T or something like that. And you're breaking it apart. Probably what you're breaking it apart into fast motions and slow motions. So we're introducing a time decomposition is another way to think of this. Mathematically, that would be, you know, you'd have sort of two manifolds, a fast manifold and a slow manifold that you're bridging in these, all these vector components into. I can think about the averaging as a projection operator. Yeah, it is. Operator, yeah, exactly. Yeah, you know, you're taking a system that has fastest slow components and project it just on the slowest. Is it the same case like you are at doing average weekly average of like annual data? Yes. No, sorry, daily data. Data, you're doing a weekly average, but the weekly average still varies. Right. So the hanging. It depends how you do it. Most of the time, it's calculated not as a rolling average. Calculated not as a rolling average. It can be, but I don't think most of the time, depending what your data is like or what you're using, you just have to be consistent with how you calculate. I would say most of the time, you know, with data, it's like I have 10 minutes of data, I just do an average of those 10 minutes. And then when I do the next 10 minutes of data. If it's not rolling, then T here would be, so the when T is between, like, if it's a, let's say it's a weekly average. Say it's a weekly average and key range is in the week, then it just stays constant. So it well, yeah, so then you're getting a little bit of a equations wouldn't make sense. It is a yeah, for keeping it as a differential equation, you could think of it as a rolling category. There's a lot of nuance built into this. I mean, the cleanest way to think about this is that your ensemble object goes over a hypothetical, infinitely large ensemble of different realizations of the turbulent flow. And then the ensemble object commutes with the time direction. The ensemble algebra commutes with the time derivative and all other derivatives, and everything works beautifully. Um, that's that mathematical setting. When you're dealing with actual observations, you typically just make one realization of observations, and so you can't do that ensemble averaging. And so you have to make some sort of ergodic hypothesis argument that you can switch to local time averaging. And so there's the way it's done for observational data, and there's the way it can obtain the so-called Reynolds average Navier-Stokes equations, which are Equations, which are most naturally thought of in terms of a big ensemble average over a hypothetical ensemble of different realizations of shared notes. So, this is different from the directly direct, you're not projecting out of radical notes. So, on the third term, the del z is it the height, the change with respect to height. Yes, so there is a term, the change with respect to x, the change. The change with respect to X, the change with respect to Y, they've been dropped out before this problem because we're emphasizing the vertical structure. And we think those vertical eddy fluxes are our largest ones. And mostly because we're looking at one, well, we'll come to that. We're looking at one point. If you're looking at spatial variations, you would probably keep those X and Y derivatives if they could be important, depending on what your spatial scales are. But what we're going to do with these equations is the same thing we did before. One reason we're introducing these, these are still non-linear, difficult to solve equations, sort of impossible to solve. You might solve them numerically. So that's one thing. If we're solving these numerically, we have to come up later some way of representing these terms in our numerical model because we don't want to solve for them. We want to represent them in terms of our mean quantities. We only want to solve for these quantities. So we rewrite these eddy terms. Rewrite these eddy terms in terms of the mean quantities. We come up with some magic formula called eddy parametrizations. They are all wrong. Some of them work well. Some of them don't work so well. Some of them work differently. And so you'll see in any sort of CFD type model, and you probably asked Joshua about this, you'll be flipping switches. You can just, I want this any parameterization. And then you switch. Drop down menus. Yeah, drop-down menu. Just choose them. They all give you slightly different values. That's true. Let's see if he puts. Values. That's true. Let's see if he programs out, right? He's like, choose this one. And they all do it slightly differently, some better than other for a given problem. What we're going to do is look at this. We're going to say, okay, similar to what we did before, we're going to take this balance and say, okay, we in the layer close to the planetary boundary layer, close down to the surface, any fluxes are more important than these terms. And so we're going to look at this simple balance. And so we're going to look at this simple balance and say, okay, now I might be able to solve for the velocities and show how they vary given these eddy fluxes. If I can say something, I'm going to hand wave a bit about the eddy fluxes because they're really hard to measure and they're really hard to model. But we're going to have some, well, basically that's what we're going to do. We're going to step through, say some things about these, and then solve these equations to say, how do the velocities vary in the vertical? How do the result is saying how do they? The result is saying, how do any fluxes change? How the velocities vary in the vertical, right? So, those are the equations. And these are simple equations. The critical part is, well, they're simple differential equation with boundary conditions. So, we're doing a boundary value problem. And specifying these boundary conditions is critical to the result you're going to get. It's a boundary value problem. Your solution is determined by these boundary conditions. Some of them, we choose the velocity to go zero. We choose the velocity to go zero, not exactly at z equals zero, but at some height. And this is well, we'll come back to this. This z-naught is a interesting parameter. We don't say exactly zero, partially for, well, we see the model that comes out. It doesn't work at z equals zero. So that's one reason we don't want z equals zero. At the surface, at the top of the boundary layer, this is at the very height, we're going to say that the velocity. Say that the velocity goes to the high-level velocities, which are driven by weather, you can think of the geostrophic velocities that are way above our planetary boundary, they are way above our turbines. Those ones are specified, and this is important, I'll come back to this. So, those are specified somehow in this model. You would, in a real situation, those are the weather driving the winds way up above us. They play a very important role. What we kind of at this level, we just say, well. At this level, we just say, well, somehow we know what those are. So that's a big approximation. At the surface, near the surface, at this value Z naught, we specify that there is a eddy flux, negative eddy flux into the surface with this parameterized value u star. I think it's on, and u star is called a friction velocity. It's again a little bit of a hand-wavy term. Term. It's called a velocity because this has the units of velocity squared. So we call it a velocity squared. So it's got the right units, and it is a, so it is a velocity. What exactly it means gets a little tricky at times. And at the top, we assume when we get to the very top of the planetary boundary layer that all our turbulence has vanished. And because when we're doing the weather above, it's not connected to this small-scale turbulence driven by the surface of the Earth. Driven by the surface of the earth. So, we're really talking about the turbulence that's driven as the wind blows across the surface of the earth that is highest at the surface of the earth, and then it goes to zero if we go far enough up. Are we solving for four functions in there? We're just going to solve as we should be careful about saying solve. Maybe I'll. Maybe I'll go through it, and you can see it's all really what we're interested in is these quantities. That's what we want to know. What is the structure of the mean velocities with respect to z? So, we'd like to have, what we want to come out of this is an idea of what these look like. But what I'm, I mean, I didn't mean to solve in the sense that does this equation define how many functions does it define? How many functions does it define? Like, what is given and what is defined by equation? I would say, so what's given? We're given these are the only things that's given. Yes, there's four unknowns in there. And is it enough to define these? We only have two equations, so no. So no. These we don't, again, these terms we don't really know these. Know these. We're going to make some sort of hand-wavy ideas about them. So we do want to have these ideas of boundaries. So we have a problem that's not well defined. We have too many unknowns. If you go to the previous slide, there are other equations. Well, but this introduces more, but the note base, this one only applies to the. No, no, no. There are other two equations about flying, the flying equations. Yes, you would have a set of equations that you could write down for the Eddy terms. These are the mean equations. You could write down terms that describe the evolution of the Eddy equations that you could, in theory, solve. They would be fully non-linear equations that in practice we can't solve. Well, but also those equations for the double products of prime variable involve triple products of primary variables. Yeah, so it's not a closure lab. So, it's not a closure lab. So, you've got to have an equation for the current product, which has terms involved. So, it's not a closed product. At some point, you have to close it. That's why it's that's one way of calculating these things. We go to a next level above it, and we assume that the triple prime products are zero or easily understood or something. That's what a lot of numerical methods will do. They'll have some, it's called the closure problem. Eventually, you have to make some approximation to stop this whole set of equations. To stop this whole set of equations that become higher and higher order in these multiplication of these terms. There is no easy way out of it. I mean, the easy way out of it is you just start with the original equations and you solve them. So that's we're essentially thinking those flux terms as given and then writing the equations for u bar and v bar. Yes, not what we're writing down is a simple relationship between them. Is a simple relationship between them, and we're going to try to exploit that relationship. We don't necessarily specify these exactly, yes, but let's specify them in terms of functions of u bar and v bar, and then we could solve these. That's one thing we will do. Oh, okay, nice. But we're just saying that, you know, at least that is simple, there's a relationship between a nice simple expression of u and these simple quantities. So maybe we can solve these. That's good. That's good. And on my screen, so roughly, we have a picture of what this looks like. So these are just sketches of the picture that it looked like, and we're going to write down some equations for these. But this is what we expect it to look like. That the bricks, and these should have really rhymes on them. These are the prime terms. These are the prime terms. The friction terms are high, the eddy terms are high at the bottom, at the surface, and decrease with height. There is some sort of change in direction as you go up as well. So there's a bit of a spiraling motion with these. The u-bar and v-bar start at zero at the surface and they increase with height up to our geostrophic velocities at the top. That is the picture we have. That is the picture we have. It's roughly sketched on what we expect the balances to be. And then we're going to go ahead and try to solve some equations that would match this picture. It is a bit handly. If you can get standard maybe error, I think, as we go along, I tell them getting more definite. Well, one comment that somebody might ask, Richard, is why is the Rimmel? Is why is the Rimmel stress not zero at the wall where we expect all the velocities, even the fluctuations, to be zero? And I think you pointed this out because here at the wall is not where you end plotting. That's at Z0. The wall is, this is at Z0, and the wall is down here in the summer and a few millimeters below. Some few millimeters below. And in that time, this would go to zero. Down to zero. Really quickly. Very quickly, and molecular viscosity is doing all the work. Yes, yes. So, there is another little layer there. I think that was mentioned in the lecture I had the other day. There is another layer, or is it coming up, maybe, a really thin layer where velocities all go to zero? The BW is zero because of the coordinate system. Because of the coordinate system, I think that was on the page. We're choosing the coordinate system in a way that we're choosing the largest part of the geostrophic velocity. Part of the geostrophic velocity and the large, therefore, and also the corresponding eddy fluxes are in our. We're choosing our coordinate system that specific way. Generally, you think of the coordinate, we think of the planetary boundary there as having a winds there heading over the small time scale, a direction, and we orient our coordinate system in that direction. Why do we have to negative posit for v bar? It can be positive and negative. No, why is it negative there? Negative there. V bar is V bar. Oh, yes. V bar. It just, again, it's our coordinate system we're choosing. It is. I'll write down formulas for those quantities in a second. And it turns out that in the coordinate system, it'll be negative. It does. I mean, the direction changes. It's a bit of a choice of the coordinate system. It's a bit of a result of the rotation of the Earth because these are geostrophic velocities and saying that if this is what you choose. That if this is what you choose you to be, this is the corresponding V because they're related through the pressure gradients and the rotation of the Earth. If you did that in that southern hemisphere, we flip things around or something like that. Again, this is just a sketch. So hopefully, you know, it's a sketch based on some of the ideas we want to look at. So, where we are, we are looking at the lower part of the boundary layer close to the surface, but just above that millimeter type surface. This is describing this description. Well, if we look at the lower part, we can approximate the eddy flux term as a constant value. So we're looking really down here, and we're going to assume it's a constant value as an approximation. Obviously. As an approximation, obviously, it's changing as we go through the rest of it. All right, this is the sort of hand-wavy chart, but that is important. What we're going to do then is say, okay, over this small height, stratification doesn't matter. The air is sort of one density. And the vertical shear is determined by this turbulent momentum flux. This turbulent momentum flux, and how far you are from the surface. And we're going to derive an equation based entirely on dimensional concerns. Now, if we're going to say that, the only equation that works in terms of dimensions is this equation. That the vertical gradient of u bar times z divided by u star is equal to one over kappa. And I wonder how many people have done like dimensional analysis like this, where you start with equations and then just take out the dimensions. And just take out the dimensions and find out that there has to be a balance. Everybody should do this sometime in their mathematical career because it's a wonderful way of examining equations where this has to be the balance. Now, based on those hand-mavy assumptions, it has to be the balance. The second bullet, I wonder if that's correct, if I'm thinking incorrectly. Are you saying that the stresses there are uniform or the gradients and stresses are uniform? Isn't it the gradients that are uniform? Running messes are changing from minus u star and they move it that are actually fixed. I think you're right. This is your slide. I didn't say I didn't say it's uniform, but I think which second one? This thing here: is it true that we're saying that the turbulent stress doesn't change then? Right, but no, but this is the whole idea of the surface layer approximation is that what we can do if we're What we can do if we're sufficient energy close to the surface where the change is sufficiently small, then we can essentially say there's one characteristic stress value that we can use throughout that layer. And that's what all of the similarity theory arguments are predicated on. This idea of the constant flux layer of the surface. It's called the constant flux layer. Which is a bad name because the fluxes are a constant. But what it's saying is that the layer where you approximate the fluxes by the... Rated approximate the fluxes by their surface values with an up to order 10% error. And this is a little hand-wave. It is. It is, except this equation. Yeah, this equation is important for the previous diagram to remember, this is only meant to describe that very bottommost part of the block. It's not, it's not. We are really now just, even, but even here with the diagram, it looks like there's a big gray. Here with the diagram, it looks like there's a big gradient, even if you do that really small, it's where that largest gradient is, not the smallest gradient. But if you do that small enough, even with a gradient, this equation can be solved. It's a nice simple differential equation. And we get a, with the boundary condition that mu bar at z non is equal to zero, we get what is known as the logarithmic law of the wall, that the velocity very close to the surface. Velocity very close to the surface varies like a natural log. And this is used all the time. This is, this is, even though it's sort of this, you know, we had a not clear derivation of it, lots of hand waving, lots of approximations going on, this is the standard rule, one of the standard rules of how flow varies close to a wall when it's turbulent. This one was first discussed by Discussed by von Karman, I think, in the 1930s. He had discussions about this. An interesting discussion, I'll show another one on another wall. If you go back to the 1930s, there was an interesting discussion between von Karman and Prandtl about how to represent these turbulence quantities near a wall. This works fairly well. You compare it to measurements, which was done in the exercises in the R code. It works fairly well in a large range. It is some thought of whether this is a universal law of turbulence. Of turbulence, does it apply everywhere? Every type of turbulence, um, it does pretty well, uh, and not just every type of turbulence, but like every type of turbulence, regardless of Reynolds number, regardless of the fluids, and it does fairly well. There would be some criticism that it's it's only universal if you if you manipulate the constants involved. So, does that mean it's universal? All right, it has a problem, the problem, one problem with it. You put z equals zero in this one, we can't do z equals zero in there if you put z equals zero. This one can't do z equals zero in there. If you put z equals zero in it, this goes to infinity at z equals zero. So minus infinity at z equals zero. So you had a problem with this formula is that you have to introduce this sort of z naught, this artificial layer above where your velocities actually really, really go to zero. And choosing this parameter z naught, we'll see is a critical part of making this formula work. And this constant is, you know, pretty common. And this constant is pretty constant. Over a lot of different calculations, it's usually, it's not exactly constant, but it varies a small amount. So you can take lots of data and fit these curves. So we get to treat U star as some parameters, depending on the structure of the surface. On the structure of the surface, the structure of the flow. Usually it's kind of. Yes. So we really have what we have, and this is the way I've done it. So, we really have what we have, and this is the way I've done it in the exercises. You have a two-parameter curve that you can fit to your data. So, you take your data in the vertical, you fit a curve to it, you choose U star and Z naught to match your data is one way this is looked at. If you do that for lots of data, you hopefully see that some of these values get to be sort of standard. We'll have a, I think there's a chart on the next thing, but Z naught is related. It's called the roughness parameter, it's related to how rough. Way to do how rough your surface is. U star is, and we look at that. I think it is. That's what it means. So logarithmic. Most of the flow near a boundary layer looks logarithmic as a function. The roughness lights, okay, we probably can't see this, but it's a bunch of different surfaces coming from a really flat, sand-covered, snow-covered surface up to killy mountains or forests. And this is the challenge. Forest, and this is the challenge with Z naught. It varies from a value of 10 to the minus 5 to 10. So, over these different types of surfaces, that parameter that we hope is sort of somehow nice and universal varies by six orders of magnitude. And it's a really tricky parameter to fit from data. And it does, you know, having done this a lot for fitting data at one location, so even at that wind location that we had the other day, I've done this in the tidal flows. The tidal flows. If you do this spitting process and you do it for each individual curve that you have, Z naught will vary by three or four orders of magnitude. It is not constant. Partially, this is a problem just because of how what this curve looks like. It appears in a logarithm. So, what you're really fit a parameter to it, and you have to take the exponential of that parameter, and it means any small variations in your fit parameter get exploded exponentially. Exploded exponentially. Sorry, Charlie, having hard time to understand how those least three different tributes. Well, this is the idea to give just the structure. Like I have a plot of it. I'll have a plot of it later. But the vertical structure of the flow right close to a surface, a turbulent flow close to a solid surface. This is the turbulent. I mean, from the equation that you started, we can do a certain You need to do a certain balance to solve this balance. You have to know this profile. What is turbulent? What is turbulent? What is where is it? It's not in the equation. This is an equation just for rock. It's in here. I should be careful. It is in here. The turbulent quantity is hidden in the U star. Basically, we replaced. Can't do that either, right? This did, I should say. This did, I should say, this equation didn't come from the previous equations. It comes from this assumption and the dimensional, this balance that we're going to do in a hand-wavy way and say this is the balance we think has to happen. And if that's true, the dimensional analysis says this balance has to happen and therefore we can solve it. So you're right, it is an odd model. It's an odd model. It has a lot of assumptions behind it, it works fairly well. Behind it, it works fairly well. It is a lot of how modeling of turbulence is done. It's too complicated. We'll make some assumptions and we'll see if we can come up with some simple formulas that then appear to work, that we'll then empirically check. How big is that layer on that second point assumption about what is why? I know it's about it's it depends on it depends on how rough your server. On it, depends on how rough your surface is. Really, I mean, how big is it? Mostly, what people would do is take their data, they'd say, How big is that layer? I'll fit my data, I'll fit this curve to the data, and where it fits well, that's the layer. When it stops fitting well, I'm going into something else. And is there a natural value for that? I haven't seen it. It depends on the situations. So that's typical what we did with our data is we'd start at the bottom, we'd say, I'll kind of take first three or four points of data at the bottom, I'd fit this curve, and then I'd end a point, fit. I'd fit this curve and I'd add a point, fit the curve, add a point, fit the curve, add a point, fit the curve, add a point, fit the curve. When the fit gets bad, you stop. And that's a really messy way of doing it, right? It's not very satisfactory. And another thing that comes out of this calculation will often change from a u-star quantity to a drag quantity. This is one. This is one definition of it. You can rearrange it a bit in different ways. You can write it in terms of u star. Sometimes I think it's even, I don't know, I gotta remember this right: u star over u bar squared. I might get this wrong. Maybe there's a capital there, something like that. It's a ratio of these velocities. And again, a lot of these quantities are sort of arbitrarily chosen. What? There's a Z in here, so you have to pick a height that you're calculating this at. You're essentially picking. You're calculating this at. You're essentially picking a ratio of a velocity at a certain height above the surface to the U-star quantity. And this, but which again, lots of hand-waviness, but this drag coefficient, this is the drag coefficient that you hear about talked about when we're doing modeling. Like, what's the drag coefficient of wind going over an aerofoil? What's the drag coefficient that you put in your numerical model to represent the bottom of the atmosphere? This quantity is used all the time in modeling. The time in modeling, often assumed to be constant when it is no way constant. You look at day, but we got to make some approximation. So, this is this relates then. We're going to write the force of everything going on at the bottom as a quadratic drag formula. So it says all that turbulent stuff that we're going on, that we're messing around with, that we've been waving my hand, I've been waving my hands about here, not really convincing you. We're just gonna call that a drag, a quadratic drag. A drag, a quadratic drag, and throw it all away. And it works very well. The mean velocity is at Z naught. The mean velocity here, this one, no, is at Z here. Some level that is not specified here. U says, so this Z. So usually you have to specify that Z. I've used, we use in the title stuff, we say U at Z. The big bar here is like U at one meter. Is like u went one meter is a standard one meter above the bottom, and that depends on what your bottom looks like. So you pick a level above your bottom. If you have observations, you pick a level where you have measurements. Again, it's somewhat arbitrary. And if you're using this drag coefficient in a numerical model, you should really be careful and say, okay, how am I using that drag coefficient? What velocity am I applying it to? Because I'm not modeling that really thin body. Modeling that really thin bottom layer. I'm modeling something close to the thin bottom layer. It's remarkable that some of this works well because we're really throwing a lot, just hiding a lot in these simple parameters. So it says roughness like Z0 depends on the character of the surface. And we said U star also depends on the character of the surface. So then we expect that U star and expect that u star and z star to be related i yeah i said i wouldn't say u star depends on the character of the surface entirely it depends on the it depends more on the character of the flow close to the surface but they are not it's it's still are these totally independent um well if i do it as a model fit yes i have two parameters in my model that do two different things in my curve so yes they work as independent they they do not i do not have any trouble fitting this Not, I do not have any trouble fitting this curve. This curve is easy to fit to data. But based off of the physics, they're combining because it's based off of the mutual interaction of the momentum transfer that occurs at the surface and the turbulence that occurs in the well. Turbulence is influenced by the shear, and the shear is influenced by the turbulence. I mean, the hand-waviness is because most of this was done by engineers. I have to be careful about the hand waves. I have to be careful. It has, but this is the accepted way of describing this for oceanographers and atmospheric scientists. This is not the way the engineers describe this layer. They describe this layer this way. They use a different law. They use a power law, which is a different, similar type of rules, which they call ZR as opposed to Z naught. And they don't do it as a logarithm. They use a different function here. A is generally, as you can see below, A is a small value. So that's a fraction there. Value, so that's a fraction there. And they use a power law and they just say this power law fits the structure we see. And it works very well. They're very similar curves. They're curves. If you looked at the data, these are curves that look like the data. And you can pick whatever one you want. I did remove a line here from here because Adam had a line here and said this model has no physical basis. And I've been reading up on these two models. And I've been reading up on these two models, and that's not what the literature says. There's two camps: one, I like this model, and I like this model, and they will argue they've been arguing for about 100 years now on which one's the best. And they both argue that their model is more physical and more applied. And they're both, the models are so similar in reality that the way they're used is it doesn't, it's like I have a curve, I'm fitting data, I have data, I fit data to a curve, I'm fit curve to a data. Data to a curve, unfit curve to a data, how you choose that curve, there's no perfect way to do it. The one thing I like about this power model, I'm actually becoming a bigger fan of it, is this compares the Z-naught values that we capture, and this is what sort of was on that other table that you couldn't read, to this A value and moving from different types of surfaces, water through new cities. And I'll show a plot of this idea in a moment. And the Z naught value, as I said, changes over orders of Said changes over orders of magnitude. That's not nice to have a parameter that you put in your model, and you might get wrong by like a factor of hundreds. The A value doesn't vary that much. Still varies, but doesn't vary as much. So it's a little better behaved parameter in terms of curve fitting. In the end, they both give you about the same result. And you can see lots of derivations of both of these. And you can see lots of derivations of both of these models, and more or less hand-wavy than I've seen. I can give you if you want references. I've got like two dozen references on each of them and why they're the better model. How volts of parallel generalize to non-neutral stratification? It can be, it can be, you can do the same thing. Because, in some way, I mean, I think I have an excuse, what Adam's asking is: I think. I think we'll come back to that in a minute. I think I have that later on. If you want to, these are these assumptions here: is that we have a nice flow. If we have complex flows, so your stratification is not stable, then we know the vertical structure changes and you'd have to adapt that some way. And essentially, what I've seen, both of these laws can be adapted to just about anything by adding in some arbitrary terms that help you do what you want it to do. Do what you want it to do. So they both are fairly flexible. They're both derivations, no matter which derivation I've seen, or a little bit of a lot of this, right? So if you do a lot of this, it's easy to just add a term and say, well, I'll do this a little more. And I'll add a new term to make it do something else. So it's, I mean, that's the message here is that this is, this is, in terms of it, rigorous derivation, this is very, very unsatisfactory. In terms of practice, it works, which is why the engineers go with this. Which is a lot of engineers go with this. Is that like, if I'm going to go with something, I don't want to deal with logarithms, logarithms are strange. I'm going to deal with a power one. That's easier to write down. Okay, that's looking at this very bottom part of the flow. The next thing we're going to look at is this structure. Fairly quickly, this is something you would study in oceanographic. Oh, sorry, that's well. We're going to get there. One way. Well, we're going to get there with one way. So, how do we get rid of this term in the equations? We will approximate it as a down-gradient flux that where we calculate, we represent the eddy terms as a derivative of the mean term. This is an approximate, well, written like this, it's not an approximation, well, it's not sort of approximation. You can write down a k here, and it's not constant. It varies with the flow. The approximation is, we usually say, let's take k to be a constant. A constant. Is that exact? No. It allows us to solve the equations. Right, so we're going to use this down gradient idea. It's an idea of mixing, that if you stir and mix stuff, you transport things down gradient. You move things from hot to cold and stir everything up to get rid of any changes. It's a diffusive type term. So if you add a diffusive type of term to your equations, that's a common thing we do with solving Navi HDOS equations. Again, is it? H-DOS equations. Again, is it really accurate? No. How you choose this constant k? Many, many different methods, or whether you choose it to be constant, or whether you allow it to vary based on some, even write it as a function of your background mean quantities. Lots of different ways to do this. We're going to assume it's constant. And when we assume it's constant and stick it back into our equations, now we have a set of equations we can solve. That really should be newer. Now we have. Now we have two partial differential equations that we can solve with boundary conditions. How much do you need to turn the plasma? I'd say it has order one changes in a very turbulent 12. It's not that constant. Assuming it is constant is a big approximation. Uh, and it's done just because what else? Anything else that you do? Any other approximations I've seen, you can see for it, they work better in some search, some situations. That's that's a whole, you know, at least from my point of view, when I started doing research, that was a whole area of research. How do you choose K? You know, you can go out there and find hundreds of PhD theses written on how do you choose K. All of them are wrong. Fortunately, I saw that going along and I said, I. Fortunately, I saw that going along and I said, I am not getting into that game because that's just like, oh, wow. People spend $30,000. Your whole four years of a PhD is how do you choose K? So these equations we can solve. This is called the Ekman layer equations. You can write down solutions. They are exponential solutions with cosines and sines. So I got nice second-order differential equation type problem that you can solve. I guess it's an And you eliminated from it's a fourth-order differential equation you can solve. order differential equation you can solve ODE type equation with boundary conditions you can get solutions they have their solutions that give you a spiral type motion but this is a well-known problem equilayers are studied in atmospheric science oceanographic science anytime you have a force so in oceanography this is the winds blowing over the ocean and the resulting motion in the ocean should there be u bar v bar in the equation yeah yes i had that on the previous slide but just a way of making it Previous slide, but she has a way of making it. It's on our slides. Yes. So we get this. This is the Ekman. It's a nice process. If you ever, if you want to see the results of Ekman layers, you can Ekman layers exist when you stir your cup of tea or you take your liquid in the water and stir it, you will get an Ekman layer on the bottom surface of as the water slowly spins down. So it is a, it's everywhere, these Ekman layers. Everywhere you have moving fluid interacting with a solid surface. With us all with the surface. What this means is that the motion, this is, I don't know if it's perfect. What we can think of: this, this, this is a map of how the velocity vector changes with height. What you can think is, it's sort of on there. I don't know what's with that. These vectors, what we're representing is the velocity vector, and as the tip of the vector. And as the tip of the vector traces out that black curve, as we go up with height, so we start with a velocity vector of zero. And as we move up with height, it points in the constant direction that we've chosen with our coordinate system to be the dominant now, the direction of the wind. That's our layer, our constant sort of, what do we call that, constant flux layer, constant turbulence layer. Then we get the Ekman layer where this vector spins as we go higher and gets larger and larger and eventually matches up to the wind. And eventually matches up to the wind way above us. So that's the structure now we've constructed with all these approximations of what that planetary boundary vertical layer should look like. And with all the hand waving, it works okay. Even despite that, it works fairly well when you compare it to data. You did this, and now maybe we're doing the exercise. Go back and look at that part of the plot that did that in the exercises and say, yeah, it's not perfect. Yeah, it's not perfect, it's not there. It gives us an approximation that works. And this is another picture of how that spiral wing, just to give you an idea of it, depth. We start with the velocity vector here, and as we go up, it spirals around and gets larger and larger as we go up. So, this is important for wind turbines because we're getting, well, it tells us, it gives us sort of a point you'd like to aim at for the largest winds. These tend to be fairly. Largest winds. These tend to be fairly high. In this little diagram, we're talking four or five hundred meters, sort of where you get the maximum, generally higher than what the wind turbines are. But we also know that the wind velocity changes direction as we move up across the turbine. Or should, if this theory holds nicely. Okay, so one of the things I had come back to a couple ideas wrap things up very quickly, which I'll show lots of pictures. Which I'll show lots of pictures. The roughness quantity, this gives you an idea. This is sort of varying that Z naught or varying the other parameters in our model. The rougher the surface is, so this is often used for modeling winds in a variety of things like cities. Cities are very rough. The buildings can be hundreds of meters tall. And therefore, your layer, your boundary layer, gets really large because this is all mixed. Your turbulent layer is very large. It's generally high. Is very large. It's generally as high as your roughness, and it takes a while for it to settle down. If you have a really smooth surface, your boundary layer is generally smaller, and you have a quick transition from the very turbulent boundary layer to a more steady. The logarithmic plot gives you a steady, relatively steady flow or the geostrophic flow. So, this is sort of the picture you have in your mind: as I increase the roughness value, I increase the Value, I increase the depth of my layer. And then also, on here, it says, you know, as you do this, near the surface, we have more gusty winds. If you want to turn them in terms of sort of standard language as opposed to turbulence, near the surface, it's very gusty. Up here, it's less gusty, more constant winds. Rougher surface, more gusty. Smooth surface, less. We're assuming here that new star in all these cases is staying the same because you're looking at wind. I don't know. Wayne, uh, well, I don't know if we're really making any. I mean, this is just a sketch, so I wouldn't say I wouldn't make that assumption that u star is always the same here. I mean, but it wouldn't be the same if I'm fitting the data. So, I would what I would assume is that the only parameter that's changing is the roughness parameter. Is that? I would say no because the drag parameter, which usually depends on u star, is also changing here. We would have the drag parameter be much higher here and the drag parameter to be lower here. So it's, I know what you're trying to do, but I don't think we can say that that simply. And this is going to be my sort of conclusion as we get through this. That's another picture of the same thing showing. Notice the difference, but anyway, I don't have side here, the difference in the shape. But anyway, I don't have to sign here, the difference in the shape of the curve because we're thinking of putting a turbine. We don't put turbines in cities, you know, for a variety of reasons. But one reason is the wind isn't very nice there. Lots of other reasons. We want to put turbines in a wind like this because we can get the turbine outside this thin layer where all the really turbulent, quick variations of wind go, and we can plot it up here where the wind should be nicer. So this is why offshore winds, offshore turbines are nicer than onshore turbines. Nicer than onshore turbines. Onshore turbines, we do have these variations of things that cause wind to do different things. And you see also these pictures, a lot of these pictures come from engineering approaches to building buildings, building bridges, building things, and figuring out what the wind force on these objects are going to be, building turbines. Very similar. This is what Adam mentioned. You can. Adam mentioned, you can. I'll set this up on the screen again. You can make changes by making adjustments to this to take into lots of factors. One factor that's often done in the atmospheric sciences, our planetary boundary layer, is going back and looking at an equation for the potential temperature, writing this again as some similarity function, so approximating that with a nice function, and then sticking a relationship, adding something to your vertical function. Adding something to your vertical function that relates. So basically, you're saying, I know that temperature variations matter. How do I add that into my equation for the vertical changes of velocity? Here's one way to do it. It's not simple. And, you know, again, it's a bit hand-wavy. It works for a variety of purposes. I'm pretty sure you can do exactly the same. You can add almost exactly the same term to the engineering power law equation because the power law equation is. Because how law equation is just replacing this first part, so you do exactly the same thing. What I'm saying, you can do this is one step. If you want, you can go further and further and further, and you can find equations for this structure that are extremely complicated and bring in all these different parameters. And in theory, do a slightly better job. In practice, as they get more complicated, they just get more complicated. So, it's a question of whether. So it's a question whether you want that. Could you explain phi m and phi h? What do they use? I think we're just switching the subscript. Why do we use phi h up there and phi m? I don't know. It's different ways of representing the effect of a temperature stratification on momentum fluxes by turbulence and energy fluxes by turbulence. Energy fluxes, but theta temperature, potential temperature, yeah. The way that the turbulence is transporting momentum and heat is not the same, and that's what's encoded in most of the calculations. H and M, oh yeah, one is heat, one is heat, one is momentum though. So up here, you're saying this is a heat equation, a temperature equation, and then down here, because we're talking about momentum, we're going to use the same function, but apply it to momentum. What is L and why are you scaling with that? L, I didn't include L. About L, I didn't include L is a length scale, the Obakov length scale, that is determined by measuring a variety of. So you have to scale, scaling the height some way based on the background temperature gradient. I don't have the full formula here. I can show you that, but it's another complicated formula. So it's a length scale associated with the instability created by variations in temperature. So, like I said, if you want to get into this. So, like I said, if you want to get into it, this gets as complicated as you want it to get. If you really want to get into this, if your focus is how does buoyancy, temperature-driven instabilities affect your flow, this is what you want to get into. Generally, when we're looking at wind energy, you'll do a bit of this, but you're hoping, maybe you'll talk about this in your slides a little bit, you're hoping that you're picking a site where the temperature variations don't make that much of a difference. Reality is they make a difference a lot. The reality is they make a difference a lot of places. Anytime, any place the sun shines. Okay, I have like five minutes left, so we're going to go through complex spatial variations. Now I'm going to tell you why all that theory is sort of is extremely limited. But this is what we'd like to do. We'd like to figure out, okay, we're not, what we've been doing is looking near one spot, and we'd like to look spatially. So this is connected to what Whitney talked about this morning. You want to do spatially, there's a lot of chat. Want anything spatially? There's a lot of challenges with this. The biggest challenge, I would say, there's two big challenges to this type of picture, right? So, I already you're not convinced by this picture, you have good questions. The biggest challenge here is this is not in a steady situation. This is in a situation where we have a really strong wind blowing across. So, the turbulence that's generated here doesn't go short. Let me make sure the turbulence that's generated here doesn't go. That's generated here doesn't go straight up, it goes at an angle up. So, the turbulence that you're seeing at your turbine height is not from the bottom of the turbine, it's from 100 meters or 200 meters or a kilometer in front of the turbine. So, these ideas, like when we were talking about roughness and new star, I don't need to know the roughness here. I need to know the roughness a kilometer upstream. Oh, but the way. Oh, but the wind changes direction. So I need to know the roughness kilometer upstream this direction, in this direction, and everywhere. I need to know it all the way around. So these simple models deny that fact that we are in a strong wind regime. The second thing that denies it is this geostrophic velocity that we use as an upper boundary layer. Well, that's determined by the weather. That's not some constant amount. That is changing all the time. So if you're going to use the base, All the time. So, if you're going to use this model, you need to have a weather model up here that's saying, oh, yes, I know what's happening above my turbine all the time, which is not crazy. I mean, if I told you what is the wind going to be out there tomorrow, you'd say, well, I'll go look at the weather forecast and I'll figure out what the wind is going to be out there tomorrow. But we've kind of ignored that for most of this, because we're not doing the, we're doing just this layer, but we have to recognize that all of this depends on weather. Depends on weather at some level. So, you need to look at this is where the spatial variabilities and complex terrains come in. We need to know, before we can apply the simple theory, we need, and we're going to apply it over a range. We need to look at how does the weather change in that area? How does the roughness change in the entire area? What is this distance? How far upstream do I have to look to figure out what the turbulence will be at my turbine? This is, I mean, you probably see this in your numerical modeling, right? If we do numerical modeling of a turbine farm, we see. Modeling of the turbine farm, we start the flow a kilometer, 10 kilometers, I don't know how far you do it upstream with your turbines, so the turbulence can fully develop and hit the turbine in a realistic way. Ah, maybe I'll skip it. This is about weather. I'm going to skip these slides because I want to talk more about just to give you an idea of how that roughness changes. There's actually roughness, you mean Z not, right? I mean Z naught. Well, I mean roughness. Well, I mean, roughness. Z naught is an approximation of roughness. Okay, so the Z naught doesn't change drastically over a closed area? No. Well, depends what your surface is. So if your surface is water or a flat grass plain that goes on for kilometers, no. If you have trees or buildings or hills, possibly yes. So it has to be measured on It has to be measured on an area, right? For every location of that area. Yes. And measured is not an easy thing to do. But it's been, and this is just showing the effect. I start with a nice flow. I don't know if you might think of this over water or something. I come over land, I get some small adjustment. I hit a forest, I get another small adjustment. And then those adjustments carry on downstream. So if my turbine is here, I see the results of all those things. All those things hitting my turbine. So, which value of Z naught do you use? Well, it's some integrated value of Z naught representing all the things the wind has come across. How long a distance should I go upstream? Well, there is a well-developed turbulent theory to describe this thing, usually looking on turbulence over flat plates. This is the classic turbulence theory. You take a flat plate in fluid and you move it. Move it. And then you examine the structure. And there is nice, well, I should say, there is similarly hand-wavy mathematical series to predict how the height of this layer changes, how all these other layers interact with each other. And if you want to, there's a whole, you know, a really rich theory around turbulent boundary layer development. You can look into it. I don't know if anybody uses this in detail because generally around our wind turbines, the roughness structure. Wind turbines, the roughness structure, the land changes enough that any, this is simple theory about a flat plate. Theory about something complicated breaks down pretty quickly. But you might get some ideas in terms of how this theories about how this boundary layer depth changes as you move along the flow. So there is lots of theory there, how well it can be applied to these complicated situations. I don't know. All right, I'm going to spend five more minutes talking about flow over different aspects of flow over complex terrain. This is going to be flow over a hill. I'm going to make this larger in a second. We're going to look at the different cases. The reason I'm going to explore this, the one I didn't post this yet, there was a suggested textbook that Adam used last year to build the lectures, and it suggested we could study easily flow over a hill as one example, one simple example of complex terrain. Of complex terrain, flow over a hill. And I looked it up and I read that what was in the textbook, and I looked at it and said, this is way too trivial. This doesn't capture it all. So here's a simple cartoon that says, flow over a hill. It's not just the wind. You have to consider the stability of the atmosphere. You have to consider how stratified it is because, in a situation where this is the froud number, people know what the frouge number is. It's a relationship between the velocity and the buoyancy forces. And the buoyancy forces. So it's a ratio between these two. This says, in this situation, where it's really low, the atmosphere is very stable. One way to think about this is it's very hard to take a parcel of air and move it vertically because the potential temperature effect will push that parcel of air back down. So if I can't move the air vertically, when the wind comes up to a hill and it can't move vertically, it goes around the hill. It doesn't go over it. And so it treats the And so it treats the hill like an obstacle, and you'll get wind going around. You reduce that number a bit, you make it less stable, so it's a little easier to push air up, and a little bit of the air goes over the hill. A little bit that creates a disturbance, usually represented as a wave. You can get a nice lean wave. You'll see these in mountains and various things from the weather forecast sometimes. So you'll get a nice wave of behavior downstream of the hill. If you continue. If you continue with that, that's the same way. If you continue with that, you let more air go over the hill. Well, now air comes over the hill and then sinks as it comes onto the other side of the hill. And you start to get a large wave with recirculation zones. And you continue that, it gets more, you get sort of like a hydraulic jump type situation, and you get a cavity and recirculation zones behind the hill. And if you take that situation sort of to the And if you take that situation sort of to the ultimate, you get fully turbulent flow downstream of the hill. So a simple hill, flow around it. We have five different regimes of what the flow can look like, depending on the stability of the atmosphere. So complex terrain, it's complex. Is there simple rules you could do? There's simple things you could do. Rules you could do. There's simple things you can look at as sort of hand-wavy ideas, but you have to consider in detail the terrain, the stability of the atmosphere, the weather above to figure out what's going on. There are some simple cases you'll see. Well, for one view from Calgary, you know well the idea of the Chinook, right? How large mountains can affect the winds you see. So the idea of the Chinook is, I'm going to say, A Chinook is. I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I looked this up, I read about it, didn't read a lot about it because I don't think I ever saw a really nice, clean description of why a Chinook occurs. This part is fairly well known. We have warm, moist air coming off the Pacific Ocean. It hits the mountain. It starts going up. As it goes up, it cools. The moisture is lost. You generally get rain on the BC side of the mountain, not on the Alberta side of the mountains, all the Rockies. As the moisture is lost, it gets warmer because as the water condenses out of the air, Because, as the water condenses out of the air, you get a release of latent heat, and the air gets warmer, it hits the top of the mountain. And this is where it's not exactly clear why this occurs, at least not in my reading. The moisture is kind of held all rung out of all the clouds, and you get a warm wind that comes down the other side of the mountain. As it goes down the side of the other mountain, I've seen the idea that it gets heated by compression, but I never saw a really nice explanation of why, as it comes down that side of the mountain, it accelerates. Comes down that side of the mountain, it accelerates and gets it gets really high speeds because it's warmer air. So, I didn't, I don't know if you know an explanation. I think it's sometimes you can think of it as a control flow. Yeah, so you get, it's like in a large moving over a weird, and so you get sort of a rapid flow, and then some distance down the stream, you've got a hydraulic jump. The hydraulic jump is where you see the Chinook arch. But it doesn't depend on this air here. But it doesn't depend on this air here being a certain relative temperature or something, so it doesn't mix, so it gets pushed underneath it. Yeah, but I think that's why it doesn't happen all the time. It's raining in the mass coast. But if you're going to build a wind turbine in the foothills of Alberta, you probably need to understand this. But it's going to be, you know, it doesn't happen all the time. What happened? How often? Once a winter, twice a winter? Oh, now. Much more? It does happen a lot of times. I was wondering those high speeds that we saw on the average speed. High speeds that we saw on the average speeds of the foothills. How much of that is caused by Chinooks? It'd be interesting to look at because we can't count on that. You can do similar things in valleys. I'm putting this one up there because one of the data sets we have is in related to a mountain valley system, where during the daytime in the valley, warm air tends to move up the valley and up the slopes of the mountain, and then you get a reverse of this at nighttime. And so a valley system creates its own. And so, a valley system creates its own weather system and own wind system. So, if you're putting turbines in a valley system, you have to study that specific system to understand what's going on. And this is on top of regular weather going on, right? So this is not always not every day looks like this. It needs to be, it's just another way that sun heating can change what's going on in your local conditions. You have to look at your local topography very closely. Closely. That's the simple picture. There's the complicated picture of a mountain flow. This is in a paper examining, I forget the mountain, it's probably on there somewhere, the Matterhorn in Europe. And this is like every possible little piece of land and different weather conditions creates different winds. Winds around mountains and valleys can be very complex. That's why you gotta be careful putting your wind turbines in there. Another thing I'll end with is. Another thing I'll end with is: if you're doing wind farms, the biggest thing that changes your wind profile are your wind turbines. The biggest thing that does spatial variation is the wind turbines themselves that you put in. Because they disturb the wind a lot more than the few trees or a little roughness on the bottom. They disturb the wind fundamentally. So, once you're starting to put more than two or three turbines in, you have to steady the effect of the wind turbine far on the winds. Far on the winds itself, and right there. There's a picture from Joshua's work looking at this and actually showing that one of the works he does showing you know it just changes the weather patterns. It was generating gravity waves. And you can see that there's lots of studies out there now, wind farms changing the weather because they have much bigger impact on those little roughness quantities that we talked about, having a turbine that's actively stirring up the air, creating a huge amount of turbulence. Creating a huge amount of turbulence changes the local wind pattern any more than, you know, this is why studying the roughness quantities of the surface up here. If you're designing a wind farm, that's not as important as figuring out how your wind turbines down here are going to interact with the wake of the turbines in front of them. Most of the time, we try to design a wind turbine so those wakes don't interact. But this is the classic picture. I don't know if there's many more out there where the turbulence caused by the wind turbine causes the Caused by the wind turbine, caused the moisture to condense in the wakes. And so I always see this: who designed this wind turbine that they put everyone exactly in line with the wakes? And I think it turns out that that's just an odd wind, that that, you know, if you see all your wind designs, the wind comes from every direction at some point. So you're, you know, this is sort of odd that the exact time we got the right conditions to create that picture was the time when the waves were interfering. Was the time when the weights were interfering with each of the individual turbines. So that's, you know, that's, this is why I'm cautious about doing how much you do on the complex terrain analysis. You have to do some when you're thinking about a wind turbine, but then you also have to look at your wind turbine farm and analyze that. And there is, as Joshua would probably tell you, he probably had hundreds of papers on modeling wind turbine lakes and how that works. One thing you do, if you're turbulent, if you have more rough surface up here, More rough surface up here, more turbulence coming into the wind, hitting the turbines, that affects your wakes. Generally, your wakes are shorter if the flow going into the turbine is more turbulent, because there's already some, there's some turbulent mixing there to mix the wakes away faster. So there is some relationship there. It gets complicated. I did have a concluding slide or something like that, which is not that every situation is fairly unique. And in some ways, this is. Unique. And in some ways, this is good because that gives us a lot of work to do. Otherwise, somebody's already solved this, right? If you don't have to solve your specific location, it's done. I'll stop there because you know where to make. I have just a comment just to give a sense of what the cost of these simulations are. The picture that you're going Simulations are the picture that Richard showed was done in 2023 and it consisted of the most computationally expensive simulation that was performed in Canada in that year. So we used 74,000 core on the Niagara cluster in Toronto, and we were on that for four weeks. Longest single search, but maybe there were more, but that was over a long period of time. 74,000 computers. Yeah, also simulation. Pardon? This is a simulation with lots of approximations. I think this is not a full turbine resolving model by any sense of the imagination. Yeah, but that's great. So it's again, this is why, you know. But again, this is why you know it's frustrating to do some of this mathematics. It's still necessary because to do these simulations, you're building on some of the mathematical theories out there to simplify the calculation because the full calculation takes way too long. And maybe also for clarity with that box that's shown is just a crop. The whole domain, the domain is much wider and longer upstream and downstream. Is it with 10-meter resolution? Yes. Yes. Yeah. The different contracts. For weather and climate models, they would be a thousand to ten thousand times more coarse resolution. Yeah. Both weather models. Regional weather models would be. Regional month or maybe a hundred. Yeah. Regional wind models would be something similar, 100 meters, something like that. Maybe a little more higher resolve than that. If you're doing a really small scale regional wind model, but for a global model, you're experimenting. We are experimenting with four to four kilometer global models. Which is why all that stuff we were talking about, you're putting in a three-kilometer box, those little details don't matter. You're representing those details with constants because they don't matter that much. You can't, you're not resolving any of the details of the swirling winds and things like that. You're only doing one wind variable every three kilometers. And yeah, we can chill. You know, we'll look at the data in the exercises, the reanalysis data. Exercises of reanalysis data, it's still really complex on a scale of kilometers. Wind is still very, very highly variable and complex. It's like most of these details. This is why sometimes we go to statistical methods because the more you look at it physically, the more complex it gets. It never gets easier. It just gets more complex. At some point, you do throw up your hands and just say, let's just treat this as data and do the statistical analysis of it. What's up is page 14, please. Page 14. It's going to be about the parameters in. Yes. So L is a length scale, probably something like the scale of the hill, the width of the hill. Of the hill, the width of the hill. Uh, n you say n and n is the brunt vice frequency. Um, that is a is a formula for it. Can I write down the formula? I should know that. It is a non-dimensional quantity. It's non-dimensional, right? No, it's a frequency. It's a frequency that is, basically it's a frequency of a buoyancy frequency. If I take a small piece of air or fluid, I usually think of it in water but fluid, and I move it from its stable situation, I pull it down or up. I pull it down or up, the buoyancy forces will pull it back up and it'll go too far and it'll oscillate. The Bruntfeisality frequency is that frequency that it oscillates at. So it's telling you how strong the stratification is. So stronger stratification, it will oscillate pretty quickly. Weak stratification, it'll go slowly and big oscillations. So it's a measurement. That's why it's in the fruit number here. It's usually sometimes the front visall, other times you'll see gravity and And gravity should be in there as well. Density and gravity is a different definitions of the froum number. Is that a factor that causes the mobility part of the wind after the dome? Sometimes. Yes. I mean, this frequency of this wave would be related to the brunt by Sala frequency because it is sort of gotten pushed it up a little bit, the piece parcel of air, and then it travels along, oscillating up and down. So the frequency of that wave should be related to air. Thank you. Be related there, thank you. That's good. Good point. Well, if you want to look at, all right, one thing I said, these complex trains, the one reason I'm just showing you figures, I went and looked and looked, and almost every paper I saw on this was numerical methods. That's all. In the complex train, we did a numerical model. That was it. So, there's really not a lot of theory that you can put down there. It's complicated. Can put down there. It's complicated. Do a numerical model, pay attention to things in your numerical model. But if the numerical model has a resolution like 100 meters or coarser, then all the stuff that Richard was talking about with the approximations of turbulent diffusivities and all of that, that kind of thing will be at some level put into a model like that, to some level of approximation. Yeah. All the stuff that goes on, you're just approximating with some constant drag. Constant drag. And most of the models use constant drag over huge domains that have very different roughness. But what are you going to do? It's very hard to estimate that value accurately. I've seen ways people try. I don't know. Most of them don't work very well. Other questions? Otherwise, I guess we're off for lunch. Yes. Otherwise, I guess we're off for lunch. Yes. And back here. Oh, we have lunch in the next room.
