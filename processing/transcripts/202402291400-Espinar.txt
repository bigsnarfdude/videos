And today I'm going to talk about a joint work with my student, Digo Marin, where we really, in an educated way, we stole beautiful ideas containing in a paper due to Virginia Gostinani, Stefano Borghini, and Lorenzo Maccieri. We borrowed those ideas in order to give Give some insight into the world or the realm of free boundary minimal surface. So, the thing that we're going to be interested in this particular equation is the eigenvalue problem in the sphere, is a domain in the sphere, where the solutions are positive, this over-determined problem. And we will see how this over-determinated problem is related to free wandering minimal surface in the world. That's the topic. Surface in the world. That's the topic that I was really interested in. So we'll see that the technique in this paper of Agostiniani, Borghini, and Marcieri can be translated to give some partial result to probably the most famous conjecture in free boundary minimal surface right now. That is the critical catenate conjecture, because it has to do with some sense with the Lawson conjecture in S3. So, the thing that we are going to be dealing with over determined program and over-determined problem in general can be rephrased in these terms, right? You have a editing equation. So, for us, it's going to have this form, Laplacian plus some function of the solution equal to zero. And we are going to impose this condition. Normally, if we only impose this condition, we will always have solutions, right? But when we impose one more condition, Right, but when we impose one more condition, there is a Newman condition and on the boundary. So, this says that probably we cannot always have a solution. And if we have, we are going to determine the topology or geometry of our domain. That is what we are interested. So, the question is, what can we say about the geometry of our domain? So, the first classical theorem in this matter is a ring, right? I mean, this matter is serene, right? Serene says that for the serene equation, when f is equal to one, and we are in a bonded domain, and the boundary condition, the Newman boundary condition is sequencing all the boundary components, then our domain have to be a bond, okay? A rotationally symmetric bond. So, in general, as I say, I'm going to be focused on positive solution. In this case, we don't have to impose the positivity. We don't have to impose the positivity because that's followed from the maximum principle. And Sering, well, this theory has two proofs that in the same year. So Serine, that he implement the moving plane method for the PD people, but for me it's the Alexandrov reflection method. So for CMC hypersurface. And the same year, Wimberger gave another beautiful proof using p function. proof using p function. So he proved that given a solution, that p function associated to the solution is superharmonic. And then he proved that the maximum is in the interior and then have to be with that condition, that pre-function has to be constant and then classify the domain as the ball. Okay, those are two methods that have been generalized in many directions around the years. years and each one has advantage and disadvantage okay so for the proving the moving plane method uh with pucci a puccian screen they they extend the method for solution of the laplacian plus f u equal to zero when the f the function is leachy okay you can run the the argument and prove that bounded domain with the same Newman condition have to be bounds Condition has to be volunteers. And then for another space form, since we are going to be talking about the sphere, so that was done by Kuma Desan and Prajapat. Sorry for my spelling. And they did it with n restriction in the hyperbolic space because the hyperbolic space is the same, topologically speaking, as the Euclidean space and in the half-speed sphere. And that's important for us. And that's important for us, the Half-Sphere, because here is the moving plane method in the Half-Sphere. You do it through, this is the dimension two, through geodesic, okay? And then, if you impose this in a hemisphere, then you can take the equator, which is contained, and then you start to rotate the equator. Okay, that's that work. And then you can start the method because one of the problems in the Alexander reflection method is to start the method. Once that you are able to start, so. You are able to start so you can run the argument. But then I change this by, I say before moving plane, and now I'm going to say geometric method, because in the last decade, following this electron reflection technique, from the theory of CMC hypersurface, the electron reflection methods have been used not only to classify topological. To classify topological sphere or compact surface, embedded surface have been used in many other ways. And I will say some works. The first one I got interested in this over-existent elliptic problem were a few words by Sibaldi Ross and Reed, where they extended, say, the theory of Kurever-Kuntemic Solomon for properly embedded CMC surface to this over-determined process. Surface to this over-determined problem. Myself, with Mao, Alberto Farina, and Laura Macet, we extended in the hyperbolic space. So, say we extended the Carmo Eschenberg theorem or Rosenberg-Langevin theorem for CMC hypersurface. In another set of ideas, is this last one? It's completely different. So, you all know that in S3, the only topological sphere Topological sphere, minimal topological sphere is the equator, right? That's due to algorithm, and there we cannot use moving plane method, right, in the great sphere. Or, say in another way, there is a famous theorem, counterpart with the Alexandro theorem in R3, that say that any topological CNC sphere in R3 have to be a Ragnar sphere. You don't need embeddedness for that. You don't need embeddedness for that. That's the Hoff theory. Okay, and Hoff proved that using the index method, the Poncare-Hoff index method. So, with Lorena Mathet, we implement that index method to over-determinality problem in order to prove that simply connected domains that support a solution to an over-determined problem in the sphere have to be appalled. So, there, we don't have to assume that. There, we don't have to assume that the solution is in a hemisphere, can be anywhere. Okay? In particular, the sering equation in the sphere for simply connected domain have to be volts. Or for the problem that we are going to talk about, that is the eigenvalue problem, also have to be both. We can use. And in the other way, the functions have been also generalized in many direction for the product of, I mean. For the product of, I mean, the product, the thing about p-functions is that you need to construct the subharmonic function. So you need to control more or less the equation in order to get the... It's not as general, in general, as the Alexandrov reflection method. But you can deal with your equation. You have some divergence form or in product manifold and so on. So you can extend the method of p-function. We're going to use both. We're going to use both here. So the second result is not general and is not true in general. And we have some contact example depending on when I say in general is when I change the condition F equal to one for a different F or if I move from the Euclidean space. So Dele and Sibaldi, they prove that the eigenvalue problem that prove that the eigenvalue problem that this one for general manifold you don't have that rigidity don't have to be geodesic both in that sense and for example if we don't assume that the solution is positive you may have domains that are not rotational symmetry supporting solution to the over-determinate problem for particular f that's true that are not rotational symmetric was done by david ruit last year in a beautiful paper In a beautiful paper. So, okay, in the case of Sering, he imposed that all the boundary, all the Newman conditions along the boundary are the same. But what happened if we don't assume that? So we know that we can construct rotationally symmetric solution on annular domains in the plane. You can do that in any dimension. And the idea is the following. And the idea is the following, or at least how I see the. So you have the first the first part, this one, that is the one associated to the simply connected domain, the ball, and that one, that is the green function. So when you sum both, you will see, and if you follow the profile of your curve, that it's going to have two points where R0, then it's positive, and you take that region where it's positive, and you do the rotation. Is positive, and you do the rotation, and you have a solution to the equation. I want you to have that in mind that you need some part as the green function, because when we will talk in this problem, we will relate to minimal surface, and for us, are going to be an end on finite total curvature, like a catalyst. The end of a catalytic is like the green function for us. So, but one thing that So, but one thing that you can see in this example is that the NUMA condition in each boundary is different and actually have to be different in one specific way. This one has to be bigger than the other, right? Because otherwise you can apply the moving plane methods. So, okay, but what do we know about the serine problem with more than one boundary component and only imposing? And only imposing that the Newman condition is constant, not necessarily the same in each boundary condition. We have now this classical theorem of the Shell and Sirakov, okay, where it's not exactly the problem that we are dealing with because in the interior component, they assume that the daily condition is a positive constant and the other is zero. Okay, and the Newman condition is relaxed. Okay, but you have to. Okay, but you have to also this result in mind because it relies in the alexander reflection method, in the moving plane method. So, okay, let's go to this beautiful paper that fortunately Lorenzo is going to speak more about later. So, consider the Sterin equation, okay, with a constant new management data. Not necessarily obvious. Not necessarily, obviously, not the same. So, they have two theorems. I mean, they have many theorems in that, but two main theorems in that paper. Okay, this one is the one that we are going to extend that say that if the solution have infinitely many maximum, then have to be rotational. That is what happened in a rotational situation, right? Because the maximum is attained in a curve, okay? So, here you can, we are going to be dealing with. We are going to be dealing with an analytic solution. So, infinitely many implies that you have a curve, right? So, for me, my solution is going to be analytic. So, it's going to be the same. So, this is the one that we are going to extend in our situation. And then this second one. And this second one is really interesting because I would like to extend this grinder situation because if I do, I can't disprove. If I do, I can't disprove the critical catenate conjecture. So, but there are few things that are subtle in the situation. So, what you do is ambification argument here, right? So, you linearize, when you linearize this equation, what you end up is the harmonic equation. But when you linearize there, it's the same equation. And in order to get a contact example for the critical catenary conjecture, when you do Critical catenary conjecture: when you do the bifurcation, you have to fix the eigenvalue, have to be two, and the boundary condition. Too many conditions, at least for me, I don't know how to do it, too many conditions in order to run the bifurcation argument. So, you can run the bifurcation argument, probably relaxing the condition on the eigenvalue, but then you are not going to get a minimal surface, or relaxing the condition on the new man value, then you are not going to get a free boundary in the. To get a free boundary in the ball, but just in two balls. That we are going to talk about that. So, even that, I will be interested to see. Excuse me, excuse me. Minimizer. You mean for this problem or for my problem? For this problem, probably Lorenzo will ask you. You will answer you better. The minimizer, I don't know. I would say that in my case, it should be the rotation, the symmetric one. But in this case, there is not a clear idea which one is the symmetric. So I cannot answer your question in this problem, in the same problem. In my problem, I can give you some insight. So the second one that we are not going to talk about. The second one that we are not going to talk about is interesting, probably for people in PD. It would be interesting to see a bifurcation argument that fix this is this one? Yeah, it's in the mission. But it can be is that if you impose some other condition, you can you can do more things. Is that because you need to control in dimension two is simpler because you need to control the set. Because you need to control the set of maximum, right? So, in dimension two, you only have dimension one, right? It's a curve. But in higher dimension, you need to control more or less the topology of the event that happened in that case. But yeah, everything is going to be in dimension two. So, this is our equation that we want to study. The eigenvalue problem for the eigenvalue equal to two. So, what we want to see is a classification of the solv a la Agostiniani Borghini material. Costignani Borghini material. So the difficulty here is that we cannot apply the moving plane method. And in order to get the idea why we cannot, think in the Clifford Rye in S3. So it's exactly the same, right? So annular domains here or with topology correspond, say, to minimal surface in S3, then you can use the moving flame method. And an observation. And an observation, that is a simple observation from the equation, is that we can construct a pre-function, right? We will use this p-function. So, our theorems say the following. Suppose that you have a over-determination solution to the eigenvalue problem where the domain is a ring shape, is an angular domain. Okay, so that is zero along the boundary, so it's digital, so it's local. Boundaries, so it's digital, so it's locally constant along the Newman condition, it's locally constant along any of the boundary components, not necessarily the same, and has infinitely many maximum points. Then it has to be a rotationally symmetric solution. Our solution are later, like this one. These are the solutions we will see now, but I want you to have this picture in mind. I will explain in a second. So the approach was. So, the approach, as I say, is based on the approach of Agostinian, Borghini, Macieri. And first, what we are going to do is to describe a one-parameter family of rotationary symmetric solutions. And that family comes from the catalog. So, given a domain that we consider a solution, we take the maximum and we consider a connected component. We consider a connected component outside the maximum, okay, the minus the maximum. And then we construct in this annular region a correspondent with a solution that is rotationally symmetric. And for me, here is the most important part of the paper is to compare both geometry. And the important part for me is the north gradient estimate. That's everything because with that, you can do. Because with that, you can do the rest. So, what they do that Lorenzo will speak, I will show you, is giving a solution, I can construct a new one, more or less, new solution. I can transplate a rotation solution to my domain and then compare the gradients. And once I do that, I can compare length, curvature, everything that I want. That's the That's the depth, and you have a lot of computation there that I'm not going to show you. And then, with those length and current estimate, we're going to see that when we have a curve of maximum, we're going to divide our analysis and one of the parts should be contained in a hemisphere and then finish using the moving flame method. So, for example, in the paper of Fagostiniani, Porghini, and Mazieri, they can relax the hypothesis. They only need that the Newman condition is constant. That the Newman condition is constant on one of the boundary components. We cannot do that because we need both components, because we don't know how where to apply the moving plane method. Even in the case, one of the, say, the exterior annulus can be solved using only a movie play method, but not the inner. But yeah, so it's in this case more subtle. More subtle in some sense. Okay, so the model solution. The model solution, we are going to parametriz our sphere in cylindrical coordinates, okay, and we describe the rotation asymmetric solution. Here we have two parameters, two free parameters, okay? One of them is this omega there, okay, and the other one is alpha here. The omega, you will see. You will see with because I will show you the catenates later on. Is that you take the catenate, the complete catenate with vertical axis? Okay, the omega is a translation in the vertical axis, and the alpha is a dilation. Our problem is invariant and the dilation, right? So that constant alpha there is taken in a way that fixes our geometric problem, okay? But you can fix whatever constant that you want there. Okay. Okay, so with that parameterization, we are going to parametrize the solution by the where is located the maximum of the solution. This R, big R here is the height in cylindrical coordinate where is the maximum of the solution. Okay, these are the solutions when you, this one is the corresponding when you take the critical. Is the corresponding when you take the critical catenoid and you do the you see the support function in the sphere? There's a picture over there I will explain in a moment. So that's the solution for the critical category in the in this setting. And these are, when you move R is how the solutions are moving. So you can parameterize this solution by the critical height, and then you go from zero, that is the critical cartenoid. Zero, that is the critical cartonoid, that is the symmetric solution, to one. You never reach one because one is where is the simply connected solution, that is the one corresponding to the height one, the height function. Okay. Okay. So in order to make a correspondent between whatever analyst that we have, solution in an analyst we have with this model solution, we define, as in the way of the paper, the In the way of the paper, the normalized world shear stress based how much is the value is the quotient of the gradient of our function along the boundary and the maximum. So observe that this is a scaling variant. That's why this scaling factor we can prescribe wherever we want to. So we compute this quantity over our annual rotational symmetric solution. Rotational isymmetic solution, and you can see that if you cut through the critical height, so you will have two sub arrows here, and one of them corresponds to one of the normalizable shear stress. That is, the top one goes from, this is the parameter r, okay, and goes from the value of the critical character in the symmetry solution to plus infinity, and the lower one goes from the, from one to the. Problem to the critical category. That this is the one corresponds to the solution. So, the first theorem that you have to prove is to, in order to classify no simply connected domain, is say that when this function or the function that we define in our analysis is less or equal than one, we are in this situation. That's the first theorem that we prove, and we follow the ideas of The ideas of Virginia, Lorenzo, and Stefano. And you can prove that if the normalized shear is less or equal than one, then you are actually in a simply contract domain, and then you are in a disk type domain. And we use for that the p function that we construct and the energy function. You have two cases that you have to deal with when the set of maximum. When the set of maximums separate, or doesn't those are the two cases that you have to you have to deal with, okay? So, once that we have this theorem at hand, so we can give a correspondence between annular domains with a rotational symmetric solution through this corresponding. Because if we define the tau tau bar, so we are going to end up in between one or plus infinity. Between one or plus infinity, because the topology is not the one of the disc, and then depending where we are, we are going to associate their radius of the part that we are in. So, and this is well defined because of the previous. So, this is the and this is the idea, okay? Here is all the all the talk is contained here. So, the thing is the following: you have your solution. Is the following? You have your solution here, okay? This is not necessarily the case. Okay, I draw in this way, but you may have the maximum set can be points, right? But this is easy. So you have your analysis here. And what you do is go from the function to the value of the function. And then what you do is take your function, take the same maximum as your rotational symmetric sample. rotational isometric sample and then go through this to the where is the value in the in the in cylindrical coordinates okay so how do we do this the implicit function theorem right so we define in one side in one side we have the rotational symmetry solution and in another one we have our solution then we do the derivative and we use the implicit function theorem and we find Theorem and we find these two functions that go from the set of zero to the maximum up to the set of values in the cylindrical coordinates. And in that way, we can construct an innovative solution in our domain. That is going to be this set of radial function, right? So, again, since I don't know in which one of the alus I am, I need to know which function. To know which function should I take, okay? But the computations are the same that you have to be careful in which one you are, but it's the same. So, okay. And now that you have you use this silver function, what you do, and here is where all the computations are made, is that you can compare the gradients of your solution with this silver radial one. And in order to do so, And in order to do so, it's a clever idea by these guys that I say the name many times already. In order to do that, what you need to control is the Haitian of this rotational solution. And you have to write the rotation in a way that the gradient doesn't appear in the denominator. That's the whole idea of all things. So once that you So, once that you do that first, then you go and you say, Okay, I'm going to compare the difference of the gradients, and I'm going to show that that difference satisfies an elit equation. It's a super solution of some operator. So, the first thing that you do is to compare the difference, but that doesn't verify or satisfy any equation. Then you put an auxiliary function, there is this beta here, that that makes. That makes that your difference satisfied an energy equation, and then you apply the maximum principle, okay, in order to get the inequality. And again, by the maximum principle, you know that at some point you have the equality, then have to be the rotational symmetric solution. So, with that, you can get Carolyn estimate and length estimates, okay? Length estimates. Okay. So the curvature estimate and length estimate follow from the Taylor expansions. Okay. You control the Taylor expansions. And to be analytic, it's important too. And you can have these two theorems of these two propositions in our case following those ideas. And this is the important thing because what we are going to prove is that with those. Prove is that with those carba sha and length estimates, when I have a solution to my problem, the car for maximum is going to be contained in one hemisphere. Then one of the part of the one of the two sub-allus that you construct is in one hemisphere, and then use the moving plane method. So, okay, so this is the result. So, suppose that you have a solution. Result: So, suppose that you have a solution in an annular domain to the eigenvalue problem, so that has infinitely many maximum points. In particular, singular analytic does say that it contains a curve, okay? This curve have to separate the boundary, right? That's clear by the maximum principle, have to be in the fundamental group of your arms, in no other way. So, okay, so what do we do? So, what do we do? We have this curve, and we are going to separate our anulus into two anulus. Okay? And now we are going to use the previous theorem. We are going to, at each one, we are going to associate a model solution. With a model solution, we are going to get the carbacha and length estimate that we proved before. And what we show is that for any component that we Component that we have in our annulus, in this, when we separate through the carbon maximum, we will have this length estimate for each boundary component. And then, with that length estimate for the boundary component, we can get a length estimate for the curve of maximum. Okay, that is that one. But then this shows that the length is less or equal than 2π. To be less or equal than 2π in the sphere implies that either you are an equator or you are containing an equator. If you are in an equator, if you are an equator, then the Kochiko-Valecki theorem tells you that you have to be rotationally symmetric and actually you have to be the critical catenoid, you have to be the solution of the critical catenoid. Or in the other case, any of the two components. Other case, any of the two components must be contained in a hemisphere. So, in that case, we finish using the moving plane method that has to be rotationally symmetric. So, that's how it works, the proof. That's why we cannot skip any of the condition of the boundary component. We cannot say only one boundary component, the Newman condition, is constant and the other is not, because we don't know which one is in a hemisphere. Okay, we need both conditions. Okay, we need both conditions. Okay, now let's go to pre-boundary minimal surface. And we are going to give a definition more general than the usual one. Usually, when we say free boundary, we say in the board. All the boundary components are contained in the board. I'm going to allow that the boundary components are contained in two different Are containing two different spheres, but both spheres center at the same point, say the origin. Okay, that's what we say free boundaries. And our geometric situation is this one, is the other one. We don't allow this situation here that our analysis is intersecting one of the balls from the exterior, always from the interior. Always from the interior, okay? And these come from the catenoids, the model catenoids, right? So that's what's going to happen in the model catenates. But this is the kind of free boundary problem that we have. The critical catenoid is when both spheres are the same, right? So, okay. Now consider a catenoid in cylindrical coordinates. A catenoid in cylindrical coordinates, you can write down the catenoids specifically in that form. Recall the two parameters that we had for our family: the omega and the alpha. The omega is a translation in the C-axis. So, what you only are doing is that you take the usual critical category, set the origin, and you translate up or down. And then alpha is the scale. So, you can write down explicitly the normal. And the normal, you can see there is a parameterization of the whole sphere. So, this is the situation there: it runs through the whole sphere minus the north and the south point, where is the end of the catalog, right? And then you can write out explicitly the support function. The support function is nothing but the product of the position vector and the normal. And the support function is well. And the support function is well known in minimal summary that satisfy the eigenvalue equation. Satisfy the Laplacian u plus 2u. In the spherical metric, the third fundamental form is the metric that is induced from the sphere, satisfy that equation. Because what is really, if you see the support function from the point of view of the free boundary of the minimal surface side, where it satisfies is a Jacobi equation. It's a Jacobi equation. It's Laplacian of U plus. equation is laplacian of u plus second fundamental form u equal to zero when you transplantate that into the into the sphere is that equation so and we are going to get the part of the catenoids like in the our solution our model solution here and they are going to have this three boundary condition and they look like that in the here we have the the critical cat Here we have the critical catenate when the two spheres are the same. And here we have a model when the critical height is different, is one half. And the biggest sphere is the sphere of one. The other one is smaller. We can always do a scaling so that the other sphere is the sphere of reduced one and the other one is going to be smaller. Okay. So that thing you can do geometrically, right? So you take any two. Right, so you take any two spheres, where one is the sphere of radius one, the other one is any other sphere of small radius. You can always translate and scale the catenoid in order to have a solution like that. And the solution, as I say, come from the interior. And is we know in minimal actually, okay, this is explicitly stated in. Okay, this is explicitly stated in this paper of Swan, but this is way older, comes from the 60s. And it's well known that when the Gauss map is a local diffuse, then you can parametrize your surface by the Gauss map. This is due to the solution to the Christopher problem, in FIRE, and it's very well known. But in the case that the Gauss mass map is injected, which is a local diffuse, you can do this locally. You can do this locally. Then, when you are in the minimal, in the minimal case, you can write down the second fundamental form in this term is the Haitian plus the identity of the satrix in general. And then, when it's minimal, implies that equation that means. Now, the free boundary condition is there. This is to be minimal, the first equation. The second equation is to be free boundary. is to be free boundary is like because this is the support function the support function is the product between the position vector and the normal and be free boundary in the sphere implies that the normal and the position vector are orthogonal so it's zero and this condition here is where is your sphere the radius of the sphere that's the from the point of view of minimal surface okay we can use that but our problem is to know when the gun Is to know when the Gauss map is a global diffusion in order to have a well-defined solution in a real domain. Right? So, okay, the theorem that we prove in descent is the following, that suppose that you have an embedded minimum alloy with three boundaries, probably in two different spheres, centered at the origin, and the boundary, one of them, is in the sphere of reduced one. That's not important. One. That's not important because we can always achieve this by scaling. And the other one is a smaller issue. And suppose that the support function, the support function has infinitely many critical points. Critical point, we don't ask for maximum point, that's important. Then have to be a rotational catalog on part of this model rotational catalog. So in particular, if you go to free boundary. If you go to free boundary minimal surface, both boundaries in the same sphere, the only possibility, the only rotational example is the critical character. If you have an infinite number of critical points of the support function or the distance function is the same, then you can classify the critical capital. It's important, this is the first theorem that don't use the classification of the critical category by the first steck of eigenvalue. The first stake of eigenvalue by Fraser Shea. Okay, all the other results, they have many results of that. Kuzn McGraff, McGraff, Seo, with there is only one that doesn't use is Lucas Ambrosio, Evaldo Lunes, that they use an idea of Antonio Rufus. That is when you have a gap in the second fundamental form, but all the symmetric The symmetric with symmetric conditions, say one plane of symmetry, three planes, antipodal symmetry, all of them reduce to the classification result of Reservation. But this is not. Okay. So in order to prove that theorem, what we have to prove is that we have a well-defined solution in the sphere. So what do we do? Suppose that we are in this situation. Suppose that we are in this situation, right? We have this pre-boundary minimal arrows. Suppose that it's the same sphere, okay? It's the same. And I have an infinite number of critical points. So since I have an infinite number, it's analytic, I have a curve. I can have many other things, but at least I have one curve. And these curves have to be in the fundamental group of the atoms. It cannot be in another way. That's easy to. Otherwise, that's easy to prove. So, the first thing that you have to know is that the index theorem tells you that the free boundary minimal doesn't have any umbilic point. So, that implies that the Gauss map is a local diffuse for every point. So, once that you have that, a simple topological argument, because that condition, the Gaussian curves that tell you that these curves here are convex, that tell you that the Gauss map is. That tells you that the Gauss map is a global diffusion onto the image. So you have a one-to-one correspondence between the analysis and your spherical domain through the Gauss map. Then you can transplantate the support function to your domain. And then, as we saw by the Resolus 1, satisfy the eigenvalue problem. U equal to zero follow from the free boundary. Follow from the free boundary condition and is constant in both components because of the is in this that in this situation is in the same sphere. But if you have two spheres, that will say that in one boundary component is one constant and in the other is another constant. Now critical points correspond to critical points, right? This is the critical point. And now one thing that we know for embedded free wandering minimal surface of genus zero is that they are. surface of genus zero is that they are star shaped okay that's not easy to prove it's not it's not hard to prove and even you can prove more in that in the when it's analogous that is stable have to be stable stability implies that support function is positive with that orientation that's why i get this orientation with this orientation the support function is positive then this guy here is going to be positive we are in the situation and now And now, and that's kind of more tricky. We need to use, I don't know how to do that from the PDE point of view. So I need to prove this result. Say the set of critical points have to correspond to the set of maximum. And actually, there is only one curve, cannot be one. And the idea is the following. If you are in this situation, a critical point corresponds where the position vector is equal to the normal. So So that says that if you take the radial projection and the Gauss map, this curve is the same curve. Okay? But the radial projection will take the upper domain of this, when you separate this annulus by this curve, will take this upper domain to the upper side, but the gauge map to the lower side. To the lower side. So there are no other points where it can correspond, can correspond the Rayer projection and the Gauss map. And that tells you that the only situation, one that you have one curve of critical point, this is the only situation that you can have. You can have any other critical point in your domain because the radio graph tells you that this domain goes into one part and the Goes into one part and the normal takes you into the other. So the components are disjoint, and you cannot have any other critical point. And once that you are in this situation, now you have a solution which is positive because it's stable. You have this over-determinated solution, and you have a curve of maximum points. You don't have to be maximum, cannot be any other thing. Then you apply the previous result. Then you apply the previous result and have to be noticed. And this finishes the proof. This is everything. Thank you for your attention.
