I continue. Let me recall, we stopped here, so I explained what is topological recursion, and I introduced the notion of xy-swap duality. And this x-swap duality motivates actually the definition of generalized topological recursion. And this is what. And this is what is missing in my talk. The actual definition of topological recursion, generalized topological recursion was still missing. And as you remember, it's very different in its form from the original in R-Runten recursion. And so it's really not obvious at all that in a non-regenerated case, it's actually equivalent to the original recovery. Actually, it equivalent to the original recursion. And this and why it's true, I will explain today. And if the time will left, then I will discuss also some generalization, some extension of XY swap, which is called so-called symplectic duality. And in particular, the closed formulas for the Bush-Arina recursion is better to treat in terms of the symplectic duality transformation. This symplectic dual AC transformation rather than xy swap. Okay, let me recall what we have for xy swap. We have a system of differentials and we would like to define a new system of differentials. And this transformation is called XY swap and it has, how to say, three levels of possible interpretation. On the first level, we On the first level, we discuss, we consider everything expanded at one point. So, this transformation X on formal power series. And on the first, we consider a nice point, which is the point where both X and Y possess logarithmic singularities. So, a generic spectral curve does not have such a point, but however, Not have such a point, but however, let's let's assume that it does exist. So we consider everything expanded at this nice point, and in particular, we can to this expansion, we can associate the corresponding potential associated with the expansion to this point in the suitable local coordinates. And for the local coordinates, we take the exponent of x and exponent of y. And first of all, we on the first level, we define how the Define how the xy swap acts on the corresponding partition functions. And then it's realized just by one linear operator, which is the exponent of the standard cut and join operator. So if you just consider the corresponding partition function, that we have just introduced one linear operator, and that's all. Then Then we start with this definition and we check how the same transformation acts on the corresponding endpoint differentials. And it's realized by certain transformation, which now acts on corresponding differentials. But still, when I write them as vacuum expectations. As vacuum expectation values of some operators, it means that I still consider them as a formal power series expanded at the latest point. So we have some computation which involves some expectation values of some operators applied to the original partition function. So for regional differentials, these are Differentials, these are loop insertion operators, or extended loop insertion operators, which involve both positive and negative J operators. And the same we have for the dual side, but for the dual partition function, and it means that in terms of the original partition function, we just conjugate with this exponent of Q. And on the intermediate step, we On the intermediate step, we consider the same similar connected correlators with the insertion of universal bosonic operators. And so we realize this transformation in two steps. On the first step, we pass from this to this one, and this is given by summation over graphs, and this is explained by And this is explained by the explicit bosonic formula for this universal bosonic operator. And on the second step, we pass from this to that one. And essentially, it's given by a replacement of the insertion of u parameters by the corresponding partial derivatives with respect to y. And this part is proved by computations in the Lie algebra. Lie algebra J infinity directly, which is defined by the action of this universal bosonic operator. And then it proves out that these transformations could be extended globally to the in the setting of global rational curves, and we obtain the corresponding expression now in this clause. Now, in this closed form, which has no reference to expansion point, and even an existence of the nice point is not important. This transformation acts now on global meromorphic differentials. And again, it's realized in two steps. The first step we sum up over the set of hypergraphs. The set of hypergraphs. The contribution of hyper edges is just certain modification of the original differentials. And then again, this sum over hypergraphs contains some extra parameters u1, um. And on the second step, we replace the monomials in these u coordinates by the corresponding partial. By the corresponding partial derivatives with respect to y. So, this is how it works. And after my tomorrow talk, several people approached me, asked whether there are some interesting examples when we have something non-trivial on both sides of xy swap. Because in most cases, we apply this on the other side of this x-y swap. Of this xy swope, the topological recursion is trivial, and then we can write the closed formula for the original differentials. So, let me show you one of such examples. So, consider this spectral curve, it has a meaning that if you take these corresponding topological requirements. This corresponding topological recursion has enumerative meaning. The coefficients of these endpoint functions are expressed in terms of intersection numbers on modulus spaces of R-spin structures with respect to Schotten class, which are called omega classes or Kyoda classes. And I will not go into details how what is the interpretation of this of these numbers. You better ask Danila for the details. But just this is the answer. So I just ensure you that this spectral curve, the topological recursion for this spectral curve, has a definite numerative meaning. So, the result is very nice, but I would like to see how it works. What is the result of this topological recursion? So, notice that in this case, X has non-degenerate critical points. This is differential of X. It has critical points, which are roots, R roots of one of R. And all of them are known to rate. All of them are non-degreted, so we start the usual Chekhov-Renar-Rantan topological recursion. It's well defined, and I would like to apply this in practice. How to compute this in practice? So, in order to apply this recursion, we need to locate positions of zeros. Then, we take all these R zeros of dx. At each point, we should compute. Point, we should compute the corresponding deck transformations and volution of the deck transformation that applies this relations of in R and M. And this is not so easy because you see this computation would involve algebraic numbers, finding roots of algebraic numbers. Some we should go into complex domain, and this is strange because the And this is strange because the final answer is rational. The corresponding intersection numbers, all intersection numbers we are interested in, are rational. So this not so easy to apply this in practice in the very simple cases. So let's do the following. Let's go to the on, let's look at the dual side of this transformation. Let's switch the role of x and y. Switch the role of x and y and go to the dual recursion. Then we observe that on the dual recursion, the corresponding y function, which becomes x on the dual side, is just monomial in s. It means that it has a single critical point, the origin, which is a degenerate one. So, on the other side of recursion, we have just a single special point. Special point. It means that the corresponding differentials, the corresponding endpoint functions, will have only one hole at the origin, and which is much more simpler. And this recursion is still, even if s equal to two, it's not the same as the usual, we cannot apply the usual standard equation because y has logarithmic singularity at the Logarithmic singularity at the origin. So, in any case, for any value of S, it's neither Chehov-Hernar-Rante, neither Boucher-Renar. Both are not applicable because the second function has logarithmic singularity. So, the only way to understand this recursion is just to apply the generalized topological recursion. And this is nice because we start with a problem which doesn't. We start with a problem which does not know anything about the existence of generalized recursion. But to solve this, as an intermediate step, we apply just generalized recursion that I'm going still to, I promise still to define. So we start. Fortunately, I have implemented this generalized topological recursion and I may compute this. And this is algebraic. I do not need, for instance, to study deck transformations of the. Deck transformations of this function z to the power s. So all computations involve only rationals. So I get the answer. This is the starting differentials. They are not so complicated because they have only poles at the origin. So these corresponding Kenpo functions are Laurent polynomials. Functions of Laurent polynomials, or to be precisely the polynomials in the inverse Zi's. And then I can apply just directly the XY swap. The formulas. Why simple? Well, this is just kind of Lorentz polynomials in inverse power sub z. What do you mean? I'm just asking like, so yeah, how do I get the omega d and checks from h of R? Yeah, yeah. Okay. And then we apply the formulas for XY swap, and the formulas become much more complicated because they involve, these are results of the usual check-Fernard-Warantin recursion for the regional spectral curve. You see that the You see that the denominator corresponds to the zeros of dx. So we have poles at these zeros of dx. For omega zero three, these are poles of order one. For not omega h, the endpoint function, the differentials have poles of order two. You should differentiate with respect to each of the arguments. H11 has poles of order three because you should differentiate. Because you should differentiate once with respect to Excel. This makes the pole of order 3. And for instance, for two points of genus 1, the answer is as follows. We have pulse of order and this five-order poles again we start with something which has poles of order one and then we Has pulse of further one and then apply I wrote d over dy, it should be d over dx. Sorry, it's it's misprint. We apply d over dx several times, and each time when we apply d over dx, the order of poll increases by two. So the actual answer occupies too much space. So I represent the answer in this form. In this form. So it involves actually the corresponding endpoint function is spent by the functions which are obtained from the original one with the poll of order one. And then we apply several times d over dx operator. And this is encoded in the insertion of u parameters here. And so, of course, the computer allows one to compute much further and much more correlators, and they occupy several pages of output. And to get the same answer by implying directly the original recursion to the spectral curve is not so easy. So, this is an example of application of this xy swap and generalized. XY swap and generalized TR directly for the computation of for the problem which does not know the existence of these objects. Okay, so let me still finally define the generalized topological recursion. The formalized ideas, already I explained the ideas, but now in order to realize this idea, let me consider a simplified version. Me consider a simplified version of this diagram where we do the same trick only with one of the J operators. So we consider correlator functions which involve several J operators and one of them is distinguished and denoted by the corresponding The corresponding argument with index n, I denoted this without indices. And then we consider two other correlators of the same sort when this J of X is replaced either by the universal bosonic operator or by this GFAT. So we comparing with the comparing with uh comparing with this diagram we we keep the standard the original j of x operators in all the places and we replace just in one place by the corresponding by the by the new uh version of this uh Version of this J operator of the loop insertion operator. And this is a, I would call it the partial XY swap. So we apply XY swap transformation only to one of the possible arguments. Then again, it happens that all these objects appearing of this diagram, they originally defined in the power expansion at the special point at the At the special point, at the not special, at the nice point. But then, by the same reason, it could be extended to the global differential objects and we can compute this transformation just in two steps. This one involves certain combinatorics obtained by the very form of the bosonic operators, and this one is obtained by replacing monomials in U by. Replacing monomials in U by the partial derivatives, but now we have only one u parameter. So this situation is much more simpler. And this object that we obtained as a result of this transformation, I call it partially x, y swap u, that it has n arguments, but the first n minus one arguments are corresponds to the original side of xy duality. side of x y duality and only the last nth argument belongs to the other side of x y duality and one go one can go in the adverse direction and one can show that this one could be expressed in terms of the either original or dual or dual differentials in the closed form. In particular, it follows that if you impose the condition If we impose the condition that these differentials are regular with respect to this distinguished coordinate, it's the same as we impose the same condition on the set of all dual differentials. So my definition of our definition of generalized positive recursion is that this omega n minus 1, 1 is holomorphic with respect to the last coordinate. With respect to the last coordinate at the case special point. And this would imply automatically that all dual differentials are homomorphic at this point. So now let's show how this works in the global setting. And this is essentially leads to the definition of XY slow, of generalized topological recursion. So again, the So again, the first step is combinatorial. We express this curly W in terms of the original original differentials, but now the summation over graphs is replaced by something simpler, summation over all set partitions. And the corresponding partition of a set is described by the contribution, the contribution of one of the of this part of the Part of this set partition is computed as follows. We consider original endpoint differentials and this original endpoint differentials has n minus one coordinates that we are do not touch and then it has one distinguished coordinate and we replace this distinguished coordinate but but k new K new auxiliary coordinates, and then we apply this differential operator to these auxiliary coordinates and restrict everything to the diagonal. And this is the contribution of this curly W. And then, as usually, we replace the appearance of monomial in U by the partial derivative respect of y. So, this is a definition of this. Of these new objects, and all these formulas work in the rational setting, in the global Meromorphic setting. And then if you look carefully what is written here, we sum up over all non-negative integers corresponding to all possible monomials in U. And there is a sum corresponding to. There is a sum corresponding to r equal to zero, and this is like the original end-point differentials with up to a sign. And the tail of this sum, which contains, which corresponds to all other values of R, proved to involve the original differentials with smaller indices of g and m. G and L, this could be double script, which are already considered as computed on the previous steps of recursion. And so this is finally the definition of generalized topological recursion. So we instead of the formula for the Chechov Edara Rantan recursion, we apply this. Runten recursion, we apply this one. So we consider this curly W and apply this transformation, but for the indices, all indices except R equal to zero. So all summons in this expression for a positive value of R involve only those differentials which are already computed in the previous steps of computations. Steps of computations. And we just drop the sum and corresponding to r equal to zero, which corresponds to the original endpoint differential. So this one. And so it happens that if you apply this transformation, that it means that if you remember, we take this differential, then take this this differential then we consider we pick only polar part of this differential and use this polar part to glue to glue the new differentials of the of the of the next step of topological recursion so our condition that these differentials have the same polar part of as those that we are trying to compute means that That we are trying to compute means that the left-hand side is holomorphic. So, the definition of generalized topological recursion provided by this expression is equivalent to the requirement that these differentials are holomorphic. So, this is once again, so this is a this one is given by an explicit expression. expression is computed from the previously computed previous differentials and the requirement that this one and that one have the same polar part at the k-special point is equivalent that to the fact that this one is holomorphic and this is equivalent that the dual differentials are holomorphic and the same argument arguments applied No, I I consider the dual topological the dual cycle yes yes yes this is what I mean that the let me consider the same the same generalized topological recursions recursion on Recursion on the other side of duality for the dual differentials, for the dual spectral curve data. So let's consider now non-case special points, the case special of the dual side of duality. By the same reason, apply it to the other side of the Ah, this one dual K is this should be checked. Yeah, yeah. Ah, thank you, Sienki. Yeah, you're right. This should be checked. Ah, yes, you're right. Yeah, this should be holomorphic. Yeah, but if you consider points which are not case special, then the Points which are not case special, then the original differentials are holomorphic. And this means that, by the way, definition that these are holomorphic, it means that the corresponding dual differentials satisfied the same relations on the dual side of x, y, swap duality. And so the If I put here n minus one comma one checked, which is which is different, which is I would from the on the original side, it would correspond to omega one n minus one, something like that. Okay, so anyway, this provides the by diff so we obtained that by the very construction, this definition of generalized topological recursion is compatible with xy swap. So finally, on the third lecture, I was On the third lecture, I was able to give the definition of the new version of the topological recursion. So, this is the new definition, the new form of topological recursion. So, you see, it doesn't look similar to the Cheche-Fernar-Rantan recursion, neither Boucher-Renar-Rantan recursion. Error and ed recursion because it does not involve any information on the ramification, any information on the deck transformation. It's purely algebraic. And the corresponding left-hand side extends as a global Meromorphic differential with respect to this distinguished coordinate. And And really, it looks strange that it's compatible with the original recursion. So, let me now discuss how this is related to the original Check-Fernarrant recursion in the non-degenerate case. So, let me switch to this question. So, let me recall the original. The original check of Henarante recursion is given by explicit formulas for the contribution to the poles of the differentials. And this, so essentially, we should impose certain conditions on the principal part of the poles. And then we compute on the first step, we compute the principal part of the poles and then glue them together. Poles and then glue them together by the projection operator. And this condition on the principal part of the poles could be equally refibrillated in terms of the so-called loop loop equations. So loop equations say that if you take this combination, so we consider the setting of the original Czech Vernon-Ronden recursion. We have a critical, simple critical points of X, that is. Critical points of x, that is simple zero of dx, and we impose certain conditions on the principal part of the pole at such a point. The first one says that the original differentials, the differential the principal part of the pole is odd with respect to involution. So if you symmetrize this differential with respect to involution, the result is. To involution, the result is holomorphic. So this impose certain conditions of the principal part of the pole and say that the principal part of the pole is holomorphic. And the second equation, which is called quadratic loop equation, which is actually a reformulation of the recursion step, says that this combination of differentials is also holomorphic. So So in the brackets, we have an expression which is quadratic differential with respect to coordinate z. And then we divide by dx and we obtain the usual differential. And we require that it is holomorphic. One could consider instead the original expressions in the bracket and it should be holomorphic and has zero at the origin, but zero at the origin, but equivalently we could divide by dx, dx is symmetric, and the result should be holomorphic. So both equations impose conditions on the polar part of the omega only, and they identify the polar part of omega uniquely. So these conditions are just a different form of the original Check-Fernarrow and 10 recursion. Original checkfener and 10 recursion. And the difference here is that I include to this sum only also 0, 1 summons. And the omega n appears in this sum just when one of these two g and j, g and this differential are zero. 0, 1 on one factor and Gn on the other factor. And then we can extract the summant and obtain the recursion, the original form of the error or an 10. But I would like to get rid of this deck transformation and then I prefer to formulate. I prefer to formulate this linear and quadratic equations in a slightly different form. So let's just remove the vector summation from the previous equations. So we obtain expressions of this sort. And then we obtain differentials which are not holomorphic anymore. But But we, if you look at this of this differential, we instead of homomorphicity and property, we just look at the polar part and require that this polar part should be odd with respect to involution and is an even part of this differential should be zero. And the same for the second for the quadratic equation. So we instead of asking whether it is. Asking whether it is holomorphic, we require that it is just should be its even part with respect to sigma should be zero. We impose conditions only on the even part of the corresponding polar singularities. So that I will formulate now the loop equations in the following way. We consider these combinations of differentials and we require that the We require that the result is not necessarily homorphic, but the polar part should be odd with respect to involution sigma. So up to this point, there is nothing new, but what you see in the notation, this in the notation, I involve this curly W that appeared in the definition. That appeared in the definition of generalized topological recursion. And it happens that these linear and quadratic loop equations extend in a similar way to higher loop equations which hold automatically. So once again, consider this curly W and this is a series in U and U parameters. u and u parameter and happens it happens that if you pick just any coefficient of any power of u that it has the same property that its polar part is odd with respect to deck transformation so the this is a formulation of the high loop equation for the original check-fernar and ten recursion so the the theorem claimed that the we The topological recursion itself requires only as a linear and quadratic part, linear and quadratic corresponding to k equal to zero and one, and all higher loop equations then satisfied automatically. And it proves out that almost the same holds in, so this is the form, the form The form of compatibility that I would like to prove. So, I would like to prove this form of loop equations for the generalized topological recursion. Actually, the same holds in slightly more general setting, in the setting of Boucher-Renar. So, consider, assume that X has a ramification of order R and Y is non-zero. And y is non-zero and holomorphic. So this exponent RS such that R is positive and S is equal to 1. So you consider the original setting of Boucher-NR. And then it happens that the same sequence of loop equations hold in this case as well. So we should understand what is the rep. Understand what is the replacement of the requirement of odd polar part and the adrenal setting. So we consider the space of Meromorphic differentials, which is spent by differentials of this sort. So we start with a holomorphic one and then apply d over dx operator several times and everything that we can spend. And everything that we can spend in this way is what is denoted by this ψ. So the xi is some subspace of Meromorphic germs, of Meromorphic differentials at this point, which certain restriction on the polar part of this differential. It has several equivalent descriptions. Several equivalent descriptions. For instance, one of them is that if you take the corresponding, if you consider X as a degree R covering and consider the push forward, then this push forward of a differential form should be holomorphic. Or if you expand, if you consider a local coordinate such that x is just exponent of this coordinate, then This coordinate, then these differentials expanded in the Laurent series, all the terms with the exponent negative of x multiple r should be vanishing, should be missing in this expansion. And it proves out that these all these All these components of this curly W belong to this space. This is just, I consider this with respect to this distinguished variable and all the other variables surface parameters. And this is the form of the loop. And this is the form of the loop equation that I would like to prove. And for r equal to 2, and r equal to 2, k equal to 0 and 1 is the standard linear and quadratic loop equations. For k greater than 2, these are higher loop equations that call automatically. And it proves out that in the case of in the setting of Boucher-Renar, in the same way, In the same way, if you just check, assume that all previous differentials are already computed, and we would like to understand what conditions are imposed on the differentials, on GM differential. And that it proves out that because of this factor, that if you take just, if you assume that y is non-deletable. That y is non-degenerate, the linear part of y is non-vanishing, then the first k equations determine the principal part of the polyunequally. So the first actually it's actually essentially sufficient to impose this condition on the first K loop equa uh on the first uh R loop equations. And again the all the higher loop equations are satisfied automatically. Are satisfied automatically. So, this is the form of the loop equations that I would like to prove for the static of generalized topological recursion. And let me comment a little bit this. Actually, these loop equations, when you translate this to the language of the corresponding local potential, turns into a system of partial differential equations, which is usually. Equations, which is usually called W algebra. So the original linear and quadratic loop equations or Boucher-Renar relations for the setting of Boucharinard, also reformulated in terms of the corresponding potential, means certain system of partial differential equations called W algebra. And this is And this is also, this sort of loop equations also produce some W algebra. These equations reformulated in terms of the potential produce certain W algebra. And this theorem claims that this W algebra produce the same differential equations equivalent to those of the Boucher-Renar case. Of the Boucher-Rinard case. But this one has an advantage that all these operators of this W algebra belong to GL infinity of Kp symmetries. So these loop equations are automatically compatible with the Kp integrability. So you use a different set of W algebras. W algebras and what's very hard to compare with scampi integrability. But this one is already implemented. There is nothing to prove this. These are on the language of, for instance, for monomial spectral curved data, these are cash-schwarz operators, standard cash-schwarz operators of Qp tau functions. Well, just yeah, yeah, okay, but this is just remark aside. Everything related to KP integrability will be discussed in the talk of Sasha. Yeah, yeah, this is for the spectral care for genus zero, yeah. Yeah. This is I cannot, this is what I do not understand completely, but it corresponds to certain kind of Hurricane equations which are not exactly of Kp hierarchy. Yeah, the skepiti de grability holds only if the spectral curve is rational. No, no, loop equations hold in general. But this loop equations hold, it's a local condition, it holds independently of anything. So, this is the form of compatibility that Of compatibility that I would like to prove. And again, the proof. So what I need to prove, this curly W is the part of the definition of generalized topological recursion. And I would like to understand to prove that this all components of this curly W. components of this curly W can be obtained, can be spent by by can be spent by the differentials of this form. So I start with something which is holomorphic and apply d over dx several times. But all my formulas have this kind of expression. So this let's consider this diagram. Let's consider this diagram. So, this part of the diagram, everything corresponds to the expansion at the nice point. So, this part of the diagram corresponds to the definition of the generalized topological recursion. So, I compute this part of the diagram using this formula, this expansion, and I require that this one is holomorphic. One is holomorphic, holomorphic with respect to this distinguished coordinate. But I could apply similar things on the other side of xy duality. So let me go in the inverse direction. And then it proves out that if you go in the inverse direction, you can express this. Express these differentials these differentials sorry so what are objects here so the original one involves J of X insertions this on this on these differentials I replace just one J of X by the corresponding JFET of X Of X, J fet of X. And here I insert instead the universal bosonic operator. But let's compare with a similar differential, which involves universal bosonic operator on the other side of recursor that's conjugated by this exponent of Q. And then we can go in the inverse direction and the corresponding And the corresponding expression of these differential terms of that one involves combinatorics, which expresses this one in terms of that one. And then we apply a similar transformation, which involves appearance of the additional parameter by the derivative with respect to x. But it happens then that actually these two versions of the extender. Versions of the extended curly W are related directly by similar transformations, which avoids the contribution of combinatorics. So we just apply a similar formula with just exponent of the additional parameter involved. Involved. So I claim that all the objects in this diagram extend to as a global meromorphic objects on the corresponding spectral curve. And moreover, they satisfy this kind of extended identities. And the very form of this identity says that we start with something which is holomorphic and then apply d or dx several times. So the very form. dx several times. So the very form of this identity implies that this curly w belongs to this space of meromorphic forms that I denote by xi. So essentially, there is nothing to prove for the loop equations. We just, it's the very form of this identity implies this fact. But what is strange that this identity actually all the objects of this diagram Of this diagram extend globally, and all this formulas work has a setting, has explicit combinatorial expressions applied to global Meromorphic objects. But it's strangely enough that the only way how we can prove this identity is just apply these computations in the corresponding Fox spaces. In the corresponding fork spaces, the power expansion is a special point. So, this diagram is not only the motivation for this expression, but the only way how we can prove it. Oh, nice point, nice point. So, yeah, th this computation requires the existence of nice points. Requires the existence of a nice point. Nice point, yeah. If it does not exist, then I should apply certain kind of perturbation arguments. I perturb the original spectral curve data, and this requires some additional technical arguments. But the identity itself is valid for global rational. For global rational functions and doesn't know about the existence of this nice point. Well, I checked this identity by computer by formal manipulating with formal differential expressions. It really holds, but we have no combinatorial proof of that one. So the very form of this identity. The very form of this identity implies the loop equations, but the identity itself is some complicated combinatorial identity for which we have no combinatorial proof. So, our arguments involve these computations in the Fox space. It's really strange. Okay, this proves the compatibility with Chehovinarontan recursion and even with Busharinara recursion in this very original setting when the y is Y is non-zero. Probably it's too late to start the discussion of the symplectic duality, but let me just probably, I will not provide, I will not discuss the details. Let me just discuss what is symplectic duality about. This is not this is not studied in details. It happens that. Details. It happens that if you look, if you look at the singularities of this curly W, a part of the singularities come from the derivatives with respect to X and Y, and they come from the critical when X or Y has critical points. But there is also a contribution of 0, 1, 0, 1 differentials, which involve. Differentials which involve y in the denominator, is in the numerator. And its contribution is we still didn't study carefully. So some kind of loop equations hold, but for instance, if you remember in the BGW case, if you just write the usual loop equations, you should skip the skip the the the first with the the first one corresponding to the index zero so so some kind some loop equations called in the modern setting but but how they should become formulated it's not clear yet okay so okay let's consider again the nice point let's consider the nice point Let's consider the nice point and let's consider by the this action of this operator this operator on the corresponding partition functions then you we assume that the original partition function admits the genus expansion and then when you apply And then, when you apply this transformation, it does not obvious at all that on the other side, the result that we obtain after applying this transformation also admits a genus expansion. But it happens that these differentials admit the genus expansion automatically. And in particular, we can extract its part of genus zero and zero one. And 0, 1 part. So I mean that the 0, 1 part of this potential is automatically determined by the original partition function. And then this 0, 1 part of the resulting differential exactly corresponds to the 0, 1 differential on the other side of the Differential on the other side of duality, y dx. So I mean that, what I mean, that the change of coordinates, the role of swap of y and x, is somehow contained already in this operator. But now let's consider the same diagram, but let's put here some other operators from this G L infinity. G L infinity. Then again, we obtain a certain transformation, and if we choose this operator good enough, then the corresponding transformation again has genus expansion. 0, 1 term is also 0, 1 term is. 0, 1 term is also determined uniquely by the transformation, and this implies the corresponding spectral curved data on the other side of duality. So let me just write the formulas. So assume that Q is a corresponds to diagonal operator. Diagonal operator were in the in this case dec is quadratic with respect to k but instead let's consider decay defined by the following way in the following way Verpsi is a gener is some formal series. So, in this case, so in the in the setting of xy swap Psi is equal to psi of theta is equal to just theta, but we replace this by an arbitrary formal series. Then we have that if the original the original Zero one differentials has the form I write it in the fur x is a logarithm of y, then this would apply that. That omega 01 check will be of different form, will be y, the same y times dy over y, where this y is equal to x times exponent of minus psi of y small. Small. So, this it means that this transformation requires the change of coordinates. So, we have both local change of coordinates is somehow implemented to this the form of this operator. So, the the statement is as follows. So, As follows. So we have some explicit global explicit transformation starting from the original system of differentials. As a result, we obtain a new one. Well, let me call it Let me call it also this way, but this is not xy swap such that here omega 01 is y dx over x and here omega 01 is the same y by the different d x check by x check probably. So we have we produce in this way by this transformation we produce both we produce both a new system of differentials and also a new coordinate and new spectral curve data. And if ψ is good enough, for instance, rational or polynomial or not so complicated, that it happens that this transformation preserves also topological recursion. So this is applied as follows. So we are given certain system of spectral curve data for which we know that the For which we know the topological recursion. And this procedure provides a new system of differentials for a new set of spectral curve data. And again, we can compute this topological recursion without just explicitly if you know this one. So, in most cases, we apply this to the situation to the situation where The situation when the topological recursion is on one of the two sides is trivial. For instance, consider the following one. So we have x is equal to what is the x is a is what do you mean. Uh what do you mean so uh z times exponent of psi of some function and y is just this function of z. Of z times x of z. So assume that our spectral curved data can be represented in this form. Then on the other side of this simple active duality, we have trivial recursion, and so we can explain, apply these explicit formulas. But But on the other side, on the other side, this spectral curve data is compatible with Boucher-Renard recursion. So if you vary psi and vary theta, then the limits are compatible with Boucher-Renar. On the other side, it's given by explicit formula of this symplectic duality. And this is this way we obtain the differentials of Boucharinar differentials. Okay, something like that. Okay, something like that. Yeah, thank you.
