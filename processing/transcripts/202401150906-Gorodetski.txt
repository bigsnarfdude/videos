For doing that and for inviting me. So, what I'm going to do, I'm going to first of all write the formula that I'm sure will appear here many, many times. So, what I'm going to do, I'm going to consider the description recorder. And by going to And we're going to ask the questions about the spectral properties of the superior. The two main questions that people usually ask are the questions about the spectral type. So is it, I'm almost sure, or similar continuous or Q-point spectrum? Do we have exponential decaying eigenfunctions? Do we have dynamical localization? All that. And the second question is. And then the second question is a question about the topological structure of the spectrum. Is it an interval? Is it a finite union of intervals? Is it the counterset? Is it something more exotic and so on? So the title of this workshop contains words random and quasi-periodic. So let me start with reminding Let me start with reminding the most basic achievement of examples in both worlds. So in the random world, the most basic example is definitely Anderson model. So Anderson model is the following. You just consider a sequence of identically distributed independent random variables, and you take those various random values as the values of your potential. Values as the values of your potential. So this is my L D distributed with respect to some measure mu. And in this case, for this talk, let me just assume that the support of this distribution is compact. Also, it's not really necessary for all the results. So what do we know in this case? So what do we know in this case? In this case, we know that almost surely we have Anderson localization. So we have spectral localization, which means that we have Q point spectrum with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions. We have dynamical localizations as well. Dynamical localizations as well. And as for the spectrum, we know that the spectrum in this case is a finite union of intervals, and moreover, the spectrum can be given explicitly by this formula. So we just take the spectrum of the free loop function and take the Minkowski sum with the support of the distribution mu that defines the potential. Now the Anderson localization. The Anderson localization has a long history. The first reverse result was probably obtained by Indiagal Shade Marvelous and Faster. So this is 77. Then there is Then the results by Hons and Suyar. And those also required some nice distribution, nice properties of this distribution. And for the one that doesn't have those nice properties, for Anderson-Bernoulli model, the question about localization was settled finally by Permona, Penn and Matthew. Um Permona Apene Martinelli and since then many different proofs appeared and even recently Domanik and his students provided a new proof, Ratomirskaya and her student provided a new proof, Klebsen and myself provided another proof. So there are many different approaches to localization and one-dimensional Localization in one-dimensional keys nowadays. Okay, so the question is settled in this case. What can we say now? So, the second part of the workshop was a periodic. In this case, the most prominent model is definitely almost Massey operator. In this case, we take the potential that is given by the following formula. Given by the following formula, there are some physical reasons, physical models that lead to the specific potential, and besides, it turned out that it's very interesting mathematically. So, what do we know? As for the spectral type, it gives you a range of different possibilities. There is so-called insulator metal insulator. Insulator, metal insulator transition. So, what it means, in this case, if tambda is smaller than one, we have absolutely continuous spectrum. If tambda is larger than one, if tambi is equal to one, then we have singular continuous spectrum. If tambda is larger than one, then we have two-point spectrum for almost every um. Almost every frequency and the phase. And as for the topology of the spectrum, we know that this is a counterset. This was a long-standing Gamartini problem. And that was settled in a series of papers culminated in the paper by Abu Zhlomeska. Alright, so we have those two models and we have those two communities. We want to bring them together. Communities, we want to bring them together. What do you do? We create a model that features the worlds. So, what I want to consider is the following potential. I want to consider the potential that is given by, let me denote this one by B sub Q P quasi-periodic, and let me denote this one by random. This is a person model. Let me take the Let me take the potential, which is also going to be a random potential given by the sum of positive periodic one given by this formula and the random given by Anderson model. In fact, I can extend it quite a bit. I can consider any possibility potential here. I can consider a more general random potential here. But anyway, what can we say about the spectral type and about the classical? I ask about the spectrum of the trendy operator with the spectrum. So, sir, when you say any, you mean perhaps written assumptions on the smoothness, right? So, it's not really any. Okay. So, I will formulate, okay, let me for now have this specific model and the own specific model. Model and the own specific model, and later I will formulate the more general results, and we will see what the specific conditions that I must change. So, first I want to formulate what do we know about this specific potential right now. And in the statement, I will combine the results of several projects. So, first of all, it's So first of all, it's a paper by Arvalo Damanik and myself, and also it's a project by myself and Peter Kleptson. So summarizing everything that we know, we can claim that the potential that is given by this formula has the following properties. Following properties. First of all, this operator is almost surely pure point. And in fact, we have not only spectral localization decaying eigenfunctions. But we also have a dynamical localization here. So the random part of the potential definitely wins. And secondly, the spectrum of this operator, also almost true spectrum, is a finite union of integrals. Once again, render potential means the topological structure is the same. It looks like we lost a little bit. We lost the specific description of this potential because in the Anderson model we have this explicit formula. But in fact we didn't lose anything. The formula is still there. We just need to provide this formula accordingly. The claim is the following. Let's introduce the following. Let's introduce the following iteration on compact sets on the line. So, if you have any two compact sets on the line, let's define the star operation as in another compact set that is given in the following way. If it's going to be k plus the convex hull of c Of C, if C is smaller, in the sense that the diameter of C is smaller than the diameter of K. And otherwise, C plus convex hull of K if K is smaller. If the diameter of K is not greater than the diameter of C. If they have the same diameter, then actually the post-formulas give you the same. And actually, the post-formulas give you the same intervals. So, the sum of any compact set is an interval is a finite collection of intervals. That's why we have a finite collection of intervals here. If you take Real Laplacian as kind of the generate case of quasi-periodic potential, then this formula, oh, sorry, I didn't write down the formula. First, the addendum to this um statement is the following. The almost sure spectrum of the potential of the operator given by this potential is actually the sum of the spectrum of the oval-shruhr spectrum of the quasi-periodic potential, well, the sum in this case, in this sense, together with the support of the measure mu that defines the random function. Measure Î½ that defines the random part of this potential. So it's not hard to see that in the case when we consider free Laplacian as a degenerate case of positivity potential, this term becomes the interval from minus 2 to 2. And this formula actually defines exactly the same formula for the random potential. So, this is just a direct generalization of that once we are supporting. So, that's the main result. And actually, here I kind of reduced what we know to that specific case. We can say more. But in order to say more, I want to split those two statements into two different parts, and I will start with. Parts and I will start with the question about the spectral type of surprise. In the case of Anderson model, it certainly has physical relevance. Certainly has physical relevance, but it also makes sense from the point of view of physicists to ask the following question. Suppose that we have any background potential, periodic, quasi-periodic, whatever, and then you add some random noise. And you want to know the properties of that period. So non-stationary under some localization physically should hold. So this result is by our project with Victor Cletson. So we claim the following. Suppose that you have a family, a sequence of distributions, so mu in. n is a sequence of measures, probabilities of measures on the line such that for some uniform constants k and epsilon the following holds. First of all, the support of mu n Of is inside of some compact set, which is independent on the specific distribution. And secondly, we want the variance to be bounded from below by some uniform epsilon. So we don't want the randomness to degenerate. We don't want the randomness to become exponentially small or whatever. So we want it to be honest on each step. So let the n. Let Vn be a sequence of independent random variables such that Vn is distributed with respect to mu n. And there are no conditions on the sequence mu n. I can just choose that by hand in way I want. So be independent and distributed so mu for each man So mu for each n, vm is distributed with respect to mu n. That gives you a family of random potentials. The claim is that then almost surely our operator that is now given by random but not stationary potential is Q1 as both spectral and dynamical localization. Both spectral and dynamical localization as exponentially beginning eigenfunctions. Yes, so Zenostron's viewpoint. So as a corollary, if I consider any background potential and add a random IID potential, then this potential This moderator is also almost truly peripheral. So, in particular, if I take quasi-periodic here, then that's exactly the first part of this result. So, how one can approach this non-stationary underson localization? In the case when those distributions are nice, like absolutely continuous, for example, the result does follow from the techniques that are currently. Does follow from the techniques that are currently available? You can use Concern, you can use some methods. The problem is that if you want it to hold universally, and that's what one should suspect, for example, you have the measure that is supported on a finite collection of points, each time, then it doesn't work. So, what happens in the stationary case? In the stationary case, if you want to deal with stationary random potential distributed with respect to the Potential distributed with respect to the kernel measure, you want to use first-in-work theorem. This is more or less the only approach that people can do this. So we need non-stationary first-minute theorem in order to address this question. Everything what we described by now is only the combination of OMOS matrix with the RED. You always say I need to here, yes, but I mean up to up to the cover up to the theorem, yeah, up to yeah, up to the non-stationary. So everything before that was purely almost 9 plus random. As an example, as you will see, already here we have much more trend of statement. For the second one, what is that you are assuming about the background? Nothing except it's a bounded sequence of numbers. Boundless. So you assume boundless. So this is any bounded sequence of numbers. As soon as this is a bounded sequence of numbers, we have this property. So there is no smoothness, nothing. It's just a sequence of numbers. It's not even a number of potential. Okay. May I ask a question? Imagine I'd like to, instead of taking what you're saying, I mean, instead of taking the assumptions that the Vn are independent from one another, point by point. Another point by point. Imagine I just assume, right, they are according to distributed the way you distribute them, but I just assume the following thing: is that if I take two patches, right, or two segments of your random potential, right, that is, let's say, at the distance z from one another, so there exists some constant D such that if you take two segments of potential at the distance z from one another, they are independent. Does this still work? Another version of this question: what if Another version of this question, what if the dependence goes down exponentially? That seems stronger. I get this question every time when I talk about it, and the answer is, I suspect that the answer is yes, but we didn't work it. Okay, so before I talk about non-stationary Firsten-Berg's theorem, let me remind what is a stationary Firsten-Berg's theorem. Stationary, Kirsten-Berg's theorem is. And let me do that specifically for 2x2 matrices, because that's exactly where I'm going to apply it. Also, the statements that I'm going to talk about work for the matrices of any sites. So the classical Khrushchev-Berry theorem claims the following. So let mu be a probability measure. On a cell to bar. Smash Z. And here we don't assume that the support is compact. We only assume that if you take the tail of this measure, it's going to be small. So you don't get maybe this is just too large norm if you choose those randomly too often. And secondly, and here I want to place A place condition that was originally used by Firstenberg by another one, which is known to be equivalent for this case, which is the following. There is no probability measure mu on the projective space such that for any matrix in the support of mu, if I take the corresponding projective transformation, Case pointing projective transformation, it would send this measure to itself. So there is no measure that would be invariant under all the maps in this report. Then we know that there exists another Lebanon exponent, and this Lebanon exponent is going to be strictly vertical. So, what it means, it means that a pi is means that AÏ is the sequence of independent identical distributed random variables chosen with respect to this measure, sorry, to this respect to this measurement. Okay, so what we want to do, we want to take a similar statement, but in each case we want to take this matrix to be distributed with respect to its own distribution. Own distribution. So let me remind quickly the reason why there is a relation. So as soon as we consider this Schrodinger equation. Schrodinger equation as soon as we try to find E, which is any value. It's a family of difference equations, and it's equivalent to the following, it can be written in the following matrix form. If I denote this transfer matrix by Pn and this potential as random, then everything Then everything reduces to the question about the behavior of the product of random matrices. So if you can say something about the product of this random matrices, you can say something about the behavior of the solutions of the Schrodinger equation. And positivity of Lymanov exponents for this Schrodinger co-cycle is usually Cycle is usually strongly associated with the localization. Okay, great. So this is what we want to do. So if we choose a potential on each side with respect to its own distribution, what we want to do here, we want to choose each matrix here with respect to its own distribution. So we want to change the statement into a non-stationary version. The non-stationary version of the statement was anticipated by Iliago Shait a long time ago. Vehicle shape a long time ago, and it turns out that this is indeed the case, and the following statement actually holds. So, here's what one can do. Suppose that mu n is a family of distributions on SL to R. Or cell DR, the general case, is also available. I will say which one modification mod has to need in the assumptions. Such that I'm sorry, I started wrong. All the key is a compact set in the In the set of all distributions, all probability distributions on SL to R or S L D part. Such that the following holds. First of all, we have some condition on the tail. So for any distribution from this compact set, from our back of possibilities, we want We want this integral to be finite for some uniform lambda c. So it's a little bit stronger condition than in the original first contract theorem, but um uh it also appears in the stationary keys um when you consider, for example, the simplicity of the spectrum or some related questions. Of the spectrum are some really big questions. And the second property is that for any distribution from our compact, there is no, now we have a non-stationary case. It doesn't make much sense to say that there is no measure of the projective space which is invariant. What you want to say, you want to say that there are not two measures on the projective space such that one of them is mapped exactly to another by all the projective maps that we choose. So there are no one, two on the vector. From the projector space, states that for any A from the support of this measure, the corresponding projector absents one topic. So in this case, let's choose any sequence of distributions from our bag of distributions with this property. And let's let me take a i I be independently chosen random matrix chosen with respect to the distribution mean I. So we have independent but not identical distribution sequence of matrices. Then there exists a sequence of numbers which is a non-random sequence. So I will reveal the secret right away. Ln is just the expectation of The expectation of the log of the one of this order. Such that the following holds. First of all, the inf of Ln over N is strictly positive. So this sequence of numbers is growing on average, it is growing with. On average, it is growing linearly, which means that log of this norm of this product on average grows linearly, so the norm of the product grows exponentially. And the second statement is that almost surely we have that the limit as m tends to infinity of 1 over n multiplied by Ln minus this log. is equal to zero. So not only do we know that on average we have exponential growth, we have almost true exponential growth and this exponential growth is with respect to a non-random sequence that is an analog of Epnot exponent with non-stationary keys. I don't have much time, so I will skip some other details and I will just say that This is a starting point for proving under some localization, and you can go from here. You can prove the large deviation estimates here, and so on and so forth. By the way, Iriac Al Shade told us about the proof of this statement that he knew from the 90s, I believe, at least, or even before that. And that happened here during one of the previous meetings. And I remember that he gave a talk explaining that process. He gave a talk explaining the proof. So, since then, in 2020, he published a proof, a different proof, different from ours of the statement, which is even more works for product of matrices over the Markov chain as well. Just in this case, bound stationary Markov chain. All right. I have a little bit of time left to explain the statement about the topological structure of the spectrum. Structure of the spectrum. And once again, we can actually prove more than I initially formulated. But in order to formulate the general statement, I need to remind how the recording potentials are defined. So suppose that M is some compact metric space, and suppose that G is a homeomorphism. Which is not just homeomorphism, but also preserves a measure, a probability measure, let's call it draw, on M, such that this measure is supported on the whole phase space. And suppose that also we have some observable phi, and as for And as for the question about regularity, we will assume that it's very regular. We need it to be continuous. That's all we need. So here is a statement. Suppose that background potential, so in this case, background potential is going to be not just any sequence of numbers, but aquatic potential. Of numbers, but the aquatic potential defined with respect to this picture is such that M is connected. So the only restriction that we need is that the phase space is connected. So in particular, for almost Monsieur operator, the phase space is a circle, the homeomorphism is just a rational rotation of the circle, and our function is just a cosine, so all the conditions are met. But of course, that's But of course, that's not you can favor it. I have to emphasize that this condition is quite restrictive. Even periodic background potential doesn't work here, because for periodic background potential, the space is finite collection of points. Fibonacci doesn't work here, because for Fibonacci, in order to guarantee that this function is continuous, you need to take the phase space to be contapset. So this is somewhat expected, but still. Suppose that you have a background potential such that. That you have a background potential such that M is connected. And random potential is given by ID random variables distributed with respect to some measure Î¼, such that the support of Î¼ on R is component. Then we can claim that the spectrum of the operator where this background potential, where the potential is given by the sum of such background potential, this random potential, this ID random potential, is given exactly by the almost true spectrum of the initial Of the operator with the initial background potential given here, coupled in this way with the support of the distribution. In particular, specifically for almost maximum operators that give the formulas that I formulated at the very beginning. So we have another. We have another five minutes maybe? Yeah, you have ten minutes. I will tell you when it will be five. I will tell you what will be five. So is this measured agoric or not? Yes, yes, yes, yes. That's just standard ergodic alphabet. Now, first of all, I have to say that this condition cannot be removed. Because even for periodic potential, one can explicitly calculate in some specific cases that this formula doesn't hold. Still, you can ask the question: what if you have a periodic potential? If you have a periodic potential as a background potential, do you still at least have the claim that the formula doesn't work for Edward Crossing? The formula doesn't work. So if what I'm saying is that if in this statement I'm removing, so I'm asking about the question. I'm not saying that for any periodic or every periodic potential it doesn't work. I'm saying that there are periodic potential sites that it doesn't hold. So let's see what we know about the periodic potential. First of all, in the simplest case, when this periodic potential has period 2, and when everything seems to be kind of reasonably simple and you can just ask computer to provide the results, it happens that if the background potential is 2pU, Is two periodic and random potential is given by id sequence of random variables, then almost through a spectrum of the operator given by this background potential plus this random potential is a finite union of intervals and actually is at most for the union of at most. Or the union of at most four intervals. And this is the result that was exactly the same time obtained by William Wood and David Domanich, Drake Fieldman. And Joker, which is not surprising since we discussed this question as David before, but somehow addressed this question independently. And William Wood is my student. Okay, so the next question is: what can you say if the potential has larger periods? Is it true that for any periodic potential, as soon as you have That for any periodic potential, as soon as you add id random noise, you still get you kind of remove all the small gaps and you get a finite number of intervals on the spectrum. The theorem that is currently being written by Fieldman and Wood. And the example is based actually by something from dynamical systems by the study of finitely generated semi-groups. Generated semicrups by Salt Army. This is by Ivel La Pokey and Yukos. They managed to provide an example. So there exists a background potential which is four periodic and random potential which is ID permoly just explicitly, those can be written explicitly. Explicitly, ketos can be written explicitly, such that the almost true spectrum of the potential given by the sum of background and random potentials here has infinitely many connected components, has infinitely many gaps. Um which is very surprising. Yes, but uh Yes. But I imagine the natural thing would be to assume that if the random potential has a continuous distribution, right? Yes. It should actually array the whole. Yes, that's why I imagine that. So the Bernoulli here, yeah, this... Sure. But in principle, you could easily imagine the situation when, for Bernoulli case, yes, you have disk the distribution, but you have infinitely many choices. You have just have a frequency that maybe you can share. Have a frequency that maybe you can shift it. So, my initial, so initially, when I formulated this question to William, I asked him to prove that it's finite union of intervals. He struggled, and then he came and said, you know what, I don't know if it's true. Yeah, sure, it makes sense. I mean, intuitively, I'd say it's reasonable, right? Because there's just, there's not, you can't vary enough. How much you vary is actually quote-unquote quantified, right? Unquote quantified, right? I mean, it's that Bernoulli doesn't give you the same power to adjust the coupling constants so that you can be cheaper than it. Well, the same argument would apply here, but nevertheless. Yeah, instead, if you take the support, the support is just two points, right? Even if you apply your star operation. Yes. You will get a finite union of intervals. Yeah, but you. Yeah, but goes up the V back, right? So this can be essentially almost anything, but not really. So the problem is not with the fact that the support is small. The problem is that we don't have connectedness of the space space in some sense. So I would say that intuition can lie here, and at least to me, this is. And at least to me, this result is kind of surprising. Anyway, so thank you. I want to finish with an open question that I'm very interested in. As David, Demani, we worked a lot on Fibonacci potential, so when we started to work on this project, it was very natural to ask: okay, let's take Fibonacci potential and let's add some random noise to that, what you're going to get. Going to get. So let me remind very briefly what Fibonacci substitution sequence is. So what you do, you take the substitution of the sequences of two symbols. So as a result, 0 goes to 0, 1, which if you apply it again goes to 0, 1, 0, which goes to 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, and so on. So this sequence of finite sequences stabilizes. Of finite sequences stabilizes, and therefore you can rage down the infinite sequence of zeros and ones. You can take a whole, that gives you an arbitric setting for Fibonacci substitution potential. Okay, so here's a question. If B is given by Lanachi and some random potential, what can we see if About almost sure spectrum of the operator with this potential. And we don't have an answer. We tried some computer experiments and it shows actually that the result may depend on specific, so you can put some coupling constant in both cases, number one, number two, on specific coupling constants, so on the sizes of those contributors. Those contributors. And maybe this is indeed the case. Maybe if you add just small randomness, you get one answer. If you add small multiple match perturbation to the random potential, you get another answer. That's what I expect right now. But in any case, those are just conjectures, and I would be very much interested in Fibonacci case, unlike the quasi-like omosmatic case, random is not always weak? That's what you should tell. Maybe not. Maybe that's what you should. Maybe not. Once again, I don't know. But I don't have a proof. But that's what computer shows. But I may want to stop here. Questions? Then I'll go. You put all these things and you prove the the theorems about The theorem is about the structure of the spectrum. Is it I never looked at it carefully, so I'm asking for the theory. Do you use this file criterion all the time? Are you simply trying to construct the corresponding solution to the equation which is in a in a fine way. So In a fine way. So, in order to get it, is there anything that the idea is actually relatively simple and fairly beautiful? I can say that it's beautiful because it's mostly our procyclic. So, the idea is the following. Suppose you have a trigger co-cycle, and suppose you manage to find just one point in a phase space, such as that for that specific point, uh the corresponding solution is going to give you uh the solution that decays both in plus and at minus infinity. Both in plus and at minus infinity. Then you know that the SchrÃ¶dinger pose cycle is not uniformly hyperbolic and the corresponding energy is in the spectrum. So I will just repeat it another way. In order to show that Schrodinger Pocycle is not uniformly hyperbolic, it's enough to find just one specific point where you don't have the solution that grows exponentially in one direction and it's enough to find one point where the solution decays in both directions. That is in both directions. To slow. Yes. But I want to emphasize just one point. It's enough to find one point. That's all. So now you can argue in the following way. You have the support of your distribution. Let's pick just two points in the support. If you add one constant to your background potential, you have one Pocycle. If you add another constant to the background potential that corresponds to another constant in the support, you get another Schringer Pocycle. Support, you get another Schrodinger pose cycle. Now you have those two Schrodinger pose cycles, and essentially, by changing your random potential, you can jump from one to another. Suppose for a moment that those two Schrodinger pose cycles have different rotation numbers. If they have different rotation numbers but both hyperbolic, that means that the stable bundle of one and unstable bundle of another are not homotopic. And here is where we're using connectedness of the. And here's where we're using connectedness of the phase space. If you have two non-homatopic bundles over the connected space, there must be points where they coincide. And for that point, since it belongs to a stable bundle of one, you can find the solution that decays in the future. And it belongs to one stable bundle of another, you can find the solution that decays in the past for another value of the random potential. And that argument is sufficient to show that. To show that you have a bunch of energies in the spectrum in between, so you feel all the small groups. So that's essentially the main idea. Very good question. No, yes, and no. No, because in order to say that integrated density of states exists, you need to take the limit and you need to have some percolic background potential in order to integrate to find the limit. So, otherwise, why do you know that there is any limit? On the other hand, you can still consider You can still consider some analogs of the points where the rotation number changes and how much it changes. And in that way, you can produce some analog of integrated density of states in the non-stationary case. But it's not straightforward. I can I can show the it's it's a little bit technical but uh I can show you uh the specific uh results later because it will take more time than just say you say you could you don't care about the limit I mean I guess maybe not it has the tail behavior. Uh uh once again, let l l let's maybe talk uh outside of uh because uh as I was I will start writing formulas and it will take a long time. My question concerns this Fibonacci plus random situation, and you mentioned at the very end. Is the topological structure covered by the theorems you had before? I simply don't remember. No, it's also open. So, in the key. That's exactly what I'm asking for. The fact that it's pure point is covered. We know that the spectral type we know. We know that it's almost surely pure point. What we don't know is exactly the point. What we don't know is exactly the pathological structure of almost three spectrum. Yeah, because in the space of when we talk about the type, then background potential can be anything. So in particular, it can be Fibonacci down here. But when you talk about the topological structure, the spectrum, which is somehow surprising, because usually you would think it's easier to say something about the topological structure than saying something about the structure. Then they say something about the spectral type. No, Musmatu, techno Musmati, but also later transition 1999, then we're thinking in 2009. Sorry, no, disagree. I'm not saying about quasi-periodic, just if you're perturbed by randomness. Yeah, no, I mean, that's true. I mean, quasi-periodic is a different thing, but if you're perturbed by randomness, you always think it. You always think it's easier to say something about the topological structure. That surprises me. Yes, Frederick. Yeah, actually, last year I'm birthday, there was one
