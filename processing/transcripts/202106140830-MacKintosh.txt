It's now Professor Frank McIntosh from Rice University. We'll talk about mechanical phase transitions and elastic anomalies in biopolymer gels. We have him. Great. I think, can you hear me? And are you seeing a screen? Yes, yes. Yes to all questions. Very, very good. Okay, good. Thank you. Sorry. Sorry. Okay. So it's a great pleasure to take part in this meeting. Appreciate the invitation. I think I can speak for everyone in saying that I wish I were actually in Banff. It's a very nice place. I was looking forward. I've been there a number of times. Hopefully, most many of you have as well. I was certainly looking forward to being there in person. But, well, another time. I do appreciate the effort. I do appreciate the efforts that the organizers have put in to keep this going in spite of COVID. So, what I'd like to do, it's actually also a pleasure to follow up on Christian, because I'd like to take us in another extreme limit of polymer behavior, essentially away from the statistical mechanical or thermal to a mechanical extreme to understand a very interesting class of. And a very interesting class of biopolymer gels, hydrogels, really, as almost any biopolymer gel will be, namely extracellular matrices, such as collagen or this blood clot that, so let's see here. I'm somehow I completely lost my mouse, but anyway, on the lower right, you'll see a blood clot. And so, one of the things that I want you to start orienting yourself toward is thinking of this as no longer essentially at all thermal, but mechanical. And that is actually an interesting challenge in understanding the rheological properties, elasticity of these networks. And what I'd like to argue, hopefully convince you of, is that thinking of these instead as a mechanical phase transition governing especially the nonlinear mechanics. The nonlinear mechanics is quite fruitful. And if there's time, I'd like to get into some implications for some elastic anomalies, which have been observed for many years in these systems. So what I'm going to be talking about is the work of a number of group members highlighted in red, the primary ones here, including Abhinav Sharma, who will be a future colleague of Christian's, or is he moving right now, Christian? Or is he moving right now, Christian? Anyway, he'll be joining, a former postdoc of mine will be joining CISA. So, and as well, we've benefited a lot from collaborations with a number of our experimental colleagues. I'll be highlighting along the way, but again, I've shown a number of these in red. So, biopolymers are an absolutely universal construction principle in biology at all levels. Principle in biology at all levels. Actually, there'll be chromosome discussions we'll be hearing later. There are cytoskeletal discussions a number of us will be involved in. This is a image just meant to illustrate visually the filamentary structures that you have there. I'm not going to go into those in any great detail, but take you instead to the extracellular scale. The kinds of networks that The kinds of networks that give our tissues their mechanical properties. Also, important in organizing cells. And it's the substrate, if you like, that cells typically move in or move on. So what's shown here is a blood clot. It's false color, but a real image showing, and actually it's approximately 40 microns or so across this. Microns or so across this image, so it's a fairly large scale. And hopefully, you already start to see a pretty non-classical limit of polymers, these filaments shown in green. Red blood cells are appropriately false colored in red, just to give you a sense of scale. I'm going to focus a little bit more actually in networks like this. These are collagen networks. It's a beautiful image. Again, the image is probably about 50 microns across. A beautiful, beautiful image from my colleagues, my colleague Jaisi Kundrink, used to be in Amsterdam, now Delft. And as I said, I want to argue that these are in strong contrast to the classical polymer limits we were just hearing about of flexible polymers. If you like, the thermal persistence length, which was discussed before, would be meters for collagen. So I would argue that thermal fluctuations. I would argue that thermal fluctuations are utterly irrelevant, and anything you see structurally is not of thermal origin, but something else. Quinch disorder, if you like. And so, not surprisingly, particularly when you get to collagen, textbook polymer theories really utterly fail. And so, the question we're left with is what governs the mechanics there? And that's actually been an interesting challenge that many of us have been interested in. Us have been interested in. But let me just begin to show you some of the kind of behavior that would be very hard to understand within the context of something like rubber elasticity theory of flexible polymers. And this is a classic experiment going back to a little over 50 years now, textbook physiology. It's actually an extension measurement of collagenous tissue, but it's the same. Tissue, but it's the same experiment you can do by just pulling on your earlobe. Okay. We all know from our tissues that they're not linear elastic. There may be a linear elastic regime, but they're characteristically nonlinear in a way that is much more stable, if you like. As you go to higher strains or apply more stress, their ability to handle larger stresses increases. Stresses increase. If you like, their compliance goes down or the rigidity stiffness goes up by orders of magnitude, not a small effect. And yes, flexible polymers can also, rubber actually is nonlinear, but not like this. Moreover, this nonlinearity sets in at very small strains. Now, so this image already, which just shows force as a function of extension of a tissue. Force as a function of extension of a tissue certainly looks non-Hookian. One of the interesting things Feng did was to actually plot not the stress versus strain, but the derivative of stress with respect to strain as a function not of strain, but stress. So that's what's shown on the right. So that's a, you could call it a tangent modulus. It's a differential modulus, not the ratio of stress to strain, but as a function of load, as I said. Strain, but as a function of load, as I said. And what he already observed was an approximate linear relationship between stiffness and stress, again, not strain. Now, what that begins to suggest, although I don't want to emphasize this overly much because it's not rigorously correct, but it certainly suggests a very strange exponential relationship between stress and strain. I'll return to that later, but it's an example of something. Return to that later, but it's an example of something which has been a puzzle out there for which there really haven't been a good theoretical understanding. So, I'm going to argue that one way to do this is to think about physics that goes back to Maxwell, the same Maxwell we know and love for many things. But unfortunately, mechanical engineers learn this when physicists tend not to. Guilty is charged. I'm a physicist. I learned about this very late. I learned about this very late. But over the last 20, 30 years or so, people have been realizing the importance of this idea. And it's basically a simple counting argument. It starts as a simple counting argument. So Maxwell's idea was the following. He said, let me look at what determines the rigidity of a structure like this bridge here. It's a modern bridge, but it's a classic so-called Warren Truss structure that Maxwell actually wrote about. And so if I imagine now a more microspecial. Imagine now a more microscopic picture of this, of a network. And if I look at the nodes of that network, shown as red, in a two-dimensional system, so let me start in the plane here. Each one of those nodes has two mechanical degrees of freedom for the two axes along which it can move. And Maxwell's basic argument was the following. If I take the total number of degrees of freedom and I subtract off the number of constraints, a transition occurs when that number goes to zero, i.e. I have no. That number goes to zero, i.e., I have no more freedom in the system, and then the system becomes rigid. And so, if I take one of those nodes, shown as red, with its two mechanical degrees of freedom and two dimensions, and I connect it up to four neighbors on average, and it doesn't have to be as regular a structure as I'm showing, but on average, if there's four connections to neighbors, each one of those connections represents a constraint, but I don't get four constraints for that node, I get four half constraints, and they're half. Four half constraints, and they're half constraints because they're simultaneously trying to constrain two nodes. So, four minus four halves gives zero, and I have a just marginally stable system. That's the isostatic point, so-called, that Maxwell identified. Now, in three dimensions, that would have been a connectivity of six. So, I'll call this coordination number the connectivity. That would have been a connectivity of six. What does that tell us about the networks like collagen or this intracellular network of actives? Extra intracellular network of actin shown in the middle. Well, not very much. In fact, this initial picture, if you like, would be irrelevant because the local connectivity of collagen is something between three and four. People measure something like three and a half on average. Now, as this picture begins to illustrate something else is missing in this picture, and collagen can indeed be stable, there are additional constraints coming from bending. Constraints coming from bending, but I still want to look at this original Maxwell idea of central force interactions only. And the other thing that we know about that transition is it's a continuous or second order like phase transition. Now, it's a genuine phase transition. It just happens to be at t equals zero. This is an a thermal transition. And at that transition, the shear modules, for instance, would grow continuously. But the systems we're interested in. But the systems we're interested in are well below that isostatic point. I'll call them sub-isostatic. And so the physics of isostaticity is not going to be governing them. But nevertheless, I want to argue that it's interesting to generalize Maxwell's idea to large deformations. Okay, so that's the direction I'm going. But just before going there, let me remind you of another second-order continuous phase transition, magnetization as a function of temperature. Magnetization as a function of temperature, something like iron as I cool it down from high temperature. Magnetization will grow continuously, as I've indicated. And so by analogy to what I just referred to, I said that the biological networks we're interested in are sub-isostatic. They're not controlled by the rigidity balance of constraints, if you like, argument of Maxwell, at least with respect to the linear. Maxwell, at least with respect to the linear elasticity. So they would be floppy. Floppy would be like the disordered phase, if you like, in the magnetic analogy, would be the paramagnetic phase. Now, if we're interested in magnetization, though, you know that you can get magnetization with something else, a field. So you can go to the high temperature phase and get magnetization with a stabilizing field. And I'm going to start thinking about mechanics now. So that begins. Mechanics now. So that begins to suggest that we could take these networks that Maxwell would say would be floppy and stabilize them. And that's actually a very fruitful thing. You can stabilize them in many different ways. One of them I mentioned is bending rigidity of the fibers, and that's definitely present. But let me think about another one. Let me think about stress. So stress itself can stabilize these networks. And so we actually know this, stress or stress. This, stress or strain, and I'll loosely use the two interchangeably, being a little bit more careful than I'm suggesting. But something like the spider web is an example of something which is only stable as a result of the stress imposed at the boundary or the fact that I've strained it. It would actually be floppy in three dimensions if I were to release those constraints or remove the stress at the boundary. Now, this is maybe a slightly misleading picture because it looks like mass. Slightly misleading picture because it looks like Maxwell's criterion is satisfied in the middle of the structure. I assure you that you could cut all sorts of bonds in this structure and it will still remain stable provided you strain it an appropriate amount. So this is not stable even as a two-dimensional structure as a result of the four-fold connectivity in the structure. But it starts to get the idea across that maybe what we should do is strain or stress. We should do is strain or stress these systems, which are initially floppy, and it certainly suggests that they could go rigid. Now, you actually know this from fabric, like my shirt, right? Fabric is not something you build with unless you put it under stress, right? That brings up the idea of so-called tensegrity in engineering and structures. But what I want to talk about is a transition as a function of strain, which occurs as I take one of those floppy systems and I Take one of those floppy systems and I strain it. And so I'm not going to change anything about its connectivity, not even entanglement, which is essentially not very important for these networks, as it turns out. And they'll go rigid. So let me show you a little movie, little cartoon to illustrate this. So what I'm showing here is an initial triangular network which has been diluted well below the isostatic point in two dimensions. You can do a little counting here. You can do a little counting here, and you'll see a lot of nodes of different connectivity, but the average is well below four. This system is utterly floppy, doesn't resist any deformation to at least shear or bulk deformation. I'm actually stretching this system at the boundary, sort of like that spider web. And so I'm imposing bulk strain on this, extensional strain. Sorry. Sorry, a bulk positive strain, if you like. But I'm leaving the full network in the same field of view. So I'm changing my magnification. That might be slightly misleading. I'm straining at much more than it will look like, if you like. Equivalently, I'm contracting all the elements inside the network. Now, as I do that, you can already begin to see that what were originally straight lines are no longer straight. Well, let's see, here's one. Anyway, Anyway, it's starting to deform, and as you continue to strain it, it remains completely floppy. And now, let me run the movie again, and I'm going to stop it right at the transition where I would cross this line. Did you notice a bunch of rearrangements right before I stopped? It's still absolutely floppy. Those rearrangements, I'll get back to a little bit later. Get back to a little bit later. I want to think of them as fluctuations, and these will be fluctuations that actually are analogous to critical fluctuations associated with this phase transition. Okay, so it's still floppy. And now if I strain it anymore, the system will actually go rigid and let me stop it. Hopefully, you begin to see some red lines forming. Those are under tension. So, tension is now propagating from one side of the sample to the other. If you like, I have a stable. Sample to the other, if you like, I have a stable structure. The transition was indeed, as advertised, continuous, at least apparently. This is, of course, just a cartoon, but you can flesh these ideas out. And then, as I strain the hell out of it at about here, that's a strain of order one, and I'm going to go to strains of order 10. I get what looks like a drunken spider's web with a lower connectivity, but it is indeed stabilized by that same effect. Stress at the boundary. That same effect, stress at the boundaries or strain. So, that basic picture is the one I want to think of. I want to look at this transition and the implications of it. So, again, going back to Maxwell, we would have had a stable structure to the right of this isostatic point indicated with the red dot, but the networks we're interested in are on the left, even more so in three dimensions, of course. And so what I want to do is pull another axis out of the plane here of strain. out of the plane here of strain. This is going to be shear strain now. Same thing happens with that movie I showed you a moment ago. And so what I'm arguing is you can take one of these floppy structures to the left of that transition and just strain it and cross a boundary from floppy to rigid. Now, I talked about the second order like or critical nature of the transition as a function of connectivity. What's the nature of the transition, the line I just indicated? The line I just indicated. Well, one of the things we've found is that it is indeed critical still. So let me show you how that works. But just before doing it, let me add back in one of those mechanical constraints that's left out of Maxwell, the original Maxwell picture, namely bending rigidity. If I really have bending rigidity of fibers, those are additional weak elastic constraints. And so what I would get would be rather than a floppy system, I would get a soft network transitioning to a Network transitioning to a much stiffer one associated with that transition. Okay, that's the basic idea. So let me show you how this works. The results on the left are a bunch of, well, the result of variety of simulations you can do, different network structures, 2D, 3D pictures basically the same. I'm showing the stiffness. Again, that's the derivative of stress with strain as a function of strain, log axes on both. Log axes on both. And so the transition I just described would be for zero bending rigidity. So that's the dashed red line in the lower right. Again, somehow I don't have a mouse, surprisingly. And if I were to increase the strain, go across that strain threshold that I indicated, the network would stiffen. It happens to do so as a power law, an interesting power law, which Power law, which corresponds to a non-mean field exponent for the statistical mechanicians. That's an interesting aspect of this problem. That's above the transition, so that's when I've strained that spider web till its stable point. The region below that can be controlled instead by the fiber bending rigidity in these networks. Amusingly, an equation was left out. I'm sorry about that. Was left out. I'm sorry about that. I don't quite know what's happening between. Well, so a presentation that was working before Zoom is apparently slightly modified by Zoom. But anyway, you can capture this in much the same way you would for magnetization. That's jumping ahead to the story. Basically, the magnetization would grow as a fractional power law of the difference in temperature between below, if you like, the critical temperature. Below, if you like, the critical temperature. For us, that would be a shear stiffness, which would increase as a power law of the difference in strain above the critical strain. And then a magnet would also, a magnetic system would also be stabilized by a field, that's little H. And following a lot of critical phenomena for decades, of course, one can look at a scaling function. Look at a scaling function here appropriately labeled W for Widem, which actually can characterize that. And just as you would take magnetic data, this is magnetization as a function of field at different temperature. That scaling form that I've shown there actually results in a collapse of all the data if you plot the magnetization divided by that temperature difference to the power beta versus field divided by a different. By a different power law of T minus T C. All the data collapse onto two branches. The two branches refer to above and below the transition. And something very similar happens for our networks. But now, bending rigidity, as I indicated, is the stabilizing effect for these networks, at least at low strain. And so, how would that relate to experiments? So, far, this is just showing that. So, so far, this is just showing that the simulations I showed you before. By the way, in 2D and 3D, the different colors are different network structures. This is a very general phenomenon. This basically just shows that the theoretical results I indicated or simulation results can be characterized by this. What about the experiments? Well, just before getting to the experiments, let me say something about how the binding rigidity relates to something you can control experimentally. If you change the concentration of a collagen network, Of the collagen network. In terms of the network, you can think of that as fattening the collagen fibers. The bending rigidity increases as the fourth power of the radius of the fiber, whereas its stretch modulus increases as only the second power. So the relative importance of bending should go up with concentration. And so, if you take collagen data, this is from our colleagues in Walches Kundrink and her student Karen Janssen did these experiments. This is basically scaling things in terms of concentration, as being that stabilizing field, if you like. And so to our surprise, the data collapse almost as well as they do for a simpler ferromagnetic system. Very surprising. But it's basically just the beginning of something we've been flushing out for a number of years now. You can turn this basic idea into a quantitative predictive theory for color. Into a quantitative predictive theory for collagen networks. Let me just show one surprising result associated with that transition. You can quantitatively account for the nonlinear rheology. By the way, notice that the modulus is changing by orders of magnitude here. Let me show something, a different way to look at this. These are results from the weights group experiments by Stefan Munster a couple of years ago. This is, I think, a nice way to connect up with the classical physics. To connect up with the classical physiology I was showing you before, because what's plotted here again is the stiffness. That's the derivative of stress with strain, is a function of stress. Most of the previous plots were as a function of strain. And this is very reminiscent of those classical physiology results where the stiffness grows linearly with stress. After you leave a linear response regime and the low stress regime where the red data are flat. Flat. You go into this linear increase, approximate linear increase. Now, there's another very dramatic thing here, which shows the fact that stress is the stabilizing effect here, in, I think, a very dramatic way. So the different red curves are collagen at different concentrations. The concentration range is about an order of magnitude. Not too surprisingly, the linear moduli increased by about two orders of magnitude. By about two orders of magnitude. But look at what happens as you put these systems under stress. Notice how all those curves coincide at high stress. It's very surprising. It's basically saying that the stiffness of the network is independent of collagen concentration. Very strange. Provided that the stress is specified, another way to put it, you tell me the stress, I'll tell you what the stiffness is. I'll tell you what the stiffness is, independent of what the collagen is, collagen concentration is. Very surprising. Very dramatic illustration of stress as being a dominant control variable controlling the mechanics. Okay, I'm running out of time. Let me just say in words, you can flesh out these critical phenomena approach to actually get a predictive theory for the elastic energy as a function of two control variables. Of two control variables: the difference in strain away from the critical strain, that's like a difference in temperature above or below the transition in the ferromagnetic analogy. Following classical ideas going back to Kadanoff, so-called real space renormalization, you can actually turn this together with the key observation that those strain fluctuations I was showing you in that cartoon actually are critical fluctuations. They actually also have a diverging correlation length, importantly. Importantly, you can turn that into a prediction for a constraint, if you like, on the mathematical form of the elastic energy from which you can actually start calculating critical exponents or the relationship between them. Interesting story in its own right, but let me just show you how this relates to an anomaly, an elastic anomaly about the Poisson ratio. So, ordinarily, if you take an elastic, linear elastic isotropic material, extend Isotropic material extended along one axis, it'll typically contract along the other two axes. That defines a Poisson ratio. I've indicated here as nu with a minus sign because, of course, it's typically a contraction. If I have a volume preserving system, it would in three dimensions contract, the strain laterally would be one half the axial strain. That corresponds to an incompressible material, and all materials would strain less than that. Would strain less than that. Never more. Now, that's exactly what collagen and fibrin networks do, though. They anomalously contract in the transverse directions, corresponding to a very strange effect, which appears to violate a thermodynamic bound. You put a system under traction, and it decreases its volume by 90%. Very strange effect. That looks like a negative compressibility, if you like. Negative compressibility, if you like. Now, it's not violating any real bounds because that's a nonlinear effect, but it happens at very small strains of order 1 to 2%. And what we've recently shown is that that anomaly appears coincident with that phase boundary I showed you before. As a function of connectivity of the network, there's a boundary you can predict, and that's basically the local architecture of the network will determine the point at which. Network will determine the point at which that dramatic collapse of volume occurs. And it's coincident with diverging fluctuations in the strain field as well, as I've indicated, which is here with a heat map. So there's a lot more you can do with this. The critical phenomena associated with this are very fascinating in their own right, and there's some interesting implications for tissue. But I hope I've at least convinced you that. But I hope I've at least convinced you that this is a fruitful and I think interesting way of approaching polymer rheology in an extreme athermal sense as a mechanical phase transition. And again, thanks to a number of people been involved in this and collaborations with a number of our experimental colleagues. Thanks.
