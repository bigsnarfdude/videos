The topics of the conference were my favorite topics, so I look forward to contributing and seeing what progress can be made on some of those famous rank conjectures. So I was asked to prepare an elementary talk, and that I was told several times, it should be elementary, accessible to both algebraists and topologists. So what I'm going to provide here is a very leisurely introduction. Leisurely introduction into the subject, and towards the end of this lecture, I will propose some of those conjectures. From the point of view of topology, so I want to caution everyone that I am a topologist. I am not a community algebraist. So I will let the community algebraists give things their own spin on things. And we of course do use methods and ideas and language. And language, some language for that, but the primary objects that I will be focused on are spaces and invariants coming from topological spaces. And as I said, I'll try to keep it as untechnical as possible. So let's see, let's see. Hopefully, okay, you can see that. Switch the slide. Okay, so it's going to be in three parts. First, a quick First, a quick trip through group actions and cohomology, setting the stage, going through some of the classical material and proto-definitions so folks can understand the objects we're talking about. Then we're going to focus on free actions primarily because that seems to be the topic of main interest in for this these conjectures. These conjectures. And then at the end, I will specialize to the notorious case of products of spheres, which I believe afterwards Bernhard Hanke in his lecture will elaborate on more on his work in that direction. Okay, so let's start. So I'm going to recall some basic notions about group. Basic notions about group actions and what we call cohomology of groups. And for the purposes here, and just to keep things fairly simple, by and large, you can assume that when I say G, G will be a finite group. Okay? Now, what is the starting point to the study of the topology of groups, in particular of finite groups? Well, it's the notion Well, it's the notion of a classifying space. So, what do we mean by that? Well, recall there is a principal G bundle. Can people see the pointer, by the way? Or no? Maybe not. Okay. Yes. Yes, okay. There is a principle G bundle, Eg over Bg, where Eg is a contractible space with a free action of G. Free action of G. Now, in the case of a finite group, that just means that EG has a nice structure, G is acting freely on it, it's contractible, has a homotopy type of a point, and the quotient is what we call PG. If you had a more complicated group, then you'd have to worry about the vocal structure. But here, it's all very simple. All very simple. And this was originally introduced, a construction for this was introduced by Milner from 1950. And we can assume that EG is a GCW complex. I will assume that you know what CW complexes are. Briefly, they're spaces built out of cells attached in a particular way. And in this case, And in this case, we want action, an action of the finite group that moves the cells around. And there are theorems that tell you, you know, cellular approximation theorems, etc., etc., tell you that this is a good category to be working. And in particular, when you have a finite group, it turns out that you can assume that there are you have a model which has finitely many cells in any given dimension. However, However, the model itself has to be infinite-dimensional for a finite group. And you'll understand why as we go through the basics of the theory. Now, the orbit space BG is called a classifying space of G. And it's given that name because it is a classifying space in terms of the classification or principle G bundles. And it goes back to a theorem of Steenrots. Of steerons, but we won't talk about that here. Now, when G is discrete, in particular, when it's finite, then the space BG is also an Eilenberg-MacLean space. And what that means is that it has all its homotopy concentrated in a single dimension or degree. In this case, it's just pi 1. Pi 1 of G, of B G is equal to G. A Bg is equal to G, and all the higher homotopy groups are going to vanish. And the models here, of course, are all path-connected. Okay, so now we have a space here with a free G-action. We think of it as a cellar space, and it's contractible. And now we can look at the chains on EG. So, oh, sorry about that. That's the first step into algebra. Into algebra, looking at the stellar chains on Eg. Now, because Eg is contractible, what we obtain is a chain complex whose homology in degree zero is a trivial module. And it had no other homology. So it's an acyclic chain complex. And free action on a space gave rise to a free modules at the chain. Free modules at the chain level because the modules, the cells are all freely permuted. So it's a free resolution of the trivial module over the group algebra, dg. Now here I'm using Z, but obviously this crowd will want to use a ring R, I don't know, computative ring with unit or something like that. Take your favorite ring and you can put it in here and do something analogous. Now, based on this, we see the very beautiful. We see the very beautiful equality here. So, if we take any ZG module M, then the cohomology of the space Vg with twisted coefficients M is in fact isomorphic to X, the X group over Z G of the trivial module with coefficients in M. And that follows from the fact that when we take a quotient by G, this is the same as taking This is the same as taking and then computing homology. It's the same as constructing X. And that's what we algebraists would write as the cohomology of G with coefficients in M. So this is telling you that you have the whole machinery of group cohomology and at the same time a relationship with topological spaces. That's kind of the genesis of the connection between group homology, groups, and topology and And topology and group actions, as we shall see. And I think these theories, I think by and large, were invented by topologists because of geometric problems that they had to deal with, and then developed much more widely and with greater depth by the Algebra theories, were developed then by the Algebraist representation theories. Just a quick question. Yeah? This is Daniel Armin. Just a quick question. This is Daniel Erman. Just a quick question: Is the second equality there? Is that the definition of the group cohomology? That's right. The thing in the middle, yeah. Thanks. Okay, maybe I'm going too slowly, yeah? Am I going too slowly? All right, you tell me if I'm going too slowly or too fast. Okay, now I'm not going to say too much about group homology. Obviously, I'll refer you to some books on You to some books on that topic. But one of the nicer properties is that finite group homology can be determined locally. You know, finite groups, we all know that there's some very special primes associated to finite groups, namely the primes that divide the order of the group. So if we take all the p subgroups of G and think of them sort of combinatorially, where Where we look at inclusions and then conjugation by the group. So, this is an ICE G poset. Then there's a very classical computation due to, well, at least it appears in the book by Cartan in Eilenberg, which says the following. So, first of all, if you have a subgroup H of G, then there's a natural map from BH to BG, because it turns out that the construction Because it turns out that the construction of the classifying space is functorial. And then you can look at that map in cohomology, and that's what we call a restriction map. So assuming now that we have p subgroup, then we have restriction maps. And now the funny symbol FP will be the field with p coefficients. And the computational result is that if I look at this limit over all the pieces. Over all the P subgroups of the cohomology of the P subgroups of G, then this is a computation for the cohomology of G at the prime P. So the idea then is, this is kind of a formalization of something which you might already know, namely that the cohomology of G with mod P coefficients embeds in the cohomology mod P of the P of any P silo subgroup, and the image. And the image, the trick is to try to understand what the image is, and those are the so-called stable elements. And what this limit does, these are sequences of cohomology classes which are compatible with respect to maps induced by inclusion and conjugation. So, in principle, we understand what this is. Of course, the stability conditions can be quite complicated, and anyone that's tried to compute the Como. Anyone that's tried to compute the cohomology of some interesting group will see that actually implementing this can be rather complicated. But it's a bit of a black box. All this does is reduce things to p groups, right? That is not completely satisfactory because community algebraists want to understand things up to nilpotence, things of that kind. So that's kind of the direction we want to go into as we move ahead with this analysis. With this analysis. Okay, so now we've talked about the cohomology of a group with coefficients in a module. Now we want to talk about what you might think of as the cohomology of the group with coefficients in a space. So you want your coefficients to be geometric. And how do we accomplish that? Well, there's a very beautiful construction. Very beautiful construction which was introduced by Borel and hence known as the Borel construction or the homotopy orbit space, which is the following. You take your space EG, so EG always, you know, and now suppose you have X, a nice G space, GCW complex, always be assumed to have nice spaces, and we take the diagonal action of G on this product. And what this does is multiply X by a contractible space. multiply x by a contractible space, so the homotopy type of Eg cross X is the same as the homotopy type of X. However, now the action is free. And free actions are very good because you can divide out by the action and it's a covering space. One of the principles in the theory of group actions is that if the action isn't free, then the orbit space can be quite ugly. It's kind of like an orbifold. You're in an orbifold situation and orbifold type. Workfold type, and we know that the singularities and all that can be quite messy. So, this is a way of freeing things up, dividing out. So, you're, and that's why it's called a homotopy orbit space. And now, we consider the cohomology of this space. Often denoted, this is often called the Borel cohomology, because I guess technically it is not the equivalent cohomology. The equivalent cohomology, but some people still call it the equivalent cohomology. And here's a symbol for it: it's just a cohomology of the Braul construction, again, with any coefficients you want. Now, if you're an algebraist, you say, well, what is this? Well, what you're doing here is replacing M, a module, by the co-chains on X. Co-chains on X are a perfectly good object with a G action, and you can compute these X groups. X groups with coefficients in the code chains on X. And X is any GCW complex. So you would wonder, well, how complicated is this chain complex? Well, the modules which appear there are permutation modules up to sine. So it's quite a simple chain complex from the point of view of each of its View of each of its terms. They are, of course, glued together geometrically, which makes it interesting. And of course, everything is equivariant. So you're really taking the G hypercohomology of the code genes on X. I was reading somewhere where that term is now antiquated and rarely used. Okay, you might want to talk about sheaves if you want, but okay, I'll just here I'll just say chromology of the Cohomology of the group with coefficients in the co-chains. And oh, sorry. Let's assume here that X is finite-dimensional, GCW complex, or even finite if you're uncomfortable with that. But let's assume the homology is finitely generated in general. So these are the kinds of spaces you want to look at. So now, if you worry about examples, well, you know, in geometry, the more geometric topologists want to look at spaces. Topologists want to look at smooth actions on compact manifolds. And there's a nice theorem that says that these can be triangulated. I guess who results? It goes back to Illman, maybe? You have a GCW complex structure on your compact manifold. So then all the theory that we're talking about here will apply to those examples. Okay. All right. Now All right, now we're in very classical cohomological territory here. So first consider the projection onto the first variable. So if you take EG cross X, there's a map onto EG. And now divide out, that's an equivariant map, and you can divide out by the G action on both sides. Sides. Now you can check, and this is due to the fact that Eg is a free G space, this gives rise to a vibration where the fiber is precisely X. So you have this very classical vibration of the Borel construction mapping onto Bg with fiber X. Now, we like vibrations because it gives you a nice spectral sequence. And the spectral sequence here is like the basic object. Spectral sequence here is like the basic object used in the theory, comological theory of group actions. But it's just the Sarah spectral sequence associated to this hybrid. By the way, once talking to Sarah, he told me that it was Borel who taught him spectral sequences and how to use them, which I thought was kind of interesting. So then we define the Borel cohomology or grandchildren. Borel cohomology or Grand cohomology as simply a cohomology of the homotopy orbit spaces. Here, whatever coefficients. And now, as we said, you think of that as that thing. Oh, here we're here. And that's a spectral sequence, E2 term, E2PQ. And it's the usual HP of G with coefficients and HQ of X with Z coefficients. So that is potentially twisted. This would be with twisted coefficients. So here I Coefficients. So here I should mention that if you have a finite group acting on a space, then the cohomology becomes a module over the group, the group algebra, and it's not necessarily a trivial module. If the space is connected, then the thing at the bottom is going to be a trivial module, the H0. But otherwise, you can have all sorts of different modules. And there's, in fact, realization theorems about what modules can appear in the cohomology of a space, etc., etc. In the cohomology of a space, etc., etc. So, that's an interesting area of mathematics. Okay, now the second projection map where you map onto x mod g, that's trickier because as I said, you know, x mod g, the map from x to x mod g is not covering a map if the action isn't free. Now, you have associated to this a Le Ray spectral sequence. Okay, so this can be defined using, of course, sheaves and things like that. In this case, the spectral sequence we'd like to look at is really a combinatorial version of that. And it has E1 PQ equal to the Qth cohomology of G with coefficients in the Pth co-chain of X. Now, this is really. Now, this is really what we're doing here, is really related to Bredon cohomology. You're sort of computing Bredon cohomology with coefficients in group cohomology. But nevertheless, this can all be obtained algebraically using the double coaching complex associated to the X computation and taking the two filtration. Taking the two filtrations gives you these two spectral sequences. Now, if G acts freely on X, then this is a vibration, and the fiber is Eg, which means that this is a homotopy equivalence. Now, this is important because if X is a finite-dimensional complex, then X mod G is a finite dimensional complex. So that would mean that for a free action, the cohomology, the X. Action, the cohomology, the equivalent cohomology quits after a while. Okay, keep on going back to that one. Now, algebraically, that corresponds to the co-chain complex being a free VG chain complex. And then the equivalent cohomology is simply the cohomology of the invariants. Because when you compute this, when this thing is projective, the higher-derived functors are all going to be zero except for q equals zero, right? Then you just compute an invariant. So then you're just computing invariants. So now, more generally, E1 term can be computed using the cohomology of the isotropic subgroups. So typically Cp of X will be a direct sum of permutation modules, and you'll be getting the cohomology of these subgroups. You know, permutation modules, the cohomology of a permutation module is the cohomology of the group underneath, right? If G mod H, cohomology of the permutation module of the original. module of the orbit G mod H is just the cohomology of H. So then you get the input for the cohomology of the subgroups coming in. And this is just an indication that to really understand a finite group action, you have to understand all the isotropic groups, all the fixed point sets, and how they all are put together. Of course in this lecture I cannot explain all that. It's a quick trip, remember, and this is a quick trip for commutative algebrais. And this is a quick trip for commutative algebrais. So we're going to start turning towards the algebraic aspect of this, so-called cohomologies. So, okay, the homology of X is finitely generated as an abelian group. So it's a nice thing, you know, budget of Z's and then finite groups, finite abelian groups appearing there, and then quitting. And now, if you look at the first spectral sequence, you can use that, you can see that the cohomology, the occurrence cohomology is fine. The occurrence cohomology is finitely generated over the cohomology of PG. So these are all modules, nice modules over the cohomology of the group. That's why the cohomology of the group plays a very special role in all these considerations. Now, if you, finite groups are okay, but we actually don't know their cohomology a priori. I say, here's a finite group, tell me its cohomology, you know what it is. But if I give you a unitary group and I ask for the cohomology, Group, and I asked for the cohomology, you immediately reply, yes, Chern classes, we know that. Everyone knows that, right? So we can kind of shift the problem over by saying, well, every finite group can be embedded in a unitary group. Say G maps into BUN. So now we have a nice vibration with compact fiber. See, this is the continuation of the vibration you'd have. You'd start out with UN mapping to UN. You start out with UN mapping to UN mod G with fiber G. And then this is the classifying map of that fibration. And it turns out that then you can extend it to BUN. This is again a classical process for algebraic topologists. So you have BG as the middle term of a vibration where the base is BUN, a nice space. We know its cohomology. It's polynomial algebra. Polynomial algebra over the Chern classes. And these are C1 up to Cn, where they occur in, Ci occurs in degree 2i. And this is a compact finite complex. So now, from the point of view of commutative algebra, that means the objects aren't all bad. Commutative algebra should be happy right now, at this moment. You should have had a realization. Oh, sorry, it's moving around so much. If we take the Poincare series for the Ecuadorian. Poincare series for the equivalent cohomology mod P, then, and this result I believe is first due to Venkov. So, Poincare series, okay, maybe some call it the Hilbert Poincare series here in this crowd. Okay, it's the sum of the dimensions of the cohomology. Oh, I forgot the t to the i. Okay, it should have been a polynomial term here, t to the i. And it has a form r of t divided out by a product of 1 minus t to the 2i. product of 1 minus t to the 2i. These come from the Chern classes. And R of t is a polynomial with integral coefficients. Now this guy has a pole at t equals 1 and that is precisely the cruel dimension of the equivalent Cohom algebra. And sort of telling you what's the size of the largest polynomial sub-algebra sitting inside there. So, um, okay. Building on that? So, wait, this doesn't depend on the choice of how you embedded the G into the unit, the representation you chose. I've seen that. Well, you can write things in many different forms in terms of polynomials, right? So, this is a particular choice that you're doing, but it's giving you a general, a structural, a general structural result. But you can embed it in a But you could embed it in a much bigger one, for example, right? Then you'd have more than Okay, now let's do Smith theory. Might as well. Smith theory was a theory, original theory of how to use coherent methods to obtain fixed-point theorems. Now, this was all blown away by Borel with his construction. With his construction, he could show that there's a close connection between the cohomology of the fixed point set and the space itself for particular classes of groups. For p groups, that's a classical Smith theory. We have these two results. If P acts on a space X with a multi P homology of a point, then the fixed point set are not empty and in fact have the multi P homology of a point. Of a point. We're the first interesting fixed point theorems after the Lefschetz one, of course. And the other one, if X has the mod P homology of a sphere, some weed, sorry, then X P also has the Mod P homology of a sphere, the fixed point, if it's non-empty. So what do you use to prove that? Well, you have to plug it in, sorry again, you have to plug it into the Borel construction. Into the Borel construction. So the key fact is that in sufficiently high degrees, the echoing cohomology of X looks like the Echoian cohomology of the fixed point set for a group of order P. And afterwards, what you do is that you use that every P group has a central group of order P and you use some kind of iterative construction, which I well that could be one of the exercises for the artist. Exercises for the art list. And the key thing is the cohomology of the group of prime order. Our first cohomology calculation, the cohomology of the cyclic group of prime order, that's the same as the cohomology of the infinite length space. That's the LP infinity. And that is a, you have a class in degree two of infinite height and which is torsion of order p. And this was my attempt to write that. This was my attempt to write that. I hope I wrote this in the way that commutative algebraists find acceptable. And so these are the ingredients that make Smith theory work. And that's where you see that the cohort of the group is playing a role. Okay, now this leads us then to think more generally in elementary billion p groups. Elementary billion p groups play an important role, of course, in transformation groups. Of course, in transformation groups and in the rank conjectures. In fact, the rank conjectures are stated in terms of the cohomology of elementary Bulgarian groups in general. So let's figure out what their cohomology is. So the cohomology mod P can be computed using the Cuneth formula from this thing over here. If you look at this guy, the interval cohomology, and then you compute the mod P cohomology, you get that if P is equal to 2, it's going to be a positive. Is equal to 2, it's going to be a polynomial algebra on a one-dimensional generator. And if p is odd, it's going to be an exterior algebra on a degree 1 tensored a polynomial algebra on a degree 2. So, and then we apply the Cunev formula. And so, if we have a product, and the cohomology of a product of groups over a field is the tensor product of the cohomologies. So, we get this very nice result that the Mont 2 cohesology A very nice result that the mod2 cohomology at the prime two, the mod two cohomology parameterian two group is just a polynomial algebra on elements of degree one. And for p odd, it's an exterior algebra on these one-dimensional guys, tensor polynomial algebra on the two-dimensional guys. So that's, for those of you who are familiar with the theory of Lie groups, we have a maximal torus or torus. Taurus or Taurus, and you know, the cohomology of the torus is this nice polynomial algebra. These are the tori for the finite group theorists, the p-tori. But this difference exterior and this makes it rather interesting. Okay, now the other big theorem I want to mention here, as part of this background talk, is the localization theorem. So just so you know what the general theory is in terms of the fixed points. Of the fixed points and the bigger picture. So now we've specialized. Remember, we said general groups, the NP groups had something special. Now elementary BNMP groups. We're focusing on them. And the localization theorem says the following. And this one theorem, I believe, was first written down by Borel, although I think the definitive proof was written perhaps by Quillen. I don't know. Okay, suppose. Okay, suppose now you have a P-elementary abelian group V, the product of ZP's. Then there exists a class in the second cohomology of infinite height, such that the inclusion of the fixed point set into X induces an isomorphism between the equivariant cohomology. So here is the usual equivalent chromology here of X. This is the, what would be the equivalent This is the what would be the accuracy cohomology of the fixed point set because this what that would be after inverting the powers of of z. So you have to invert that multiplicative system hence the localization and that gives you a bunch of interesting results and it was like quite an important result when it first came out okay and by the way I'm not talking about the parallel universe of Taurus actions. Of torus actions. I believe Bernhard might talk about that. I'm just limiting myself here to finite groups, but there are also versions of some of this work for torus actions, actual tori. Okay, now I do want to mention here that there are important elaborations on this cohomological approach that uses the theory of homotopy fixed points and the t-functor. And folks like Lan and Dwyer will. And folks like Lan and Dwyer Wilkerson have done, did a lot of work on that. In fact, they have a paper called Smith Theory Revisited, I remember. So there's some very nice, much more recent, well, relatively recent work, like 40 years after Smith's stuff, that elaborates and gives you much more refined information about the fixed point set coming from the echo variant cohort. Now let's focus in now on the cruel dimension bit. In now on the cruel dimension bit. So, the question, we go back to that question as to what is the cruel dimension of the Ergovan cohomology ring. And his theorem is that it is equal to a number, let me call this R of X, which is the rank of the largest elementary abelian p subgroup that fixes a point in X. So you look at your action of the group and you determine what else. And you determine what elementary Belien group, the one of maximal rank, that fixes a point, which occurs as an isotropic subgroup. And that's going to be the cruel dimension of the Aggregate Cohomology. Now, in the case of a point, that tells you that the cruel dimension of the multi-chromology of a group is equal to the P rank of the group. And that was a conjecture due to Atia and Swan. Due to Atia and Swan back in the old days. So now there's more refined versions of that in terms of isotropy varieties and etc. But let me just give you here a nice version for the case of the group homology. So again, you have restriction maps for all the elementary abelian groups. And now we look at the category of elementary abelian P subgroups with inclusions and conjugations. Groups with inclusions and conjugations. And the result is that the restriction maps induce what is known as an F isomorphism. Namely, the kernel is nilpotent, and given anything here in the image, a sufficiently high power of it will be in the image. So this is a computation up to no potence. So it's a very, very nice kind of foundational result. Of foundational result. And there is also a version of this in terms of the varieties associated to the group cohomology. Now, on some occasions, you get actual computations. I just wanted to give you an example here. For the symmetric groups, one of the classical results, going back to Nakaoka and others, is that the monthly cohomology of the symmetric groups is detected on elementary abelian subgroups. So, this just means that this limit, this is actually an isomorphism for the symmetric groups. Okay, now the last thing I want to say about the general theory here is that sometimes you can get nicer results if you use a complete resolution. Now, this is a leads. Leads to what is known as Tate cohomology. So you take, you know, here you're using the fact that the projectives and injectives, if you're looking over a group algebra, things work very well. So you take a resolution of the trivial module, and then you take its dual and you splice them together. And this will give you an acyclic complex that builds. That builds on a projective or free resolution, and then this co-resolution. And that's what is known as a complete resolution. And it was used by Tate to define the Tate cohomology of G, the coefficients in a module. However, we can also do this in the context of a covariant cohomology. And this was first introduced by Swan. And this was first introduced by Swan. We can use, sorry about that. We can define the G hyperchomology of the co-chains on X using a complete resolution. Now what that yields then is a theory. So do it as before, right? You take the hom g of the complete resolution into C star of X and you compute the cohomology of that. So you get a theory which is graded over the integers, over all the integers. Over all the integers. And now we put a little hat on it. So that's the Equivariant take homology. So it has some nice results. First of all, if the G action on X is free, then the Equivariant cohomology, the take homology is trivial. In other words, the orbit space no longer plays any role. Essentially what you've done is eliminated the contributions, the low degree contributions. The low-degree contributions coming from the orbit space. So that makes things very clean. The second property is that this is a torsion object. Multiplication by the order of the group always annihilates the Ecuvian Tate cohomology. In other words, it has what we will call a finite exponent, and it's an exponent that divides the order of the group. Now here, what I'm not talking about is something called the transfer. Are something called the transfer. These theories, there's a way of going, you know, we've seen restriction, but there's also a theory called transfer, which you can see by taking sort of inverse images and going up and adding in the co-chain complex. And the point here is that if you use a transfer argument, you can see that the order of the group annihilates the takeoff model. The tail cohomology. It's the same argument as you'd use for the cohomology of a finite group away from degree zero. And now, in sufficiently high degrees above the dimension of x, this theory is in fact the same as the old theory. So in terms of any asymptotic kind of behavior, it's just as good. But as I said, what it's done is gotten rid of the orbit space. And as before, there are two nice spectral sequences coming from these filtrations. From these filtrations. Now you'll have the take cohomology of G with coefficients in the cohomology of X. Again, with any coefficients, you can do this. And the other one is the one from the other filtration. You'll have HQ of G with coefficients and Cp of X. And that's where when these are all free, you'll see immediately that this is zero. So the take homology is going to be equal to zero. And so this is a technicality, but it actually proves to be useful in some of these restrictions. And some of these restrictions on free group actions that we're going to talk about very soon because we're running out of time. Sorry. Okay, free group actions. Given a finite complex X, can we describe the finite groups that can act freely on X? There's your problem of the day. And we've seen that, for example, given a point, the only group that acts freely on it is the triple group, right? So what can we say about something like a sphere, for example? About something like a sphere, for example. So, a basic restriction is given by the Euler characteristic. If g acts freely on X, then the order of the group must divide the Euler characteristic of X. You can see that by subdividing and looking at the cells. So, for example, it's easy to see that the only non-trivial group acting freely on an even-dimensional sphere is Z-Mod2. Now, for odd-dimensional spheres, the situation is much more complicated, and the first foundational result. And the first foundational result was due to Smith in the 1940s. And he proved that if G acts freely on a sphere, and here we're taking an odd sphere, then it cannot contain Zp cross Zp as a subgroup for any prime P. Well, first of all, we observe that the action has to be trivial in homology of N is odd by the Lefschetz fixed point theorem. That just means that, you know, well, we know it has to. Know well, we know it has to be anyway. If you cannot multiply by minus one on the homology, right, in the case of p equals two. So that means that the top level homology is a trivial molecule. Okay, so now we're going to use a spectral sequence argument here to prove it. Now, for any subgroup Q and G, the Ecorient K cohomology is zero. We just saw that. So the differential in that spectrum. So the differential in that spectral sequence, in that first spectral sequence, is an isomorphism. Because there's only one differential in the spectral sequence, because there's only two lines, right? And that spectral sequence has to give you an isomorphism. So now we identify this term, the E P n term, and it's the same as the cohomology of Q, and this is the differential, and this has to be an isomorphism. So now this. So now this implies that Zp cross Zp cannot occur as a subgroup because we know that Zp cross Zp contains a polynomial algebra of rank 2. So it cannot have this quote-unquote periodic behavior. So with this condition on the cohomology is a condition which is called periodicity. And that's because things are repeating themselves every n plus 1 degrees. Degrees. And what this shows you is, in fact, the cohomology of Q of any subgroup has to have periodicity, period dividing n plus 1. And now it's a result in group cohomology that this result is in fact equivalent to every abelian cell group of G being cyclic. And we know what these are. These are the groups that have PCL subgroups, which are either cyclic or generalized quaternion. There's a classification. Generalized quaternion. There's a classification of periodic groups, groups with periodic cohomology. So, this is like the first application of methods from cohomology of groups to restrictions on group actions. Now, let me describe another restriction, which involves the exponents. And we're in a situation actually we could describe it very completely. So, suppose we have a connected free GCT. Have a connected free GCW complex, then the order of the group divides the product of the exponents of the take cohomology of G with coefficients in the cohomology of X. And pay attention to the degrees. Here's H minus R minus 1, and here's HR. This is a result due to Browner from around, I guess, 1983, 82. So it's telling you. Telling you that if you have a free action, then you must have some cohomology here which is generating some exponents enough to build up the order of the group. So here I'll give you a proof and very different from his proof. You just use a spectral sequence. You have that spectral sequence with E2 term converging to zero and E2PQ is this. And E2PQ is this, HP of G with coefficients in HQ of X. And now at the bottom, you have H0 of G with coefficients in Z. And take cohomology, the beauty of takeoff is that H0 is torsion and Z amount the order of the group. Now this one has to be killed in the spectral sequence because the limit term is zero. And all you do then is look at the differentials which are involved and do a little bit of algebra. A little bit of algebra, you see that the order of the group has to divide the product of these exponents because these have to kill that cyclic summon of order, the order of the group. So it's a very, I would say, succinct way of expressing this importance or this contribution from the exponents. Now, we're going to tie it into rank. Now, suppose that g acts trivially on the cohomology of x. On the cohomology of X. So, this is an important assumption which you will see topologists like. That means that the modules, homology modules, are actually trivial models. The action is trivial. So, if gx trivia on the cohomology of x, then the order of the group divides the product of these exponents. That's what the simple corollary. So, that's telling you that a certain amount of cohomological torsion must be present to allow for a free action. To allow for a free action. So now let's consider our old friends, the elemental Belium P groups. Elementary Belium P groups are unique in that for any degree different from zero, their cohomology is annihilated by P. They're the only group, only finite group that can satisfy that. So on the other hand, in degree zero, you have a Z mod the order of the group. Zeem on the order of the groups. You have a large exponent in degree zero and the lowest possible exponent everywhere else. Okay, so now let's consider an elementary BB and P group of rank K. And now rank conjectures. Okay, the rank of V first appears in the word rank. And now for a finite connected complex, let's define dp of x to be equal to the number of degrees greater than zero such that the cohomology of x with co-omulum. cohomology of x with coefficients in the integers localized at p is different from zero. So you look at all the lines in the spectral sequence where localized at p, it's non-zero. These are p-torsion phenomena. That's why we do that, just to get that. Because if there were torsion at different primes, that wouldn't really matter for us. And the basic proposition is the following. If V acts freely and homologically trivially on a connected finite complex, then the rank of V is less than or equal to. then the rank of V is less than or equal the dp of x. And that's because you need to have p to the k will have to divide the product of p, all the p's which can appear here, and that's precisely the dp of x, p to the dp of x. So therefore, the rank of v must be less than or equal to dp of x. That's already telling you that if you have a big p torus acting freely and homologically trivially on a space, it's going to have to have a lot of non-zero. It's going to have to have a lot of non-zero cohomology sitting there. So now, the most celebrated application of. Oh, what am I doing here? All right. We haven't done products of spheres yet. So what time is it? Okay, running out of time. So let me just go quickly here. Maybe I'll skip this result and go to the products of spheres, because I know you love products of spheres. This is the observation that That you have results which apply to non-free actions. So you can use group cohomology to obtain a result where the co-rank of the maximal isotropic subgroup appears instead of the rank of V. But we'll skip that in terms of in the interest of time. Okay, so let's go to the celebrated case of a product. To the celebrated case of a product of spheres. So, conjecture, the basic conjecture is if an element of the MP group V acts freely on a product of spheres, Sn1 up to SNK, then the rank of V is less than or equal to K. Now, you saw for a single sphere, the Smith thing, then there was a result of Connor. He proved that for a product of two equidimensions. For a product of two equidimensional spheres. And this is a paper from the 50s. Look at his paper. He says, This can be done for products of spheres, as many spheres as you want. I found the proof. But there is no proof. It's just like a note added in proof in his proof. And in this generality, I think it first appears in a paper that Browder and I wrote. But it's a well-known conjecture. People like Borel and so forth knew about this. Borel and so forth knew about this. It's been considered by several authors. Let me focus here on the equidimensional case. We have the following theorem. Well, if V acts freely and homologically trivially on a product of equidimensional spheres, then the rank of V is less than or equal to K. All right. Well, okay, we can give a proof here. This is the proof. This is our proof. That's not his proof. If you take a product of Sn to the If you take a product of Sn to the K, then Dp of X is equal to K, because there are K lines, right, which occur above degree zero. And therefore, the result follows, because we have the hypothesis of the previous result that we talked about. So now if you want to consider the non-homologically trivial case, then you have to deal with some representation theory. Some representation theory. Here's a result of mine with Browder from way back. For P odd, if V acts freely on the product of equidimensional spheres, then the rank of V is less than or equal to the dimension of the invariance mod P plus 1 over P minus 1 times the K minus the dimension of the invariance mod P. This uses the spectral sequence as a bit of rational representation theory. So, a bit of rational representation theory and some equivariance of the spectral sequence. So, now for p equals 2, n differing from 1, 3, or 7, you can use a modified approach to establish the bound. And the key fact there is that for those values, the cohomology of x is a permutation module. And that's due to Hopfin variant 1 considerations. So, a sphere is different from 1, 3, or 7 don't have an H-phase structure. So, the kind of representation. So, the kind of representations which occur are very rigid. Now, the case n equals 1 was settled by Ergun, and he's here, I think, using Bieberbach groups. And therefore, we have the following theorem, which is a combination of a work with Browder and Ergun's result. Let V be an elementary B and P group acting freely on S into a K, then the rank of K let's equal to K if P is odd or if P equals 2 and Or if p equals 2 and k is different from 3 or 7. I believe the cases 3 and 7 are still open. I guess we can ask Gergun if he's worked on those. So that's kind of where we're at for elementary, for equidimensional spheres. Now, more generally, a case of equidimensional spheres permuting the basis in homology gives rise to a stronger bound. And here, this is a result that's a proof of. A result that was proved with Dave Benson using methods from group cohomology. Suppose you have a group acting on a product of X-dimensional spheres, such that the basis corresponding to the spheres is permuted by V, then the number of orbits of V on the basis is at least R. In other words, the rank of V is less than or equal to the dimension of the variance. Now, some advertisement for the Advertisement for Bernhard's lectures, he settled the general case provided P is large relative to the dimension of X, kind of a stable version. And I believe he will tell us about that in his lectures. Now, when topologists saw this about actions on products of spheres and so forth, then, well, what about general actions of finite complexes? Shouldn't they be supported by large enough mod pico models? Supported by large enough mod peak homology. And Gunnar Carlson formulated this conjecture, which of course has its analog in the theory of chain complexes and commutative algebra, I believe. And it says very simply, if V is a P-elementary median P group acting freely on a finite connected complex X, then 2 to the rank of V is less than or equal to the total sum of the homology of the complex. This has been said, all I get. This sentence said, Oh, I guess where p equals 2, k less than or equal to 4, and other cases, more recent ones, probably. Now you can ask the same algebraic question for free chain context, and of course that's an interesting topic in its own right, and I believe a topic for some of the other lectures. And where the topology and the algebra separate. So when you have a topological space, you have a lot of extra structure. So it's who knows? Maybe someone here at this conference can say. Maybe someone here at this conference can settle this conjecture. Quick question. What's K? Oh, what's K? Where's K? K is the rank. K is the rank of the group for Z2 to the fourth complexes. Now you can apply those exponent techniques to do the non-free version. In fact, one can show. One can show that the rank of V minus the maximum of the rank of the isotropy subgroups is less than or equal to K. Same conditions. So it's the non-free version. And in fact, you can have a more general conjecture, which would say the following. If x is a finite connected VCW complex with a maximal rank isotropic VX, then 2 to the co-rank of this maximal rank is less than or equal to the sum of those dimensions. Now, an interesting approach here is to take a suitable extension of the field for which there exists a group of units in the group algebra of appropriate rank, which acts freely. And this is something which you can do through the theory of, I guess, homological varieties and group cohomology. So this is perhaps the most general conjecture you can have about pre-group. Conjecture you can have about pre-group, about group actions of elementary Beauty groups. And now, in terms of, if you want to find the references to all that, I'm giving you references where you can find the references. So, and this is all online in my, well, they're online. And the second two papers are online. They're on my website. Okay? I think. I think I'll stop here. Sorry if I went a bit too slowly, but that's what I was told to go slowly. Thank you. Thank you very much. Are there questions from the people here in the audience? I have one question. So, there are this results. I have one question. So there is a result on the free actions and then the conjecture on the non-free actions would use this corral. So is the non-free result obtained from the free ones? I mean, what's the relation between the two of them? Okay, so the results, I guess the part I skipped. Here. Yeah, so here, you know, the point is that. The point is that if you look at the exponent approach, you can show, we'll go back. The exponent of the equivalent cohomology is in fact the order of an isotropy subgroup of maximal rank. So then when you look at that spectral sequence, then you see that this co-rank or this index is what you need. So you can get that rank appearing here, that inequality falls me. Here, that inequality follows immediately using the same techniques because it doesn't really depend on it being a free action. And then, if you go back and think about the proofs here, the proofs of these results use techniques of degree. And again, that degree, again, that's a result due to Browder, but also follows on these results with Take Homology. That we have a free action, the degree of an action on a manifold is the order of the group, but then if The order of the group, but then for this one, if we generalize with elementary Belian groups to the index of the maximum rank isotropic subgroup. So now, if you say, well, let's think from the point of view of mod peak homology and ranks more classically, it turns out that if you have a co-chain complex of permutation modules, then you can always find, for other intermediate groups, you can always find a group of units which will act freely. Which will act freely on this co-chain complex. And then you can apply the homological algebra to that group of units, so-called shifted subgroup. And of course, if there's a trivial sum and, if there's a fixed point, then that thing will have to be the trivial group. But say, if there is no fixed point, you know, because then the formula of force is meaningless because rank of dx is equal to rank of b, and you're saying that force, a connected complex, has a dimension at least one. Least one. So that's where that evidence would come from. So it would follow from the free one, from that point of view of homological algorithm. Thank you. Okay, are there other questions from the in-person audience? Maybe I just have a quick comment. I think Carlson's conjecture is known for rank up to three, but the rank four case, I think, is only known for product of spheres. I think it is only known for product of spheres. I defer to the experts. I don't know, but yeah. Are there questions from the virtual participants? I just say again, I didn't actually ask and understand the answer. So, like you're saying, the proof of the more general conjecture, you might approach with the shifted subgroup, but. With the shifted subgroups, but you cannot, in general, see that the free conjecture implies a more general one or what? Well, if you have the free one purely algebraically done for chain complexes in some setting, right, then you might have an idea that this would be true. But we as topologists and the way everything indicates we have using exponents, for example, which is look. Exponents, for example, which is look, which I say, we can see why this would be true. But that's what I meant to say. Okay, okay, okay. So it's not that the one implies the other, it's just. But I guess if you had the free one, we know we don't have the chain complex one now, I guess, right? So that would not imply it, unless there were some special conditions that would, you still have the group action on the space here, but now you have the shifted subgroup. And there are some problems with the Group. And there are some problems with the half algebra structures there when you go to shift in subgroups. I see. Right. Okay, thanks. And if I can just say a word that tomorrow's lecture, we'll talk about the converse problem, namely constructing actions. Given the group of rank K does it act freely on a product of phase spheres. Are there any questions in the chat? We can't access the chat. But we can speak up, so there's none here. Okay, okay, and just comment. All right, then let's thank Alejandro again, and we're looking forward to tomorrow. Thank you. So the people who want to discuss can stay, and the otherwise please go for coffee. We'll meet again in 25 minutes. In 25 minutes. Yeah, so yeah, only if you're talking to the virtual people, she
