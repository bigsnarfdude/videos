Speaker of the workshop is Yuri Kodyershov. We'll speak about the road to Durong homology. Thank you for the invitation. And this talk is almost okay. It's easy to say completely about not yet done work. So there will be. I will not show any code. Instead, I will talk about some things that I think can be done quickly and other things that need more time. Maybe I will copy at least. No, no, no, I'm erasing. No, no, no, no. It's just that everyone knows it's the number one. Okay. Just use. Okay. So, first of all, do I need to remind the definition of the rock homology? Yes. I guess I do not I guess I do not need to remind the definition of main default, but I will discuss it later when I will briefly describe how they are implemented in METLI. So K4 is a multilinear. A multilinear a multilinear map from E to K generally speaking to some F. Later we will say that F is just real numbers, but whenever possible, I will stick to more general segment. Second. These are what? Nodes spaces, nodes something? E and F, for simplicity, I will just say that they are normed are vector spaces. Parts of the construction work for any vector spaces. Any vector spaces, parts require topology, other parts require norm, but I will skip it for now. And it is multilinear and Uh alternation so it means uh that omega of, let's say, x, y, etcetera, is negative omega of y. Omega of y, x, etc. And this holds for any pair of indices. Then we look at so this is pure linear algebra. Next we look omega k form. K form on a manifold M and this is this means that omega of X is a K form From the tangent space, sorry, I will disturb to R for any point, so in every tangent space we have a K form and omelet. Omega of X is smooth in X. So smoothly depends on X. Again, smoothly can be C one or C infinity, depends on what you want. And then we define D omega it is a k plus one form and in coordinates it is so uh there is an uh exterior uh do I need to remind what is the exterior product of two The exterior product of two forms no. So the of the differential of let's say f dx dy again, there can be more terms is d f dx dy where df is the full differential as one four so this is almost everything I wanted to say about purely mathematical part and uh uh yes and uh Yes, and d of d omega is zero, so this is a co-chain complex, and we can define cohomology, and this cohomology is called the runo homology of a manifold. Okay and And maybe what I will try to do today is to convince you that actually we can at least define the rank of homology and not prove anything useful about them, but at least define the rank of homology in a reasonable amount of time. Amount of time like several days. So, what do we have and what is to be done? We have manifolds and we have vector bundles we have. We have continuous multilinear forms, and we have alternating maps. So, what and we have exterior algebra which is defined as a special kind of Clifford algebra with some API linking it to alternating maps. I'm not yet sure whether. I'm not yet sure whether we will use this definition at all. Yes? For the last three bullet points, do we have them for vector spaces or vector bundles? For vector spaces. So what is missing first smooth Smooth so first is simple and what's missing is continuous alternating maps. Are you assuming, or should we be assuming, that M is finite dimensional, or are we supposed to also imagine? I'm confused about the word continuous and maybe also the purpose of the term. Yeah, these parts of the construction that work for infinite dimensional, we try to do for infinite. We try to do for infinite dimensional, but whenever we work with finite dimensional, yes, everything. So continuous means like fiber-wise, it's a continuous linear map. Yes. Yeah. So more or less, I mean, one can want to define. Want to define the RAM cohomologies of something infinite-dimensional, especially if it's essentially finite-dimensional, but for some reason, for example, we take a finite-dimensional Cartesian product with just Hubert space, yes, something like that. So So, yes, one of the goals is to use finite dimensional only when it is really needed. So, continuous alternating maps, more or less, you need to take files about continuous alternating files about continuous multilinear and alternating and take the union. I started doing it. I started doing it like yesterday, but I didn't finish it yet. I mean, I copied API about continuous multilinear, but not all the API about alternating maps. Then we need smooth sections. Sections of vector bundles As far as I understand, we either don't have much API about these or Or have it only in some very specific projects. We have a characterization of when maps into vector conversion maps. But you want like the bundled, like the algebraic structure of the space. Yes, yeah, yeah, yes. What I want is vector space structure on this thing. On this thing because I want the nodes in my code chain complex will be those bundled smooth sections of this button this vector bundle of This vector bundle of continuous alternating maps. And at the moment, I mean, you're talking about alternating maps, of course, because we're doing Duran, but is it possible at this stage to be setting things up so we can apply other functors? Like, what if I wanted symmetric powers instead? Am I going to have to reproduce all of this for other show functions? Can't be caused in a way that's generic. Carlos in a way that's generic for what we're doing clipperwise That's an interesting question So in order to do this generically we need to define some Generic API, but some kind of functors here, but I didn't think about this, so let me leave it as a question. And it just seems like I mean, we pointed to many other metaphors last night. Like, surely we should. Yes, actually, I last night I had a look at what At what needs to be ported to get a manifold derivative, and it's about 10 or 20 files, not that much. So, possibly we can do this in Lin 4 without touching Lin 3. So, question is functorial. Functorial operations on vector bundles, not necessarily a tangent space on smooth vector. I think it's already tricky though on the topological vector bundles. It it's not a trivial construction to make the one example of this that we have already, which is the homer bundle. Have already which is the harmony between the two populations. So we can have some finite dimensionality at the source. Oh, but we did an infinite function. Oh, okay. But it's not, I mean, it's not that easy of a construction to get that the right things are continuous in the right functory spaces. Yeah, I mean, it's not clear what the input is. I mean, you know, I know functions for which it works. I think some other dimensions. I'm not clear what set the inputs. I mean, this API can leave some heavy proofs on the user side. Okay, a smooth and topological. So, two questions. Yes, and the problem is that we want to be able to. We want to be able to do both things like hope and symmetric powers and they are different types of functors. Isn't the right notion of this notion of polynomial functions? That's the one I was thinking of, but that might be more. For instance, the functor of taking the absolute value of the division of edge. That wouldn't be algebraic, but it would still be. Still be, it would still be something for real vector spaces, you know, or like fractional power. I mean, you know, there's some version of this that would be for topological, and there would be nicer things for polynomial vectors, for sure. But then. Yeah, and what about like, you know, the bundle of the conjugate linear maps between bundle maps which are different. Yeah, so we might want something. Yes, and one of the problems of using some categorical theory, API, even if it exists, is that we would need to restrict universes. As for me, I am happy with type. With type zero everywhere or almost everywhere, unless we really need it. But it seems that sometimes we need other universes. I don't know whether it's okay or not to do this. Maybe we can. Maybe we can have some special cases. Yeah, so this either we can do this for continuous alternating maps more or less manually and when When someone comes up with an answer to this question, we can rewrite using generic API. And so define the omega. And uh I will separately write correctness of this thing, in which sense correctness. The definition I will write in a minute, it is not coordinate like it fixes a basis, but it uses. But it uses local trivialization, local chart on a manifold. It only uses a norm vector space on this chart, but anyway it uses this chart. So we will need to verify that it does not depend on chart all. It's It's verify and link to particular theory API. API. Possibly we will need to add category of. You just mean the homology API, no? Yes, yes. I mean a homology API in terms of all those civilian categories, things like that. I mean it's mostly the same thing. It's most people here have algebra background, and for you it's easy to think in those terms. For me, homology and cohomology are just those factors of models or groups of Groups so s so and then at this point I would say that we have a definition but then of course there are lots of things that we may want That we may want to do, like formulate and prove Stokes theorem, link these to some other homology theory. For example, prove that it's more or less the same as a singular coherence at all. Heather suggests shift cophomology. But all these can, and of course we will need to prove that it behaves well under isomorphisms. But I think that this This is doable. Yes. Do we need the Poincaré lemma? That's not fine. I think he would need the Poincaré lemma, for example, to prove that the chromology of a contractible space speaks. Yes. Yes. So for the definition, no. But if you want to prove that, for example, a homogenous That, for example, a homology of Rn is zero, then yes, it's also part of the relationship of C and so if we set the bar low at this point, not at linked to other theories, proven natural properties, etc. Properties, etc., then I think that this can be done sufficiently quickly. And how I suggest that we define this exterior derivative. So uh should there be an item called examples? Like just being disgusting. Because in a way if you imagine having formalized all this and you cannot Having formalized all this, and you cannot actually compute something? Yes, but in order to compute something, we would need, for example, Point Karen and Mar. And that's why I specifically stopped at the definition. I mean, it's not. It's like a next stage. Be able to compute something, have at least some examples. But I think that this is the part that just needs time, and I don't see anything that can actually. Anything that can actually stop us here so of x1 xk plus 1 is just the sum over I from one to k plus one of Of negative one to I always forget i or i plus one times the derivative in the direction of x i of omega of x one x i minus one. X I minus one X I plus one X K plus one So usually this formula has one more term with Some sum over I less than J omega of X I X J the Libra to vector fields and then X one we omit X I we omit X J need xj xk plus one but we don't need this term because what I suggest is we take the vocal chart at our point then extend our vectors we want to compute g omega at some some adjectives x1 etc xk plus 1 we extend them as locally constant vector fields then these vector fields will commute and we don't need this term so it just disappears so we define Z omega in the following way we take In the following way, we take a chart in order to compute d omega at some vectors x1, etc. xk plus 1, we take a chart on a manifold, then we look at just x1, etc., xk plus 1 constant vectors in this chart. In this chart, and compute this in this chart. Yes? I mean, just the following work as a basis-free construction, you have a smooth alternating, like on a vector space, you have a you smoothly have an element of the the alternating space, and then you take the Fourier derivative of that and you anti-symmetrize, and this should give you a a k plus one of the k is given to equal. That would be basis screen. It certainly gives you something alternating between models and derivative. So, wouldn't it be the construction you need? The friction derivative of a map between the E and F black spaces is going to be it's going to give you a map from E into the linear maps from E and F. Yes yes, it's more or less the V's formal y thing. But it's basis free. This is also basis free. This is also basis for vectors of coordinates. But those we want to compute d omega at vectors x1, etc., xk plus 1 and we And this is the formula. We don't use any basis here. Oh, I see. So they're not necessarily T by T by I if it's II. This is the directional derivative in the direction of the vector xi. So this is exactly what you said. It's exactly the same formula. Just I added this anti-symmetrization. In disimetrization explicitly. Probably this can be done with this alternating map from multilinear, but or we can just take these format proof properties. Properties. So, what, and of course, it would be nice to have this formula for non-computing vector fields, but as far as I understand, we don't have the lean bracket of vector fields yet. Or do we I don't think so. We don't except for this weird definition of the financial puzzle that we haven't connected to our real definition. Okay. So at least we can we can take this and prove that it is that it works. Uh it works well if you change all of trivialization. Can you explain again your strategy of extending them constantly? With this x1, xk plus one, they are local vector fields, right? Uh no, uh I want to compute G omega uh at x one, xk plus one, they are just vectors in one tangent space. Vectors in one tangent space. Okay, they're vectors. Yes. So you're doing it controlling, nothing relocally. Yes, yes. I just define it in one tangent space. And then in order to prove that this construction actually defines a smooth thing, this I called correctness. We will need to verify. We will need to verify that it behaves well under change of local chart. Because in lean, every point of a manifold has a local chart that is like the local chart for this point. But different points, of course, have different local charts. And we can use this chosen local chart to define something that lives in the tangent space. But in order to prove that it is smooth, we will need to actually show that it Actually, show that it works well with coordinate changes. So, more or less, these and this involves very little mathematical content, but it's just about writing trivial API for I don't know how many hundred. I don't know how many hundreds of lines. These again, we can do it for some specific functors, for example, for these continuous alternation maps. Or we can and it will be about some API again. Yeah, again. Or we can try to come up with a better definition. And this and this are no, I think this is the only non-trivial step where you need to verify that this behaves well. This behaves, well, geometrically, this change of chart will mean that we extend our vectors to other local vector fields, still computing, but other local vector fields. And possibly the best way to prove it is to prove this formula with this term. For example, just prove it in a vector space. In vector space. Something too interrupting, but I thought you said that the way that you were describing was the same as the way I was describing, but the way I was describing doesn't require extending vector fields everywhere. But so what But you cannot extend to commutant vector fields everywhere. If you don't do it locally, but if you want a global construction right away, then what you described is this first term. You will not get the second term. If you extend to C. If you extend to some if you want and in any case if we define it using vector fields then we need to prove that in fact it only depends on the values of our vector fields at this point the value of G omega at this point only depends on Veterus at this point, it does not depend on the way you extend it nearby. So, but do you need vector fields at all? I mean, if you use the local trivialization to give an identification of your bundle of alternating maps with the maps from someone else they see to the alternating. They see to be able to inform something. Yeah, but now I want to prove smoothness. So I have one point and another point. And so I have many points nearby. And for every point, there is V chart for this point. So I guess that you could say, I mean, So I guess that you could say I mean what you're going to say, I guess, prove is that the construction I was describing behaves correctly under change of the coordinates and uh yes, yes. And yes, so we need to show that it behaves correctly and. Sure, that it behaves correctly under change of coordinates, which is not exactly the same as change of trivialization, but pretty close. I mean, when you change coordinates, the change of coordinates in the base and in the fiber are related. But yes, yes. What we need to verify is Yes, what we need to verify is that this definition does not depend on the choice of core. But I guess I don't see why you need to make function vector flips at all. You see, when you change coordinates Coordinates. Geometrically, what we did is we took this bunch of vectors and extended as constant vector fields. But in other, after a smooth change of coordinates, these are no longer constant vector fields. And we need to prove that. But uh i if we uh use buttored to move from one space to okay, the same thing but in other coordinates, then we will have this same formula but for x1, etc. x k plus 1 extended as vector fields that k That came that transferred from one chart to another. But I mean, when you take this vector-field point of view, you're somehow talking about the alternating form by means of its inputs. But can you not consider it in the abstract rather than sort of testing it by comparing it with various inputs? I think that we need to at least think about this as vector fields, maybe not write it as vector fields, but at least think about it this way when we are writing the proof, but maybe you have some trick to avoid this. So again, Again, as long as the only goal is the definition, this is the only invariance of this definition on the change of coordinates is probably the only non-trivial part. In fact, There is one other thing that is missing as far as I understand. And we do it twice for many constructions. When we construct something on a manifold like this thing, but even in simple case. Even in simpler cases, we prove that this construction plays nice with coordinate change twice. First, when we construct and we have coordinate change from one chart to another and to in order to actually construct Construct, for example, a smooth function. If we construct a smooth function on a manifold by using this chosen chart at every point to define this function at this point, we need to show that our construction does not depend on the chart. And this is one occurrence, and another is when. Occurrence and another is when we prove that dithomorphisms or smooth maps between manifolds play nice with our construction. And as far as I remember, in many cases, we more or less repeat the proof twice. I don't know how hard is it to Set up some machinery to avoid API duplication, or at least to avoid proof duplication. This is another question I don't know how to answer yet. And And sometimes a very similar thing appears in the definition of some group point we use to define manifold structure. There are not so many group points, so this doesn't happen very often, but another source of code duplication. Okay, any more questions? Somewhat of focal, most probably parallel but opposite direction of what Edith was suggesting. So, are you really doing it functally? Since at certain point we will need one credit, not for these, but later on in Bible needs. Can't you do it locally on a sufficiently small neighborhood where a technology is trivial? And maybe it makes it a lot easier to loop from one piece to another. Piece to another rather than do it immediately? Anyway, we want to know that what we get is actually a k plus one form in each tangent vector space. So we want to be sure that it It only depends on the when we evaluate it of some, for example, vector fields, it only depends on the values of these vector fields at that point. With all these, can you prove they're finite dimensional or even? Or you will be looking I was without going to singular I think that most of this should be true in any final space. Yes. I don't know. Uh I I s so uh I uh uh I was mostly thinking about the way how to define, just get to the definition because I wanted some goal that I can work on during the workshop and At least get close. So, okay. And for questions, one question when we're talking about smooth versus topological before, is what's the framework for having some kind of group where you're just saying what the structure group is for the bundle and you want your functor on vector spaces to preserve that? We have something called structural report that allows us to do with topological and smooth manifolds, for example. And there is some There is some machinery how to do it, and of course, any answer to this should somehow play nice with this machinery. But it was written by Sebastian also. I guess I need to read the code before answering questions. The code before answering questions. I know that there are people in the room who used this part of API more or less and we've heard it before.
