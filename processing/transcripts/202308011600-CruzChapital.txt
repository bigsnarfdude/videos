Yes, it's not the interpretation that it's just that I download it from web and I don't know how to change it. Yeah, so this is a joint work with Osvaldo and Stebo. And as the title suggests, I will be talking about construction schemes. They were introduced as well as capturing actions by Stebo in its paper, Construction Schemes for Non-Separable Structures. And at the same time, construction schemes have its origins in. Have its origins in Gabuan Morazas introduced by Jensen. There is a problem whenever someone tells me which thing do I work and I tell construction schemes, they ask me what is that. I say like Morasses and suddenly the interest disappears. Yeah, I remember like the first time I heard about Morasses, it was like hearing Oaxaca, and I asked someone. Like hearing Oaxaca, and I asked someone, like, what was what is Morasis? And just said, it's something difficult. And that was like all the answers. So like in the first part of the talk, I would like to convince you that Moraces is not like what its name suggests, just more or less in the same way like death bread, that is like a famous bread in Mexico in some celebrities. Some celebrities is not actually made of dead man or something like that. That was a very bad joke, but you still laugh. Okay, so I will start by talking about two construction schemes. I will tell them like that, or simplify the omega one more. Okay, so what is that? You take a family which is partitioned into Is partitioned into omega many families of finite subsets of omega one. And this family has the following properties. The first thing is that, well, how do you construct each of these FKs? You take one level, I mean subsets of omega one of a fixed cardinality, and you just take a collection, a sub-collection of that family, taking care that. Family, taking care that in the first level you take them all. Okay? That family has to be cofinal. You take any finite set. There is a member of the construction scheme which contains that finite set. It has to be coherent. Anytime you take two guys from the same level, the intersection is an initial segment of both. So here is where like So here is where we start thinking about applications of construction scheme or Morasses. We want to construct uncountable structures by finite approximations. We can think of each level, Fk, to be coding some finite approximation of an object we want to construct indexed by a particular ordinal. The thing is. The thing is that, well, there may be many elements of the same level which have the same ordinal. And we want those approximations to be like in a certain way coherent. So usually what we do is we define the approximation in such a way that the definition of that approximation only depends like on the position of the order. On the position of the ordinal respect to one element of the particular level, which has that ordinal as an element. So if this intersection is an initial segment of any element that, of any two elements, well, our definition will be okay. And these three properties are easy to remember. The last Remember, the last one is also easy and it helps us to improve approximations. What does it say? Like you take an element of the construction scheme that is in a certain level, where that level is greater than zero, and you can decompose that element of the construction scheme exactly as two elements of the previous level. And that decomposition looks like this. Like here, I have. Looks like this. Like, here I have one element, here I have two elements. We know that the intersection is an initial segment of both, but in this case, both elements are ordered in this way. We have a delta system where it's the root, the first part minus the root, and the second part minus the root. Okay? You remember all? Okay. So before I tell you. Before telling like some like real results, I would like to convince you that they can be easy to use, the construction schemes. It's not that it's something really, really difficult. So, for that, I will need to introduce to you two functions which are relevant for Relevant for construction schemes. But before that, and I forgot, well, I put all this for you to remember one last time that I finished. As quick remarks, we have that once an element of the A finite subset of omega one is trapped by an element of the construction scheme, it will be trapped by another element in each further level. Okay? So, in particular, for singletons, we know that they are trapped like in the first level. So, what does this tell us? Is that in any level, there will be an element of the construction scheme which has that ordinal as an element. Which has that ordinal as an element. So, in this way, we can define approximations for each level. And it's exactly this. The cofinality in principle is globally, but once you contain an element in one level, you will contain an element in each level. So, in one level, all have the same size. So, you can see that. Oh, yeah, fine. So you can see oh yeah, by the way, the source scary doesn't need to be trapped by the case. No, no, no, no. Usually they will be trapped mo much later. Okay, and this is what I was telling you about, like the coherence in the approximations. If an ordinal is in two elements of the construction scheme, then this part will be the same, no matter which F or G you take. F for G, you take as long as F for G has alpha in it. So we will define the approximations only taking care of this set. Okay? So the first function I will tell you about is C. This is like funny because I didn't know the name of this letter, but every time I read in Latin, every Greek letter that I don't know, I call it C. Actually, Mario told me that this letter was actually named C. So I had a lot of luck with that. So, this function, all that is telling us is in which part alpha lies in a given element of the construction scheme. If it lies on the root, c is minus one. If it lies in F0 minus the root, it will be zero and if it lies here. And it lies here, it will be one. Nothing, just naturally saying in which part those alpha lies. But there's something so the function depends on k. So I guess you're probably missing a sub-index k on the f evaluate. Oh, yes. Here I wanted to say f sub k. Sorry. Yes. The next The next function is a row function. So, here the pair alphabet by coffinality is trapped in some level. As I said before, it will be trapped in many levels, but we take the minimum level in which it is trapped. And in this level, it happens something funny because here we have alpha, here we have beta. Here we have beta. This is the element of the construction scheme. And in principle, you could think that, well, beta could be here or alpha could be here, but if beta was here, then alpha and beta would be in the previous level, right? So this is the only picture possible for the row. An important property of the row is that it is an ordinal metric. What is an ordinal metric? What is an ordinal metric? This is the part of the definition. Usually it does not appear, but if I write it this way, it looks more like a metric. So rho of alpha beta is equal to zero if and only if alpha is equal to beta. It satisfies the triangle inequality as long as the smaller one of the three ordinals you're calculating the metric is under. Is on the left side of the equation, and all the balls are finite. And this is like a very important property that we will use. Not only the balls are finite, but in fact, when you do the proof, you can conclude that the ball actually looks like this. You take an element of the construction scheme. Of the construction scheme at level k, which has beta, and the ball of radius k centered in beta will be all the elements of f which are less or equal than beta. Okay? And an important thing about the row is that it determines some kind of coherence. means some kind of coherence. Like when you take two ordinals, alpha less than better and you look at the key of both of them, there are like two critical points. The first one is in rho. In rho, they will be in different parts of x. One will be zero. Of c one will be zero, and well will one well will one will be one. This was just this picture. Yes, minus one, zero, and one. So this critical point will help us to achieve like certain critical properties that. Properties that we want our uncountable objects to have. And after all, there is some stability in the decision of Xi with respect to alpha and beta. What do I mean by this? Either the C are equals from rho upwards, or the smaller one will have C minus one. Minus one. All that this is saying is that, well, they will be on the same part of the decomposition. But if you are on the same part of the decomposition, you are either in the root or in the decomposition minus the root. Okay? Well, so remember this? The properties? Have you remembered it? Have you remembered it? Okay, and remember this. With these three properties, we are able right now to construct an omega one omega one gap. So what's an omega one omega one gap? We take two sequences of size omega one of subset of omega, and we say that those two sequences form an omega. Those two sequences form an omega one, omega one gap if both are increasing. If for a fixed alpha, A alpha and B alpha are disjoint, and there is no set, infinite set, separating the right part, the A alphas, from the B alphas. Okay? And like there has been some discussion about Hausdorff graph yesterday and And at least what you, if you didn't know about Hausdorff gaps or omega-1, omega-1 gaps, you know that they were created in the past century, right? So this is not something new. And like the there are like many ways in which one can construct omega one, omega one gaps. The usual way is not difficult, but when you first enter into the terrain of set theory, Enter into the terrain of set theory, it may be like one of the first things you struggle with when doing a transfinite report. Here we will construct one using construction schemes. A way in which we can assure that one family satisfying these both properties is omega one. This is an omega one, omega one gap is only to assure that this property is satisfied. This property is known as the Hausdorff condition. What does this property say? You fix a beta, you fix a k, and all the alphas which are less than beta such that this equation occurs is just a finite set. Okay, so Let's start partition a meta like this into infinitely many pieces, each of size two, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Okay, we will use the construction scheme to do what? In each level, we will define an approximation of each A alpha. An approximation of each A alpha and each A beta. This approximation will be defined by telling you which point of A alpha of this set of two points lies in A alpha, which set which point of these two lies in B alpha. Okay? So we take an alpha in omega one, we take a particular level, and we approximate alpha and B alpha in this way. Alpha in this way. If C is minus one, if alpha is in the root, you will add nothing. If C is zero, here you will add two K to B alpha and you will add two K plus one to A alpha. And if C is one, you switch the decision. Okay? So from this drawing, Throwing, it should be clear first that the A alphas and the B alphas are disjoint, right? Now, when you take an alpha less than beta, this set here will be contained here. And the same with the B alphas, right? Why is that? Right, why is that? Because if k is bigger than rho of alphabetical. So we have two cases, right? Either C in alpha is C alpha of rho equals minus one. In this case, we didn't add anything to the approximations in this level. So it doesn't matter what the approximation. Doesn't matter what the approximation's value is in beta in this level. This set, that is the empty set, will be contained in here. And in the other case, both Z's coincide. So the approximations are exactly the same. This is telling you that both the containments are Nothing more. Me too. And so is this argument correct? Okay. So now we need only to verify the Hausdorff condition. And to verify the Hausdorff condition, we take a look at the critical value that, as I told you before, is row. So in rho. So in rho, C alpha of rho equals zero, and c beta of rho equals one. So I define the switch, right? So blue intersects with red, red intersects with blue. And what does this tell us? That in particular, for example, two of rho alpha beta always belong to A alpha B beta. But um this set is finite so but all for all but finitely many elements of omega one which are less than beta there will be an element greater than k in omega which belongs to this intersection, right? So the Hausor condition is satisfied. So now we have a Hausor gap. So now we have a Hauser gap and this is like a really concise way to write it. It's beautiful, right, isn't it? Okay, so now I want to talk about capturing actions and to talk about And to talk about that, let us see this gap for another moment and trying to say more about this gap. For example, if you fix alpha and beta, as we saw before, this element is in the intersection between A alpha and B beta. But can we calculate the actual intersection of A alpha and B beta? How hard is it to calculate a given intersection of A alpha and B beta for two given ordinals? And for this, I will introduce two more functions. This is set. The first function is the k cardinality. So So I take alpha in omega one, I take k in omega, and I take an element of fk such that alpha is in f. The k cardinality of alpha is just the position of alpha in f. That is the same as, well, as I said before, taking the ball and without alpha. The second function is the delta function, the first time in which both cardinalities differ. Okay? So in the construction of the housework app, the construction only take well was defined in terms of the x function. And the x function can be calculated. Can be calculated in terms of the k cardinality. Like, do you believe me in that assertion? Like this picture of F, of any element of the construction scheme with which lies in the level K. In the level k will be the same. Like these lines will be in the same position. So in order to say that alpha lies in here, here, or here, I just have to tell you like how many elements are between here and alpha. Okay? The following properties are satisfied when we look at the four functions like at the same time. The first one is that delta of alpha beta is less or equal than rho. That should be obvious because in rho, we have one element of the construction scheme which has both alpha. Which has both alpha and beta, and alpha will be less than beta in the drawing, right? This is just the definition of delta. If k is less than delta, then the cardinalities are equal, and then the x's are equal. And exactly at the point delta, we will have more or less the same picture as what happened in the row place. Placed with the exception that in this time it is not necessarily true that alpha is in the piece zero and beta is in the piece one. The values or the drawing could be exchanged. So if we take these basic properties in joint with the other basic properties that we saw of Rome, we would have this. Rho, we would have this picture. The intersection of A alpha and B beta, I wanted to say this, would lie between this set and this set. So like the real use of the analysis lies between what happens in delta and what happens in rho. In rho. Okay? If somehow we would have that delta equals rho for a particular pair of ordinals, then we would know exactly that the intersection of A alpha and B beta is two times rho of alpha beta. Okay? So, like a dynamic picture looks like this. We are in the place four, we have two different. Place four, we have two different drawings. The places are equal, they are still equal, equal, equal, equal, and the tenth, let's say, is where the delta comes into place. Okay, so at this point, there's like a lot of chaos. I just throw this like on cocaine or something like that. And at the place 17, rho comes into place. At play 17, both alpha and beta are trapped in the same element of the construction scheme. So these two pictures collapse into one. In this moment, the blue is here, the red is here in different pieces, and after that, there comes again stability, right? They will be in the same or. Or the blue will be at the root. Okay, so now it comes the definition of two capturing. What this action is trying to do is to reduce all of that chaos in the strongest form as possible. So we will say that a construction scheme is two capturing if any uncountable X has two elements out. Has two elements, alpha and beta, for which the delta equals zero. Okay. All the definitions are understood. Okay. So the capturing action two, CA2, is well, you take an increasing sequence of M case. Remember that I was thinking of the M case. Thinking of the M case as the cardinalities of the elements of a particular level. Maybe I should have remarked that, but yes. If you take a sequence of MK satisfying some properties that I will talk more specifically later, you will have a two-construction scheme which is two-capturing, satisfying that the Satisfying that the cardinality of elements of the same level is mk whenever that element of the construction scheme is in fk. And well, this is like the drawing of pin to capturing. You have here an uncountable x, and you can find alpha and beta such that when they are trapped, this distance from here to here is the same as this distance from here to here. Okay? So. So, like thinking about the chaos that we wanted to avoid when we talked about the delta and the rho, we want to right now analyze what happens in this notion, informal notion of chaos when we take a two-capturing construction scheme. Okay, so in order to do that, we analyzed the definition of The definition of oscillation. Whenever we take two functions in omega to the omega, we define the oscillation as this number. You take all the natural numbers such that fk is less or equal than gk, but at the next moment they are switched in order. In the case of construction scheme, we will Construction scheme, we will define the oscillation of alpha beta as the oscillation of these two functions. Okay? So the picture looks more or less like this in the case of construction schemes. Here we have delta, the functions are equal. After delta, well, in the point delta, the functions differ for the first time. After that, there After that, there will be a lot of chaos. And when you reach rho, well, alpha will be always less than beta. Okay? In this drawing, which will be the oscillation, it would be here I have one and here I have two. So the oscillation in this drawing is two. And observe that if delta, well, if delta is equal to rho, then this part doesn't exist. And we would have that these two alpha and beta have oscillation zero. So it turns out that it is enough for that to happen to be able to conclude that for able to conclude that for any uncountable set of omega one we always have two elements of that uncountable set having oscillation k for each k in omega this might remain like you might remember the analysis that stebo did on the for example b equals omega one and the oscillations of functions um remember that was Remember that this is a theory exactly, and that is a really important point. In this study of the oscillation theory of construction schemes, we achieved to get numerous results which are similar or analogous to the ones about B equals omega one of stable. The difference here is that, well, I didn't write. Here is that, well, I didn't write it, but all of these functions are. I even forgot the word in Spanish. Bounded. I are bounded by the functions which tells you the cardinal, this common cardinality of the elements of a particular level. So this is a So, this is an oscillation theory which works more or less like B equals omega 1, but for bounded family of functions. No, here we're assuming a two-capturing construction scheme. Yes, it's also another assumption. And if we work a little bit more, like generalize this proposal. Like, generalize this proposition a little bit more, we can get, in fact, this thing that, as you might remember, is more or less the same coloring with less properties than the one that Stebo constructed in his book, Partition Problems. Like this was one of the first points of the oscillation theory. Oscillation theory. So we have a family O that we're thinking like a corrected oscillation such that well it's like rainbow but not only for pairs but for finite matrices. Every time you color a matrix with omega one many colors you will have two sets a less than b such that the color of the matrix is exactly Of the matrix is exactly the same as the color of the pairs of each side of the square in omega one. So this coloring is powerful, is powerful enough to imply that the CCC is not productive, to imply that there are strong spaces. Are strong spaces and to imply that there are strong L spaces. Okay? What is the assumption? What is CA2? It was that assumption that there are two capturing construction schemes. But I guess you know that that's consistent. Is there something easy to say that we know that implies this? Yes, I will talk about that later. Yes, I will talk about that later, but diamond than coin reals. What is the difference between the two construction? I am like that, was actually a question I wanted to ask you. was actually a question i wanted to ask you but because now for example in your paper when you add one coin real and then like the one uh bana space the definition that you use of uh morass in the amalgamation you explicitly wanted that one element of the morass wasn't actually the union of two previous elements of the elements of the of two elements of the previous level but there were like some points that you didn't cover before and there are like some definitions of morals well obviously doing the the translation with functions in which you have the opposite requirement in which you literally take the definition of a construction scheme that I'm giving so I think that's That like that's the thing. In my knowledge, I think that sometimes the definitions are exactly the same. So there is like the translation would be only like technology, so to simplify volumes. Because then ah, because then I will say um Because then I will say like the general definition of a construction scheme. And maybe there was someone who said, Oh, you were talking about Morasses, now you're talking about construction schemes. I don't know, it was maybe just bad choices. Sorry for that. Well, And well, from CA2, we can also derive the following things. So, as I said, CCC is not productive. We can construct strong S and L spaces. We have this negation of partition relation. We can deduce the existence of a 62P type. We can deduce the existence of a 6. Type, we can deduce the existence of a sousling pre-tower, we can construct a first-countable locally compact text space, we can construct a suslin lower semi-lattice, and we can deduce the failure of vancar net action. So, this is a really powerful action, and I would say that none of these proofs are really difficult, they are more or less. That are more or less easy to follow. For example, here in the construction of a southern lower semi-lattice, this was done first by Tilib Ragaban and Yorioka. And they have their two constructions in their paper. One, basically, adding coin reals. The other one is constructed using diamonds. The other one is constructed using Diamond, and it's a really good proof, but it's like 13 pages long. With this capturing action, we were able to give a proof like two pages long. It turns out that when you talk about that two-key relation of partial orders of size omega one, there are Omega one, there are like five really standing out types like equivalence classes in that relation. That would be omega order in its usual order, omega one, omega times omega one, and the finite subsets of omega one. And just one point. Jorge, can I ask a question? Can you hear me? Can I ask a question? Can you hear me? Oh, yes, yes, yes. Hi, great. Thanks. So, is this? I mean, so under PFA, there's five co-final types for directed partial orders. So, what exactly can you describe this sixth Tuki type? And is it for directed partial orders, Anamga? And it actually the sixth Tuki type is the family of all these functions. Family of all these functions. Does that answer your question? Yeah, thank you. Okay. Yeah, so there are more or less like the same arguments as stable with B equals omega one, but like the closing argument, we do use the two capturing of the construction scheme instead of the onboundedness of the family. With almost damage, yes, yes. Yes, yes. No, no, with the strict domination. With almost domination, it will be well ordered. Yes. That was one of the questions that I will ask later, but I will ask it now. Well, you ask it. Okay, so now we have like the general definition of a construction scheme. We ask the first three more properties, they will be the same. And the only thing changing is the last property, the amalgamation. Before one element. Or one element of the construction scheme was built by amalgamating two elements of the construction scheme in the previous level. Okay, so now for each level, there will be a fixed number such that any element of the construction scheme is constructed by amalgamating that fixed number of elements of the previous level. Of the previous level. And that is the only difference between a construction scheme and a more ass. So we should look like this. An observation is like, well, we can calculate the root by knowing how many pieces we're amalgamating, by knowing the exact cardinality of this set. Cardinality of this set and by knowing the exact cardinality of the whole set. Right? So if we call the cardinality of the root Rk, this will be uniquely determined by Mk and Mk minus one, and this is the equation that determines this cardinality, right? We will call this sequence of mk, mk, and rk the type of the construction. RK, the type of the construction scheme. Okay? So, what is an abstract type? Is the sequence satisfying the properties that we would expect from a construction scheme to satisfy? First is this equation, and we told that in the first level, all the elements must have a cardinality one. There are singletons. This last property is just an auxiliary property. Okay? So, I'm going to go ahead and do this. Oh, yes, this should be R instead of K. Yes. Yes, yes. Yes, it's natural number appears as the root infinitely many. Number appears as the root infinitely many times. And like in order for Stebo to prove this theorem, he used that the abstract types of a construction scheme satisfy this property. We do not know how to construct a construction scheme of a given type without. Then type without it satisfying this property. So it's not really that annoying. In fact, it's useful in some cases, but it's not really necessary when you're working with them. So, yes, Stebo proved that for each abstract type, there is a construction scheme having Git as a type. Now we have Now we have like the same definition of the functions. In particular, the only definition that changes is the x function. Here we have the root and we enumerate each piece. And depending on which piece is alpha in a given point, we tell the xi to be that value. Okay? So now we generalize the notion of capture. The notion of capturing. If you take a construction scheme and we take n different elements of omega, we will say that they are captured if their rows equals their deltas and equals some fixed k. And each alpha i is exactly in the ith position. This condition was not necessarily, what was not necessary. Was not necessary to be specified in the case of Morasses because there we had only two pieces. So alpha zero must be one and alpha one must be two in x values. And okay, so we will say that the construction scheme is n capturing if any uncountable x has some n elements which are captured. Elements which are captured, and we will say that the construction scheme is fully capturing if any uncountable set has any has n elements which are fully captured. Where fully capture is exactly the same as I told you, but where n equals n k. Like you cover all the pieces of the amalgamation. Okay, so see. So, CAN is telling you that for each abstract type, there is an end capturing construction scheme of that type. And FCA is telling you that for each abstract type, there is a fully capturing construction scheme having its type. We proved that the diamond principle implies FCA. Well, originally in the paper. Well, originally in the paper that Stebo wrote, there was a proof of this fact, but there it has like a small gap. Well, more or less, well, we prove it. But the general ideas are of the general structure of the proof is still the same as in steppe of first pip. They prove that a full capturing action holds after adding omega one coin reels. And it is easy to see that full capturing action implies n capturing action for each n, and n capturing action implies n minus one capturing action. So we have like a line that goes like this. They also proved Fulcensio and Damien that the CAN does not imply CAN plus one for any. Plus one for any n. Okay? But how? I think this is more or less based on the observation that if you have an end capturing construction scheme and you have an end master forcing, it is preserved. So you destroy the one sand. Okay, so Okay, so from FCA we were able to construct a coherent Susslin tree, a full Susslin tree, an entangled set, an independent coherent family of functions that maybe this is not known, not like the definition, but it's not really that important to say it here. And under CA3, we were able to construct a CCC destructible to bounded coloring. So, yes, we do not know for any objects that we have constructed that the capturing action required is essential. So, a good question would be if any of these objects can be constructed using CAN for some n. Now I have the problem. Now I have the problems. So, which would be the relationship between the full capturing action and, for example, the club principle? It would be also interesting to know the relationship between the capturing actions and any of the parametrized diamond principles. Like, all the objects known here are known to be Are known to be to exist when you add exactly one coin real. So does FCA follow when you add exactly one coin real or at least some CAM? Is it consistent to have CAM for all n but not FCA? Your question. And in general, it would be interesting, for example, to know. It would be interesting, for example, to know which kind of suslin trees can be constructed using the capturing action. So, how much time do I have left? Okay. So, thanks for joining. I had one more slide in case I have 30 minutes, but Okay, so plenty of time for questions, and I think on Zoom. And I think on Zoom, you can probably just unmute and ask, and we'll manage. Yeah. Okay, anything. So under CA2, you said you get a six two key type, but let's say under diamond, you can get the maximum number. Do you get that as well under CA2? That's also a question that we have in our propin. We don't know how many sub-tuki types. We don't know how many sub-2KI types we can get for having the CA2. We don't know even if, for example, for two different construction schemes having the same type, type in the definition of a construction scheme and being too capturing, it follows, for example, that the six two key types determined by its cardinality functions are equivalent. So I remember you constructed also with these things this loose in family where every comfortable set can be separated from its complement. Which of us that was just to capture the more paths? Just in CFC. Yeah, I know, but it was just so it came just from the Yeah, I know, but it was just so so it came just from the two ka whatever two from a Moras from a Moras, I see. Which is something like strange because like uh in your your paper there is also a construction with a Moras and somehow there is like problems arising like make the construct to not direct. So I don't know like there is something about Morasses that I don't know, but I That I don't know, but I don't know what I do not know about them. Okay, thank you. Does anybody know what he doesn't know about? More questions. Yeah. So maybe I just missed it. So, does any of this CA give you a destructible gap? Yes. Yes, yes, Fulgensian Stebo proved it. I think from CA3, you can have a destructible gap, or by using a small variation of CA2, in which you capture elements, but like first you partition omega into two pieces, two infinite pieces, and you ask the condition of capturing to be satisfied in both pieces. So if you have an uncountable, Pieces. So if you have an uncountable X and one piece, there will be two points of that uncountable X such that they are captured and they are captured in a level of that piece. Thanks. Any other questions? Okay, if not, let's go ahead and thank the speaker again. And we break for coffee and
