Much it's a real pleasure to be here, and uh, and real pleasure that it works. So, uh, I will explain uh what I did the few last year to understand this question of multiplicity in versation theory. And uh, I'm a bit different, my point of view will be uh to relate this question to index theory, so the plan. So, the plan of my talk is as follows. I will explain the basic branching law for compactly group, where we will see that we have the classical custom formula. And after, I will explain that in the case of a symmetric pair, we have a non-abelian location formula. And at the end of the talk, we will see that. And at the end of the talk, we will see that this non-abelian recognition formula in the compact setting still works when we look at restriction of discrete series. So this case is a small case relatively to what did Oshima in this talk, but the methods are different. So here some dedication are. Here some detection as I follow. I work with connect compactly group the representation ring L of K and when I put minus infinity is that I allow I allow formal sum okay of this form okay when you are like that when it's fine lambda when it's finite sum this is an element of k and when you allow infinite infinite and this what i and so the the standard point is that you want to understand the this uh the branching laws the multiplicity map that governs the restriction Governs the restriction. And but what we will see is that we will usually give a decomposition formula of this form. In fact, you look at you have a representation of K. When you respect to H, it belongs to the representation of H, but you will look at this element inside a bigger space, this one. A bigger space, this one, and so we will look at the decomposition of this element here as a finite sum of generalized representation. And we can start with the most basic example is the custom integration formula. If you want, this is a case where h is the maximum tourist. Where H is the maximum tourist. And here we see or we recognize here we have a finite sum and each term here, you have a symmetric, you have the polynomial. And you recognize that each term belongs to this vector, to this group, R minus F info T. And what I denote by the bar is that you take the opposite. Is that you take the opposite complex structure? And we have also, Caston gives also a formula in the non-Abbian case. And there is a situation where the simplest situation to explain this formula is to suppose that you, so I take T maximal to raise of K such that the such that the intersection with t with h such h intersection with c is maximum h so i take the tangent space k over t h over h over t and i take a supermetary h model and and if you suppose that this vector has no invariant vector either zero so we we we have this So we have this formula and you can ask yourself why we need this formula such that this is true, but it's easy because here, if this part was not equal to zero, here you will see that from this part here you will have infinite multiplicity. So it does have meaning. Okay. And from this formula, you can see that when you take h equal to t, this formula goes back to this one. So what I will now do in the next slide, I will explain how we recover this abelian look decomposition from the point of view of index theory. And after we Index theory, and after we'll see that we will propose another non-Dabelian localization in the case of a symmetric pair. So let's start with the basic fact. I will call always F the flag variety of the big group. So each time that you have a character lambda, you Lambda, you can define a line bundle. And when lambda is dominant, we know that the restation is given by the section, holomorphic section on the line bundle. But me, I will not work with this Borel Veil point of view. I will work with index theory. So in this, we have a In this setting, we have a complex manifold with a line bundle, and we can form a differential operator on the section on the line bundle tensorized by the form of degree 0k. And the classy, so we take the form of even degree, of even degree, form of odd degree. Of odd degree, and the classical fact is that this operator is elliptic. So, what it means? It means that P lambda is elliptic, which says that when you take the kernel and the co-kernel, they are finite-dimensional. Okay, from the point of view of this means that the denial is almost invertible. And so, when you saw the kernel is a representation of because everything here, everything, your d lambda is equivalent to the k. Here is representation of k, this representation of k, and when you make the difference is Sequence is a via toolization of k. Okay, and this is what we call the index. And all the interest in this technique is that each part depends on the choice that you make to define the lambda, because to define the lambda, you need a choice of metrics and so on. But when you make the difference, it's a topology-based. You make the difference, it's a topological invariant, okay? And in our case, we know that this index is an Euler characteristic, but we know from Code-Haw vanishing theorem that everything vanishes and that we have only the section. So this is the point of view that I will have for my presentation. And now I want to explain how to recover the want to explain how to recover the abelian localization formula of Paston. And what we do is that we take a regular element in the Lie algebra of the maximum torus and it defines a vector field on the flat larger T just by differentiation. And since Air is regular, the subset sub-variety where the Sub-variety where the vector field vanish is just the finite set of fixed points for the t-action, and this finite set is parametrized by the group. So, here, here we are in the case where we will localize on the finite set. And so, a way to obtain the formula of Attier single-free. It's given in the lecture note of Fatia Singer in the 70s, is that what you can do is start from your elliptic operator. And I will not explain what this means, but you can deform this elliptic operator with this vector field. And by deforming it, its transversibility. Transability. So, and what is the interest of the translator operator? Is the interest is there? Is that because we start with our representation, which is equal to the index of domain data related to k. So, when you restrict to k. When you restrict to t, it's the index relative to t after you deform, and standard fact in the position theory says when you deform, you do not change the index. And after is the key point is here and is something that happens in with transversally elliptic operator, but never with elliptic operator. And all the point is that you have the fixed point here, x1, x2. x2 okay or you should put x e okay each time the uh okay you have a finite number of fixed points and the thing that you can so what you do is that you put a neighbor of of this fixed point set the neighbor i could be u w so you have an open neighbor Uh, not enabled, okay. And the point is that when you take an elliptic operator, if you restrict an elliptic operator to an open subset, he's still an operator, but he is not elliptic anymore. So, you do not have meaning to restrict an elliptic operator to an open subset. But the key point here is that we Is that with translitigation, and for this one, it's a uh you can restrict, and a kind of exigent property tells you that you just have to analyze the transient operator on each neighborhood. And after you have to finish, you have just to compute and you direct computation done. Done in the book of Attiyah, shows that you recover the part of the Abelian formula. Okay, so what we will do is we will now speak about symmetric pair. So I will first explain a few things about symmetric pair and I Few things about symmetric pair, and I will explain after that we can perform the same idea, but in the non-Navalian case. So let's write notation. So I take a Lie group in an evolution. The fixed point is sigma. In what I in my talk, if there are If there are a doubt about what I said, take the connected component. But just to have a very easy intention, I don't put a zero for the connected component. So I will be interested in the critical set. So what is the meaning of this critical set? Look at it. The flag barity, I remember it's flag variety I remember it's k over t and and the flag variety when you have an element here inside you can you can look at the infinity you have you can look at the infinity zmat stabilizer okay this is a carton subalgebra okay and so And so, or either this is, or you take the stabilizer. Okay. So, here, k over x is a stabilizer, it's a maximal torrent. And so, this cryptical set is just the limit of the flag variety such that the maximal torrent is stable on the involution sigma. And what's the key point here is that when you look at it's an old result of the 70s, is that when you look at the flag variety, and here you look at the action of the fig point set, and you look also at the action of the complexification of the group. When you look at this action, and this action has a finite number of. This section has a finite number of orbits. And another way to express the same thing is to say that when you take an orbit of Kc sigma and you restrict to my critical set, it is defined a unique orbit of the compact group. And so the thing that you have a natural detective map. Dijective map between these two finite sets. This set of orbits is the same as the orbit on the particular set. And this button What I will do now is to explain that a result that obtained Uzawa in 1999 in his thesis 25 years ago. And the proof is related to symplectic geometry. And it goes as follow. So here I've described this map. I've described this map, and you will see that using symplectic geometry, you can describe the inverse map. And how to define that? On the flag barity, if you take a regular element, you see that you can look at it. If R is a regular element, you can identify GT to G acting on R. G acting on R. Okay. And after what you do is that this is a is here identical bit, and you project, you project this element to the sigma invariant element. So, okay, so it's projection. And this map here. Here, I call it PR. And this is the moment map relatively to the action of K sigma acting here. And it is a nice map. And what is the use of the moment map in this scalar setting is a kind of related to geometric invariant theory. Geometric invariant theory. And how do you do that? Is that you take the critical set of the norm square? Here you have a map from a manifold to a vector space. You take an invariant norm here, and so you get a function here. And you use this function like a mouse function. And what is the use of mass function? And what is the use of mass function? We know that we have a mass function. When you take a remaining metric, you take the gradient, we have a way to project any element of the manifold to the critical set of the set. So I take the critical set of this function. I take a gradient vector field of the Laplace. Meta field of the Lafassian of the of the and he has a flow and I take the limit of the flow and it's a classical fact that this map gives you a retraction from R to the critical set and and the result of otherwise like this is in fact my critical set is exactly the critical set that sigma the same thing That sigma is the same thing, and it does not depend on R. And in fact, the inverse map here: if you take an orbit here, okay, P, you take an orbit of K sigma here and you pull back here by the projection, and it gives you the orbit of the complex group here. So for me, this is to tell you that there is a natural relation between the moment map and the orbit of the complex root. So now that we have speaking about that, I can explain how in this context I will do the same thing as before, but in the non-abelian case. Case. So, in the setting where we speak about the simplicity manifold, moment map, the squares moment map, we define what we call the here one vector field. What is this field? This vector field is okay. Remember, you have a map here from your manifold to the Lie algebra fixed by. Lie algebra fixed by sigma and your vector field, okay, kappa, kappa, kappa r. Okay and it's just that you take the image here by x, this is the element of the Lie algebra, and you make you make you take this element of the algebra and you make this element act on x. And since everything is equivalent relative to K, this is K sigma invariant. You have an invariant vector field. And so this is, okay. You have to imagine that this vector, when you take before, when we work with a fixed R, we had an abelian vector field, and this is a vector field which is invariant relatively to the non-Nabelian loop. Relatively to the non-abelian group. And here, the classical fact from simplic geometry: these vector fields vanish exactly on the same set than the critical set of the. And we know from before that this set is my critical set Z sigma. So here is the case relation is quite simple. I mean usually. I mean, usually when we work with inseparate tree, this set is very difficult to analyze. But here, it's very easy. We see that this set is just a finite number of orbits. And we do the same thing than before. We start with our elliptic operator. We deform it in a transcript elliptic operator. it in a transacid leptic operator with my thanks to my vector field the cumulative and and i i do like i i i make the same thing as before i uh the index of the elliptic operator is the same than the index of the transparency and uh and uh by a property of excellent property uh i can localize the computation of the index of the transparency Index of the transparent on each orbit of the critical set. And here we will see after what it is. And if you do the eye computation, what you obtain, you obtain a decomposition which is not the same than the non-debelian. It's constant decomposition. It's a new decomposition, and you can recognize the ingredient from the geometry. Here, you have a sign, you have a finite sum, which is parametrized by the orbit. And each term here it's just a module that is induced by a module. This small group here is abelian. Small group here is abelian, but not connected to abelian. And here you recognize the one-dimensional representation. Here you have the symmetric algebra, and here the exterior algebra. And what I call EXNCEINCI is that here, when you take the tangent space, this tangent space decomposes on a three-module. On the three module, the module where the roots are different from the image by sigma. Here, the roots are the same, but when the root is the same, the image by sigma, what we call there are two kinds of root, what we call complex imaginary and non-complex imaginary. Non-compact imaginary, sorry. So it's a So it's the point I wanted to explain that we can see the decomposition from the geometry. So now I felt how to make with the situation. So H is still compact. Here, everybody is compact. Sorry, I should have put it here. I should have put here is not H is because here I'm sorry, I'm in the yes, here I'm okay. H is the fixed point set of sigma. And your neighborhood to ux is h invariant over index here. Yeah, if ux is neighborhood, you take neighborhood invariant. In this case, In this case, here you have an orbit of k sigma. Yeah, you have an orbit, okay. And so you take a you take a turbulent, the orbit are sub-manifold, and you take a tubular neighborhood of this sub-manifold. It's what I call ux. It's just a tubular neighborhood. And before to go to the Before to go to the discrete series, just to understand the most basic situation is the case of k equal s u2 and k sigma equal u1. So, and here our representation, we know that is the reduced representation are the homogeneous polynomial. Polynomial of degree n. And here we know that when we restrict v lambda to u1, which is the torus, okay, you have the sum of c k, where k is between minus 1 and n, and the difference of k with n is even. Okay, this is a basic fact. And here, And here, what we have in the custom formula. So a way to represent this, you represent this on a line and you put a point like that. Okay, so my character here is the element here with the condition that the difference is even. If you take the custom formula, That the abelian one, but here everybody is abelian. So, you what you write is that this sum is equal to this sum minus n n plus infinity minus this sum. Okay. Okay, this is a if you want the cluster formula, okay, you represent a finite sum as the difference of two services, okay. And if you and here, if you what you obtain here is a very simple example, what I call the non-abelian formula, even is abelian. Here it says that this term is equal to the difference of. Equal to the difference of three terms you have. This everybody minus minus I put a sign like that minus n plus one. No, so plus infinity minus infinity plus infinity s plus one minus minus one minus one. Minus one, minus one, minus one. Okay, so in the classical formula, we have two contributions that go in the same direction, and here we have three contributions, one which is everything and the other part goes in each direction. Okay, so this is the formula here in the simplest case. So I have a ten minutes I've put the my alarm tuck tuck tuck. So I can now explain how this kind of this formula is still true for discrete series. So I consider a real addictive group. I'm meeting discrete. The group emitting difficult series, and here we know that the difficult series are attached to some regular elliptic orbit. And here, I will use the fact that, okay, so G is a big group, so we have an orbit of the big group that leaves. Have an orbit of the big group that lives in the dual of the Lie algebra of the big group, and you look at the action of the small group. Okay, small group is G prime, and here you have a projection from the dual to the dual. Okay, you have a projection, okay. And so, and this projection, when you restrict to the orbit, is what we call the We call the it's a moment map, okay. So, which is G prime equivalent. And the basic phrase with and something that is really important in my talk is related to simple simple geometry. It is what we call the Marsden-Benstein simpletic trendy space. What it is. Space. What it is is just very simple. You take a G prime orbit here, you pull back by the mode map, and you cut by G. Okay? So what I call this is just to take the pullback by O prime and you take the cushion by G. And when everything works well, I mean when I mean, when this is regular value and missing, this carries a canonical symplectic structure. It's all the point. And we start with an admissibility condition. So admissibility, I mean, in the sense of Toshikobayashi, I mean, I said that it is gene permissible, admissible when the restriction does not contain a continuous spectrum. Continuous spectrum, so the restriction will be a sum of discrete series of a small group, and here you have a very nice criteria. Even if it's not easy to see that something is proper map, but at least you see the relation between geometry and analytical property. Proper map, it means that the pullback of compact sets are compact set. And here it's all the point is that if you take when this kind of separate space, what you can do, you take an element C in the orbit, and so it's the same as taking the pullback of one point and you take the cushion by the stabilizer of this point, which is. Stabilizer of this point, which is and what you see, and it's a key point, is that when the mode map is proper, this object is compact. It's a key point. And now, I will not explain how I found this. Is that in fact, okay, I suppose that it is admissible, and in fact, Admissible and in fact, uh, the multiplicity are in fact governed by uh, so I'll write it in different. So, if you take in when everything is admissible, when you take the multiplicity of a big group of a d series of big group domicility, it's the quantization, spin quantization of the The radius space. Here, there are many things to explain because usually this prediction is singular. So yeah, there is a lot of work to explain what does it mean, but it doesn't mean it. And of course, this quantity, this is a nice geometrical result, but of course, this quantity is as hard to compute than this one. Okay? But at least. But at least it tells you something that the method of orbit works well here. It means that if this set, if this reduce space is empty, which means that if O prime is not in the image of the moment map here, if this set is empty, this multiple is zero. So it tells you that we are in the orbit philosophy. So it tells you that we are in the orbit philosophy. If the multiplicity is non-zero, then the orbit O prime should be, the orbit O prime here should be in the image of this moment map. Excuse me, just I want to make sure the definition of simple extra reduced space. Yes. So just I want to make sure the definition. So P inverse sub O of O prime of G or All of all prime, not D or D prime. Sorry, it's the it's the sorry. No, it's G prime. Sorry. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You're right. No, no, because here the group that I is G prime. Sorry. Okay. So in very popular circumstances, this formula tells you that tells you that. Formula tells you that tells you that, okay, because sometimes we speak about multiplicity condition. And here there are conditions you have natural geometric conditions that tells you that this ready space is a point. And when the ready space is a point, then it's not difficult to prove that this quantity is either zero or one. I will not speak about that. I want to explain. So I want to give another formula, another expression of the same result. And it's upon the geometry. So I suppose that I'm in the condition of the orbit of the big space, of the big group, and with the proper moment map. And here we have a Proper mode map. And here we have a very nice result, a basic one that tells us the geometry is very simple. Is that in fact looking at G prime acting on O, so G prime is a non-compact group, is the same, if you want, as looking at K prime acting on a slice. And it's due to the fact that the big manifold is a kind of induced manifold. This result, you can, there are, I mean, there are abstract results that tells you that when you take any manifold with an action of a reductive group, heat away the other slides. Heat always has a slice. It's an abstract result. But here, my slice is smooth, symplectic. And so the key point is that, in fact, all the information of the geometry is contained in now. You have a manifold, non-compact acton with a compact group. And so I. And you remember when I had an invariant, which was the index that defines the orbitation, I use a deformation technique to localize. And here I go in the other direction. The localization of since this manifold IGREC is not compact, the index is not well defined. Not is not well defined, but when you localize with the Kirban vector field, this index is well defined, and so I sum all the contributions and I define this quantity as a sum of this sum. So if you see it's a is, I mean, yeah, I work like a physicist. I mean, I mean, you have something that is not defined and you define, this stuff is not well defined. You define this stuff, it is not well defined. The index of a elliptic operator on a non-compact manifold do not have meaning in the compact case. When the manifold compact, I know it's localized. And what I do is that I define this object as this quantity. And why it is interesting is that in that this quantity contains all the information of the multiplicity. Of the multiplicity. Okay. But this statement or the statement four are the same, but you can imagine because here the simple kilogram of O relative B to orbit O prime are going to be the same than the simple addition of this manifold relative to orbit of K prime. So, since it's my last page, so I will try to explain what is the end of the story. The end of the story is the thing. Even if you don't understand the formula, you have to think that I am interested in something that contains all the information of the MHPC, which is here. I put it, this is Berlin. I put it, this belongs to a ring of the compact K. Here I put a tilt because you have sometimes to take the twofold cover to give meaning. And what I want to explain is that this quantity, this thing is true for any group, G prime. But when we are in the case of a symmetric pair, Case of a symmetric pair, this quantity here looks like exactly the same than my formula in the non-compact abelian stuff. The only difference is if you put away this stuff, okay, if you put away this stuff, this is my formula of localization for B lambda. But here, what I uh what I What I have is that for each critical point or bit, I can define a complex structure on p minus sigma in such a way that we get the formula. And just to understand this formula, perhaps the best ways, we know that there are some cases where p minus sigma contains a complex structure. In the case of emissions, if you start with. Emissions, if you start with an emission symmetric space, it means that when you work with a specific case of holomorphic dispute series, here you will have the same structure for everybody. And so this symmetric algebra you can put out of the formula. And so what you get at the end, you get You recover, or if the old result of Rosenberg, not Rosenberg, Vernian, you will see. In the honomorphic setting, the classical stuff tells you that when you want to the multiplicity in the homomorphic setting, like that, it's the same, then the multiplicity. the same then the multiplicity of V lambda prime k prime v lambda k that's the symmetric of pay prime this formula is true in the holomorphic setting and here in exactly we get exactly this in the setting this symmetric algebra can go out and and the big sum will be just Peak sum will be just V lambda k sorry for having a bit late finish. Well, in some stage, did you assume the Ramco G prime is Ramco G? The big assumption is that we are in the admissible case, or if you want, I am a case where I can make geometry work. So, proper mode map. So, you're working with this grid series, so you're always close or with the red flag, and you may be. And you make this geometry work for other objects, non-discrete series, other homological objects. Sorry, I don't understand. So you are restricting discrete series, too. That appears to as tolerophomology over some objects. But there are other representations that are not discrete series, other comology spaces. In fact, I know that this. I know that these fix series are mostly defined using different techniques or Dolbochomology, but I believe that my feeling is that even I'm not an expert on Dolbochomology, I believe that Double Bochomology, the realm of Double Commergy, is mostly when you work with olomorphic disfigurations. I mean, For me, I mean, from the point of geometry, if you want, when I speak about, for me, holomorphic series, it's a scalar manifold with line bundle. And when you have with non-nomapic disperses, it's syntactic manifold with a spin C structure. And you have the whole shift of the flow. And this makes a big difference. And this makes a big difference to you. And even in the compact case, even in the when you look at with compact group of symmetry, the two behave very differently. So.
