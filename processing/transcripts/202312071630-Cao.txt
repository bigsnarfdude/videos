My talk will consist of three or four parts. First, I'd like to give you some introduction and how to reduce the problem into a two-dimensional case. Of course, you have saw several, maybe hundred times of these equations. Here, the problem. Here, the problem is set on the synergic domain of infinite length. So, the boundary condition at the next is a so-called impenetrable condition or sleep condition. That means the fruit is confined in the domain, we are not passing the boundary. And of course. And of course, you can take a curve of the velocity. Then, from the first equation of the equation one, you get the equation for vorticity. And actually, this term in the red color is something not good. We always want to get rid of him because in the Because in the two-dimensional case, it disappears, it becomes zero, but usually for the three-dimensional, it appears and it's a hard atom to deal with. So, we always try our best to get rid of it. And this is why my talk will concentrate on the so-called helicopter image solution. Of course, the equation. Oh, of course the equation two has a non history. It was first proposed by Hem Hauser. And in his papers, he found some so-called vortex ring. And you have already heard a lot of times in this conference. And something like this, this vortex ring move around there. Move around the action and travel almost at a constant speed. And actually, you have it's those speed can be gave in terms of the circulation, the radius of the ring, and the cross, the diameter of the cross section. Then actually, it looks like this. Actually, it looks like this. So, actually, Chanzhu has given this in his talk. And we also talk about some works of Dar Heroes. In his thesis, he considers the problem like this. If you have a curve in the fluid and affected by the velocity, then By the velocity, then which way should it evolve as the time goes on? Actually, in his thesis, he derived equations. Now we call the so-called bilomo flow. And I noticed that there are some guys called also Rica. His wrote papers recall some history of how they work. History of how the work of Dahheris was first ignited, then people refound his work. So give you a coof, then you have the tangent, you have a low, then you have a biolog, which is a coarse product of the tangent and the loam. So you have this so-called biolog. So suppose So suppose this curve can be parameterized by some parameter S, then the gamma S T should follow these equations. So to follow these equations and here, K bar is a local coach and B B gamma t is a Gamma t is a bilomo at the point gamma t. So the curve should involve focus this equation, which is called now by the biolog flow. If you rescale the time by add the sorry the factor of The factor of this, then it's you will get the simple way of this equation. And of course, you have two you have two examples. One example is a point vertex. Another is a vortex ring. The point vertex is actually you have a line of infinite length, then this line also Line also satisfies this equation. And the second example is you have a circle or a plan, then this also satisfies this equation. Actually, after the work of the heroes, you will have the the two guys have hired a people in armor. The people in armor, they just generalized, relaxed the assumption of the heroes and they proved this convergence under much weak conditions. So now this the problem now is unsolved is the so-called filament conjecture. That means That means giving you a curve which follows the equation of the biological flow. Then can you find the solution of the Euler equation with the velocity whose vorticity is omega omega epsilon? Then, in the sense of distribution, you have a parameter epsilon. As the epsilon goes. Epson. As the epsilon goes to zero, then the vorticity concentrates around the given curve, gamma t. In the sense of distribution, that's actually for general curve. It's not absorbed. It's called the fundamental conjecture. What I'm going to talk about is a special curve, so-called the Curve so called the uh so called the helical uh symmetries uh curve they actually it satisfies the it so for the for the circle on on plane you have a such a uh parameter representation of parameter is it satisfies the the biology and flow equation and with but for the another curve satisfy the biolog is a so-called rotate transnetics but it can be parameterized in this form and actually you have so several You have saw several times in the first talk, actually something like this. So you have a synoda on the surface of the synoda, you have a curve, which involves pi rotation and the transmission. So this two-pi kappa, maybe this kappa is called some pinchy. So you have actually it. Actually, it seems I get this picture from the paper of Professor Fukumoto. It seems, I got this picture from his paper. But I use his paper, it seems he uses the yellow. So I correct, I changed this to K. So such a curve can be. Such a curve can be obtained by move a point on the synodon, by rotator by C, by the angular theta, and at the same time by the translation around the Z action by the Z action of this distance. So you you can of course. Of course, I should stress that as the pinch goes to zero, it becomes a circle on the plane. As the pinch goes to infinity, it becomes a straight line. So you can take the point vertex as a particular example of this vertical symmetry solution. Of course, you can. Of course, you can consider both the case when k is positive or negative, but anywhere we just here we just consider the case when k is positive. As I said in San Juan's talk, when you consider the domain, which is actually symmetric, say the whole space. Say the whole space R3, then you can just consider the solution with the synergic symmetry. So you can use the coordinate of the synergy coordinate. And for the first time in 1917, Frank obtained the existence of the vortex ring. I mean, in the math sense, rigorously. Math sensor rigorously showed the existence of the vortex ring. And he turns the problem into considering the existence of solution of this semi-linear elliptic equation. You have saw this thing in the several talks before. Several talks before. So, anywhere in the symmetric case, you get the operator like this, you get R and Z, but for the Northware solution. But for the two-dimension case, you get a simple minus Laplacian. So in the older case, you just turn the problem of three-dimensional into two or In the two or two and a half dimension, sometimes it is called. So, actually, this is a free boundary problem because you do not know where A is and A, the boundary of A is determined simultaneously by solving the equation. So, it's a free boundary problem. So, you have actually a lot of work has been done. Okay, I just skip this. Okay, I start here. And for the case of helicosimetry, it seems to me it was first studied by Duchy Foi. Duchy-foi, maybe in French, I'm not. In his thesis, he gave the result of the existence. Of the existence of the so-called helical solutions, then it was generalized to the host base. Okay, later on, after that, a lot of people have considered the existence of solid solutions. Okay. So So, first I'd like to introduce some notations. So, you have this asymmetric group and which consists of rotation and the translation around the X3 actions. Rotation of angle theta in the XYX2 prime. And we also have to give a vector field. We call this theta. And we call a scalar function a helical function if actually it's invariant under the action of this H theta for any theta in real. real number and we call the actually a scalar function f is a helical function if and only if you have a you have this this actually is just an equivalent notation of this so for the scalar functions if you if you have the value If you have the value of this function on a plane, then you can restore its value in the whole space by rotating this value. So once you know this value of this f is x1, x2 prime with x3 equals 0, then you get all its values. It's well defined in the space. And if it's a helical, then it's Heliker, then it's the granite of this function is orthogonal to this given vector field. And as for the helical vector field, we have such a definition. And here you have a rotation. You have a rotation of the angular theta. So you actually can take the scalar function as a Function as a particular examples, as the solar components, they it's the same. You get this definition of the scalar function. Okay, so we give the definition of the Henneck solution. What if you have a pair of velocity and the pressure? And the pressure, and the velocity and is both the velocity and the pressure is helium. Then we call this a helicopter solution. Of course, the domain should be invariant under the group action. Okay. So, well, and furthermore, what we assume furthermore, this Furthermore, this vector field should be orthogonal to the given vector field. And what does this mean? This means almost like in the Euler equation of three dimension or the Lavistox equation, with no swear condition. So you have the components of V theta is identically zero. zero. It's almost like this such assumption is almost like the low severe condition. So, you know, under the low severe conditions, you can reduce the problem to the two and a half dimension. Okay. So under these conditions and together with the assumption of divergence free, we can reduce the problem into two dimension case. Okay, so I show you how to reduce. How to reduce the problem into two-dimension case by assuming the oscillator and the helicity and the average fluid. So if the velocity is helical symmetry, then the corresponding vorticity omega can be expressed by the pseudotone. The pseudo-term by the pseudoterm of omega. I just drop the three here and the omega. That means you can take the velocity as a scalar function. So it can be obtained by its last components. Okay. So it's almost like a scalar function. So, and we can So, and we can reduce the problem of the velocity of the all equation of the velocity form into the equivalent form like this. And actually, for the solid components, you get the equation 50. This is exactly the overlay equation of the two-dimensional case. So, you get rid of the red. Of the red, the term of this right-hand side. So you get actually the two-dimensional case. So we can also use make use of the electrical symmetry of the velocity, and then in this case, you can get the To this third components can be obtained by the first one and the second one. So, and furthermore, by user divergence free, we can get this form. And that means if you denote this v hat, the function by v hat, then this v hat is a divergence free. Free and in this case, you can find the something like the stream stock stream function phi and this this v1 the v2 can be expressed by the gradient of the scalar function phi so and and And by the relation of this omega with v and the relation of this v with v, we can get this relation. 19. What does this operator means? This is actually means this. This is actually divergence form of the operator of divergence form. And then the exact representation. Representation of this KH is like this. So this so you get to the okay, this is this matrix K is a have a less property. For example, you get, you know, the first eigenvalue and the second eigenvalue, and it's a positive definite metric. I also need the operator, definition of the operator, the G. The G is actually this, giving you the function f, then you can find the solution of this equation, of course, with zero boundary condition. Okay. And then you get a solution which is defined which Which is defended by the operator G on the F. So actually, what we obtained is a system of the equation 21. So, if you can get a solution of this system, then you get the so-called headquarters, which is solution of the Euler equation. And then we try to get a solution of this system. Okay, by the use of this notation of this operator, then we can get rid of the psi of the phi. Okay, and then you can get this by the you can reduce this to a one equation, okay. Okay. And we 2021 is actually the system of equation and we still feel think it's hard to solve. So we need to find some special form of solutions. So actually, what we are looking for is the rotating solution of this form. So instead of So instead of finding the omega and the phi, we try to find the pair of capital W and the capital phi. And this time t is actually appeared as the angle of this of the rotation. So it seems it's almost like the what we call the travel. Like what we call the travel, the travel solution, travel wave solution. But this time it's rotating. It's rotating solution. The time t appear here as a rotating angle. So we try to find the capital W and the capital P and which should satisfy this equation, this system of equation. Okay. And still, And still, we think it's a system, and we try our best to reduce this system into one equation, single equation. And then we try to find some suitable function f epsilon so that this w and the phi satisfy this relation. Okay. So, and in this case, And in this case, we can choose properly this nonlinear function f epsilon. In particular, we choose two type of nonlinearity f epsilon. One is this t minus mu epsilon, the positive part of this to the power p. And another is some things like a characterized function of this p minus. T minus mu epsilon larger than one and if we choose this f then we get a solution of we get an equation we get an equation of of the semi-linear equation so it's a it's a non-linear equation but anywhere it's a semi-linear equation and this semi-linear equation and this this is a linear and then by choose properly alpha and the beta then we can get a solution for the overlap equation actually alpha and the beta can be determined by the circulation the pinching and the radius of the synod on which the curve is The curve is on the surface of this cylinder with the radio is alpha star, okay. Another way is to find the capital W and to find the solution of this equation. Then, if you can find this W, then you get also get a solution. So, that's true very. So that's two ways. The first way we usually call the stream function method. And this way we usually code the so-called vorticity method. Okay, let me show what our result is. Result are. The domain is like this. You have a synod of infinity length. Synod of infinity length, then we get a solution like this for any given k, the pinch number, and the giving circulation and the given radius less than a star. R star is a given domain, okay, of a radius of the domain, symmetric domain, okay. And as long as it's less than r star, it's okay, okay, but giving three numbers. For the giving three numbers, then for the then you you you get a you get the curve with the helical with the helica symmetry. It's determined by this three number. Okay, then we can always find the epsilon not positive for epsilon small than for positive epsilon smaller than epsilon naught, then we can find a solution. We can find a solution. The velocity and the scalar pressure satisfy this form. The epsilon is the parameter, and as epsilon goes to zero, it's concentrate around this giving helical, okay, helical scope. And the diameter of the support of this vorticity is Is controlled by these two lambda. So this is for the single parallel curve. If you have several, say, M curves distribute evenly on the circle, okay, if you have a cross section, the point is The point is the point are evenly distributed on this circle, then you get a solution like this. You get a solution to this. At this time, this vorticity concentrates around the K curves. And you also have the support, which consists of, of course, K components. And the diameter of each component is Of each component is controlled by these two numbers. And something like this, this is for the m equal to two and m equal to three, you can get a solution like this. Of course, you can also consider the so-called patch type. For the patch type, we have a more precise estimate for the epsilon zero. epsilon zero for the because here we get the this form of epsilon zero we get the exact of number of this and as long as epsilon is less than this number then you can get a solution of this almost the same property as before but what i'm going to stress is that at in this case But in this case, this vorticity, omega, the pseudo components of this vorticity, omega epsilon, is has this form. It's like a patch, okay? Like a patch is a constant of one over epsilon squared. So it's like it's called the patch solution. And for the diameter of this cross-section, you have the You have the uh this uh like this. So I just want to give you the idea of how we obtained the existence of such solutions and we will use the so-called vorticity method as uh Chang Jung has talked about in his talks. So you get to the So you get to the energy function actually is the terms of the vorticity. Okay. Then you get an impartial. Then we define the vibrational functional like this. Okay. You have this term here. And you can find a suitable or admissible constraint like this M epsilon and you have a total vorticity. Total vorticity equals the circulation, and the upper bound of this omega is one over epsilon square. And we can prove that actually the super can be obtained in the admissible set and the maxima element actually. the actually satisfy satisfy the this equation this so we also have some uh stability result because this orbital stability and for the epsilon in the interval of this then as long as the initial vertex is is X is close to the set of all consists of all the maximum element. Then for any time t is always close to the set. G is the LLQ is LQ space. For any Q, larger or equal to two. So this is orbital stability. So, there are already some obvious stability and some assumptions like this, but it seems it's not so easy to verify this such assumption. And also, I'd like to mention some previous result by Davilo Dapi. By Davilo, Dapilo, Moser, and Wei, in their papers, they consider the semi-linear elliptic equations with linearity f epsilon like this. So it's not the same as us. That's me to the power p to the p and by such a choice. By such a choice of the non-linearity, they cannot say that the support of the velocity or of the vorticity is confined in some very small set because you may have some small mass outside this set. This set. So, by such a choice, that's why we choose the non-narrative as t to the power p. By our choice, we can assume, we can we are sure that the the support is confined in a very small set with a red radio less than R epsilon. Than R epsilon. Okay. Actually, our analysis of the solution as epsilon goes to zero depends on the presentation or the form of the Green's function. So usually you get some elliptic equation. Elliptic equation of the divergence form with a matrix like this. You have a matrix which is smooth and you have this equation is uniformly elliptic type. You have actually the eigenvalue is this larger than less than lambda two and larger than lambda one. And in the particular case of helical symmetry, we get a better formula for the Green's function. So we need to use some lemma, some result called the Shotsky decomposition. As long as you have a positively definite A positively definite matrix, then you have such a decomposition, and use such a competition. We can have the formula for the Green's function, for the Green's function, like this. Okay, I will show you actually by this form. Actually, you have a Green's function of the divergence form elliptic equations. From elliptic equations like this, this gamma is actually the fundamental solution. That's the logar squared. Okay. Then you get actually this is the this is a singular part and you have a regular part and in the special case you can see okay in the special case you can okay. Okay. In the special case, it's just the green is the fundamental solution. Okay. And this is and the green function now is represented by the fundamental and this rubbing function. Also, sometimes people use this metric as this form. As this form, then in such a case, you get the Green's function, the composition of the Green's function of this formula. So in particular, if the matrix is Kh, then you get a better representation. Okay, this is actually the detail of our analysis. We need to show first that there is an element which assumes the super, and for this element, the third component is satisfy this relation with the stream function Pussa Ipsum. It's just like a vertex patch type solutions. And okay, so I will not give the detail and skip this. Okay. Okay, and I just say a few words about the second the second method, so-called the stream function method. Actually, Chan Jun has mentioned this before in his talk. Another way is to find a solution of this semi-elliptic. Similarly, elliptical equations. And he in his talk, he mentioned the so-called Lyaproft simulative reduction. Actually, we also try to find a solution for this semilinear ellipse equations, and then we use this as a breaker to construct our solution. And which Solution and which consists of you find the main part of the solution by use the solution of this, and then you try to put this main part so that it is really a solution. And then you have determined the center of the main part by some so-called non-degenerate of the GeoHover loss function. Function. So, I think I will not give you the detail, and I stop here. And thank you for your attention.
