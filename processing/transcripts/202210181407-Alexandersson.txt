And then you check that that formula satisfies, say you wrote a recursion that the polynomial satisfies. Okay, maybe that's what I meant. Except it's not always recursion, but it's just like the functionality or something. Oh yeah, okay. Okay, right, right. Check. So this needs a guess, right? You need. Yeah, that's why I just called it guess and check, and I don't know what I need. I can just replace that guess. Positively, anything. Right. Any curves. Exactly. So we might have a recursion or other properties. Other defining Defining yeah, this is like the first thing you do. You want to prove that two things are equal and the one side is like the conjecture expansion. And then you can prove that they are equal by checking that both sides satisfy the same recursion or satisfy some other ortho orthogonality properties or whatever. Yeah? Just I mean the name just is a just having a representation of SAF. Just having a representation of SNAP. Yeah, yep, r as that representation. So this is like it's the image of a Frobenius map, right? Or GL. Or GL. So Frobenius. So you apply this Frobenius map to some SN module or GON module. So this is the representation, power representation theory. Frobenius is for SN, GL is GI actual character. Actual character. Maybe I should put those on. Exactly. Maybe we should have two lines: one SL and one G L. GLN or G S L N, depending on your religion. Okay, there there's no more. Okay, there's no more. It's very good. It's kind of like family to be. I don't know if it's family, but it's a little bit like how many few crisps. RSK. RSK. So this is a special case of an explicit, just do an explicit payenction with semester yamta. So that's the. So in particular, say, wait, what's up? S, S, one, G. S S T and one tool here would then be using RSK. So some people in the audience might not know about RSK, but you take like a string of numbers, shove it through this algorithm, and you get a simple signal interval out. And if you're lucky, this actually gives a good bias that gives sure positivity. So, for example, the sure positivity of these modified Holidaywood polynomials, you can use RSK for that because this places. RSK for that because this plays well with this co-charge that we heard about. So this is one example you just do a biection. Hey, I still have more than I prepared. Oh, what else? Oh, no, it's okay, I'll go last. Okay. Sorry? Dual equivalence graphs. Yes. Dual dual equivalence graphs. Yes. Where do we put this here? So crystals, this is where you take the monomial expansion and sort of group them together using a graph structure and get Shur components at each you take a bunch of monomials together and then the the sum of these is the Sure polynomial. And the sum of these is the sure polynomial. Over here, it's a similar idea, but you take the gesso fundamental quasi-semitic functions and bunch them together to get something which is sure positive. And usually for a lot of these functions that we've seen, like LLT polynomials, McDonald's polynomials, and so on, we know what the Gessel fundamental expression is. It's fairly easy to compute. And for chromatics, it's also very easy. So if you don't know what these fundamentals are, you should really look into them. They like L alpha. L alpha bunch together, say to blue. And then gives you these sugars. That's the main idea. So we define a graph structure on these objects pushed up together. Sean, how does anything? I'd like to just state the obvious, which is expanded to something that you already know is sure positive. Expand positively into something that is sure positive, which has actually been very effective in some cases. Okay, is it yeah? Okay, expand into something sure positive. Okay. There's a method with not doing the sure functions that Laziac mean. Oh, okay. I I that that was not on my t-shirt. Now to me and a t-shirt. I was excited when I heard that. I knew you could put up, show that they're e-positive. Right, that falls into here. No, this is sure positive, but many of these can maybe apply for e positivity. This you can apply for e-positivity. I guess this you can probably. Positivity, I guess this you can probably do maybe by action with something might be positive. Sorry, can you say the final one again? I never think that. Non-commutative sure functions that James suggested. This is not something I have experienced this time. Non-commutative sure functions. Yeah. This is another one that made the under list expand it to show positive. Can you talk cloud there? Oh, so sometimes we change bases. So we go to P and then P. So we go to P and then P to sure. And the way that they Gasharov showed that you need interval graphs are sure positive. Yeah. You use the change of basis, actually. Yeah, change of basis. I was waiting for this. Awesome. Thank you. Change basis. You change to sure basis, right? And then you only cancel the signs, which is the very tricky part, but you can do it, right? Change basis. Basis. So you can do say use the inverse costume index. Use the inverse costume, right? Is Gashnov related to the bijection and RSK? No, he doesn't do RSK. He does some Jacobi 3D. He does some C? It's a sign reversing evolution. He has his P tableau. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he uses Jacobi 3D determinants, for functions, and then he has does a sign reversing equation. Does a sign version? Yeah. Oh, so that's. Yeah, when I played this game on Math Overflow, that's what I was saying. You've already played this game before? Yeah, on Math Overflow. Oh, I see. Right, so you can see that. So you don't know what's going to end. Okay, so yeah, we can take, say, we know the expansion usually in monomial basis, and then you can apply the inverse Cosca matrix. So you get some signs, but then you have to be clever and cancel them. So yesterday there was a paper. So, yesterday there was a paper on the e-expansion of chromatic symmetric functions that uses this technique. Read archive every day, like I do, for example. So, this is like it's it this is, I guess I forgot the title. E-positivity and inverse cost wasn't the title. I forgot the title. So, if you go into ComNetWorks, Monday's submissions. They're able to show that certain institutions for certain politicians have positive sum. So it's better than Stanley's, I mean in certain cases Stanley's will result at the sum of the multiplicities of the E's, right, with the partitions with X number of parts. So if they have someone to certainly you don't have to worry. Yeah, so it's not solved. You don't have to worry. Yeah. So starting versus evolution, there's also another trick you can expand into, you take the guesstill expansion or fundamental expansion, maybe that's what I should say because I want to be consistent. And so you And so you write your polynomials as some of these guys, but then you replace each L with S. And that's the Shur expansion. The problem is that what you do with the Shur polynomials index by a composition. And here you have to, you get on signs and you do something called like the slinky rule. It is similar to this. What's it Jennifer said that you used for strengthening, yeah? Similar to strengthening operation here. You get zeros or plus or minus plus. You get zeros, so plus or minus the true polynomial. And then you still need to do a sine-inversing evolution. So this is like this method is a sine-inversion evolution, basically. So L alpha is mapped to S alpha, but then you have to fix this with sine reverse conversion. If you don't know how to do this, you think of Jacobi through the and just re switch the roles. Switch the roles. I have a description on this on the symmetricfunctions.com webpage also to do this. There's a web page? Symmetricfunctions.com, yeah. Let's see that one. It's a really good resource for the record. They're making money off of this? I wish, I wish. I wish. Yeah. So Yeah. Maybe you should just find out what's nice to do. Yeah, so symmetric functions don't come with this. Yeah, you do, then maybe like you can go popular. Many of you have already seen this. If you search for short polynomials or dual immaculate growth and date polynomials, I think you will get there. But anyway, so the order of which you gave these answers also tells a little bit about what we feel. We like Christots because we get a lot of extra stuff for free, but we really don't like this one because it's, you know, with canceling all signs, it's hard, it's like, it feels weird a little bit, right? So, yeah, we prefer not to make this type of proof, maybe, but we would like by action with. But we would like by action with Sevinstade loss. That's something we for more. Yeah, but you know, you can do this first, for example, to prove that something is positive, and then you can do, but maybe you don't get that something is, you might not get a formal evidence, right? You can only get a evidence to do that. Yes. So, I mean, can I add a question to this discussion, which is that I'm, for sort of a non-expert in symmetric function length, which of these would naturally give you these combinatorial formulas you're after, right? Right? Or like, you know, which of these would also give you a formula as part of the package. The combinatorial rule for what shore is a year. Maybe it lies inside SM representation, but some answers to your question is the theory species. Theory of species. So that's a general So that's a general theory for combinatorial constructions. And you immediately get from the description of the combinatorial construction you're having, you get equations that tell you how to write down the words. Okay. So there's there's a set version and there's a vector space version. The set version will will The set version would go with the SN and the vector space version would go with GS. But that's a general theory of what is a combinatorial construction. So can I actually maybe ask, just offer another perspective on Morse's question? I mean, I guess some SN representation, maybe Francois knows more than I do about this, but some SN representation methods, like when you get SNP, Methods, like when you get a set module whose expansion is your symmetric function, it's not always immediate to go from that to what, like some combinatorial formula for the expansion. So I would actually vote for crystals on that because then with crystals, the highest weight element of each connected component of your crystal, if you can combinatorially define what those highest weight elements look like, that's often a way you can get a combinatorial expansion. And then also, yeah, I mean, my preferred method is the guess and check. I mean my preferred method is the guess and check, like the gr like you figure out what it might be and then you like try to prove that. But just by like guessing. Yeah, I don't know. So I'm going to talk about this tomorrow so maybe I shouldn't give a preview. But basically if you actually have a formula, it would be very easy to prove it, relatively speaking. So if you actually can guess something, then it would be easy. I'll give some examples tomorrow. And the other thing is, so with the change of basis, it might work, but you will have to find some nice involution and figure out what to cancel. And then whatever remains is going to be your combinatorial interpretation. So again, there is gonna be an example. So maybe the So I would say that maybe you start with one of these. You might not have a formula, but once you start working in this corner and you cancel, the stuff that remains will inspire you to come up with a formula. Yeah. So maybe one could just say, like, all of these could lead to combatoidal formulas depending on how much, you know, like how explicitly you know some of these. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So this is a way to sort of So, this is a way to sort of be intimate with your network lobby. So, start examining them and so on. But, you know, so Crystals also gives you an SN representation for free. That's sort of a nice thing with the package. And it also basically gives you a bayechnical semester for free also. Yeah. So I and I guess you get R S K maybe because you have a R S K tweet here, so When you say crystals do the SN representation for one, my understanding is crystals give you the GL action report. Maybe it's the GL. Okay, but crystals, it gives you an SN action on your object at least, right? Oh, I guess from the crystals. Oh, yeah. Can I just feel? Sorry, I just feel bad because we have, I'm trying to mix like geometry and other, and one of the obvious missing ones. One of the obvious missing ones would be like to say that the coefficients are intersections of varieties or something like this. I mean, there's many geometrical issues. The coefficients of the F lambda. Sure. Don't forget raising options for the same thing. Yeah, we put geometrically products of geometric functions into sure functions is the intersection of two varieties in the Gratonian. To get a little bit more specific with that, one way to get a whole little bit expansion is sometimes to do FQ. Like figure out that your coefficient is the number of points of a variety over FQ and then figure out, oh, that's coming from things that look like spring-high. Sorry, that's probably a little bit too specific. Too specific. Well, I think maybe there's too geometric. Well, I think you guys are RSK. Right. So tell me what you're doing. Is it an RSP thing? Yeah, it is. So I think maybe you gotta put a spring of fire. Okay, so they are related, okay? Yeah. We put an arrow here. Draw a line. You know, even the interval. That's right. Yeah, you have to compare an interval. That's right. Yeah, you have to convert it up. You're given a symmetric function somehow. Shouldn't how you're given it influence which of these can possibly work? What are you given when you're given this? Well, yeah, it depends. I personally am used to be given the monomial expansions. The monomial expansion. And you want to know that. So that's how the LLT polynomials can be presented, for example. And there's also some generalization of And there's also some generalization of these unit interval graphs where they're positive D is still open for geometric symmetry functions. But we're like given like it and like it's like five, you know, not infinitely many of them, but just one of them, and it's not like 20 billion terms, then I'm going to say it could change the basis. Yeah, for one specific, yeah, that's that you can do. I mean, useless danger. Yeah, so this the computer can do this for you, of course, yeah. Right. Right, the cost uh they can figure it out. Yeah. What is twenty dollars terms uh yeah. Uh the so yeah, so we heard, I think, we heard the P tables mentioned in some talks, right? The P tables. So they give the short expansion of chromatic structure functions. These P tables should very much be related to crystals. They should be like the top component, the highest element in a crystal structure. Element in a crystal structure. So we still don't have a crystal proof of the sure positive for chromatic symmetric functions. But the P double should sort of be, you should have a P double in each piece here. So crystals really tells you you break up your colorings in some ways. So we have a bunch of colorings here. Each coloring gives a monomial thing. And there should be exactly one p-tuple in each component, and this crystal graph here. Component and this crystal graph here P such P should be sure positive. Do you think it should be a Gauss proof and like translator? It gives a hint of how a crystal proof should look like. And I can probably tell you tomorrow how not to do it on the failed attempts. Yeah. So, yeah, and that tells you. So basically, these crystals, you don't need to You don't need to read many books about crystals. I think you can go to this webpage and read a little bit about the very basic ones. It comes with like some operators or Anna's book. But it's a long book. You will not have time to read it during this workshop. You should wait a very short video. Sorry? So maybe one problem. I what Dick Releasing is like. Maybe one tool that is missing is having good operators algebra. Operators, yeah. That that might be something also. Operators. Oh yeah, you said racing operators. Operators there. But there are moments. Yes. Many of them, yeah. Are they just going to be recursion or they just be recursion? Think of the elliptical algebra. If it's realized as an algebra with operators, you apply this to one creation operation and this tools of. Oh, and everything we build will be sure positive. Do you build something, you write whatever the thing is, the product of image. Because the image of some operator, you know, because it's kind of like the requirement. It's image rubber activation. So, what they do is their construction above that phrase? Yeah, like non-recursion. You can think of recursion as using s some kind of operating. So, another thing with these crystals, because that's it wasn't the title of. Crystals, because that's what was in the title also for this session. Is that so? You have a crystals on Sims Daniels. You have like some extra structure, you have something called like these EI, FI operators acting on Simistarium, like local changes. So everything which is sure positive should have a biection with semesters. So if you go the biection back, these operators should be on your original object as well. So one way to sort of get to know One way to sort of get to know your computer objects is to look for such crystal operators on your objects. So, for example, colorings, even if it's proper colorings or non-proper colourings, we would like to define such operators on colics that satisfy Christoph operator axions. That would be one way to sort of figure out by action. So, for example, if we could find what would be the corresponding key tables for LT polynomials, that would be. LT polynomials, that would be, then you'd be solved, like, then we have a formula for the AP, the short expansion for LTs. But one way to figure out what could potentially be p-tables, like certain colorings, would be to find, to first define these operators on colorings. That would be one way to start approaching that problem. Yeah, actually, this is kind of a question. Probably somebody here can answer this better than I, but I was just trying to. But I was just trying to think about Mark Heyman's original proof that the chromatic symmetric function was sure positive for unit interval graphs. So that was some sort of representation theoretic thing, but it wasn't a direct, it wasn't like directly saying it was an SM representation. He was taking some like what he was doing. He was saying some like verma modules. Vermal modules, yeah. I think in the end you kind of put that in your GLN. Yeah. Yeah. Because the permalog, they were like way on. Okay, maybe that's just a GLN. How do you get to the GLN side from what came from? First of all, it wasn't, he didn't think about it like even an interval. Yeah, he didn't phrase it that way, that's right. It wasn't really. Yeah. What was it really? Is there a good reference? Like, what was the original? I don't know if there's any other reference other than his original paper. And even there, he said it's kind of technical. I'm going to stick in the appendix. Do you remember? I think Mark has something about that frame. I was going to hear I wasn't here. But Mark has papers. Is it the paper about Hecker Algebridge? Yeah. We're about HEC algebra? Yeah. But I know, I mean, the positivity, like he took like tensored vermal modules together, and then there's a character of he looked at the character of the tensored vermal module. And the data was about GLF. Yeah, I guess. There was like input. Yeah, it did. Right, that's right. It was really complicated. Yeah, it did write. That's right. It was really complicated. Is there more than one paper that uses this technique? Maybe that's a good question. I mean, would his construction give you some clue as to how to form this crystal structure on this detail level? I didn't quite. So our little Henry Urquhart construct the crystal? Construct a crystal? It was just not a stembridge crystal. For the chromatics. For the chromatics. So are we talking about LLTs now? Oh, L. I'm not sure. Are you talking about LLTs for chromatics? No, so he did this for the chromatics, but he, I mean, of course, we know Shropos did it in this case, so he just kind of reverse-engineered maybe because how Crestos should work. Yeah, so maybe so we want the stem rich crystals here, right? What other kind of crystals are there? We have just some graph, but it wasn't like we only have true for the symbols here. So I mean you can call any graph of crystal graph. One that you want here, one that actually wants to verify the crystal axioms. The crystal axioms are in those temperatures. Who was the guy's name? What's the guy's name? Hi, Eric. I don't know. Well, so maybe we should maybe problem related to crystals. So I guess maybe crystals scares some people. So the first thing you ask, you have a symmetric function. How do we prove that it's a symmetric function? Yeah? So for chromatic symmetric fun chromatic quasi-symmetric functions, you have to do some Quasi-symmetric functions, you have to do some little bit of work. It's not just obvious from the definition when you have the queuing here. So you have these involutions which interchange two colors. So you can call these involutions as ice, right? But those involutions that are in this, in John's paper, they don't satisfy the braid relations. So we would like involutions on colorings that uh that's that satisfy these actions uh this relation so because this if we find find these types of evolutions we are much closer to finding like crystal terms yeah and this would also be very nice to find for LOT polynomials because proving that LOT polynomials are symmetric is like even worse it's very tedious I would say well in the past Tedious, I would say. Well, it depends on what you mean by tedious, but it's recursive and not very enlightening. Where is the best proof that the LLT polypods are? Mark Heyman and Nick Board or something? It's Heyman and his student, Michelle Weiland, probably found editorial proof of LLT positivity, and it uses mega and just breaks things up into where entries involved value and i plus one. I and I plus one. But it's that's not a shear function. So this is, so both for LLTs and for the chromatic symmetric functions, this is like a very concrete problem to work on. Prove that something is symmetric by using involutions and the involution should satisfy this rate relation. So Si is like the exchange colour i and i plus one in some way. Yeah. And I guess we we saw some other symmetric functions today, right, that are symmetric, but there's no combinatorial proof in this sense that they are symmetrical. That would be nice to study. And it's, of course, related to sure positive. V a cross mass. I'm just saying if you have a monomial expansion, say you know something is symmetric. If you have a monomial expansion, Something is mentioned. You have a manobial extension, you don't have a Schur extension, you can look for things that satisfy this. Yeah, if you can find these, you are halfway to defining crystals, I would say. Right? Would you agree? One-third of the way there? Yeah, you would have to break them out of the SI into the FI. Yeah. But if you know these, you are very close, I would say, to knowing what this should be. Yeah, because if you have a crystal already with If you have a crystal already where you have the EIs and FI's, if you know these, you can define the corresponding SIs. But these are harder to find probably than to find these. Start here, and then that gives you some ideas. You say in words again, the SIs are the implications. If you want to see my notes. Expansion showing you. I mean, I think the first example is the proof that that's semi-standard Yalta cross-sector. Yes, which maybe is in the example that Franklin was trying to do. Exactly. But also an example from Michelle and John Peter. Like their technique of proving the symmetry, the symmetricness. There's an example in the notes that does that. There's an example in the notes that does that. Oh, okay. A bigger example. Oh, and it lets show that it fits into that technique. No, you know that there's this. You know about maybe you heard about Bender Knuth involutions that show that these are symmetric. That the short polynomials are symmetric. We have proven that maybe sometimes. Maybe. Maybe not. But there are these classical evolutions called biomedical evolutions, but they don't satisfy these evil. But you can do what it is called boulestigginvolutions that do satisfy this and they are like exactly these crystalline reflections. So what John and I use are similar to the bender command. Yeah, the same age. So here you're assuming that what's given me is the monomial. And the monomial suppose that it on the actual objects that you're Objects that you're countering in a way that you construct the same distance structure. Rather than on the symmetric side, on the provenious side, say, or whatever, I think about this as handy objects. And actually, the crystal structure of the objects rather than the curve can. Yeah, I mean that's that's probably what I mean, or what we mean by finding a crystal, is the actual objects that we are interested in, that we define a crystal structure. And then we wait in some sense to get the monomial expansion. There's a paper or document called Crystals for Dummies, which is pretty good. Is that on the it's on the if you It's on if you search for it, it's Mark Shimazono that has written that. Is that on symmetric functions.com? I have a link. I mean, Shimazono's document is linked there, so it's one of the references here. Maybe a complement to this picture would be to have a list of hard problems about true positivity. I'm sure that some. Pitt has some hard problems about sure of positivity. There are others who know about this. Because if you know all these problems, we don't know yet. There are sure part of it. There's all these techniques. And if we don't know how to do it with this technique, maybe we have something that we have to look for. We're being open hard on this. What are the big open problems that things that want to be shared on? LT polynomials. I mean, it's almost phrased, it's a slightly different question, right? It's not, you already know the share positive, but you're asking for like a combinatorial interpretation. That's a separate, or that's an additional question. Right, that's true, yeah. Maybe you you know that it's your part of it, but you don't have a proof then there is problems out there. There are problems out there where. Right, right, right. Well, like, for example, just for quasi-symmetric functions, the sure positivity was known a long time ago, but then it took many, a long time before there was this cash and Hessenberg varieties and the actual connection with the dot action, the symmetric group. And so even though the short positivity itself literally improved, that wasn't the end of the story. You still wanted to know something more, right? So. Yeah, so I mean, so the point is that you can have pieces of this, but you can always make a paper by filling in all the other proofs here. That's what people do when they first start here, do this type of proof, and then they maybe they do this type of proof, and then you do a crystal. So I mean, you can do many, you can prove the same theorem several times. You really are generous in commentary workshops. I just wanted to add into what Jim said. So, John and I modified. So John and I modified Gasharov's proof. We couldn't use it the way it was. We had to find a different involution in order to make it work for the statistic finding. But then we conjectured also sure unimodality. And that we didn't have a proof of. We did not have sure unimodality. We only had sure positivity. And then the connection with Hessenberg variety. The connection with Hessenberg varieties and the Hard Leshett's theorem gave the show you would have looked at. That's open to get more combinatorial proof. I would agree on that. But for those LLTs, you know, I'm like totally ignorant about LLT. Do they have like any kind of unimodality going on in them in those kinds of systems? No, they're like skewed, right? Like if you reverse, then you have to multiply. Then you have to multiply by the sign character. But then it is some kind of unimodality, then? So there's something more, because for like, yeah, for those chromatic symmetric things, it's more than just sure positive. It's like sure unimodality. There's like a, yeah, like some kind of hard left. I guess if you identify, right, a partition and its transpose, right? Maybe you could ask if these things are unimodal. Is it maybe it's the same as unimodality of cosmic Folks polynomials in some Cost of Volks polynomials in some sense are related to that. So there's this cost of Volks polynomials which are you get from the charge, like the generating function of charge. And those are unimodality properties. The LLT. But the LLT we don't know sure positive. Well, they don't know like any kind of unique position. I'm asking if there's a conjectural unimodality for sure for LLT holiday. Yeah, does it look like there's some point for a duality or There's some poincarray duality, or our theorem doesn't look like there's not a point-break duality, is there? Yeah, I can't. I mean, the conjecture is they are uni-model, but they are not low-concave. No. I don't. I mean, it could if it gives you the regular representation, then it could only give you the sign representation once. Or maybe there could be like a you like a You um like a Pockaway duality where you like dancing with a slide? I thought that was true. It is true. Oh, it is true. Like, if you, I don't, this is my understanding, only from doing an example of unicellular LLTs, and there's way more experts in the room than me. Yeah, but I don't complete more than one example. Well, like, for example, like, what my knowledge is, for example, okay, so silly, like. For example, okay, so silly, like the trivial S sub, you know, that one I know. Yeah, like it's just in degree one, and then the sine one only occurs in the max degree. But then in general, I think like that kind of holds. So that if you looked at your polynomial coefficient on S lambda, there's sort of just a twist, you know, you sort of. So is it S lambda half or whatever? Yeah, then you S lambda prime, right, where you're just conjugating that partition. Those do have a really explicit. Those do have a really explicit relationship. They do have that. Yeah. But then you're saying for the unimodality, you think the unimodality is not a conjecture or it is a comparison that's not a conjecture? Unimodality and more, like they're a coefficient of a particular share function. Yeah, that's not going to be true for sure from a full complete gravel, for example. Coefficient of S2 is T squared plus Q of 4. Square plus q. Yeah. So that's fine. Yeah. Square plus two. Well, but you can have like only an even dimension or something. Well, that's other examples. I don't think that those sufficient stuff can be involved with the majority of the ma But then when you do that pl whatever that word is, that it gives you something that is sure unimodal. Maybe there's some confusion because plectism is something and what we've been seeing calling plectism here should be called lambda main calendar. Lambda rain calculation because when you put a minus it's very fun, but that's not actually platism. Pletism is composition of functoral constructions. Oh, that's what it means. So like in Latin or Greek, it means a lot. A lot of oh, that's where it comes from. Oh, that's where it comes from. Now you know. Now, just about, I was mentioning problems when we don't know. There's a Fuchs conjecture that might be called, should be called maybe Adam Arcure. It goes back to the 19th century and we still don't know if it's true in general. And that's about your position. And that's about show positivity. So, sure positivity. Everyone knows that it's true positive, but we don't know how to prove it in general. So, do you know, have you ever talked about this projector? Heta knows everything about this. Don't say yes. But i this is a platism. You took homogeneous H A, platism homogeneous H B minus homogeneous H B. Homogeneous H B, that is an H A. And if A is larger than B, then this is supposed to be all the time show positive. We don't know. That would be a bigger result than anything. Oh, there are proofs for large cases, but we don't know each other. And I don't know how to approach this with crystals. Approach this with crystals. So, I mean, the advertisement is that you don't need to know all this stuff about crystals. You can just scratch the surface and it's going to help with the intuition a little bit. That's what I would say, because that's. I have used very rudimentary understanding of crystals to do things, and it's even a little helps a lot, I would say. Yeah, great idea, yes. Okay, so I have two. Uh okay, so I have two questions or comments. So the first one is what about proving the e e e positivity expansion of the chromatics? Is there any way representation theory could help? Because in this case we are not really looking for combinatorial necessary proof. We are just looking for any proof whether these coefficients are e positive. But because the e coefficients are not characters of irreducible Are not characters and irreducible representations, even if we actually have some kind of module, it's not necessarily going to be easy to that we can decompose. It's not clear why we could decompose permutation modules after Omega. So I guess my question is, is there some instance where representation theory has helped omega, then it becomes a H part. Then it becomes H positive. Yeah, yeah. And H positive makes sense for construction on sets rather than linear algebra, linear space constructions. So if you have construction on sets, you will count specific objects. H positivity will come out of some kind of, but I don't have very much confidence about the problem of. It's about the problem of correcting that we're addressing here. But one way to get age positivity is to think about polia enumeration. Because then you're counting objects of tweets. But can we do this with the that tail side? Also, it seems like that's gonna be the same thing as an extra. Yeah, mutation records. No, I mean like in principle. In principle, it's true. Right, yeah. Which thing I have a common is if you look in Isaac's character theory book, he takes an arbitrary rule and he gives a list of necessary conditions for a character to be a permutation character. So say we forget about it, that the point stabilizer should be young. That the point stabilizes should be young stuff. I think it would be interesting if someone just went and showed that these chromatic quasi-symmetric functions satisfied all these necessary conditions. So like, you know, if the class containing y, if y is a power of x, right, then the character value on y has to be larger than that on x because it's going to fix at least as many points. Because it's going to fix at least as many points as x. And it just has a bunch of conditions, a few of which are not obvious if you think about it. And it would be interesting just to show that. And then you wouldn't know it was H positive, but you would know it could be a permutation representation where the point stabilizers could be anything, not just parabolic selfies. Just to add to what you said, if there was a P expansion somewhere that was mentioned, these conditions also you These conditions also you can express for the coefficient of the p expansion on something that has a line. Maybe this is a rough approach, but we know it's p positive, for instance. The omega chromatic quasi-symmetric function is p positive because we have a counting function. So that's one of the necessary permutation parameters takes non-negative values. So are there examples where H positivity has been? Where H positivity has been approved representation theoretically, like this. You say representation theoretically, like finding an explicit basis that's permuted. Yeah, that's a slightly different method than like looking at the character and showing exceptions. Yeah. Well, either way, I mean, I just Well H2, right? This is your conjecture. This is the point. There's some fermentation basis. There are folks here who have found an exposition. Probably you mean examples outside of chromatics and that kind of functions. Yeah, I mean just in general, like anywhere in algebraic comic tortoise where that technique has succeeded. I mean, maybe we've been. I mean, maybe it would be nice to find like an analog of crystals, but where they bunch things together to get E-positive or H-positive chunks instead. That would be like useful. Yeah, go ahead. Okay, so another comment this time. So, when we were talking about the combinatorial interpretation of something that we already know is positive integer, and when we cannot find And when we cannot find it, it might be possible that no combinatorial no reasonable combinatorial interpretation exists. And this we actually prove this for a specific problem, let's say the square of a character of the symmetric group, which is always a positive integer, it cannot, it does not have a combinatorial interpretation. Of course, the hypothesis is p naught equal. P not equal to NP. So it's a complex theoretic question, but one can actually try to do this as well if you're really not, if we're not able to find a combinatorial interpretation, it may because none exists. But you're assuming that P means variable in a sense. P no, I'm talking about complexity classes. But the P class would be understandable and whether it's the same. No, no, no, no, no. So it's no, the sharp p class is understandable. So our coefficients, they're always in gap p, so they can always be written as something positive minus something positive. And we just don't know how to cancel it. I mean, it may not be possible to figure out any any com like good way of pairing things to cancel them. That's Pairing things would cancel them. That's the total. But there are other ways of showing positive need than just pairing. No, no, okay. I'm giving you an example, but this is, I mean, this when you when we're talking about computational complexity questions, we are not really assuming that that you are doing some specific manipulations. It's it's a more it's a more general statement than that. I'm just giving you an example. You an example. But just for the case of the discussion, proving that saying that something is not possible is dangerous. Because then ten years later, something does it. So. Okay, well, if you do that, then the polynomial hierarchy would collapse into pictures. So it's going to be a hierarchy. So, but keeping something is great. Having a great I think a great conjecture is great. But announcing that you will not be able to do something that is something that is hard to do. But yeah, I mean, there is a proof that you can do it. No, but the one thing I just I'm I'm gonna support you just for the top of it. But I want to say what to you were you were talking about formula. You were talking about a formula, and I bet like a lot of the formulas we write down, I think a lot are like non-polynomial exponential time to even write down the terms. Exactly. So I bet not doing that at all. So the formula might not be the current. Like we sum over every subset of something. Yeah, the question is, what constitutes a reasonable common torture interpretation? Could you have a reasonable common torturation contract? Yeah. I mean they're unfortunately a function of the input on the other level. This question is very fun. Yeah, no, I'm not waiting for it. On the right side of the left side,      It's not necessary to run. So you take a look at the product decision.  Well I have to say two things. So she went to the middle of the year. No, it's got two. You've done a good job, but he's a little scratched there. He says, You've done a weird job, but there's a good use in one. It's not yours. And then you can see the hook is PDF. But some can work. Now, we don't know very much about twins, but only tweets all the pins and lifts it up and grab the right set of there, and instead of now, it might be my bills. Right? Yeah, I think it's a little bit holding my hand.  So my question is: can you wait? Does he have a chance or do you not say how I just asked me? No, you know, it would be a really good idea. I'm out, I'm on, I'm out. Okay, yeah. So, yeah, we're actually going to be able to do it. That's definitely not anything. I don't think any control is getting me to get a really funny. And then look at this, yeah. Yeah, that I told you. This is the way that I always think. Actually, this is the one description that I would use. Okay, this is what I suppose. This is the intersection. So this is like the dimensions of the species. Well, so what I'm saying is repeating myself and that's those things I will email. That's those things I know, right? But you can't do it for like a connection to look at the lookout in the article. It's the one where it's MM and the MS. That's what it means. But that's fault, right? Yeah, it's just a little bit of a message. Oh, okay. Oh, it's the bad image. So I guess I'll just ask you.  Okay, so you're inferring that at least if the reasonable question was. So you have the right answer. Oh, I think you're not. Yeah, isn't that in your brands we break to the office or like actually interpretation? I guess there are two different things. I don't think so. I don't think so because they're just informal, right? So they're saying they're saying, okay, give me a shift on a basic. They used it as very to instead of generator. They're using a generator correlation to try to make things. So the U team. Does that answer your question? I forget exactly. I'm sorry. I don't think it's more attention. That's okay. I think they're nice. Oh, I guess so. There should be a very big rush there.  Uh-huh. I agree with you. I have to start confusing what would be answered. My takeaway was explicit is not correct. Sometimes you won't have an answer, you'll just know what's your possible idea. That happens to me, it's too much. I do that how much to guess a formula first, then you'll know what's going to do. Yeah, I have a conjecture. Which one do you just want to do? Sometimes we're just stuck. I have like the two rows. No, I don't know either. I don't think it's a good idea. My impression is on here. Then here was characterizing. We have a generalized character and more character in the general case, right? Are we now trying to prove that? I don't know. Well, actually, that looks for some future, but I didn't really know. And then what I was trying to figure out was what the drafts look like. So I'm more interested in that. I think this is actually a question about. Why don't we have like D1 and DB2 like randomly on the system? So you actually bought out basically by constants on this one and constants on this one. Yeah, yeah. Now everything's thought of. Now the Hessenberg space is sort of walked off in this way. Then in fact the Hessenberg variety is a product rather than zoom in Hessenberg variety. Did I draw these birds? I don't know. I don't know. This is where you go back. But I was trying to add in the other rooms like for this one. This is like all of these. They're also not fixed. And I wasn't sure I did these right now. I rarely get plus. Okay, yeah. I mean, I've seen it before. I just said before. This might be. So I told you to break a fixation and they can work the answers to the help and we're not. So why don't they go? Yeah, that's why I said, yeah. I probably every year, once a year, I think I built myself. This is my first time. I totally did try to do this. I think I just have a little more please sort of call it. So, we have to get our things to do this. How about this? That's why I'm here. That's why all of these are assignments quite on you.
