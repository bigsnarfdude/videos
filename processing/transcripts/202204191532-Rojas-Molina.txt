Right, so well, thank you, thank you for the invitation and thank you the organizers and thank you people that are still here attending. And yeah, right, so I wanted to share with you something that, well, many of you have probably seen this results that I'm going to share today, but there has been some progress. But there has been some progress, and maybe it's still a good idea to revisit these things. So I'm interested in the Lonnet operators, and I think it was really great that Siefrid was right before because he introduced all these ideas of tilings and topology, and when two sets are close together, because I'm going to use this and And um, and I'm also interested in the spectrum, and but I'm interested in the spectral type. And um, so I'm considering operators that are given by the Launesette. So, the idea is that we have a Schrodinger operator, and the potential is a series of little smooth bumps that we place on top of a point set. On top of a point set, and that point set has certain properties, it can be seen as a generalization of a lattice, but it's not necessarily a translation invariant. So, in particular, we could also pick something like a Peros tiling or the vertices of the tilings that Sifri was showing earlier. And now the question is, well, what is the spectral type of these operators and the ultimate goal? The ultimate goal would be to say something about the transport. Now, if we consider these as a space of the Launa set, so the Delonesets, I mean, I guess many people here know them, but just to fix ideas, they're usually, well, they're characterized by two parameters. The minimal distance between points. So, points do not accumulate in particular. So, that's let's say little r and then big r. Little R and then big R, that is the maximal distance between neighboring points. So there are voids in the space, but they are not arbitrarily learned. And one can consider all the classes of this type of the Launesets and then consider this operator and ask about the spectrum. Now, if the La Neset, of course, is translation invariant, we will have something periodic and we know that that has an absolutely good. And we know that that has an absolutely continuous spectrum. Now, one could also think that this point set is given by a nice random process, like a Poisson random process. And then in that case, one would expect, if there is randomness, one would expect that the spectrum is pure point. Now, what happens in the arbitrary case? So, when D is an arbitrary data set and we are in a dimension, oh, well, Well, arbitrary dimension. Now, for dimension one, of course, there are many things done, and many people in the audience are experts on what happens in dimension one, for example, with the Fibonacci Hamiltonian. And we know that there, the spectral type is a very, very hard question. And there is a lot of singular continuous spectrum. And what we know. And what we know for arbitrary dimension is, well, first, this result by Lenzer Stommer from 2006 that says that if we consider all the Deluna sets that share the same parameters, little R, capital R, then under certain conditions, we can find an interval in the spectrum where we find singular continuous spectrum. And this is generic in the sense that in the In the sense that in the space of these Delaunay sets of parameters R capital R, there is a dense G-delta set where these configurations exhibit singular continuous spectrum there. Now, this is an existence result. So somewhere in the spectrum, this exists. And we are working in the continuum setting. So think of this is the spectrum of the sub-regular specific ideas. Operator specific ideas, this is the Halifline. So now the question comes: so we see that there is a lot of singular continuous spectrum. It's actually generic. So when this result appeared was around the same time that there was this new multi-scale analysis by Borgan and Koenig that allowed people to look at the Louis-Anderson model. So, and at that time, So and at that time, François John Minier with Abel Klein were working on improving on that multistake analysis by Borgan and Koenig to show also dynamical localization. So Borgan and Koenig showed a pure point spectrum, exponentially decaying nading functions, and then François and Nabel, they worked on that to obtain the strongest form of localization and all the properties around that. And in parallel, In parallel, Peter Mueller was also working on the Law Nesets and the Launier operators and dynamical systems generated by these Lawnessets. And so they wondered if, well, this geometric diversity in the space of the LaNeset, so let's recall, well, we have a space of the LaNessels that share these two parameters, R, capital R. There are many ways that this Delaney set can satisfy this property. Can satisfy this property. So, the code of configurations, there are many. The question that François and Peter asked was: Could we see this as disorder, as a source of disorder? And in which case can we expect dynamical localization as we expect whenever there is resort? And well, of course, this comes from the motivation comes from the Anderson-Hamiltonian for which we have a random potential. Here I put Here I put a potential where you see that we have different types of bumps. So we have the blue bumps and the gray ones. But actually could also be something, could also be dislocations in space. So we could have points of the lattice and put our bumps on the points of the lattice and then make little perturbations around that. Or we could consider, as I mentioned earlier, a point set that is given by a point set. A point set that is given by a Poisson process. And in all those cases, one actually knows by now that there is localization in the sense that there is pure point spectrum and there is also dynamical localization, which is described by this quantity that measures the transport and is related to what Mira was showing us earlier. So, this quantity, the fact that this is founded, that when one looks at the evolution, That when one looks at the evolution of our eigenfunction, the evolution under the action of our operator in time, this is uniformly bounded in time and in expectations, and this decays as one gets away from the origin. And in particular, the transports are the transport exponents or well, the transport is bounded. So there is no, sorry, there is no transport actually. There is absence of. No transport, actually, there's absence of transport. Um, okay, so this is what we know as dynamical localization, and in particular, this gives us pure point spectrum. Now, um, so the question was, okay, can we see now the lonesets and the variety that we find in the lone escapes as a source of disorder? And the answer is yes. And this is what we did with Peter. This paper is accepted, but hasn't appeared yet in Ronaldo Daisy. hasn't appeared yet in Ronaldo Dais Mathematique. And we expect this will happen soon. But this is the product of a very long research program that we carried out with Francois and also at some point with Ivan Vessel. So let me tell you a bit about this. So as I was mentioning, well the this idea that we could see the lonescence as As realizations of a random process, apart from the Poisson case, one can also think of the Bernoulli case. So if we put, if we consider all the points of the lattice and then we start removing points with Bernoulli, or we put the Bernoulli weight on the points. So on each point, we consider a random variable to be either zero or one with a certain probability. If it's zero, we remove the point. If it's one, we keep the point. remove the point if it's one we keep the point you see here in a in a finite window what we will see is something that looks like a deloneset now the problem of this is that when we look at a finite window we see a deloneset but when we look at the whole space because we are removing points randomly we might have arbitrary large areas where there is no potential and then this would not be a deloneset so if we wanted to make a deloneset with this we would have to put something in the background We would have to put something in the background to keep this billionaire structure that says that we cannot have voids that are arbitrary large. Now, localization, as I mentioned, in 2005, Borgen and Kenny developed this multi-scale analysis that allowed people for the first time to consider, to prove localization for the Bernoulli case, which was technically very hard. Very hard. And then Francois and Abel worked on this. So people knew that there was localization for this Bernoulli case. Now, as I mentioned, in order to consider, in order to see, read these as the Launce sets, we need to put some structure in the background. So the idea here was to, in a way, randomize a Delauna set. So if we have, we start with a Delones set D0, that is in the space of the Launch sets, we don't restrict. In the space of the lunar sets, we don't restrict the little r and the capital R. And then we consider another Delauna set on top of that, such that the union is still a Deluna set. And then we are going to split these sets. So we're going to consider the background Deluna set, the zero that we started with. This is going to be a fixed potential. So we're going to put our little bump in all the gray points. And this is going to be a background potential. Going to be a background potential, and then on the extra set D1 that is also the Luna set, we're going to put an Anderson-Bernoulli potential. So we're going to put our bumps, but with the Bernoulli random variable. And in that way, every configuration of our randomness will give us a beloved set. Now, of course, they might change, and also the little R, the capital R are going to change, but that's. To change, but that's we don't worry about that now. The point is that if for the configuration where all our random variables are zero, we retrieve the original one. Otherwise, we have a whole family of the non-essents. And what do we have? We have that we have localization for that operator. So, and this is at the bottom of the spectrum. Bottom of the spectrum. So, if we start with the Delone set and we do this construction of adding the Lonnette points of the Delone set and putting randomness there, we will then find a set of measure one in the configuration space such that we have localization at the bottom of the spectrum. Now, this, in order to get this result for the Bernoulli set, this was technically very hard and And where was the difficulty actually here? Why it took us so long to prove localization for this model was that we have this, was precisely because of having this potential here that in a way ruined the, didn't allow us to use the usual techniques to prove localization. Because if that potential is not periodic, then we didn't know what to do. Then we didn't know what to do. So, just to let you know, I'm not going to go into the details of the multi-screen analysis because I think people here, they know it probably, but just to emphasize that usually there are two things. So, this is an induction over scales. One gets, we want to show that the resolvent decays. We saw in Mira's talk that if we are able to bound the measure where the green. Able to bound the measure where the Greens function is V, then we have a good chance to prove that to have bounds in the transport. Okay, in our case, we actually want to show that there is no transport. The argument is very similar. We want to bound in measure those sets of energy where, or configuration in this case, where the Green's function is big. So that means that we want that the probability that the Green's function is the same. That the probability that the Green's function is bounded is good. That's basically that. Now, how we do this, and because we want to expand this from one box and then tile the space with these boxes in a way, copy-paste this information on the Green's function, we need two main ingredients. Usually, we need one that the Green's function doesn't have, it's not too close to a similarity, of course, otherwise it would. Singularity, of course, otherwise it would blow up. And this is usually controlled by what's called a Wegner estimate, so that our box is not resonant. And another thing, since this is an iteration procedure, we need the decay of the resolvent for some initial scale. So we need to show some initial decay of the resolvent. And usually the way that one shows for Anderson model, the way that one For Anderson model, the way that one shows this decay of the resolvent is that if let's suppose we consider the operator restricted, we consider our operator and we restrict it to some box, like this box. Now we have a spectrum that is discrete. So let's suppose that, well, our spectrum is contained in the half-line. So now our eigenvalues will live somewhere there. They will be. Somewhere there. They will be random, of course. And the idea is that at the bottom of the spectrum, so we want to work in this area. The idea is in order to show the decay of the resolvent, the usual strategy is that we show that there is a spectral gap here. So if we are able to show that the first eigenvalue is away from zero for For a certain length. Then we can use here in this gap, we can use the Comptomas estimate that gives the decay of the resolvent. And the decay is exponential in the distance from zero to the in value and also in the distance from these sets that we had here. That in Mira's talk, they were in the discrete setting, think of the origin. Setting, think of the origin and then a point in the border in the boundary of your set. Um, so therefore, in this strategy using optomos estimate, the problem of showing this decay of the resolvent, the initial decay, comes, it's translated into the problem of showing a spectral gap. That's one way of doing it. And to show that the first eigenvalue is it's far enough from zero. It's far enough from zero so that we can apply Comptomas estimate. And this gives us a nice decay. Now, and the way of proving the spectral graph, actually, so when we have just the Laplacian press something that is random, one way of doing this in the continuous setting is using Leafsheet states. So for this, one needs the integrated density of states. Needs the integrated density of states and then show that this integrated density of states has a certain behavior near the bottom of the spectrum. That means that that implies that the spectrum is very thin in that area. So that means that we, with a good probability, we will find a gap easily. Now, the problem in our setting is that our operator is not ergodic. Is not ergodic. So we actually, in principle, do not have this existence of the integrated density of states, and therefore one needs to do something else. And also, well, in the cases where one actually were interested in putting a background potential, then also we know that all the techniques that exist so far work for the case. Far work for the case where the potential V D here is translation environment. So again, we're in the recording case. Now, the way to get out of this problem was we did this with Ivan Veselich, was to use a unique continuation principle. So unique continuation principle, well, we all know that if we have an eigenfunction of a nice Schrodinger operator, This Schrodinger operator, this eigenfunction cannot be zero in an open set. Otherwise, it's zero everywhere. But this is a quantitative version of that. So we actually have some control on, we have a lower bound. If we take the function on an open set, we have a lower bound on how small can this be. And the way that the quantitative unique contribution principle was used by Bergen and Koenig in their multi-scale analysis. In their multi-scale analysis. And it also appears in the proof of the Wegner estimates to prove that we don't have the boxes are non-resonant with good probability. So it appears quite often in proof of localization. Now, the proofs of unique continuation principles that were available relied on floquet theory, so again on translation invariance. So one would analyze. So one would analyze this use the usual unique continuation principle for one little cube that would tile our whole space and then in a way use this and translation invariance to get this estimate here that if we look at the AM function and we look at the mass, the volume of the A function on balls center Center around points here, then this is positive, but moreover, this is bounded below by some constant times the mass of the function in the whole volume. Now, this was known for when the array of the points was periodic in a lattice. But it was actually what we needed to do was to have that these, because in our proofs, these centers are. These centers are actually the centers, they are the parts of the, they're points of the Delones set. This is where the potential goes. And these balls that you see here were actually, this is the support of our potential. So it's this. So this is what appears in the proofs, and this is what we need then to be able to. We need to be able to estimate this quantity. If we have an eigenfunction and we look at this inner product of the eigenfunction against the potential applied to the potential multiplied by this eigenfunction, we would reduce the problem to something like this. So looking at the eigenfunction, but on the support of the potential. And the fact that we were able to do this for non-periodic setting. This for non-periodic setting allowed us to obtain so using this actually using this quantitative unique continuation principle implies that this is bigger than some constant. In a certain sense, times a certain characteristic function of The characteristic function of our set. Now, this implies that we can leave in a way we can lift the spectrum and we can prove that there is a gap. So, this inequality implies that there is a gap in the spectrum, and then we can do the whole procedure of applying Comptomas estimate and so on and get localization. So, this is what we needed in order to prove localization. Now, in the time that remains, I wanted to tell you. remains I wanted to to tell you what are the applications of this proof of localization. So now that we have localization for an operator that has a background potential that is not necessarily periodic, it's actually just a Belonet potential and it's completely arbitrary. Well, the first thing is that we can prove denseness of the Launesets that exhibit localization. Sets that exhibit localization. So we get that if we have a Delaunay set and we look at the operator associated to it, the Delaunay operator, then we can actually find some interval at the bottom of the spectrum and we can find a sequence of the Luna sets that converges to that one such that all the operators associated to that sequence exhibits localization. So basically, and we're saying that if, let's suppose We're saying that if let's suppose this is our Delaunes set, and we can find sequence, a sequence that approaches, that approximates this Delaunay set. And if you remember, Siegfried mentioned this notion of distance between tilings or that applies also to Delaunay sets. That means that if you have, if you look at finite windows or walls around zero, then you Around zero, then you see that the points are very close to each other or they're identical. And if you have this on bigger and bigger windows, then you have that your set approximates the original Delaunay set. So that means that if you start with any Delaunay set, you're going to find a sequence of the LaNesse sets that approaches, approximates that one. So it's actually what we find is actually that they're identical. Find is actually that they're identical in bigger and bigger sets. And for those Dela Nassets, we have localization. So in a way, the LaNesets that exhibit localization are dense in the space of the LaNesets. And by localization here, I mean dynamical localization, and in particular, pure point spectrum, and in particular, absence of transport for those Delonesets. Now, this Using this result on localization and denseness, one can also try to extend some result by Simon on the applying the Wonderland theorem. And one can wonder: well, what we know that for almost every configuration of our randomized Telon operator, we have localization. still an operator, we have localization, but what happens with its measure from a topological sense? So is this generic or not? Now, of course, I showed this result by Lenser Stolman at the beginning that says that what is actually generic is the singular continuous spectrum. And actually this also fits well with this result by Simon from 95. Simon from 1995, in this paper where he has the Wonderland theorem that I'm going to state in a second, where he shows that for the Anderson model that we know that there is localization, where in the parts of the spectrum where there is localization, there the singular continuous spectrum is actually generic. So from a topological perspective, there is a lot of singular continuous spectrum and very little pure point spectrum. Pure point spectrum. And Elenz and Stohnman extended the Wonderland theorem of Simon to the setting of the Lonnet operators. And with that, they were also able to show that in a given, there exists an interval where the singular continuous spectrum is generic. And we were wondering if actually we have that for our model. And there is, and yes, actually, we do. And so one can actually say that the set of localized configurations. So remember, this omega is the set such that this was our operator. We had a background potential and also this randomness is a randomized element. And we have that for omega. We have that for omega in this omega hat, there is localization for these configurations. And we can actually prove that this, so this is a summary of all the applications that are deduced from the localization result, that this set omega hat is meager in the probability space omega, and that under That under certain assumptions, very strong assumptions, and maybe wishful thinking assumptions, one can actually retrieve that there is generic singular continuous spectrum applying Wonderland's theorem. And well, in particular, I mean, we do have all the assumptions for the usual Anderson model. And this last comment is because when Simon stated this result. This result. He had several technical restrictions on the potential, but now with, I mean, with all the advances in the proofs of localization that we have now, we can actually just update this result and show that it's valid for arbitrary Anderson models. Now, I wanted to show you a bit, focus on these first two points. Can one show that the singular continuous spectrum That the singular continuous spectrum is generic in the probability space. So, to retrieve the result of Simon. And actually, well, this is a Wonderland theorem. And this says that if one is able to show that the set of configurations omega, where there is no pure point spectrum is dense, where there is no absolute continuous spectrum is dense, and where there is no distance. And where there is spectrum is dense, then all that is left is the singular continuous spectrum. And now I know that I have very few minutes left, but just to show you what is the assumption, if we wanted to apply the Wonderland theorem, we actually need one assumption. And well, first, that the set where there is no AC spectrum is the Spectrum is dense. That is a result of our localization result. We know that there is localization in a dense set, so that is good. We know that there is spectrum. If we make an assumption on the pattern frequencies of the Deloness set, which is pretty standard, we know that there is deterministic spectrum actually at the bottom of the spectrum. Now, the problem is with the first point when we want. When we want to show that the set where there is pure point spectrum, where there is no pure point spectrum is actually dense, here, what usually one uses in the proof is that if we perturb our operator Hd0 and Hd0 is this, sorry, is this. So if we perturb this by compactly supported potentials, Potentials, if we assume that this has AC spectrum and we perturb it by a compactly supported potential, does this still have AC spectrum? This is what we would need in order to show one. Now, this is not at all trivial. And actually, I asked this to Wensai and asked some people some couple of years ago. And then when Sai proved this for the case, The case in the discrete setting, in the case where the zero is periodic. So, at least when the potential, the background potential is periodic, one has the stability of the AC spectrum. And this was actually conjectured also by Peter Kuchman and Barnberg in 99. Now, unfortunately, this in the continuous setting, this is so far wishful thinking, and I don't know if there is a proof of that. I don't know if there is a proof of that. This problem is related to what Wentz I mentioned in the morning about the reducibility of the block variety. And so if one was able to show that, we would get that this singular continuous spectrum is generic, what is well known for other models. But here I'm going to finish. We cannot just assume that, but still, the multi-scale analysis that we use actually gives us a lot of information on the topological structure of the set of localization. So one can actually track this structure around the proof, along the proof, and show that this set is a union of closed sets and therefore it's meager. So we get a weaker result. It's not generic singular continuous. Not generic singular continuous spectrum, but we're able to show that the look the set where there is localization is at least near and so and with that I would like to thank you for your attention and sorry if it was a bit quick but I don't know if you have if I have one more minute to make an announcement well maybe 20 seconds 20 seconds okay good 20 seconds. Okay, good. So if I'm still sharing my screen, there will be, if you want to know more about the randomness part, there will be two events in Sergi in the summer. One graduate school aimed at master and PhD students and where we will discuss a lot of issues, current issues in randomness. And also there will be the conference. The conference in honor of Abel Klein, where there will be a lot of people from the audience, including organizers, and a lot of other people. And if you would like to participate, please tell everyone, tell your students too. I think it would be interesting. So, yes, so thank you. Thank you, Constant. So, I think we are already a bit over time. Thank you, Constantino. So I think we are already a bit over time, so maybe still one question from the audience. Thank you. Sorry, just maybe one, there are no questions, so maybe just to say, I forgot to mention that this had a flavor. Actually, after seeing Silvius talk, I was thinking that this has a bit. I was thinking that this has a bit of flavor in that direction that he was talking about. So, having a background potential that is not translation invariant, but in this case, passive periodic, and adding a randomness. What we get is that randomness is very dominant. So, multi-scale analysis is still very robust, and one can actually show localization for those cases, particular cases. On those cases, particular cases. So I guess Service is right. I actually asked a long question, but I muted myself and I was asking it. So let me make a shorter version. So for this Wonderland application, you need absence of embedded eigenvalue specifically, right? Yes. Okay. Yeah. And so this is basically one of the results that follows from a A result that follows from irreducibility, as you said, wind size. But it is also related to the unique continuation thing, right? In the not here. So for the whole localization proof, we need unique continuation principles. And this, in a way, limited the fact that we're working in the continuous setting. Great. Now, Good. Now, with the recent advances in the proofs of localization for Bernoulli models in the discrete setting, I'm wondering now if maybe one could do the same proof and use when size result in order to have singular continuous spectrum. Maybe? Oh, yeah, when size result is discrete, you're right. Yes. Yeah, it's discrete. Right. Thank you very much. Thank you, Constance.
