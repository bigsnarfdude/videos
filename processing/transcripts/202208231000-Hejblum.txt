My name is Boris Hedgeblom. I work at INSERM in Bordeaux at the INSERM Bordeaux Population Health, where I'm also affiliated with the University of Bordeaux, INORIA and the Vaccine Research Institute. And so first I want to thank Leila and Peter and Lang for organizing this wonderful workshop. And I'm quite excited to talk to you about transcriptomics today and their potential for being an early. Potential for being an early surrogate for vaccine response. This is a collaborative work with Leila, Rodolf, and Dennis. And I'm actually quite new to this field of surrogate markers. I've only started working with it thanks to Dennis and Leila that lured me in. But discussing about our applications with the data we have in Bordeaux and at the Vaccine Research Institute, it's At the Vaccine Research Institute, it's turned out to be quite interesting. Also, I'm going to talk about the work in progress today, and so I won't be presenting any results, unfortunately, because we haven't had time to do that work yet. But I'm very interested in hearing your thoughts about what I'm going to proposing. So, this work started because there's actually a lot of Work started because there's actually a lot of data that is being generated in clinical trials and especially in early phase vaccine trials, the one that we are analyzing as a data science division of the Vaccine Research Institute in Bordeaux. And an example of that is the cytomics data, which I call cytomics. It's basically flow cytometry data or mass cytometry data where we characterize cell populations with dozens or Dozens or with dozens of markers that leads to hundreds, if not more, cell populations for a given sample. Then there's also transcriptomics, which I'm going to talk at length about, whether it's measured at the patient level in bulk or with single-cell RNA-seq at the cellular level. There's also now ways to measure the immune repertoire either in B cell or in immune repertoire either in B cell or in T cell. And there are also other high throughput assays. I won't go into a longer list than what I already did. But bottom line is that this flood of data is a challenge, but it's also very helpful. It can help in understanding the underlying mechanism that drives the vaccine effect. Hopefully it could help predicting vaccine effects. And what is of interest for us in this workshop, it could In this workshop, it could be helpful in defining surrogate markers. I'm going to have a slightly different perspective than what we've been discussing so far in the sense that as Peter presented earlier, antibody response is a frequent surrogate in vaccine trials. And what we're actually interested in in this work is to In this work, is to see if we could have an even earlier surrogate for vaccine effects. The idea behind that would be that if we could measure this surrogate in the days or hours after the vaccination instead of weeks or months, which is what we're doing with the antibody response, we could, for instance, ensure the protection for first responders in case of an outbreak. And I'm thinking of And I'm thinking of, for instance, what happened with Ebola when you had an outbreak in Africa and health workers were sent to the front line before any vaccines were actually licensed. And so that would be quite helpful. And another application of such an early surrogate would be to be able to individualize either the vaccine regimen or the booster dose. boost the dose and an example of application for that would be for the covid vaccines where we know that older people or immunocompromised people have more difficulties to monitor a proper antibody response and so if we could detect early that they need an additional booster or a larger dose this could be also quite helpful so for those of you who are not super familiar with transcriptomics With transcriptomics and gene expression, here I laid out a simplified version of the central dogma of molecular biology where we have DNA at the beginning of the molecular cascade that gets transformed into RNA in a genetic process, and that's what. Process and that's what's very interesting: that the fact that gene expression is actually quite dynamic, and then in turn, that gets translated into protein, and at the end of this, into a biological phenotype, which is eventually what we are interested in. And so, gene expression, because it's a dynamic process at the root of cellular activity, and because it's very upstream in any biological process that is occurring. That is occurring holds these promises of maybe being able to carry the signal of the immune response in reaction to the vaccine. On top of that, it has been showed in several studies that gene expression is associated with vaccine response. And in light of this, it It's where our idea of maybe using this as a potential surrogate started. So, the question we actually really want to answer is, can we use gene expression as an early surrogate for vaccine response? And that actually breaks down into two parts. The first being how much of vaccine effect is actually being mediated through gene expression. Through gene expression. And if that turns out to be a large enough part, then the second question that immediately comes is that can we derive an optimal methodology to build a gene expression signature that would capture most of these vaccine effects? And this is tricky because gene expression data is highly dimensional. It's often considered sparse with a noisy signal and A noisy signal, and on top of that, if we are thinking about RNA-seq data, it's count data which requires maybe some tuning of the methodology to account for that. Okay, so now I'm going to introduce a few notations, quite standard, to introduce the methodology that we are proposing. The methodology that we are proposing. So we're going to denote A is a vaccination status that is either zero or one, and our primary outcome is the vaccine effect, which can be measured either as an indicator of infection, but rather in the application that we're considering, as I mentioned in the introduction, is going to be the antibody levels. And M is going to be the gene expression, and X. Expression and X can be confounders. And so two things can happen. Either gene expression completely mediates the vaccine effect, which means that changes that occur in Y are because of changes that occur in M, the gene expression, or the opposite gene expression does not mediate any of the vaccine effects. And then changes in M and Y are completely unrelated. Of course, in reality, Course, in reality, gene expression likes to immediate only some proportion of the vaccine effect. And that's actually what we're interested in quantifying. So this ratio R, which is going to be the indirect vaccine effect that is mediated through gene expression divided by the total vaccine effect. So now I'm going to have additional notations for the potential outcomes. So Y0 and Y1 are going to be So y0 and y1 are going to be the antibody level we would observe either without or after vaccination. The same goes for M0 and M1 for the gene expression without or after vaccination. And finally, Y0, M1 here is the antibody level that we would observe in an unvaccinated person if we could manipulate their gene expression as it Their gene expression as it would be after vaccination, and the opposite for Y1M0 here. So now we can define the different effects that we are interested in. So the total vaccine effect, delta, which is the expectation of the difference between the two potential outcomes, and the indirect effect that we're going to denote, gamma, and the direct effects that are denoted. direct effects that are denoted data. And so if gene expression does indeed mediates the vaccine effect, we have either gamma zero or gamma one that are different than zero, potentially both. And that begs the question of which effect do you focus on? And so instead of picking one of the two, we propose to summarize all of the information available. All of the information available, introducing this gamma omega, which is a weighted combination of both gamma zero and gamma one. And this omega weight is between zero and one and can depend on the confounders. And the same kind of combination happens with the total direct effect data. And two things that are interesting to notice is that if omega is actually independent of x, then this is just a convex combination of the natural effects. And if omega is actually equals to one of the vaccination status, then you end up with one of the natural Natural effects. So that's great. We don't have to choose between gamma 0, gamma 1, but now we have to choose a waving function omega. And that's basically a new problem. So there are many ways you could think of. There are two ways that we've already thought about. The first one being this ratio using the Ratio using the variance of the influence functions of Î” and the covariance between those two influence functions. And the interesting thing with this omega choice is that it would give the total direct effect with the smallest variance among the class of weighting functions that does not depend on confounders. And then another. And then another way of choosing omega would be to use the propensity score. And in that case, the weighted direct effect data would be actually the average vaccine effect. So that was for the first part: like, how can we quantify how much of the proportion of the vaccine? How much of the proportion of the vaccine effect is mediated through gene expression. And now, on the second question, which is how do we now construct a gene signature based on these ideas, it's important to note that now here the objective of the gene signature is slightly different than what's usually done when gene signatures are built, in the sense that we don't want just to predict. Don't want just to predict why, but the objective is slightly different. It's to best approximate the vaccine effect. And we want to build a signature which we're going to denote G M and so one way to do this is similar to what Larry presented yesterday based on Wong et al. One way to do this is to optimize is to optimize G has to minimize the difference, the square difference between the outcome difference and the surrogate difference, the signature difference. And that yield this G1 signature where we have this lambda term here that is this ratio and this This new expectation and this probability pi. Another way of doing this would be to actually empirically correct for the bias with this bias correction term B and attenuate the additional variability that is introduced by the fact that we actually estimate mu. Estimate mu, and we don't know it for sure. And so, one of the shortcoming of both of these approaches is that we would require some sort of sample splitting to estimate all of the quantities that we have laid out here. So, that's where we are on the methodological development at the moment. Development at the moment. And now I'm just going to introduce a few applications that we're thinking of to apply this methodology once it's a bit more fleshed out. The first one being on Ebola vaccines. So we have access to three different trials regarding Ebola vaccines. The first one being the Prevac study, the Prevac trial, which is a Which is a large trial that was conducted in Guinea, where they had almost 3,000 adults that were split into three arms. And something that's going to be typical is that there's a sub-study in this trial of 95 participants where they actually have longitudinal measurement of gene expression. And that's only for 95 participants. So it's a much smaller sample size. It's a much smaller sample size, and I'm going to come back to these small sample sizes in the discussion because I think it's a very important characteristic of our applications. And there is also the EBOVAC randomized trial where a bit above 400 adults were included in Europe, testing one of the two vaccine that was included in the pre-vac trial. And again, And again, a substudy of almost 60 participants had RNA-seq measurement for eight time points. And finally, a last study that was conducted in Germany where 20 participants received the RVSV vaccines with RNA-seq measurement at four time points. And in each of those trials, the outcome of interest would be the antibody titers after. Antiboditers after 190 days. So, just to give you a bit more details on one of those trials, here is a slightly more detailed description of the RVSD study in Germany where we had 20 participants. And here is where some Here is where some measurements were performed. So there's only four of those time points where we have gene expression. Those are day zero, day one, day three, and I think day seven. When we applied a vaccine, a system vaccinology approach where we looked at many high throughput markers, not just Markers, not just transcriptomics, we were able to find markers that correlated with the antibody response. And in particular, we identified early gene expression, an early gene expression signature that was linked to IP10, which was itself correlated to the antibody induction. So, again, just some biological intuition that there might be some reason to Some reason to think gene expression could help here. Another application would be for the COVID vaccine. Unfortunately, we don't have access to such large data as was presented beforehand. But there is this COVAX cohort study that was done in Qatar, where they had 23 participants with either Pfizer or Moderna. Or moderna. And this study is particularly interesting because we have a very high resolution temporally where we have RNA-Chick data at 22 time points. The antibody measurement here is a bit earlier than for the Ebola trials, where it's 14 days after the second induction, the second boost of the vaccine. And finally, an application with a larger sample size would be a similar use of this cohort study from the US that's publicly available, where 242 participants received a flu vaccine. And because it's a bit more ancient, it's microarray measurement of gene expression at four time points. And again, the outcome of interest would be the antibody fall change 28 days. Default change 28 days post-vaccination. So, in conclusion, as I repeatedly said, this is a work in progress and we still have much to do. In particular, work out precisely the estimators and how that would work in practice. We would implement this as an R package, which would be ultimately on CRAN. This is just a private joke to my dinner table from last night. From last night. And one of the issues that we are facing in this application is a relatively small sample size, especially with regard to the fact that we would require sample splitting. And one way we've been able to circumvent somehow these small sample sizes in more descriptive approaches in the past is to really incorporate into the modeling the longitudinal aspect of the data. Uh, the longitudinal aspect of the data, and so I'm not clear yet how that would work in this zero gate framework, but I think it's an interesting avenue, and I'd be happy to discuss that further during the workshop. And also, one thing that's quite different than what we've discussed before is that we use as our primary outcome already a surrogate of sorts and not the targeted vaccine efficacy. Vaccine efficacy. So, thank you. And if you have any questions, I'll be happy to take them. Yeah, thanks, Boris, for this great talk. So, you kind of answered. I you kind of answered this, but I just want to clarify a point. So, one of the points yesterday about the nice properties of a surrogate marker is that it's easy maybe early, it's easier to measure and also potentially earlier to measure. So, my first reaction when you said, okay, let's look at gene expression data, is that really easier to measure? Is that more expensive? But then I get that, you know, it is better to look. You know, it is better to look at that than exposing someone to Ebola. Um, so that's I understand that that's one motivation. But now, what other applications of this exist? So, you mentioned COVID, but I'm wondering, is it really easier to look at gene expression data for COVID or what other applications exist for your method? So thanks for this question indeed. Thanks for this question. Indeed, you're right in the sense that using like genome-wide gene expression from whole blood is probably not something that we would do routinely. But I see two applications. The first one being actually those phase one, phase two trials where we do get this data anyway because the immunologists are actually interested in going deep in. Interested in going deep into the biology and of the immune response triggered by the vaccine. And that's why we get all those time points where we do get gene expression. And the other answer to that is also that if we do get a signature that is actually promising as a potential surrogate, I don't think our intention would ultimately validate like Validate like the signature from the RNA-seq measurement, but to derive a much cheaper and easier assay of just a few genes. And hopefully, that would be more feasible. Can I ask a follow-up on that? Sure. This is Dave from online. Yeah, so I thought this was really interesting. I thought this was really interesting. Based on what you just said, I think another naive approach would just be to first select some genes that have an association with your vaccine efficacy and then treat those as a low-dimensional set of markers. And if that's ultimately what you're shooting for anyway, why not do that? And why stick with the high-dimensional problem? Yes, that's a very good point. And that's something that we might. That's something that we might actually try out. The main difference between this approach and what we're thinking of is the signature that we would test this way would not necessarily be optimal for the surrogacy in that sense, but it might be very close in practice. And so it's definitely an interesting avenue. Okay, thanks. Hi, this is Andrew. Hi, this is Andrew. If I could just also kind of follow on that. Sure. I thought that was a really interesting talk as well. It's an area I'm really interested in. And I wondered, I guess one thing I wanted to clarify is how you're thinking about this sort of stepwise, like sort of marching to the surrogate of infection where you're sort of, is that the idea that you're first you're going to look for a surrogate of the antibody response and then that would lead to this sort of looking then next at the surrogate of the of the At the surrogate of the outcome of interest, the clinical outcome, and do you think of that as like a stepwise approach, or is there like eventually you're thinking towards a joint model of those things? And then, I guess, I just wanted to comment also that in the field, there is a huge field of these transcriptomic biomarkers. And I'm most familiar with it in the case of tuberculosis, where there's diagnostic markers that have started with these RNA-seq kinds of things, and they started with 40 or 50 genes, and they've now, over the years, boiled it down to like three genes, and they're talking. Like three genes, and they're talking about really using it as a handheld device as a point of care. So, I think that the idea of using you know with quantitative PCR, there's these technologies that actually can be useful, very useful in biomarkers in an application. Yes, thank you for this point. I'm not sure I fully understood the first question, but I'm going to try to say something and hopefully that answers part of me. Um so the the idea would be to uh first uh make sure that we actually are able to extract enough information from gene expression from RNA-seq data, for instance, and make sure that this um is a uh this mediates enough of the of the vaccine effect so that it's it's um interesting to push further and then we will And then we would like to define a gene signature slightly differently than what's being done currently with the biomarker with this surrogacy in mind. But we could not validate this signature on the same data, of course. And that's also a tricky part of this work where we would need a different data to value. Different data to validate this in some ways. I hope this answers some of your question. Yeah, it does. Thank you. I'll probably follow up with you. Okay, thanks. Okay. Yeah, I just had a couple of comments. So I think on Dave's point with the individual genes, I know that part of what we're planning to do with this, and I mean, you hinted to it, is I mean, you hinted to it is compared to, you know, what happens. Is there just one gene, or, you know, I'm probably not using the right terms, but if we could just achieve our goals with one simple thing, then we're going to say that, right? We're going to say, actually, you don't need this very complicated, optimal gene signature, blah, blah, blah. You can just use, look at this one thing. So that is part of what we're going to do. And then We're going to do. And then to Tanya's point about the kind of usefulness of this, I think you definitely would have to think about the trade-offs in terms of cost because it would be only relevant for certain settings. Like if we're talking about COVID for someone like me and you, it's probably not worth looking at this right away to. Looking at this right away to like for me to get COVID, I mean, which I've already had, but it's just not, it's not a big, you know, it's not as big, maybe not worth the cost at sort of the high level, policy level or something. But for someone who is at very high risk of dying and maybe wouldn't leave their house at all, you would want to know sooner, is this working? And especially for things like Ebola and, you know, maybe later down the road, other fun. Road, other fun, terrible viruses that are coming our way. Like, there's going to be cases where it is really, really important, maybe for just a small subset of people. But I think that still, you know, makes it very important, but probably wouldn't be something you would do on like a large scale. Oh, yeah. Hold on. Let me take this to Dennis. If it's, but this isn't super cheap, right? Well, fine. No, I brought it to you. I think if you could get the cost down. I think if you could get the cost down low enough, then from a public health perspective, like even for COVID, right, where many people are not at high risk, you want to make sure everyone's like properly vaccinated. So if you have a surrogate that you can measure in the hours after someone gets vaccinated or something like that, then there's potential sort of like spillover effects to everybody else, even if you're not at high risk. But yeah, it may never be cheap enough to do it on a large scale. I had to speak up. I had no idea you'd be talking about Ebola vaccine. So that's something really interesting to me. I just had a comment, which was, I think this is of equal, if not greater, interest in terms of identifying the signature, understanding sort of the basic immunology of it, what's going on. And I can think of an application where, for example, you identify the signature in healthy people and then you're interested in contrasting it with immunocompromised people or whatever. You know, compromise people or whatever, and find out what aspects of you know the vaccine response, the response to vaccination are sort of knocked out and so on. So, I think it's fascinating just in terms of basic immunology and like what applications it would have sort of beyond the surrogacy, which I know is what you focused on here. Oh, I do want to just point out that we do have a panel later that's all about vaccines. Great. Thank you, Virus.
