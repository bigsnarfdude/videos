Okay, thank you introduction by Professor John. So I'm very happy to give the second talk. So this talk basically is the same topic, but more on the nonlinear wave equation or the hyperbolic equation. So I will focus on the FIFO3 model under the nonlinear wave. So I call Is a nonlinear wave, so I call it a hyperbolic FIFO 3. Let's start with some simple example. I think we already talked about the FIFO model or measure several times. So not just me, also the Hao Shen and Weijin's talk. So I want to go more like a basic example, go over a little bit. Go over a little bit so you can see what exactly is the FIFO mode, the Gibbs measure in this background. So if we consider a very simple Hamiltonian equation, so it's like a non-linear string. So this is the equilibrium, and let's suppose Q is a position of this ball, and P is a velocity of this. And P is the velocity of this ball. So it's easy. So if we suppose the potential energy, the VQ, so it only depends on the position. So if we have the high order part, the Q to the fourth, so that's why it's a non-linear spring. So then if we want to display. And if we want to describe this system, actually it's easy to find here. We have the H, the Hamiltonian, which is also the potential energy plus the kinetic energy. So this is a conserved quantity. And the system is easily can be described by this Hamiltonian PDE about the Q and P. So all this second order ODE, sorry, ODE. So then the Gibbs measure in this example is just very easy. So it's just this measure. So we have the dq dp, just find two elements, the Lebesgue measure of the Q and P, and then we put the exponential negative H. So H is conserved, and Z is a normalized constant. Constant. So then this mu is a probability, and under this flow, it's easy to see the invariant measure. Because the DQDP, the big measure, the volume is conserved under the Hamiltonian system. So if we write down this V, this Write down this V, this potential, then we put the Q square, P squared together. Then the second part we can see together with DPDQ, this is a 2D Gaussian, right? It's a standard Gaussian, and with some weight. Weight is something exponential negative, it's less than one. So it's easy to see, okay, the Gibbs measure is absolutely continuous with respect with respect. Continues with respect to Gaussian measure. So, this is a very good property, but if we later we'll see it can fail in the PD setting. This is ODE setting. So, this is invariance just by the Louvre theorem for the divergent-free vector field and the conserved of the Hamiltonian. So, another example we can have. Another example, we can have the so-called invariant Gibbs measure. If we consider this overdamped Langevin stochastic differential equation, which just we put the same v the potential and we in this equation we put a square root of two times dB. Here, B is a brownie motion. DB can be understood just as a white noise. Why noise? So it's not difficult just directly by the Eaton formula. It's easy to justify under this stochastic dynamic system, differential equation, the nu of Q. This is also an invariant measure. And okay, this one is the same with the other, the mu, just if we. Mu, just if we put the dν times the de Gaussian of the P. So, in this sense, they are equivalent. So, both of them can be understood, the Gibbs measure. So, summary, so what's a Gibbs measure? So, basically, in this two simple example, we can see: so if we have some potential energy, and we can always define a so-called Gibbs measure. So-called the Gibbs measure, and this measure is invariant, right? So, under the Langevin equation or Hamiltonian equation, there's two types of different equations. So, if we from the ODs to PDs, so the question is, can we prove the invariance of the Gibbs measure for the PDs? For OD, it's a trivial. So, for PD, it's a non-trivial thing and Non-trivial thing, and to justify this invariance of a gift measure, basically we can okay, can be understood, we at least need to do these three parts. So I also talked about this a little bit last time. So first, the construction of the Gibbs measure. So basically, the construction of the Gibbs measure for the PD is just the construction of the FIFO3 model or some related. How some related quantum field theory, quantum field model. So this part kind of like a classical is also we already learned a lot from the Wei Juni and Shenghao's talk. So the second one is we need to study the local theory, local well-posedness of this PDE under this type of Gibson data. The Gibbs data. So, this usually is the most difficult one because the Gibbs measure is supported in very low regularity space. So, with the first one, the second one, we can usually get the global well post-ness, means almost sure global well-positeness. Then, we can justify this Gibbs measure under this global flow, it's still invariant measure. But okay, of course, the third one. But okay, of course the third one is not trivial, but kind of now it's standard. One like argument by done by Bougain in 1994. So we call it a Bougain's globalization argument. So basically, so if we have the construction of the Gibbs measure, which is a classical thing in the quantum field theory. And if we can have And if we can have the well-posedness for the PD, so this URL is the hardest one. So, with the first two, so by a standard Bougain argument, we can get the third one, which we most want to know. So, let's go over a little bit. So, this is the OD case. We consider Q or Q and P in the R and we have the potential V here. And we have the potential V here. But for PD, the Q should be like an infinite-dimensional thing. So it can be understood, for example, this function, phi, from some torus to the complex number or the real number. So then this potential is also infinite-dimensional versions, right? So this one, okay, just like the potential, Hamiltonian part. Potential Hamiltonian part in the of some PD. But this is kind of like a formulae because when we consider feed some data supported in the very low regularity space, then this is not well defined, right? As yesterday's talk, right? We we need to do some renormalization. We need to do some renormalization. So if we translate the OD thing to the PD, so basically we can, okay, this Gibbs measure thing can be understood related to the FIFOD model. So first is the construction of the Gibbs measure, which is just a construction of the FIFOD model, and then another Another is a cubic, we have studied the cubic stochastic heat equation. So, okay, this is just the, in my understanding, this is just what the stochastic quantization studied. At least it's one important example at the first day's Hao Xin's talk. So, this can be understood somehow like the infinite-dimensional version of the long. Infinite dimensional version of the Langevin stochastic differential equation. So, okay, so if we consider the real valued Hamiltonian, so the Hamiltonian equation, we extend this into infinite dimension. So it can be understood as a cubic wave equation. So and the complex value Hamiltonian, it's just the cubic Schrödinger equation. Just the cubic Schrödinger equation. We talked about Schrödinger last time. So let's go over a little bit the history. I think first about the measure, which is a construction of the FIFO model. So one dimension equal to one, this measure kind of like not that difficult. I don't find which is the first literature, but it's well known. But it's well known for a long time, at least 1960. So 1966, I think this one, probably the first construction of the 2D FIFO2 measure, the Nelson's work. And the FIFO3, this classical, very classical paper Glimm Jaffe, nineteen seventy three. 1973. So, for the higher dimension, okay, this is a negative result about the construction of the Gibbs measure of 545. The measure can be not constructed by the ESMA and the for league. So, basically, one dimension is a high dimension. One dimension is a high dimension, bigger or equal than five. We don't expect we have the measure, so we cannot study any dynamic, the measure under any dynamics. So this heat equations, stochastic heat equation, V4D model under the flow of the stochastic heat. So this is our water, the first one, this actually. The first one, this actually, I think the title paper is also related something like the stochastic quantization. So basically, for this column or the heat part, they can be understood just the stochastic quantization. So then under the wave flow, the Drukov, the 1994 study the FIFO1 model under the wave. Under the wave. And then Bugan 1994. So this paper, that's a paper I think I mentioned last time. So basically, just 1D cubic equation with Gibbs measure data. So then 1996, Bougain did the 2D. That's a method I explained last time, Bougain's research. Bougain's recenter method he used. Then this one, 2D wave, Bougain, I think, mentioned in some notes. It's not written down in some paper, but at least I can find this Bougain first to prove it. So then the Double Art Debush, who did the stochastic quantization for the 2D. Then this is a groundbreaking. Is a groundbreaking work by Martin Hare, right? So he developed the regulatory structure theory. So that theory can solve the Fi43 under the heat equation very well. So this is very difficult before Martin Hair or Gubinetti's Martin Hair's regular structure of Gubinal's parallel control theory. So the reason why this The reason why this is quite difficult is also because of the very low regularity. Basically, in the 2D, the Gibbs measure or FIFO2 measure supported in the H0 manus, below zero, but in the dimension three, it's H negative half manus. It's quite low. So before the So, before this, people don't know how to handle this low regularity. So, then for the wave and Schrödinger, what's the corresponding result? So, that's a question. So, and also for the full D, so this is Eisman Dominion Corpin's 2019's work. So, this is also proves a negative result of the existence. Result of the existence of the Gibbs measure, they can prove the triviality. So if you keep doing the renormalization, so the Gibbs measure cannot be constructed. So then we don't expect the flow of the Gibbs measure. So then today I may focus on this work. So the FIFOS array under the non-linear wave. Under the nonlinear wave equation. So, this is work by Bion, Dong, Lamode, and myself. Okay, the last one still open. So, the reason why it's open, I think last time I talked about a little bit, this is so-called the probabilistic critical problem. So, now all the tools we cannot handle this. So, some related works, recent ones. So, I want to mention the Gubernetic Co. This work is in the 2018. This is the first work to use the power control method, to draft the power control method on this nonlinear wave equation. So, this one basically didn't scroll. They didn't get the Gibbs measure. They didn't get that level, but still, this is the first paper to use a power control liter. We will see. We also use a power control answer. But also, this is a quadratic non-linear wave equation. So quadratic is easier than the cubic. So this is like the, it's also called the Fiss Race Ray, right? Fiss-ris-ray model. So then the paper I present, the result I presented last time, Dona Moda and myself, 19 and 21, two papers. One is this, okay, this is 2D. So we study the 2D, but with a power bigger than or equal to 5, like higher than the quintic one. So this one. So this one is a paper after Bougain. The first paper can be done after Bougain for Schrödinger, but that's only for 2D. And for 3D, we down one Hartree equation. So Hartree equation in 3D can be understood. So you can replace a cubic non-reality by some put some convolution. Some convolutional potential with u squared and times u. So it also can be understood a little bit some better than the cubic nonlinear Schrdinger. So these two papers are about Schrdinger, then Bremen's work for the Hartree non-linear equation. So actually the timeline The timelines like so after Brim and this work, so he can do only an epsilon loss compared to the cubic non-interway equation. Because if you set up the potential in the heart tree, it's very close to the delta function. One the potential is a delta potential, then it's just a cubic. So Riemann can can do it for Can do it for just an abstract gap. So after his work, so both of us, both of I mean, both Brema and our group, you don't know that and myself, we also realized this cubic non-leader wave for 3D is maybe close to be done. So actually, one thing is very important is also It's very important. It's also this probably scaling I talked about last time. So when we published the paper with a probability scaling heuristic argument, so Bremen see for the wave equation, actually the probability scaling is negative 3 over 4. But Gibbs measure for the 3D is negative 1 half. So for wavy, So for wave, it's so-called sub-critical, probabilistic sub-critical. But for Schrödinger, they are the same. So it's like the critical. So before this, so we both know, we all know, okay, the 3D cubic wave equation and the Schrading equation, they are both very hard problem, open question. But we don't know, okay, whether one of them is doable. So after we see this, We see this, we believe we can do it. And also, also after Buran's work. And then the other Okamoto to the males paper. This is the paper, it's a follow-up paper of the Gubinetico and O. So in that paper, they can finally finish the stochastic quantitation of the Phi 33. So basically, under So basically, under the wave flow. Okay, so this is our mean result. So basically, we consider the, okay, of course, we need to renormalize. So this, we use a two-dot. So this is a first-level renormalization called the weak ordering renormalization. Basically, you just remove the mass times the linear C wave. So the mass part is going to The mass part goes to infinity when you take the limit. And the second limit is like a second-order renormalization. So that comes from some certain like double resonance terms. So we won't talk about the detail inside. But without the second renormalization, it's impossible to construct the measure. We prove the probabilistic well-posedness. Probabilistic well-postness with respect to the Gibbs measure, and also we can get the global almost sure global well-positiness under the Gibbs measure and the invariance of the Gibbs measure. So this is the FIFO3 model. So basically, okay, formally, it can be written in this way, as I just talked before. So, for example, this one, the fee to the Phi to the full, this integration actually, so it's not well defined if you study the phi in the low regularity, in the low regularity. So if we want to really rigorously construct this measure, so we need to use some way, as talked yesterday by Weijuin, some finite dimensional approximation. Let's say this epsilon is a Say this epsilon is a limit. We take a so then we do the renormalization, replace the phi to the four by okay, minus this to C epsilon d epsilon. While epsilon go to zero, they are both c epsilon d epsilon both go to zero. So the construction, as I said, is kinetical. So it's kind of back to the Gleiminger Fay, 1973. 1973, and there are many more recent constructions, other descriptions. So, I want to, so there are many, many. So, I want to name a point to the Barkarov Gubineni. This is a variation approach. So, also in Reijin's talk yesterday. So, and another, the Gubineni and Hofenova, it's a PDE construction. Uh, it's a PDE construction, and one notes: the uh, the Murato Weiber with Weijin. I think this is a very good study notes. So it's a self, there is self-contained construction. So if we want to learn from zero, so that's a good, good, good lecture notes. So for the Gibbs measure, if we want to set up the If we want to set up the initial data, it's a Gibbs measure. And so we run it under the wave law. So basically, we have two difficulties. So one is the spatial regularity of the measure. As I said, it's one minus dimension over two is negative half. Actually, it's negative a half minus. So it's very low, right? Another difficulty is for the dimension. For the dimension one, dimension two, V41, V42. So actually, the Gibbs measure, Gibbs met the data follow Gibbs measure, the Gibbs measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the Gaussian free field. So in that sense, if we want to study the local well postness for the 1D and 2D, we can just use the data, follow the Gaussian field. Field. Then, because of the absolutely continuous, like the probability zero set is also probability zero in the Gibbs measure. So that basically the local theory of the Gibbs measure of the Gaussian field, they are kind of like equivalent. So we just need to study the initial data with the Gaussian data, which is very simple. But in the 3D, it's much more difficult. 3D, it's much more difficult because the FIFO's array is singular with respect to the Gaussian field. So basically, without this absolutely continuity, which means we cannot directly use the Gaussian field to like as a substitution. So we need to really use the Gibbs measure. So this So this singularity actually from the Fourier coefficient. So if you run with a Gibbs measure, then put that into the Fourier mode, then the Foulier coefficient of the data is dependent on the GN. So if you write down the Gibbsian data into the Data into the Fourier coefficient, then it can be understood as Foulier coefficients are something random and times some the GN, right? So these two parts are not independent. So this is a difficulty. So our goal is to separate these two difficulties. is to separate these two difficulties. So we want to separate the Gibbs data into two parts. One part is a low regularity, but with a good probabilistic properties like the Gaussian-free field data. The other is bad without the independence of the Fourier coefficient, the bad probabilistic property, but in the higher regularity. The higher regularity. So we can deal with these two parts separately. So then the way we really do is we, so this is actually use the stochastic quantization thing. So we use it more like a black box. So if we want to study the GIF state under the wave flow, we first We first study, we use the Gibbs initial data, but under the stochastic heat equation, we run this dynamic from time zero to time one, one constant time. So because we already know this heat equation, stochastic heat equation, cubic stochastic heat equation, it's well It's well posed. And the Gibbs measure is also invariant measure under this stochastic heat dynamic. So then we start from Gibbs measure after certain time stochastic heat dynamic. We got the data at the time one. So this should be also a data follow the Gibbs measure because Follow the Gibbs measure because the invariance of the Gibbs measure of this dynamic. So, but we can have, so, but with this, we can have more properties from the P D's, from the stochastic P D's. So, this is this is, I think also this is one reason why people want to study, want to use a stochastic quantization to study the FIFO model, right? Because after this PD dynamic, we This PD dynamic, we actually learn more information about the Gibbs measure. So after this, we then put this data into the wave equation, then we run it. So that's our idea. So this can be understood a highly non-trivial change of coordinates, right? So you can imagine, so we cannot imagine without the Martin Herr. Without the Martin Hairs, Gubinet, all this work, we can solve this, right? Because so inside of the first step, substitution, so it's already, there are many like highly non-trivial maths inside. So we are based on their paper. So another question is: why not use the other representation of this? Other representation of this singular Gibbs measure. So, for example, some approaches on the drift measure or variation approach. So, of the box sharp curve of Guvin L. I think these are two type constructions of the Gibbs measure. So, basically, these are the, so for us, it's like a technical reason, but so if you really So if you we really try this but finally we found this if we use this two way the it's really like impractical it's infeasible. So I think it's it's it's reasonable because when we use a stochastic quantization, this first step, so we already know very, very, we already know very, very deep information. We well know very, very deep information about the Gibbs measure. If we use, for example, use a variational approach as presented uh here by Weijun yesterday, right, so we only know that formula about the measure. It's impossible to later you'll see when we really consider some high-order iteration of the Gibbs measure. So, several iterations, several Gibbs measures, then we interact then iteration. Interact them, iterate, it's really impossible to describe by only using that to describe. So this type of initial data, we call it caloric initial data. So, okay, named after the Terence-Tos caloric gate transform when he studied some geometric wave equation. So Wave equation. So basically, as I said, this phi heat one means we run the stochastic heat equation on Q time one. So this one may be not one. So really in our paper, this not has to be a constant time. It could be some time depends on the probability. But let's say just a certain time. We stop here. Then we can write down this equation. Write down this equation into three parts. So, this is purely from the stochastic heat equation. So, first part we use the blue circle. We call it the Gaussian data. So, basically, this is exactly the Gaussian free field. Data follows the Gaussian free field. So, this is from the white noise in the equation. Then we use the stochastic. Then we use the stochastic heat equation iterate once. So then that becomes the Gaussian free field, Gaussian date as a regularity negative half minus, right? Because so this is not difficult to see. So the second one, we call it the cubic, the second one, the diamond, green diamond. We call it the cubic Gaussian chaos. So this forms the This from the three, if you have the already have the Gaussian free field data, the blue circle, so that's just the linear evolution of the white noise. Then, if you put the three white noise, then use like a cubic into the cubic non-normality of the stochastic equation, then we iterate. So, this term we call it the cubic chaos. Chaos. So this one in a higher regularity is a half minus. So let me remind you for the cubic nonlinear wave equation, the deterministic scaling is a half, the regularity. So which means one, we consider the data in the sub-life space HIS as bigger than a half. We can run the classical deterministic. On the classical deterministic local theory of the cubic wave equation. So we stop here because we only need the structure below a half. So one is above a half, we don't care the probabilistic random structure inside. So actually, you can write more, but we don't care because it's already the remaining thing is already like. remaining thing is already like one minus it's already above a half so it's enough to run the to put it in into the smooth remainder the okay no it's the the the this red pentagon is something like a smooth remainder so uh so you can see the first and the second You can see the first and the second, they all from the white noise, the stochastic heat equation iterations of the white noise, right? So the initial data of the Gibbs measure in the heat equation, actually after one times the iteration, because the smoothing effect of the stochastic heat equation, it's already go to the remainder directly. So that's why we don't need to constantly. So that's why. So that's why this representation, the intro data, actually, there's no any Gibbs merit thing, right? It's we know more like Gaussian things. So for the first order, second order. So you can see this is a perfect way to separate the two difficulties, right? So the first term, second term, they are low regularity, but They are low regularity, but they are of good random structure. The third one, the pentagon, we don't need its random structure very well because it's already in the high regularity. So now the answers, when we study this wave equation, so with this caloric initial data, so the most difficult. So, the most difficult thing is a low regularity. It's a special regularity of this blue circle, the Gaussian free field data, it's minus or half minus. So, to solve this, basically, okay, we can use a power control answers to study it. So, actually, So, actually, I think people may already expect the power control and that can solve this problem after we see this is a probably subcritical problem. So, as we know, power control theory is very successful in the parabolic or stochastic equations, right? So, but for the wave, wave kind of like in my understanding. Like, in my understanding, something between the heat and the Schrödinger, right? Because wave you also have some smoothing effect, and there are some other part is also similar to the Schrödinger. So actually, we first tried to use our random tensor theory to solve this problem. But when we start for a while, several months, we found actually we don't. Several months, we found actually we don't need that. So, the random tensor theory, more the structure is like more, how to say, it's fragile. So, it's very hard to really keep that structure because the structure is too fine, it's too detailed. So, actually, if we want to keep that structure, we need to make much more efforts. More efforts. So here, because of the smooth effect, so one way we believe, so this explicit object, just like we can do the higher and higher order iterations of this stochastic object. So if we iteration more and more, so finally it will get to the half, right? A half is the remainder we want to put. So at least So, at least we know it's like a finite expansion in the NZAT. So, of course, this is not that simple, right? Because we have too many terms. So, the linear term, cubic term, and the clinical term for the Gaussian-free field data. And this one, the second one, it's the linear evolution. So, I use this. So, I use this bar, use this bar like the linear iteration of the wave equation. So, you can see the third term, the diamond term iteration, that's from the second term of the caloric initial data. It's a cubic chaos term. So, after this, if we iterate more. After this, if we iterate more, they all go to the remainder. The regularity is above a half. So that's why for the explicit objects, we stopped there. And then the power control terms, which are the terms later we'll see the real detail, it's like a high frequency part of the power control, it's like the explicit objects. Then the low frequency part could be anything of the intro data but of low frequency. Of low frequency. So, this term, in that sense, is like para-controlled by the explicit stochastic objects, first part. So, kind of like they are similar. That's the idea. So, this type of piece of data. The initial, the Gaussian field part, this of the regularity negative half manus. And the cubic iteration is the blue one, second one is of regularity zero manus. And then the following four terms, including two power control terms, it's epsilon below a half, right? So we finally will make sure all of these terms, they are all possible terms in the The all possible terms in the solution that's below a half. So then all the remaining thing we put into the y, it's a smooth remainder. So these are the definitions. So okay, the linear part, first the linear part, just use a blue circle, use a heat equation, iterate once, linear heat equation with Gaussian free field data. Then the cubic term, just term, just the cubic, right? I think there are some renormalization I forget. So the cubic should be renormalized cubic. Then the other one is the same, iteration with diamond. Then the quintic is just two linear with a cubic. So after this, if we consider high-order iteration, they are order iteration they are they are in the remainder so the power control is like this so the pair controlled term okay basically we only need to consider okay the high low low interaction for the x1 and the high high low interaction for the x2 okay so the the this the the star to the star position is like the low frequency It's like the low frequency solution. So it could be anything in the anzad. Okay, here, the high frequency part, we put the linear evolution, the linear part. So basically, our answer just finds all terms of regularity below a half. So the remainder, so because the answer is very long, right? So you can imagine put that into the remainder. That in the remainder, so all the interactions. So, in total, it's 87. Actually, so this number beyond counted. But I believe him. But so, of course, it's a lot. So, technically, this is very, so this removes interactions from the renormalization thing. So, basically, we have many, many terms, many different types of terms to control. Control. So, this is why this paper is so long. It's 190 pages in the archive. So, it's really technical. So, to do this, actually, okay, we need to exploit almost all techniques we know in this field. So, okay, I just list here. Maybe I don't explain in detail. So, let's highlight some part of the proof. Highlight some part of the proof. So these are the different things from the other results. So first is you can see we need to control some terms like these. For example, interaction with one wave linear with diameter. So like two linear to to linear with a cubic chaos. With the cubic chaos, Gaussian cubic kills, the diamond thing. The diamond thing, so in some cases, we can just treat it as just some general function of irregularity or half minus. But in some cases, we have need to use explicit random structures. So, here, this one, if you write down this longhand notes, so explicit, when we write down, we need to Explicit when we write down, we need to write down these. So basically, you can see first the blue circle thing. So we can use a okay, here it's a cube, then with a dotted line towards to a circle. So this dotted line, we use it. It's like a linear stochastic heat dynamic evolution. So iteration. So then the middle one, the diamond. One, the diamond one, you can see it's a cubic term, right? But it's a cubicle in the stochastic heat equation, not a wave. So we have to deal with this type of thing. Of course, there are some, we call it pairing thing. So because randomness, if they are of the same frequency, we cannot use it. So we need to separate the second two cases with one pairing, two pairing. So this type of interaction, this is This is very different from the other paper. This is something new in our paper. The other one, this is something for us, it's a little bit magical thing. So we found 1,533, so called 153 cancellation. So so-called 1,500 ray cancellation means so if you consider the square of the cubic thing, so just the square of the cubic, for example. Just the square of the cubic. For example, if you put the first two positions, like the two cubic, third position could be anything in this one. Then if you focus on first two positions, the square of this, so basically you can compute the actually the expectation of this. You can compute this is actually bounded from below by some log n. So it's a log divergence. So with this divergence, With this divergence, so actually, at first we see this, we found okay, it looks impossible to solve this problem. So, this log divergence is at the similar level at the second renormalization. That is also another log divergence, but they are different. So, for this one, so we finally found, but of course, we first believe this one. Course, we first believe this one can be done. So, this is true. This hyperbolic verse rate is true. So, finally, we found, okay, this divergence canceled with another divergence, which is one linear evolution term with another quintic term. So, we call it 1,533 means one linear quintic interaction. Linear quintic interaction is cancelled by two cubic interaction. So, of course, the magical things, this coefficient should be paired somehow. Otherwise, this cannot be cancelled. So, we find it in a very, how to say, so we write down, we literally write diary terms. And so, so when Bion gave a talk in some way. In somewhere in the US, he told me somebody can see this directly, follow some Freeman diagram, but we don't know how to use it. But maybe if your physics is good enough, you can see this kind of thing directly. So for us, we just see it from the equation explicitly, we can see it. So then for the remainder terms, okay, that's most of the terms we need to. That's most terms we need to control. So it can be separated, classified into two cases. One, it's an explicit object, but it's high-order enough. One, you iterate high-order enough, high enough, it goes to the remainder. So another, there are some non-explicit objects like the power control X1X2 or the remainder Y. So in this interaction, we need to put it back to We need to put it back to the smooth regularity space. So for the high-order explicit objects, for example, the hardest one in our paper is considered some objects like this, septic objects, with a cubic, cubic, cubic, three cubic. So in total, there are nine random variables, right, of order nine. So it can be written down in your mind. So it can be written down in a multilinear Gaussian sum with the folding, this one. So in the Fourier side, it can be written down into this. Thus, C can be understood some coefficient. So okay, I won't go to detail, but okay, it's explicit. You can always write it down like that. So it's not difficult. But when you really estimate, we want to estimate, we want to put this one. Estimate, we want to put this one into the regulatory space like a half plus. When we really estimate this term, so which is like the expectation of this, so by the Gaussian hyper contradict hyper hyper hyper what's the words? Yeah, so anyway, so we we want to we want to we just need to estimate the Just need to estimate the two moments, then we can use a two-momence expectation to bound any p-moments expectation so that this term is bonded. So almost surely bonded. So when we really do this, basically we have this term. This is just by the classical called the weak theorem. So the thing is simple. So one, all the randomness. All the randomness they are of the different frequencies. If you take the expectation, they go zero, right? So the only thing you can have in the right-hand side is the terms, so we call it the P is a partition of the 1, 2, 3, 2, 9, 1 prime to the 9 prime. So there are 18 randomness. So if they are all paired, means the randomness, for example, GK. Randomness, for example, GK1, GK2 bar, they are of the same frequencies, so the randomness is basically gone. So then you take the expectation, it's not zero anymore, it's one. So when all the terms, when all the terms are paired, then that's a case that you need to handle. So and in the C, it's really, in the end, the C tensors Tensors can be reduced to the content estimate. So you can see there are many, many cases because you need to consider all the possible pairing partitions of these 18 terms. So, okay, now the paper is already 190. If we do this by hand, okay, it's another 100 pages, maybe, but they are not that difficult. Difficult. So, but you need to do it one by one if you do it. So, so that, so here actually we use Don Han is the molecule representation. So, basically, it's a representation to show, okay, it's so one partition can be one by one mapped to one so-called molecule graph. And for the general molecule graph, we can develop. We can develop an algorithm to deal with it. It's like it's an algorithm. So this is initially developed by Donghani in their Web Connected paper. So optimistically, I think in Dongy's talk, he will talk about this. So another is a yeah. Yes. Yes, I think it's a good idea. Uh they are the expectation. I think this is a Gaussian measure. This is Gaussian measure. Because here this is a case we only consider the blue circles. They are the Gaussians. So we already separate the data into like the linear Gaussian, Gaussian field field. Gaussian Gaussian fulfilled part, the cubic Gaussian chaos, and the remaining thing is not Gaussian, but we treat it like the remainder deterministically. So now this one is like a pure Gaussian thing. Yeah. What do you mean, quadratic extensions? So, yeah, it's more or less just in the P. You just basically separate the whole index into pairs, all pairs, and all the possible partitions you need to do with one by one. Because for different things, the C, they are different, right? So, you need They are different, right? So, you need to use different content estimates to do it. So, of course, the one difficult thing is they are of different frequencies. So, you need to carry all the one to a nine, they are of different frequency, which one is high, which one is low. So, so indeed, there are many, many cases. This one? This one? Yeah, that's it. You don't talk. You just talk should be. So this one, we don't, yeah. This one basically is a representation to represent all the above thing, all the above cases for each P, for each partition. You can write it down into some graph. And for the graph, it's like a graph. Like it's like a graph for, okay, you don't want to talk about it. So that's not that simple. Actually, they developed that theorem not just for this specific case, for general, more. Because in their paper, they need to handle more than this. Okay, let's finish quickly. So, okay, so maybe we skip this. So the So, the future work, so basically, the probabilistic critical one, this one, the cubic shading equation. So, that's very difficult. And all the current theorem cannot solve it. So, the out of equilibrium, so there are two parts. One part is so-called the wave-turbulence theorem. So, this one also, so I list this because you don't will present this. So, they already said. So, they already solved, I think, the most important problem in this field: the long-time justification of the wave kinetic region. Okay, this is for Schrodinger. So at the kinetic time scale, so this connect at the kinetic time scale, this problem is so-called, it's related to our so-called probabilistic critical problem. So, this is very hard. So, solved by serious work by Dohani. But in this field, still, there are many other. This field skills, there are many other models that need to be done. And another is a coarse environment. So, if you consider not the Gibbs measure can be understood as an equilibrium case. So, if you consider general Gaussian data, not at the Gibbs level, different level, so what happens for this type of random data under, for example, wave flow or Schradinger flow? So, some So some now there are some results, so can be so the crossing in variance can be proved in variance cannot be proved. But we still know much less in this case. So, okay, that's all.
