Tell us about C2 effective spectral sequence and C2 equivalent, which will be a KOC2. Thank you, Tina, for introducing me. It's a great pleasure for me to get a talk here. So, what I'm going to talk about today is a new spectral sequence in C2aquarance stable homotopy category that is the C2 effective spectral sequence. And I will talk about its construction and also the use of that. and also the use of that to compute an example, which is the LC2 graded homeotopy of the spectra LC2. We will see from this example that this new spectral sequence, it is useful and it is good in a lot of ways. So before I talk about real mass, I would like to say a little bit about the philosophy. We have equivalent stable homotopy category and knowing things in equivalent stable homotopy category helps us understand Vicate helps us understand some classical theories. And usually, sometimes things happen in a very unexpected way, like in Hill Hopkins Ramana's work towards the environment one problem. And on the other hand, we have the motivic stable homotopy category, thanks to Bobowski and Morel. Knowing motivic, we can also get some information which helps us understanding classical things. And the example, And the example, one example can be the computation by Dan Isaacson, Guojiang Wang, Zhou Li Shu. They use some theoretical work established in Gyoge Wang Shi, and their computation almost doubled the stable stamps that we knew. Okay, so let's think about equivalent series. If you take a specific example in these equivalent Specific example in these equivalent theories that I take my G to be C2 and you think about the C2 equivalent stable home toky category. The computation there is already very complicated. And it turns out that if you think about the armotivic, then the armotivic computations there compared to C2A covariant, they are more accessible. And the R-motivic homotopy category, it is sufficiently close to the C2Aquarant stable homotopy category so that nice things in the So that nice things in the RMOTV computer category helps us understand or simplify the calculations in C2 equivalent. And the spectra KOC2, it is a good example, a test example which shows this philosophy. Classical. So what is this spectra, this little KOC2 spectra? First, we have the uppercase KOC2. This is a C2. KOC2. This is a C2 spectra associated to the C2 equivalent vector bundles. And we can take its connective cover, that is the little case KOC2. So here the connective cover is taken in the sense of the integral-graded multifunctor valued home topic. And this little case KOC2, it is a C2L convergent analog of the little KO in the sense that if you look at its underlying spectrum, then what you will see is a connective real. Which you will see is a connective real K-series. Now that running the computation to the homotopy of K little KO, it's very simple. We can run an atom spectral sequence. So the story goes this way. The cohomology can be identified with A mod mod A1 and A mod mod A1 here A and A1 there, single algebra and the set algebra generated by square 1 and square 2. And we run atoms for little. Run atoms for little KL. By change of ring, the E2 page can be identified with this X and it converges to the two completion of KL. Now let's do the C2 equivalent B. So thanks to Green List, we have the C2 equivalenvirant version of Adam spectral sequence. And the computation is carried out in the work by Gill, Hill, Isaacson, and Remnell. So similarly, So similarly, the cohomology can be identified with A1 by A1, but the C2 equivalent version. And the convergence problem is solved in Kukrish. So the C2 atom spectral sequence of KOC2 converges to the two completion of KOC2. So far, mimicking the classical story looks fine, but if you go into the computation, then things become pretty hard. For example, this notation. For example, this notation M2C2, it is a C2 equivalent to cohomology of a point. And non-equivariantly, this is very simple. It is the simplest thing I can think of, a non-trivial, simplest thing I can think of. But equivalently, it's hard to describe, so I don't describe it in words. I describe it using this picture. This is the C2 equivalent or to cohomology of a point. Cohen model of a point. So, what we can read from this picture is: first, you see this thing consists of two cones. One is this part, the upper part, which we call the positive cone. One is the lower part, we call it the negative cone. And the upper part, this is nicer if you zoom in. If I zoom in, then you can see that there you have two, you have two. You have two generators, one is called tau, one is called rho. And actually this part, the positive cone part, it is a polynomial ring generated by these two generators. So the two pieces of information I would like to show you from this picture is that first the C2 equivalent cohomology, multi-cohomology for point, it is additively consists of the positive cohomology. The positive cone and negative cone. And the positive cone part, it is a polynomial generated by tau and rho. And the negative cone part, it's ugly. I'm not going to go into details about it. There is a way to decompose this thing into easier pieces. That is, we can first look at F2 adjoining with just tau, and we can add the Tau, and we can add the other generator row, and we can add the negative point. And actually, there is a reason for this decomposition. That is, the first line, F2 adjoined with tau, this is the C multi multiple homology of a point. And the second line, this is the unmotive equal homology of a point. And of course, the third line, that's the C2 equivalent one. And the C2 atoms computation. The C2 atoms computation in GHR take a similar approach. That is, we want to compute the atoms e2page, which is that X group, and we can start from CX, using that to compute Rx, R motivic X, and then to C2 atom, and we run the C2 atom spectral sequence. So, how to go from Cx to How to go from Cx to Rx? The difference, as we can see from previous slides in the cohomology of a point, the difference is that polynomial generator rho. So we filter by the power of rho, and that gives us a rho-box sign spectrum sequence. This computes from C-motivic to R-motivic. And from R-motivic to C2 equivalent, the difference is the negative column. And the C2 equivalent X indicates. The two equivariant x it decomposes into the armotivic x or the positive cone x and the negative cone x. The computation in the negative cone x is fairly determined by positive cone x and these two together gives us the C2x which is the atoms E2 page. Now run the atoms and it turns out that C2 atoms spectral sequence collapse so the E2 page equals the E infinity B infinity Infinity, B infinite H, which is an associated graded homotopy of KOC2, up to 2 couple H. And also in their work, they solve the extension problem, so we know the homotopy structure of KOC2. Okay, so let's summarize. In GHIR, what they did is that, so we need to compute the first difficulty we meet with is we meet with is to compute the E2 page, which is that C2x. This is something PV algebraic. And GHR, our approach to compute this C2x is that we do this computation via the motivic world. And it turns out that the C2 computation is easier to see via motivic world. But still the computation is hard. From C motivic to R motivic, the robot sound spectroscopy Robot transpect spectral sequence, it's already a lot of work there. So, first, there are a lot of differentials, it does not collapse at a finite stage. And also, you have header extensions to displace in the robots and spectral sequence. And also, you have header extensions in the C2 atom spectral sequence, though they collapse and you don't have differentials, there is still a lot of header extensions. And I think one reason for this is that For this, is that this approach is using motive purely algebraically. So the hidden extension, this part, there is some geometric information. And you cannot, by using solely algebraic information from motiv, it does not help with this geometric part. So that leads to a question. Is it possible that we start with something geometric in motiv so that the geometric part, So that the geometric part, the geometric word is already done there, and we bother the information there, take that to C2 equivalent. Is it possible? And if such a thing exists, will that further simplify the computation? So this is a question. And then Isaacson suggested I think about this. And it turns out that this philosophy works. The example is this C2 effective slide spectral sequence. Sequence. So now I need to tell you what C2 effective slice spectral sequence is. This is some spectral sequence which origins in the motivate world and we borrow the information there and take that to C2Aquari. So before I talk about what that is, I would like to say, give a brief introduction of this motivic stable home topic category. The motivic stable home topic category The motivic stable homotopy category is defined by Wobovsky and the notation is SH of K. K here it is a few, it can be more general. And SH of K it is a motivic state or homotopy category. This gatch construction is as follows. So first we take the category of smooth schemes over spec K under some condition and we Condition. And we look at the category of simplification shifts out of it. Then we are landing the category of motivated spaces. So this category of motivated spaces, it contains two kinds of object. First, we can think about the representable sheaves, that is, it contains the schemes. For example, if you think about For example, if you think about a spec of k, then this is a terminal object in the category of these sheaves. And also it contains alpha line. It contains alpha line minus zero, which we denote by S11. And it also contains, so these part, they're the more algebraic or metric objects. It also contains things that come from topology, which is you can take the constant sheaf and that is, it contains. And that is, it contains all the simplicial sets. And the example I want to mention here is the simplicial sphere S1, which we denote by S1, 0. Okay, now this is a category of multiple spaces. To go to the stable category, we need to stabilize it. And actually, there's one more step we need to do, which is we need to make A1 contractible and we invert these two kinds of spheres as 1,1, the algebra. As 1,1, the algebraic magic sphere, and the simplicial sphere. And we pass through homeotopy, we land in the stable home topic category, motivated stable home topic category. This category, you can define a smashed product on it, then it has a good symmetric monoidal structure. Is there really any reason to assume separate Uh I don't know. To me these are some technical conditions. Technical conditions. Okay. Okay, so to me, this is a category which contains, which is like a combination of algebra geometric things and also topological things. And this is of interest to algebraic geometers because it allows people to apply home-topic techniques and it is of Techniques and it is of interest to homotopy theory because this is closely connected to non-equivalent and equivalent stable homotopy category. And this connection is called bacterialization. So zero says no. Oh, no. So we don't need to assume separately. I mean it doesn't matter. Okay. It's a perfectly good condition to assume that if you don't like it, it's okay. Thank you. No, but it has the No, but it has the so it means that instead of using a P1, we can use A1 with a double point later. No no no nobody wants to do that. Okay. Okay, thanks. So let me continue. What is this value realization functor? If we assume our base field K is embedding to complex numbers, then for these Numbers, then for these sheaves, we can take their C points. And this gives us a functor. This functor stabilizes. So it is actually a functor between the stable homotopy categories. We start from the motorbike stable home topic category and land in the classical stable home topic category. Now, if further, we assume that this basic field K admits an embedding into the real numbers and then to compact numbers. And then to complex numbers, we can still do the same thing, that is take the C plus. And there's an extra structure, which is if you think about the conjugation action, then the image, it will give us a C2 action on the image of the fadiogramizations. So that is, we start from the motivic stable homotopy category and we land in the C2Aqual stable homotopy category. This is the C2Aque. This is the C2 equalization, a C2 refinement of the classical battery. And examples. So let's assume our base field is R, and let's look at what is the image of these two kinds of spheres. One is the algebra geometric sphere. S1, 1 it is defined as the alpha line minus 0. So if we take C points, we will be looking at the complex plane. Be looking at the complex plane minus zero that is homotopic 2 S1. And if you think about the conjugation action, then the conjugation action is flipping the upper half and the lower half plane. So this fear, it is the one-point complication of sign representation. If we adapt the by-grading convention, that the first grading is a total degree and the second is a degree. Is a total degree, and the second grading is the aquarium twist or the number of sign representations you have, then this is the biging, this is a bigraded sphere S11. So under this bigrading convention, the motivic notation and the equivalent C2 equivalent notation, they agree. Also, another kind of sphere is the synficial sphere. It takes C points and the C to action is trivial. And the situation is trivial, and we get the equivalent sphere as 1, which is equivalent sphere H10. Okay. And this value realization functor is pretty nice. It is studied in different sources. And I would like to tell you more about good facts about this functor. So these facts, you can find them in work of Heller and Omsby. Work of Heller and Omsby. So first it is left quilt, it is drawn symmetric monoidal, and it is triangulated. And as what we just saw, it realizes spheres to spheres. And by gradients, they agree. And also, it realizes Edinburgh-McLean to Edinburgh-Maclean. This MA here, it is a motivator Edinburgh-MacLean associated to Maclean associated to A. And the HA here it is the Equin-Ellenberg McLean constant Machi functor. So what is A here? A then group a ring? A what? A ring or a without a C2 action or? No, 'cause it was just a typical thing. Well, it was just a real typical. Okay, sorry. There's too many. Yes, it's nothing. Okay, so uh yeah let me summarize what I just said. What we are looking at here is actually the square. So we have R-motivic, we have C2 equivalent, we have C motivate classical, these four stable homotopy categories. And they are related by these factors. From C motivate to classical, we have the non-equivalent realization function and the top horizontal horizon. The top horizontal arrow here, it is a C2 equivalent refinement of materialization functor. The C2 equivalent category and the classical category, they're related by you look at the underlying spectrum or the forgetful functor. And the R motivic and C2 motivic, there's a functor connecting them, which is induced by R embedding to C. So this is actually a diagram of a commutative diagram. A cognitive diagram of categories and factors. Now let's come back to our question. So our question is, we would like to see some computational tool in the C2 equivalent, stable homotopy category, that is more directly related to the motivated homotopy category. And C2 equivalently, we already have a very powerful computation. A very powerful computational tool, which is the C2 equivalent slice spectral sequence. So it is, I think, first defined by Dan Duggar, and it's used in a lot of places, for example, Hill Hopkins Revna. And if you want to apply that to compute KOC2, this is hard because the slices of KOC2, it is hard to identify. To identify. So, our hope is that can we get a slice approach? And the slice approach is somehow directly related to the motivic theory. Ideally, if we can get something in the motivic stable homotopy category, which is a slice-like approach, then we can just take the value realization and we will get a slice-like approach in the C2L covariant category. And luckily, such as Category. And luckily, such a thing exists. That is, the motivic effective slice vector sequence or motivic effective slice filtration gives us such a thing. So let me say more about this motivic-effective slice filtration. It is first proposed by Wobosky, and we use this notation S-H-E-F-F for effective to denote the effective. To denote the effective subcategory, it is a subcategory of the stable motivic stable homotopy category. It contains the suspension spectra of the motivic spaces and it is triangulated. The smallest triangulated for subcategory contains these things. So if I would like to think about what kind of spectra it contains, let's just think about what kind of spheres it contains. Then It contains, then, because it contains all the suspension spectra, so it contains everything that you can get out of that two kinds of sphere, S11 and S10. And the requirement you have on your bi-graded sphere is that the first grading, the total grading need to be greater or equal to the second one greater or equal to zero. And we have this definition that this is triangulated and being triangulated. And being triangulated allows you to take desuspension by simplizial sphere. So we can disusand by S1, 0. And that allows you to make the first grading arbitrarily small. So the only requirement we have is that if you think about what kind of sphere it contains, then the only requirement is that the second grading needs to be greater or equal to there. Okay, so this is the effective subcategory. We can also consider We can also consider the zero Q suspension of the subcategory, the Q's effective subcategory. And or these subcategories gives us a sequence of inclusions of subcategories. This is the slice filtration. Now we have the slice filtration, we do some formal construction. The construction is as follows. So first we learn As follows. So, first, we look at the inclusion from the Q's effective subcategory to the stable homotopy category. And this functor emits a right adjoint. So, we take the composite. The composite gives us the Q's effective power functor. And by formal arguments, we can get a sequence of maps from Q plus 1. maps from Q plus one's effective cover of some spectra to the Q's cover to the Q minus one's cover. And let me introduce some notation. So F subscript, this is the effective cover functors. And F upperscript, this is the effective co-cover functors. And it is defined to be, you take the co-fiber of the map from F subsquared to identity functor. Identity functor. And if you look at two adjacent terms in this sequence of maps, we take cofiber of such a map, then this gives us the effective slices, which is denoted by a subscript. And the picture I like is this one. So the left-hand side, yeah, the left-hand side, this part This part it is the effective cover and the right hand side it is effective co-cover. The left hand side we can get the associated gradient slices by taking co-fibers of adjacent terms. And dually the right hand side we can get equivalently we can get these slices by taking fibers. So the left part it is an analog to the classical white head tower. To the classical whitehead tower, and the right part is an analog to the classical Poznikov tower. And these two towers, they're equivalent to each other. So let's look at the Poznikov tower part or the slice co-tower part. What this tower is looking at, it is not exactly the spectra x, but the homotopy limit of this tower. Therefore, we need to get a Therefore we need to give a name. We name the homeotopy limit of this tower the slice completion of the tower. The slice completion of the spectra x is defined to be the home-topy limit of this tower. And if we take home topy of our associated greatest slices, then we will get a spectral sequence whose E1 page is a home topy of these slices, and it converges conditionally to the slice completion of the The slice completion of the spectra X. And this is the motive effective slice spectra sequence. Actually, Dan has complained to me several times, abuse of this word slice, because the word slice, it is used in a lot of different places. And they are formally similar to each other. But for example, we have the equivalence light spectrum. Have the equivalent slice vector sequence, and we have this multivakive effective slice spectral sequence. They're formally the same, that is, you have a filtration, you take localization, and you have a tower, you take associated weighted slices, you get the spectral sequence. But depending on the filtration you choose, they can be very different. So, for example, this one, the motivated slice spectral sequences, the subcategories, they are triangulated. You're closed undertaking. Undertaking extension, cofiber and fiber. But the C2 aquevira slice spectral sequence, it is not, it's not triangulated. You can take cofiber, you can take extension, but you cannot take this expansion or fiber. Right, so I was, when I was making these slides, I thought about delete the word slice, but But eventually I decided to keep it there because otherwise I would abrade with this thing as M-E-S-S. And it is not mass. Actually, this vector sequence is pretty good. So some good things about ma mass. So first, on this definition, we can talk about it for general fields. Talk about it for general fields. You don't need to fix to a specific field. You have our motivation version of that, C-motivic version of that. So you have a lot of things that you can compute. And another thing is that the slices of many interesting motivations spectra are known. For example, the most interesting motive spectra, which is the sphere spectra, the slices of that is known. And this has, so though it's not the same. So though it's not the same, even you take realization, though it's not the same as the aquavarant slice spectra sequence, it has closely connection to that, that is worked by Douhardt, and also it has close connection to the Adams-Neukov spectra sequence, that is worked by Mark Levy. So this is the motivic, the motivic story, the motivic effective slide spectra sequence. We can think about now, let's take C. About now, let's take C2 peterialization and we go into the C2 equivalent world. I would like to mention that when I first thought about this, there are two ways to take value realization. One is that you take the realization of these slice filtrations, you take the realization of these subcategories, and you do the formal construction in the C2 equivalent stable homotopy category. Homotopy category. And the other choice is that I do this woman construction and I get the tower and I realize that tower. So, in fact, at the first I thought about the first one. I thought about taking the realization of the filtration and do the construction. But it turns out that this will give you something ugly. For example, the Edinburgh McLean's, they're not zero slices. And the reason for that is if you The reason of that is if you think about the coefficient ring of an pain, that is the positive coin and the negative coin, and the existence of the negative coin makes it not that vanishing. So the first effective cover is not contractable. And so the right version we want to think about here is we do the formal construction in the motivation. Do the formal construction in the motivic world, and we realize the tower to C2 equivalent. And we realize this effective co-tower. And because this realization function, it is triangulated, so we realize this spectral sequence, this is still a spectral sequence. And what it means is that if you look at the associated weighted slices of this real light tower, Realized tower, then these slices are the realization of the motivic tower. Okay, so motivically, we have this motivat tower and we take Hong to P going to algebra and get the motivic effective slice vector sequence. It computes the slice completion of our motivic spectral x. In C2F19, we have this realized tower. We have this realized tower, and we take home topy, we go into algebra, we get the C2 effective spectral sequence. So the first thought is that it computes the realization of the slice completion. I mark it red because this is not true. The reason is that the slice completion, if you think about what it is, it is homotopy. Is it is homeotopy limit of that tower? And realization functions, it is left equivalent. It does not necessarily preserve homeotopy limit. So here is a warning. The realization of the slice completion or the realization of that homotopy limit does not necessarily be equivalent to the homotopy of the realized state. Therefore, we need to introduce this notation of effective completion. completion. The effective completion, so the definition is that it is a homotopy limit of the real X tower. And the right version of the C2 effective spectral sequence is the homotopy of the real X slices that compute the homotopy of the effective completion. Now the spectral sequence is set up and we can use that to think about our example which is a computation of KOC2. Computation of KOC2. So, to do the computation, we need to find a calculationally accessible model, motiv model for that. In the periodic case, in the uppercase case, the motivic spectra, it is called KQ. So this is the Hermitian K-series spectra. And this is the right motivic model for uppercase KOC2 in the sense that if you take the C2-betting realization of that, The C2 betting realization of that, you will get uppercase KOC2. And we have the connective version of that, connected version of that, which is a very effective cover of KQ. So very effective cover. I did not tell you what that is, but this is similar to the effective cover and the difference is that the subcategory you choose, it's very effective subcategory knife. Very effective subcategory, not effective subcategory, and they're slightly different. But this is the right version we want to consider. This is the motivic analog of the classical KO in the sense that if you take the non-equivalent realization, you will get the classical KO. And it is almost the motivative counterpart of the C2 equivalent KO. So first we have a map. We have a map from the realization of map from the realization of C2 realization of KQ to KOC2 by universal property. And here to simplify the notation, I define, I use a notation KQC2 to denote the C2 realization of KQ. Okay, so what I mean by this is not exactly KOC2, but close. We have this proposition, which is that this map is introduced. This map induces an equivalence after attack completion. So I don't know if this map before attack completion is equivalent, but it's an equivalence, but after attack completion it is. And this is enough for our computational purposes. It's by this corporation, so I said that this is enough because of this corollary. Corollary. So C2 equivalent atoms computes the two completion of KOC2. And we have this fact that if you do atom computation and then you do completion, that is the same as you do, just do two completion. So this map, it is an equivalence. After other completion, if you further do a two completion, you still have an equivalence. And if you take the Two completion of the eta completion of KQC2, then what you will be looking at is a two-completion of KlC2, which is what C2 atoms converges to. Okay, so this is the Mote-Vec model for KlC2. And let me tell you more about its Mote-Vec effective spectrosequence, Mote-Vec effective slices. This is work by Ananius. Work by Ananiuski, Pluton, Proninx, Osterver. So, the slices of a KQ, so their work identifies the slices of a KQ. The slices of KQ can be described using this weird expression, which is the motivum pain tense is something algebraic. I will explain in a minute what this expression means. And they also figure out some extra multiplicative relations that is not thinking about. Hitting relations is not seen by Adam Snoikov E2 page. And the convergence problem is solved. That is, the motivic effective spectral sequence, slight spectral sequence, compute the adder completion of KQ, and they carry out the computation in their paper for general fields for some bi-degree. Now, let me explain what this expression means. So, first what is atoms? Adams, so first, what is Adams Neuck of E2 page of KL? The Adams-Neut of E2 page of KL, it is X, and the big gradient of that X is S T, where S is Adams-Neuic of filtration, and T is a total degree. And on the Adams-Neuk of E2 page of KL can be described, it has two generators. One is called H1, the other is called V1 squared, and to H1 is 0. H1, it is in degree 1, 2. one it is in degree one, two and e one square it is in degree zero four. And basically what you will be seeing that what Adam Snoikov E2 page looks like is that you have a gray paper, two-dimensional gray paper, and you have lots of Z and F2 on it. And a copy of Z, it contributes to some suspension of MZ in the slices. Similarly, for MZ, Similarly, for F2, it contributes to some suspension of the Anberg McKay MF2 in the corresponding slice. Okay, so these are describing words and I think pictures are better than words. So I also prepared a description using pictures. The left-hand side, it is Adam's Noikov E2 page of K. On the right-hand side, it is slices of KQ. I will explain how to go from the left hand side. I will explain how to go from the left hand side to the right hand side. So in the Adams Moic YouTube page of KL, this is a pattern that you will see. You have the Z, that is index over by V1 square and powers of that, and also H1s. So each dot it is F2 and each square it is a Z. Let's look at the scoring dot, this V1 square, this dot. Dot this V1 squared is dot. So this is a Z in degree 0, 4. According to the previous slides, this will contribute to a 4,2 suspension of MZ in the second slide, that is in the filtration 2. So it will appear here on the right-hand side. And similarly, you can do the same thing to other dots, and each one contributes. and H1 contributes to suspension of MF2 and it appears here. You can read of the slices of KQ from this picture. For example, the zero slice, you look at the zero line here, it's just one square, and one square, it is a copy of MZ. So the zero slice, it is MZ. And the first slice, it is a suspension of, one, one suspension of MF. 1-1 suspension of MF2. The second slide, if you look at the two line here, you will see two dots. MF2 here, actually, this is 2-2 suspension of MF2 and a 4-2 suspension of MZ. So the second slide, it is a wedge sum of these two Edenberg mechanics I just described. So this is the slices of KQ. Now we take hometopy and we go to algebra. So take homotopy. So, take home topy. We can still use this picture to describe what we see after we go to home topy, go to the E1 page of our slice vector sequence. That is, each dot here, it's not representing an Ellenberg-McCain anymore. It is representing the coefficient ring of the Ellenberg-McCain. And what is a coefficient ring? So, as shown in previous slides, the coefficient ring for the motivic MF2, it is MF2, it is F2 adjoined with two generators, rho and tau. And if you add a direction, which is a direction of weight, another axis, then what you will see is a horizontal cone goes into the screen. So each dot here, they represent some cone. This is similar for MC, and actually I'm separately taking two completions everywhere. So each dot represents some cone. Represents some cone goes into the spray. And if you insist that I draw everything on this page, then I can draw the projection of them. And this is what you will be looking at. Each red dot represent a row modification. And each dot or each square, these symbols, the way to think of them is that they represent an infinite tower which goes into the screen. goes into the screen, which is tau squared power or tau power. This is not that bad. And we can, now let's look at the C2 equivalent case. So C2 equivalent case, this is a reminder that the notation KQC2, it is a realization of KQ. And there's another reminder, which is Alenberg-MacLean realizes to Alanberg-McLean, and sphere realizes to sphere. Two sphere. So if we take the realization of these slices, basically what you will see is nothing different than the motivic case. The only difference is that we replace MZ with HZ with an equivalent annual plane. And we take COMTOBI. This is a C2 effective slice spectral sequence for KQC2, and it computes the effective completion of KQC2. Of KQC2. So here is the work. Effective completion of KQC2. This is like the treasure chest you get from a motivic dungeon. And the work is that we need to open it. Okay. And you open it, you see that inside it is KO C2, the editor completion of KOC2. Okay, I did not expect that the color of gold is so invisible here. But I also But I also put it in a normal way. That is, the effective completion of KQC2 can be identified with the eta completion of KQC2. And this the previous proposition we saw, which is after eta completion, the realization of KQ and KLC to their equivalent. These two together tell us that what CQ is. Tells us that what C2 effective spectral sequence it is computing is the atom completion of KOC2. And if you further complete it, you will see the same thing as what RC2 atom spectral sequence computes. Alright, now let's look at the E1 page. So the E1 page, that is, we take the home. That is, when we take the homotopy of each slices, the homotopy is more complicated because immotiving we only have the positive comb part. But equivalently, we not only have the positive comb, but also the negative comb. So if you think about the pattern, these lines, each dot, they represent something goes into the screen, and also another cone goes out of the screen. And the row, if you project everything down into this piece of paper, this screen, then you will see a lot of overlaps, which is ugly. And we need another way to organize it. Which is we organize this thing by co-weight or the piece, the copies of trivial representations in your C2 equivalent weighting. Okay, and it turns out that if we organize it by colour, the pictures they look pretty plain and you will see a periodic pattern from it. I think this is a point where I'm supposed to show you some pictures, show you some charts, which shows the E1 page. I put it, I made the charts, I put it in the slides and I showed the slides to Peter and Peter commented with something which I think. Commented with something which I think is true and deep, so I would like to share it with you. Okay, I agree. The figure said, no self-respecting person calculating spectral sequences can suppress a desire to display the answers using charts that she loves. And only another such computational person could possibly appreciate it. Therefore, if you want to appreciate the charts, we can talk about it later. Okay, so now we've seen the E1 page. Let's compute the differentials. The differentials, they can be deduced from the mass, so multa-effective spectral sequence, the multavelic effective slide spectral sequence. And this is, we discussed the sequence. And this is, we we design it to be so because at least the B1 differentials, they are just a connecting homomorphism. And you can see that on the spectrum level. And we compute these differentials. It turns out that this computation is surprisingly simple. So first you have non-non-trivial non-trivial You have no non-trivial differentials after the E2 page. That is, E2 equals E infinity. You only have D1. And another thing is, so the differentials, they're simple. And another thing is that you got the analyze of the hidden extensions, they're also easy. So most of the hidden extensions, they can be analyzed. They can be analyzed purely algebraically in the E1 page, which means that we don't need to do arguments like toggle bracket arguments to get these hidden extensions, most of them. So from this summary, the differentials and the hidden extensions, they're both single for C2 effective spectral sequence. And the result, as expected, you can see a periodicity. You can see a periodicity, which is multiplication by an element beta. This beta element, if you realize it to non-equivariant, then it is the bot element. So this is the C2 effective spectral sequence results. And I think this is a point where I'm supposed to show you charts of the results and the header extensions. Okay, now we've seen the results, let's compare. The results: let's compare the C2 equivalent approach and the C2 equivalent atoms approach and the C2 equivalent effective slice spectral sequence approach. So, after two completion, the C2 equivalent effective spectral sequence, it computes the same thing as the C2 atom spectral sequence. And of course, these two answers agrees. The approach, they are independent of each other, and also they're Independent of each other, and also the arguments are independent. So, in other words, the C2 effective computation reproves the result of GHIR. And as we just saw, the computation, it is a lot more simpler. You have simpler differentials, you have simpler extensions. And the price we pay for that is that you need to identify the effective completion. You need to open that treasure chest. Okay, and another thing is that these two spectral sequences complement each other. So what I mean by that is if you look at the C2 effective spectral sequence, there are multiplication relations, there are extensions, and the extensions in the C2 effective spectral sequences, some of them, you can see them from GHIR as the multiplication. HIR as the multiplicative relation. So this also happens the other way. Some catal extensions in the C2 atom spectral sequence, they're just multiplications in the C2 effective spectral sequence. And I want to say something here. That is, I feel that this is actually the most interesting part of you have two spectral sequences. Have two spectral sequences and they compute the same thing. In fact, you don't need them to compute the same thing. As long as they're comparable, then you can get 1 plus 1 greater than 2. Because you have two spectral sequence and you put them together side by side, and by comparison, usually you will get more information. So, this is to me, this is like you're the detective, and you would like to see. And you would like to solve this complex, this great, complex, complicated case of murder because each page a lot of dogs kill a lot of other dogs. And different spectral sequences, they're like you get testimony from different witnesses. And by using that, it makes it possible to eliminate the problem. Eliminate the probability or possibility, and you can track down the suspects. This is also a good point about C2 effective spectral sequence, because C2 effective spectral sequence, it takes the motivic origin. So this comes from the motivic effective spectral sequence, which makes it comparable to things in motivic. And on the other hand, this is C2Aquarium. This is C2 equivariant. So you can use C2AN thing, you can use C2Aquivariant things or classical things to compare it with. This is like the Union Station in Chicago, where you have a lot of trains here, and these trains connect you everywhere. So, right, so the C2 effective spectral sequence. The C2 effective spectral sequence, because of its connection to a lot of different computational tools, it helps us to play a better role as detective. And okay, so at the very end, I would like to say something about future computations. So I have mentioned that the motiv slice. That the motivic slices of spheres are known. And as expected, the motivic slice of sphere can be expressed as the motivic Edenberg paint. So with the Adam Snoic of E2 page of the classical sphere. So if we realize the tower of that, the motivic tower of that, we will see the C2 effective slices of the C2 equivalent sphere, which is the Edenberg mcaine. The Edenberg mcane and cancel with the Adam Snoikov E2 page. And the question is: if we can carry out the computation of that, if we can identify the effective completion of that, and will this computation gives us more information about maybe C2 equal, maybe classical work, motivic sphere. So this is a possible computation. And I think this could be hard. This must be hard. This must be hard. Okay, and yeah, this is hard. And maybe another thing we want to consider is that can we find, like in the non-equivalent case, some approximation, some easier substitution to sphere, and can we do a same C2 analog of that in the C2 equivalent C2 effective slice spectra, C2 effective spectra sequence? So for example, So for example, the Adams-Noikov E2 page, the Adams-Noikov spectral sequence, it goes well with the VM periodicity things. Is it possible that we can find a C2 spectrum which sees the, for example, the alpha family in the Adam-Snoy curve E2 page? So what I mean is that the spectra whose slices the Adambergen page. The algorithm tells us with these alpha families, and if we can carry out a computation of that, if that computation will tell us some information about C2 BN periodicity. Okay, so this is the end of the talk. Questions? Peter is a character. Peter isn't here. Can you show us your pictures? Stop the recording. This is... Okay, this is... I just put four of them on this page. This is very unreadable, but I will say this is COVID 3, COVID 2, COVID 1, COVID 0. This is an E1 page picture. And since my blue and red. Things are mark blue and red because the blue parts are from the positive cone, the red parts are from the negative cone. And the periodicity, the mod two pattern I mentioned is that if you compare the code 3 and co-wave 1 page, then this is, if you slide everything in co-wave 3 down by 4, 2 and you truncate this blue pattern, then that's what you will see here. That's what you would see here. And similar for this COA2 pattern, you can slice it down and update this. That's the COA 0. So this is the E1 page. And the ENFI page, I feel I've betrayed Peter. Go with that feeling. So this is that one. I put eight on the same page because now this is mod 4. That piece is COVID 4 and this is COVID 0 and actually the mod 4 equals 0 part is the most complicated thing in the infinity page. But still you can see that everything slides down. Everything slides down and you get the COA0 page. And COVID 1, Co-Wait, no, that's 3. CoA3, COA negative 1 page, there's nothing. And here, that's 1, that's 2. And you see that you have a parallelogram with two lats. Also, this is Call Wave 1, this is Call Wave negative 3. You see the parallelograms here. So this is a pattern. This is a pattern. So, is there a hidden ADA extension up there? There, yes. So, yes, this is very invisible. Yeah, so this blue line, blue dashed line is a row extension and this is an epa extension. And this is an eta extension. And you're saying that there's only D1 differentials in the spectral sequence? And are the D1 differentials, do they sort of match up with the A box time spectral sequence differentials? Is that figuring out what's going on? How do you get these D1 differentials? Okay, so the D1 differentials, they're different arguments which gives you the Arguments which gives you them. So, because the spectral sequence is constructed by the tower, and you see the D1 map on the spectrum level. On the spectrum level, it is the connecting homomorphism. So you can get that. One way to get that is from that geometric description. And which is these D1s, they're actually there. Stingrod squares. Ah, okay, okay, cool. Yeah, and also another way to do that is so the motivic motivic d what differentials we know and the motivic part they embeds into C2 aquarium. So the positive compart, it's just motivic, and the negative com part is some algebra. Correct. Yeah. And just one other question. So I know that the So I know in the GHIR, they see this sort of phenomenon of these hidden row extensions finishing off the complete A divisibility in the answer, or the row divisibility in the answer, I don't know what you want to call it. And your spectral sequence also has those, is that right? These those dotted lines indicate the low. Between the negative and positive cones, yeah. Positive columns, yeah. Oh, this? Yeah, those, yeah, yeah. Yeah, to these uh row extensions. Yeah, yeah. So, uh, so what is there does this spectral sequence provide a different means of computing those row extensions? Uh, actually, yes, these things can be deduced algebraically, I think. So, so I think JHR is the argument is that you compare it to Equivalent 10 things here because on the line you don't have Because on the line you have nothing in KO3, the pi 3 of KO, so that is row divisible. And I think you can also get arguments by comparing this and that. I think about, so this dot here, if you take its multiplication with tau upper 4, you will get some dot there. something there which is which supports a which is how do you say which is row which supports it supports a row tower and by comparing non-trivial row multiplication is that what you're saying Uh that one supports a row tower. Yeah. Okay. Okay, cool. Cool. Okay, that's that's cool. Other questions? Okay, thank you very much.
