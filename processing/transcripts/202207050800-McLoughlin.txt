First of all, thank you for the invitation to speak at this workshop. I've attended a couple of BERS workshops in the past and really enjoyed them. The space that's created in the agenda just for the networking and talking informally, I really appreciate that. The kind of typical action-packed scientific conference where you're running from presentation to presentation and panting to keep up is sometimes overwhelming. So I really like. Sometimes overwhelming, so I really like the kind of pace and opportunities to really get to know each other. Um, I also feel really comfortable in this setting. I know some of you from past workshops and I've collaborated with some of you. Also invited one of my new colleagues from BC Wildfire to kind of back me today. So looking forward to getting to know those that I haven't worked with more over the coming days. I'm new to BC. I've moved from Alberta recently. Moved from Alberta recently. I was with the Alberta government and the wildfire service there for 18 years. Before that, I spent a bit of time with Parks Canada and a bit of flavor of fire when I was there as well. So most of my career has been in fire, but I never planned on it. As I mentioned in my introduction, I started in conservation biology. And I find it interesting that I'm kind of slowly getting pushed back into more Worldly problems and conservation-related problems. And I think climate change is one of them. And I kind of had that epiphany the other day. Anyways, I moved to Kamloops, BC six months ago, started in January. And so I will admit that I'm a little bit intimidated to talk about perspectives from BC Wildfire Service with only six months under my belt. But again, I've got Mike here to back me. But again, I've got Mike here to back me. Some of my comments may be a reflection of more of my general career in wildfire. So we're going to talk about a number of things kind of just jambled together. And I'm actually going to ask you to participate later in the presentation here. And I want to get your feedback. Listening to the introductions yesterday, there's just such a well. There's just such a wealth of information and knowledge and expertise in this room. It would be a loss of my time here if I didn't try to tap into that. So as John mentioned, I'm in a new role as a superintendent of predictive services, and there's been some big expectations laid upon me, and there's some big problems BC, but other fire agencies across Canada and the world are facing. They're facing. And so I'd really like to try to tap into some of your thoughts. And whether you're a grad student or whether you're later in your career, I want to hear from everybody. So I'm hoping we can do that in the presentation later. So let's start with a couple of statistics. I wonder if I can move that little top window. It's just cutting off. These are 20-year periods. And I started in 19. I started in 1961 to 1980, then shifted 20 years forward, 81 to 2000, and then the most recent 20-year period, 2001 to 2020. And I've got a number of statistics here. I'm not going to read them all out in detail. I might give you a moment to just kind of reflect on some of them, but let's look at a couple and just look at kind of general trends. If we look across the Trends. If we look across the first row, total number of fires, we've been fairly consistent, but I did notice in the last decade or sorry, 20-year period, that there's been a fairly substantive drop over 10,000 fires less than the previous two 20-year periods. But when I look at the next row, total area burned, it has more than doubled. When I look at the 90th percentile fire size, 90th percentile fire size, it has doubled compared to the previous 20-year period, and it's certainly much larger than the 1961 to 1980. Maximum fire size, three, four times as large as the previous two 20-year periods. So looking at a half a million hectares as our maximum fire size. Maximum fire size, and this isn't taking into account the 2021 fire season from last year. Number of fires greater than or equal to 1,000 hectares. There's a lot more of them in the last 20 years, two to three times as much. And finally, percentage of fires accounting for 98% of total area burn. This one, this one blows me away. Blows me away. I have to keep looking at this. There's so much behind that last row. You know, 61 to 80, 5.3% of fires accounted for 98% of total area burn, fairly similar in the next decade or sorry, next 20-year period. And then you finish off in the most current 20-year period at 2%. 20-year period at 2%. 2% of our fires result in 98% of total area burn. I mean, imagine going to school and having to worry about that last 2% on your exam in terms of whether your organization succeeds or fails. And I mean, that's what we're dealing with. So, in one respect, it's a testament to how effective wildfire suppression has been in the last 20 years. In the last 20 years, we've more than half that, in terms of going from 5 to 6% down to 2, we've really started to zone in on that problematic little bandwidth of fires that's resulting in most of our area burn. But at the same time, it's like, wow. Like 2%, that's all it takes. I think there's a lot of opportunity in that statistic as well. So, I'd invite you to think about if we can't deal with that 2%, what about the other 98%? Looking at some of those statistics just in a different way, this is by. Just in a different way, this is by decade, area burned, total area burned across the province of British Columbia by decade. Note that the last decade, 2020, of course, only has two years that are going into that bar, and it's already meeting or exceeding five of the seven previous decades, which is two years going into it. But we certainly see an uptick in the last. The previous decade, 2010 to 2019. So over 4 million hectares in a 10-year period. And then just comparing those statistics to last year, I'm just kind of setting some context here, by the way. Number of fires, they were actually lower, relatively speaking, than a lot of the years historically. Then, a lot of the years historically where you're up to 2,000 plus fires. A lot of them were lightning caused, 60%. Area burned, close to a million hectares. 67 fires of note. Mike, can you help me explain what is a fire of note? My understanding is a large fire that's in the attention of the media, the public. The media, the public, its threatening values. Is there anything else to add to that definition? Generally, I'll describe a large fire that's likely to be interfaced on threatening values. Okay, so for those online, a large fire that's likely to threaten interface areas. Evacuation orders. I think there's a typo there. I know there's a typo. I think it was 100 and no, 67. It shouldn't say 1981. It should say 67. 81, should say 67. I'll have to check that. My apologies. That doesn't look right. Anyways, I know the next one is right. 304 evacuation alerts, over 19,000 wildfire reports on the 1-800 number, and 56 days in a provincial state of emergency, basically all summer, right into the fall. Suppression costs: $565 million. $165 million. So we spoke yesterday about the profitability of financial institutions. We talked about insurance and payouts. I would also suggest that governments, I wouldn't call them a financial institution, but I would say they're collecting taxpayer dollars and we're spending it every day. And right now we're spending a lot of money on wildfire support. Spending a lot of money on wildfire suppression. And then we're spending a lot of money on insurance and recovery. And not to mention all of the other impacts that public and firefighting organizations are feeling. So it is a very costly natural hazard. And then this was just a little soundbite off a media report I saw from the United Nations Environmental Program. Program. There's similar journal articles that are coming out that are forecasting what we can expect in terms of future area burned and fire rates. But this one was suggesting catastrophic fires are expected to increase by 50% by year 2100. And it just highlights that the consequences of these fires are wide-ranging, you know, really keyed in on some of the comments we made. Keyed in on some of the comments we made yesterday about damage and loss, danger from smoke, health, firefighting costs. But this report went so far to suggest to governments how they allocate their budgets. So 45% was suggested to go towards prevention and preparedness, 34% on response, and 20% on recovery. I know when I started in FHIR, we spent about 0%. Fire, we spent about 0% on recovery, but certainly some of the larger fire years I was involved with in Alberta, we were starting to spend a fair amount of money on recovery, which was never heard of before. Yeah, go ahead. So when you burn a community down and you're rebuilding that community, there's a lot of different phases from the evacuation to now there's no homes. You got to put those people somewhere. Put those people somewhere. They lost their wallets, their bank cards, everything. And so we're handing out credit cards with cash to people so that they can buy food. And we're filling up their, you know, Fort McMurray, we're filling up their vehicles with fuel so that they can evacuate or drive their vehicles, like just a lot of things we take for granted. So that would be the early phases of recovery and then rebuilding the community. And as we rebuild it, providing Providing a budget to build it back better and maybe build it back safer. And so these were areas that we had never put money towards when I was with Alberta government. We're seeing that now and it's suggested that we allocate 20% of our annual budgets towards that, which is crazy. You know, like it's basically saying there's going to be significant impacts. Allocate a fifth of your budget towards recovery. Budget towards recovery. I was encouraged to see an announcement earlier in June from our Minister of Forestry, Katrin Conroy. This is the largest investment historically ever in the BC Wildfire Service. They've added an additional $359 million of new funding to support prevention and preparedness. So those were two of the key areas that the previous slide here talked about. The previous slide here talked about 45% of the budget on prevention and preparedness. So that was encouraging to see. So there's our context. That's kind of setting the stage for wildfire in the province of British Columbia. I don't know if anyone's read the book Homo Deus. It's about forecasting tomorrow from a human. Tomorrow, from a human perspective. It's an interesting read, philosophical read, but I really like this quote. I actually have it written in my office on my whiteboard. What's the point of a prediction if it doesn't change anything? And so I always keep that in mind when I talk about modeling and predictions. So, with that, we're going to shift into some modeling topics. Topics. These were the three most common questions from the public, but I would also probably say our incident management teams and operational staff in 2021. Where is the fire now? What direction is it spreading? And when will it reach me? They're actually pretty simple questions, and they're still very difficult to answer. To answer. You know, when you've got 67 fires of note across the province and evacuation orders and everyone's experienced the smoke in the skies, you can't see the fires. You can't fly. A lot of our methods for tracking where these fires are is to ring them with a helicopter and a GPS unit and then bring that back for a GIS person to upload that information. GIS person to upload that into a spatial database so that we can display it. When you can't fly, you don't know where the fire is. So then we look to remote sensing and hotspot detection. But even those methods, you know, the satellites only orbit so many times per day, and sometimes there's not good visibility. And so you get little snippets here and there. So even as even just the first question, where is the fire right now? That's really hard to answer. That's really hard to answer. And then, when you look at BC and the complex terrain, well, what direction is it spreading? We're getting better at this. The high-res, regional, numerical weather predictions are doing a much better job than when I started my career. But there's still issues when operating in terrain. You get interesting diurnal patterns of wind flow. Flow and then when will it reach me? I'm going to talk about that one a little bit in terms of where we typically focus on models and maybe some low-hanging fruit. So let's go there. Extreme rates of spread. So this little graphic on the right-hand side is out of the 1992 report for the fire behavior prediction system used across Canada. There are 16 standard fuel models, mostly boreal-based fuel types, and they were derived from a data set of 300 fire observations. And they came from either experimental fires, prescribed burns, or large-scale wildfires. With respect to the large-scale wildfires, and even to a degree, some of the prescribed burns. To a degree, some of the prescribed burns, it wasn't like it was one single fuel type and it was a pure data point. It was often burning through a complex of vegetation types. And what you will see if you look at all 16 of these graphs is that you can literally see the data points that are identical on all of the different curves. They were reused. If we study this graph, and basically all Graph, and basically, all of the extreme rates of spread come from wildfire observations. They didn't do experiments on those extreme rates of spread. So, if we just start counting dots, 22, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 20. So, all of that and above is from welfare observations that are kind of a mixed bag. That are kind of a mixed bag from complexes, and also not documented or instrumented as well as an experimental wildfire. So it was at the lake at this time, and then it got to the river at that time, and, you know, approximate rate of spread. So what I take away from this graphic, and then I always keep in mind when I'm doing predictions, I drew these error bars in. They're not, I don't have the actual data, so I couldn't actually do a. I couldn't actually do an actual proper statistical set of error bars. So I just drew them in manually. But what I notice is as you get into the more extreme rates of spread, and this is a relationship between an index called initial spread index, which combines fine fuel moisture and wind speed, which allows you to predict how quickly the fire is going to spread. As we move into the more extreme initial spread index and higher rates of spread, Index and higher rates of spread, the error is so much larger. And what that really means in this example, I just highlighted a 50 ISI value. And that's kind of the difference, you know, on the upper and lower error. It's the difference between 55 to 95 meters per minute. That's 3.3 versus 5.7 kilometers per hour. Multiply that over 12 hours of burning per day. 12 hours of burning per day, you're out by a lot. You're out by a lot. So, those three questions that we talked about: where's the fire right now? What direction is it spreading? And when is it going to reach me? You can be way off, way off in these extreme fires. So, last year, some of my colleagues who were working in an advanced planner role actually went back to basics. They were, they They had employed some contractors to run our sophisticated fire growth models using numerical weather modeling data and the current fuel grid for the province. But after a couple days of observation that, you know, we are in that extreme zone of that graph and we're way off, they went back to just persistence forecasting. So looking at the weather forecast, looking at the fuel types and Forecast, looking at the fuel types in front of the fire, are they similar to previous days? Yes. Let's assume similar growth in the next 24 hours as compared to the previous 24 hours and just draw it on the map manually. And that's what this image is. And it actually did a pretty good job. So we're essentially doing science on the fly. We're collecting new data points. And I'll throw that out there. I mean, I can't remember the statistic for how many wildfires there are. Statistic for how many wildfires there are across Canada each year, but there's anywhere from 1600 to 2000 in BC. Why do we have more data points to improve these rate of spread curves? But this worked. Another issue observed last year with models and challenges with respect to climate change is some of these reports. Is some of these reports that we're seeing from the United Nations and the climate, what is it, the UPCC or IPCC, International Panel on Climate Change, are indicating warming overnight temperatures. And actually, the overnight temperatures are increasing more than the daytime temperatures. And that's really important from a fire perspective. When I started my career, When I started my career, in modeling, I was challenged to slow fires down. And it was all about that nighttime period. We knew there was recovery of temperature, but more importantly, relative humidity. Temperatures would drop, humidity would go up, and you'd have periods through the night where the fires essentially are active, but they stop spreading. And it was all about figuring out what that was. As a rough rule of thumb, it was 10 till 10, 10 at night till 10. 10, 10 at night till 10 in the next morning. And after one or two days on the fire, you just kind of knew what it was, you observed it, and then you could build that into your models. What I'm showing on this graph is the only fuel moisture metric we have in FHIR that provides us a perspective on diurnal patterns, and that's the fine fuel moisture code. It responds hourly, and you can track it through a 24-hour period. It through a 24-hour period. And so, in this graph, there's two methods for estimating what your fine-fuel moisture code is. The one that's dotted is more typically used by fire agencies. It's the one that's taught in our advanced fire training. And you can see that there is this diurnal pattern of recovery where a higher value indicates less moisture or more hazardous conditions. So, during the noon period, it goes up and then through. Period, it goes up, and then through the overnight period early morning, it goes down. And that's that recovery process I was describing. The other method, which is labeled hourly FFMC in this diagram, and it's the solid line, this method actually uses hourly information, but it doesn't follow the same kind of diurnal pattern. And so the first, it's kind of more flatline. There's just subtle changes through the 24 hours. There's just subtle changes through the 24-hour period. So, the first part of my career, I only used the dotted line, the Lawson method. And on top of that, parametrized models to slow them down. So it literally said no growth between 10 and 10. The later half of my career, I've been doing everything I can to speed them up because they're not fast enough. And so more commonly now, we use that solid red line. That solid red line. Now, these both of these were developed 30, 40, like these are old methods. It's not like they were developed around climate change signals, but that one method is now working better. And it's just, it validates that we are seeing these increased temperatures, lower RHs through night. And so in BC last year, overnight and downslope burning was a commonly observed. Was a commonly observed fire behavior. One of the quotes I heard when I started was: We were getting two burn periods per day. So like I say, previously it was around 12 hours you get of active spread. When you remove that overnight recovery and the fire is burning for 24 hours straight, fire behavior specialists that were accustomed to kind of predicting how. We were accustomed to kind of predicting how much growth you'd get over 12 hours, were blown away by the fact that it was now double that because the fire didn't stop. It just grew right through the night. I want you to keep this in mind as I engage you in some discussion in a moment here. But two more before we go there. More fires than resources. This is a snapshot from a day last year. You're seeing MODIS hop. You're seeing MODIS hotspot detections. All the little labels are new fire numbers. And this is not the whole province. This is mostly just the southern portion of BC. There's a lot of fires there, a lot. And so in terms of models, there's a real need for intelligence, business intelligence, for operational decision making and triaging these large fires. Like I said, Fires. Like I said, there were 67 fires of note burning simultaneously through last season. We're relying on people to run models and collect the data they need to run these models manually. They're extracting things off websites. They're clipping things in GIS manually. They're assembling their model parameters and running the tools manually. And then they're building maps and providing the outputs back to the organization manually. The organization manually and usually by email. It has got to be the oldest, almost outdated approach for providing business intelligence for this day and age. So there's a real need, you know, aside from the science and the actual mechanics of how these models operate, for just speeding up how quickly we can generate model outputs so that they're available as these real-time decision-making processes are unfolding. Processes are unfolding. Because, in my experience, if you can't provide the model output when the decision's being made, the decision gets made without the model. And that's the way it's always been. The challenge around that is levels of expertise are changing in fire management organizations, and we're entering new territory where the rates have spread. The rates of spread and the fire behavior we're seeing hasn't been observed before, hasn't been experienced. And so we're relying on staff to make these quick, real-time decisions on what to do and how to triage this map. And so we need to speed up our systems to provide those models quicker. I think I shared a story with someone yesterday when I worked on the not the horse river farm. Not the Horse River fire, the Richardson fire in Fort McMurray in 2011. I prepared a model and then I got exported to Slave Lake. My former supervisor finished the model and gave the forecast to the incident management team and said, the fire is going to run 80 kilometers. It'll be 80 kilometers north by tomorrow. And some very experienced staff on that fire with 25, 30 years of experience said that's not. 30 years of experience said, that's not possible. Change the fuel types. And my former supervisor said, I can't do that. Like, unless you've flown that 80 kilometers and you can tell me what to change it to and why this isn't reflecting reality, let's wait and see what happens tomorrow. And so that's what they did. And the next day, the fire had spread 72 kilometers. But it was just a real eye-opener for me that people with, you know, people that I was looking to as mentors. People that I was looking to as mentors have never experienced this stuff before, and so the models were detecting it. The challenge, though, is we're not getting this information out at scale and quickly enough so that it can be incorporated into decision making. One last one about models, national fire activity. If you're not aware, fire organizations collaborate and have agreements across Canada and internationally, you probably hear on the news. You probably hear on the news when you see firefighters coming in from all different jurisdictions, we like to highlight that. So, the challenge with that model is no one fire agency really has enough resources to address fire seasons like we saw last year. There's a real dependence on resource sharing, both nationally and internationally. But when the whole country lights up, which is Which is our biggest fear with respect to climate change is that we get multiple jurisdictions having large fire seasons simultaneously. No one's letting go resources. There is no resource sharing. And so you're left with what you've got. And so historically, we would have been better off. You know, we would have been able to bring in resources and have maybe more than we need, but to really address, now we're having to address even larger fire seasons. Even larger fire seasons, but with less because we don't have the resource sharing ability like we did historically when half the province was blue, so to speak, or low hazard, and maybe one or two agencies were busy. So around this problem is the need to be able to anticipate fire occurrence, initial attack success, and growth of sustained action fires over the next two weeks to inform. To inform decisions around do we bring in resources now or not? And because it takes time to mobilize people, it takes time to bring people from Australia to Canada. It takes time even from Ontario. Often you're waiting for a crew to time out. And then once they've timed out, then they fly here, then they have to get mobilized and have their orientation to the incident they're working on. It could be. Incident they're working on, it could be two weeks from the time you order to the time you get them. So, being able to kind of look forward in time by two weeks and anticipate what's coming so that you can make those resource sharing and resource ordering decisions sooner and with confidence is kind of another modeling opportunity. That's I've been asked to try to do this a lot, and we could definitely do better. We could definitely do better. So, I want to shift focus. I want to do a little bit of interactive discussion. So, I'm going to scope out how this is going to work. And for those online, we'll do something slightly different. So, just stay tuned. I'll describe what this looks like for you. I'm going to share four pictures with you in a moment, and I'm going to say a couple words about each picture. Say a couple words about each picture, just note a couple things in each picture, and then I'm going to ask that you have some discussions after reflecting on those pictures. The context for this is, you know, with respect to models, management interventions, and wildfires in a changing climate, what opportunities do you see for making progress on financial risk? Financial risk. I'll bring this slide back up just so you have this question frame for you once I break you out into your discussions. But I want to say a couple more words about the format for this. So I'm going to show you four pictures. As I show you those four pictures, I'm going to give you 30 to 45 seconds just to write down words that come to mind with respect to this question. With respect to this question. And maybe they're not opportunities, maybe they're challenges, but just, you know, what comes to mind as you're viewing these images and thinking about this opportunity statement or the inverse of the challenges? You're going to do that for each of the four images. So we'll take about three minutes to go through these four images. And at the end of that, you should have a couple notes, a couple words that have come. A couple words that have come to mind. Then I'm going to ask you to pair up with the person beside you. If it doesn't work out perfectly even, you can be in groups of three, that's fine. But I'll give you about two minutes to compare notes with your partner. What stuck out to you? What were you thinking? This is what I was thinking. Make sure that you just really go through your list quickly and then have a bit of a quick discussion. Two minutes goes fast. Discussion. Two minutes goes fast. Really do focus on providing each person the opportunity to just share what's on their list and then use the rest of the time to discuss. Once you've done the paired conversation, I'll then ask those groups to maybe turn around and find a pair beside them or behind them. And you're going to have four minutes to discuss it in a group of four. And what I want from that group of four is that you start to find commonalities or Find commonalities or things that are really resonating with the group. And once that four minutes is finished, we'll come back and we'll go group to group. And I'm just going to go like, what's one item from this group? What's one item from that group? And we'll go around a couple of times until we exhaust the ideas. But this is where I'm really looking for input from you. The challenges to modeling that I just articulated. Challenges to modeling that I just articulated, these are not, in my opinion, complex challenges. These are physical modeling challenges that can be overcome. There's newer technologies, there's newer sensor networks, but I think the pictures I'm going to show you might really frame some bigger thinking. So I'm looking for bigger thinking here. Now, before we go to the first image, there are a number of folks online. So I want So, I want to check that there are. I see one, two, three, four, five. So, for the groups online, you will also do the silent reflection. When we break out, rather than you doing pairs online, we're just going to put you straight into the group discussion. And I recognize it could be a little bit more cumbersome online to To have that interpersonal experience. So, you might have to have one person facilitate online and take notes and just make sure that everyone has an opportunity to speak. So, for the folks online, you will have six minutes to just chat and come up with the ideas that are resonating. You will have the silent reflection, but you will skip the two minutes of paired discussion. You'll just go straight into group discussion. Go straight into group discussion, and I just ask that one person online step forward to maybe take a couple notes on behalf of the group and manage the time. So yeah, there's about five or six people, so that's about a minute per person. Okay, so let's look at these pictures. We'll just start with our silent reflections, and then I'll have you help me once we're done with the online meeting. Okay. Meeting. Okay. Image number one. Can we dim the lights? Thank you. What am I noticing in this picture? It's nighttime. What you're seeing is a smoke column. It's not a cloud. The light is the flames from the fire lighting up the column. And you Um, and you can't make it out in this picture, but this picture is taken from probably someone's backyard. There's some homes in the lower right-hand corner, and um, and they have a pretty interesting view that evening. So, I'm going to give you 30 to 45 seconds, jot some ideas down in terms of what comes to mind.  Okay, I'll go to the next one. What are we seeing in the What are we seeing in this picture? This is after a forest fire has gone through. What do I want you to notice here? What's left for vegetation after this fire has gone through? What happened to the trees? On the lower On the lower right, you see some stumps. This was a cut block, and this was a forest. And if you're not sure what happened to the trees, they're bent over from the indrafts of the forest fire and they're frozen. And they're frozen in time from the heat. So the fire did that. So I'll give you 40 seconds on that one.  Okay, two more to go. This is a landscape photo. What are we seeing here? There's a lot of black. There's way more black than green, but there are some unburnt islands. Unburnt islands. The middle unburnt island and the little one on the lower left happen to be replanted cut blocks. So, think about that one. The green islands that you can see in the photo. Yeah, replant. In the photo, yeah, replanted, cut black, harvested areas that were replanted, re-vegetated. Yeah, you're probably right. Yeah, so the comment was some of the surrounding area to the green that survived looks like it was replanted because you can kind of see a bit of a grid pattern, and you're probably ripe. Yeah. So go ahead, think about that one for a couple of seconds. Go ahead and think about that one for a couple seconds. Okay, let's do a little fun. Let's do the last one. Another nighttime photo: a silhouette of a firefighter working through the night. What comes to mind for this one?  Okay, that's all four pictures. So I will invite you to find a partner. If, like I say, if it doesn't work out and you need to be in a group of three, no problem. You need to be in a group of three, no problem. Before you go, uh, you only have two minutes for this, two minutes goes quick. So, once again, you're going to share your ideas with your partner or your group of three. Make sure everyone has an opportunity to share. And then maybe in the last minute, have a bit of a discussion about what you're noticing. I'm going to put the question that I framed back up on the screen in a moment. We're just going to set up a meeting room for the online participants. A meeting room for the online participants. So go ahead, find your partner. Just check that out. Perfect. These are all the people that should be in there, yeah? Can you scroll force slides up on the presentation? Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I didn't have patients. So I had to do everything. I'll uh grab your attention just for a moment. I'll grab your attention just for a moment. So, we're going to transition to the four minutes with the group beside you. So, if you want to just turn and find a group beside you, I'll give you four minutes for a larger group discussion. For the online participants, you can just keep continuing on and look. They didn't? They came here. Okay, I'll. They didn't? They came here. Okay, I'll just take that. Yeah, all right. Okay, yeah, I'm wondering if there's a base on the chat here and saying You can start coming around and physically moving the groups. So at the end of the four minutes here, I'll be looking for the ideas that are really resonating with the group, what's floating to the top for your discussion. So if there's someone that's willing to take some notes or just make a star in their notebook in terms of what you'd like to share back with the larger group when we finish. So four minutes. Group when we finish. So, four minutes and we're done. Okay. Say the idea, um sick uh we talked to a family sense, you know, Australian loss is lost and actually how bad virus rate.  I don't know if you want to write down the ideas people have. This probably was going to be PowerPoint. I guess that people can see the screen might be a little bit harder to turn right off. You're gonna want to edit the slide? I'll just say slide. Okay. And it's not meeting on what you're doing. What is what is the password for painting this? Because that's what we try to know if we're going to call it on the first one in the fast yard, but etc. Or even five super steel there is hard to also just. Also just hours points where it's free or all kind of good thing. So then the tax survival during the boss remember can be firefighting. Manage the tour to get in our way. It affects the file spreads, but that's not just a remote file for either doing a lot of customers. And then the last one I'm just going to work with where the last thing is if you actually think that reaches from my perspective, you couldn't find one of the two I asked the additional on fifty plus. So, one minute left, and I'll bring you back to the larger group. Yeah, well, I don't think it's hard, but we're going to find out cold out of the hard one.  Wow, I never knew it. I just channeled to do that by this one here. One here, and then if you delete that picture, and then just drag the text over to the screen. Okay, I'm going to bring you back now. I'll invite you to wrap up your last comment. Okay, so the most important question is: if you named your team, so in this corner we have no no name. No, no name. We'll go at nice try. Well, let's try over here. Over here, we have team team Johnny. Okay, team Johnny. We can't go with team Johnny in the back. What's your name? What was your team's name? Okay, president's choice. I want to take one more stab at it. Team broad. Okay, and then we've got team online. And then we've got team online. So, what we'll do is we'll just circle around the teams and we'll look for one idea. As we circle around, we may find that another team shared that same idea. We don't need to repeat it, but you might note that like, hey, we had that idea as well. Here's another idea we'd like to contribute. And we'll just go a couple times around until we start to exhaust some of the top ideas that really resonated with your discussions. I think I would like to start with the. I think I would like to start with the online participants. And so my trusty technical assistant here will help me with that. So with the online participants, if there was someone that was going to speak on behalf of your group, you can share your screen or share your camera or turn your mic off. And we'd like to hear from you. What was one of the ideas that you had with your Ideas that you had with your group discussion. And if someone's speaking, we can't hear you. H Joe is unmuted. Okay, we see that HJ unmuted. Harry? We didn't elect a spokesperson. Okay, we've got you loud and clear. You just became the spokesperson. You just became the spokesperson, so go ahead. Lucky me. Well, we were talking. Do you want us to focus on one of the pictures or go over each of them? You can just something that really resonated in your group discussion that you'd like to highlight and share back with this team. So it could be related to one picture. It could be related to all of them. What do you have? So I guess we were most recently talking about the bent trees and not totally understanding. Understanding the context of that, but whether that may have happened if there wasn't the cut zone there, or was that something that's kind of the cut zone allowed to happen? Sure. So maybe there's a question around the interaction of different disturbance patterns and management interventions and forestry on fire behavior. Is that a fair summary? That's a great summary. Okay, and what was your name? Johanna. And what was your name? Johanna. Thank you, Johanna. We'll come back to your group momentarily. Who's next? Team Johnny. Yeah, that would be great. One thing that resonated with our group, and I'm sort of synthesizing our three groups that combined, was we were thinking about loss management. And one thing is, you know, what is the One thing is, you know, what is the losses in each picture that we were seeing? You know, so we were, so we thought, what assets were at risk? Who is at risk? And so in one picture, we see the first picture, we see property value of the homes so close to the fire and the people who are living there. So there's people and assets. In the second one, we saw timber value. So if you're doing cut blocks and you're harvesting that area, do we lose from the forest at From the forest that burned through that area, from the bent trees that could have been harvested. And then also the firefighters who wouldn't be able to fight that fire because the winds were so powerful and sucking those trees and bending them and breaking them, then you're seeing those lives. You couldn't even put those lives at risk in that situation. So you can't even fight that type of fire. In the third one, there's okay, that's enough. Sorry. It was all in the same. Sorry, it was all on the same idea. Don't worry, I'll come back to you. How on that? Do you need anything repeated? I think I got it. You think you got it? Okay, great. Thank you. Anything I missed, Team Johnny? I'm not looking over my shoulder. So if you'd like to make some revisions to what we're capturing, just let us know. President's choice. Thank you. So I'm going to get us started. So, I'm going to get us started. We had two pairs of two, and the one pair was John Braun and Tara from the city of Kelowna, who's the urban forester. She decided to step out for a call. And they're kind of experts in forest. One a massive expert and one a pretty big expert. And then the other pair was me and Tony, who are not experts at all in forest. So one of the things we saw was that Tony and I could see it was complex, and there's lots of intersection. Could see it was complex, and there was lots of interesting science going on, and lots of interesting phenomena going on, but we didn't quite understand what was going on. Um, and the other two seemed to understand an awful lot of what was going on, and so only got to like halfway through photo one in their in their wrap up. Uh, so you know, apart from the complexity and the difficulty in management, which I think is clear, the idea of the impact of the cut blocks came up, um, something else that. Something else that really came up for us is how hard it was for me at least to see the connection between this and financial risk. There were definitely connections there in loss in insurance payouts, loss of homes, loss of timber, possibly much enhanced greenhouse gas emissions, if that's something that's getting traded. Something that's getting traded. But to see how to manage whether that would be a management decision as opposed to the direct physical emergency at place, that's harder to see. Anything else to add? Oh, uh, yes. The only thing that the my own experience was a little bit like what Matt described at first. That first shot, I was at a complete loss until I actually talked with Tara a little bit. And then it suddenly occurred to me that, in fact, that first one highlights what, in fact, actually precipitated this workshop and the whole This workshop in the whole in the first place. What suddenly occurred to me was: those houses shouldn't have been there. That should be a fire risk zone, and we need to establish guidelines for actually identifying where people should be building and where they shouldn't be building. They probably shouldn't have been building there. Interesting. Yeah, so a similar theme to that last point that we were talking about is whether you can create either new kind of insurance policies or taxes for these high-risk areas that the payments from those could. That you know, the payments from those could go into a fund to pay for either new mitigation techniques or for recovery, like you were talking about before. And I think one of the other themes, it's a bit less about finance, but we are talking about whether there are like ecological management techniques or if you can take advantage of different foresting patterns that might be effective in preventing sort of the most extreme forest fires that you were describing. I think those were two of the main points. Is there anything else you want to add? And when I think about those kind of management strategies and actually conducting that work, it might not impact financial institutions. But like I said before, if we're looking at public service to carry this out, it's a lot of money. A lot of money. We'll talk about that on our field trip on Thursday. On our field trip on Thursday. Let's go back online. We'll do one more loop around and then I'll do a check-in if there's anything that we've kind of missed. That's a big one for you. So maybe have a look at your lists and what's another big one you'd like to share. So we'll go back to Joanna online. Over to you. Actually, I see that Whitney posted in the chat. So maybe he wants to take the next one. Okay, yeah. Go ahead, Whitney. Oh, so not single spatial. Nothing special. So, when I look at the picture one, because I'm a statistician, so I think about like different ways to get the data. I heard a term like a citizen science database. So, that's the thing it came always. I did not think about like a deeper implication that people should not live there. I didn't catch the last part. You were talking about a Catch the last part. You were talking about a citizen science database to maybe inform modeling, or what was that? No, no, no. So, so I was the thing I think about, but I did not realize another thing about like a high-risk zone, which point out by the other group. So, are you what you're pointing out is collecting more data around these high-risk areas? Good question. So it's good to have more data, but it's probably danger to have someone there to collect the data. So I don't know. Okay. Is there anything else from the online group you'd like to add to that? Joanna or others? Okay. Okay. We'll move to. We also touched briefly on health risks. In the last photo, looking at the firefighter, didn't look like he had like a mask on. So just smoke inhalation risks and other health risks from the firefighting. Great. Thank you. Okay, we'll go to Team Johnny. Anyone else want to just one? Just make sure anyone else wants just one idea. So, one of the other ideas, one of the other ideas that we were thinking of was the recovery of the forest after a forest fire. And we could see that there's definitely some fuel management in the third photo, the types of trees that are being planted, and it did seem maybe to affect how the fire was spreading over the region. But then, if a fire burns through a managed area, what's the recovery of the forest? Area, what's the recovery of the forest like after that? Is it set up for that? So there's the risk to the ecology of the forest. Yeah. Yeah, that's a great point. And I think, you know, again, this is not a financial institution, but if we think economy, there are companies that are depending on long planning horizons. And they do incorporate certain levels of disturbance, but certainly not the levels of disturbance. Certainly, not the levels of disturbance we're seeing recently. And these large areas that are burned at such intensity may not come back online within their planning horizon, which means their allowable cut is reduced and they may also be losing investment in terms of replanted cut blocks or investments out in the forest. So, although that may not impact a financial institution directly, it's going to affect the economy, it's going to affect local jobs. To affect local jobs where people choose to live because there are or there are not jobs there anymore. So there are some indirect ties to what you observe. So yeah, thank you. President's choice, I'll wait for you down here so we don't squeal. The other thing we talked about was in picture two with the bent over trees. Also saw the Also, saw the remaining sort of soil under the trees. It looked very much just like sand. Now, that might just be normal in that part of the world. I don't know. But we wondered if that was going to be really prone to erosion and maybe what the lost value of the ecosystem services that that block of forest had been providing might be. Yeah, great observation. Yeah, great observation. On my drive here, I drove through the White Rock Lake fire, and it was raining, and there was an incredible amount of soil on the road, and it had been plowed like snow to the side of the road. And you can see the channels coming down through that fire in the steep terrain. There is definitely erosion. And what you see there is there's probably a good level of soil pyrolysis. So it's not just the erosion, it's the loss of the seed bank. And you lose soil and you lose your seed bank. That's the potential of that site for what it's going to do in the future. And so I start thinking ecologically, what happens when you burn off soils that take thousands of years to develop and you lose your native seed bank? And we're starting to see in some of these intense burned areas, invasive species moving in and new novel communities, ecological. Communities, ecological communities, from a predictive services perspective, like what's that going to be like for the future? How does that start changing landscape dynamics? So a whole bunch of stuff there for sure. Last group, team broad. So the other thing that came up in our conversation was some of the softer side and human impact. Uh, softer side and human impact of those. Like for me personally, just seeing that first picture, trying to imagine if you were a six or eight-year-old kid and you looked out your window and you saw that, that would be traumatic. And there's long-term impacts to that. Plus then, does your family decide to move or relocate or do you have to relocate? Because it's now a high-risk zone. And there's carry-on impacts to that. And similar to the worker at the end, just looking exhausted, and is he safe? And has he got longer term? Is he safe and has he got longer-term health impacts because of the job that he's been doing? And so sometimes those softer sides get lost in the risk assessment when it's just all about property values or timber values and you forget about the human impacts. Yeah, just a quick side note on the overnight firefighting. I showed you the issue with diurnal predictions and Predictions and fire behavior training is still benchmarked on what we call a peak burning period, 1700 hours in the day. That's when we do, that's when we expect to see the most extreme fire behavior. That's what our projection represents. And that's what we talk to crews about and operational staff. And what we're actually observing now is more extreme fire through the night. Is more extreme fire through the nighttime period sometimes than peak burning period in the day? Who's doing a projection for the midnight hours? Are there any predictive services people or fire behavior specialists working through the night when the firefighters are working through the night providing advisories and warnings? They're not. So, yeah, there's definitely some safety implications, but human health impacts as well. But human health impacts as well. I could take that same picture and talk about when do evacuations often get triggered and occur. And you probably heard a lot of stories of people being evacuated at 10, 11 at night. And not only are you driving through smoke, but you're doing it in the dark. And so scary time to evacuate families and public. So at this point, I want to wrap this up. So I'm just going to open it up. Is there any really pertinent point from any of the teams that you? From any of the teams that you haven't shared yet, that you want to. I'll just check in with the online group. Is there anything else you wanted to share? I think the only other thing we talked about was with respect to the third picture. Like the area that's green looks somewhat natural. But you mentioned that it's replanted trees. So it's a little unclear what is the properties of that replanted. Properties of that replanted area that's allowing it to survive that fire? Is it something natural about the topography, or is it just the fact that it's been replanted? Is it the actual techniques of reforestation that are making it more resilient, or is it something about the soil moisture or something other physical properties? Yeah. Yeah, no, great question. I think it could be any and all of the above. Of the above, and I could probably show you the same picture for natural islands of green that are left untouched by fire. So it could be completely unrelated to a management intervention or a harvesting disturbance. It could be something about the biophysical properties of the site. So, Team Johnny, any last comments? This is more inspired by the conversation than. Inspired by the conversation than actual from the photos, but thinking of those houses in the first picture, the value of those houses is going to be linked to decisions such as do we put in place stricter policies? So if you own that house in the interface zone, which was a valuable house because everybody wanted to live in the interface zone, and now there's a policy that says, no, you're not allowed to build there. out to build there, your asset's going to go down in value. And people don't want that. Small anecdote, I know we're in coffee break. The prices of homes in Fort McMurray, and they might be going up again now, but from about 20 years ago to a few years ago, they dropped. So people who sold homes in other parts of Canada to move to Fort McMurray because they were going to get rich and bought a house, and then 15, 20 years later, And then 15-20 years later, they're selling that house, it's worth less than what they paid for it, and homes in other parts of Canada have gone up. So, these kinds of things, like people's connection to their value of their main asset for many of them, is something that is going to drive people's decisions, like the resistance to adopting policies that make sense, like moving out of interbase zones and et cetera, is going to be connected to what people see they are. What people see they are losing, and they're going to be fighting to protect the value of things like their homes and resisting policies that might impact that, even if those policies make sense. So, I think we do have to think about this in a bigger context and rather than assuming that some aspects of the system are fixed, because that skews the decisions that we think are feasible. Yeah, no, interesting comment, and there's a tension between Paul. Comment, and there's a tension between policies going forward and then what's already developed. And I read a story about one of the communities that flooded this past fall in BC, and part of the community is being permanently relocated. And that area will no longer be homes. It'll be turned back to vegetation to be part of a floodplain. And so there's an adaptation piece as well: you know, for the interface. For the interface areas that exist now, when events like this happen, do we rebuild to what we had before or do we adapt and change? And I think you made that comment yesterday about engineering and engineering in a way that in 10 or 20 years you can adapt if required, because we don't know how we need to adapt today, but build in kind of some kind of approach where we recognize. Approach where we recognize we're going to have to adapt and we'll be prepared to do that when the time comes. But I was encouraged to see that they're actually saying, we can't have homes here. We're going to move the homes. Very traumatic for the people that have lived there all their lives, but I think a good decision on behalf of that community or municipality. President's choice. Last call. Last call. Yeah. So just a quick comment about the replanting pattern. The replanting patterns, right? Because there's a financial interest in making nice regular straight lines, you know, exactly the same species because it's going to be easier to harvest. But on the other hand, that's going to create channels. It's going to increase the potential damage from fire risk. And also, thinning patterns. Again, you might think, well, just thinning very regularly might be good, but Tara made the point that actually kind of thinning in irregular ways where you have been. Thing in irregular ways where you have big gaps and then clumping and other kinds of things. But those have financial implications, it seems to me. If it's an area that you're looking to harvest in the future, you've got to balance those things. Thank you. And team broad, any last comments? Just to ask something. Sure. I mean, I think it's really good we've talked about economic loss and recovery, landscape level resilience. Landscape level resilience, but I agree with you, Neil. I think adaptation is critical here, right? We know that climate change is causing a lot of challenges. Ecotones are shifting. So the great question for me is how do we look after fire and flood and adapt to that in the long term in the big picture? Canada is really diverse ecologically, and BC is more so than any other province. We've got more diverse ecology here than anywhere. So how do we look at that and economically adapt so that we don't expect? Economically adapt so that we don't expect trees to grow back where they were but burnt. How do we look at that, plan ahead, and do modeling and predictions that will allow us to be prepared to have a good economy going forward? Adaptation for me is the big one. It's struck me listening to this and looking at your pictures that part of the risk management business is going to have to be the fire service thinking through its mission. Mission. You know, it seemed to me that an assumption that predicated the discussion was that every fire would be suppressed. And of course, that's not feasible. Doing that alters forest structure, even if there's no other management action that takes place that probably ultimately increases fire risk as opposed to decreasing it. Wonderful comment to wrap this up. So, thank you, everyone. I'll say a couple words about that, and thanks to the online group. Sorry, I forgot your name. Liam. Liam. And thank you to Liam for taking notes and helping me with the online breakout room. So I have two slides and we'll break to your comment, Francis. Um, uh, what was I going to say to that? Um, we talked about adaptation of communities and maybe uh financial institutions, but I think the same applies to the wildfire services and the fire agencies. And I think I might be able to give you a snapshot of what that could look like. I'm going to present a couple things from our strategic roadmap for research and innovation, but certainly. But certainly suppressing fires for essentially 100 years, it's made an impact on the forest. And I think we need to adapt as an organization in terms of what does fire suppression look like into the future and what is the mission? What are we trying to achieve? What I really want to emphasize in that, though, is I can't really speak on behalf of BC Welfare Service, but I know when I was. Of BC Wildfire Service, but I know when I was in Alberta, we were an emergency response organization. We were not a land manager. And so, for fire agencies to make that kind of shift and that adaptation where we start to allow fire in some respects and not in others, we really need collaborative input and engagement from all of the land managers and all of the ties to financial institutions. To financial institutions and economy, society, societal expectations. I think you made the comment about, like, you know, policy and sometimes, you know, people wanting to protect their assets, they're going to resist that policy shift. You know, if I went out into the public at large right now and said, you know, raise your hand if you think BC wildfire should start letting more fires burn, I wonder what kind of response we would get. But that's what's really required. But that's what's really required. And so, my message is: I agree. I think fire organizations need to adapt, but we can't do it alone. We can't do it alone. And so, I think I'm really excited about this workshop because we're starting to get new areas of expertise in the conversation. And I think, you know, with respect to financial organizations, areas that actually have some, I'll say, clout, some pull in some of this stuff. Stuff. So I'll take over and we'll finish out. So are we sharing? Yep. Thank you. Okay. So just a quick overview. We're about to release a research and innovation roadmap for the next three years. Mike McCauley's team has done an awesome job essentially reaching out to the entire organization and abroad and identifying some key themes which are. Identifying some key themes which are on this slide, and then subsequent research questions and objectives that would fall under each of these. I'm not going to go through the detailed roadmap. It will soon be public and you can do that at your leisure. But essentially, our four themes are around enhancing health, wellness, and safety of the BC Welfare Service. I heard a lot of comments about that from you. Two is contributing to the national understanding of wildlife. Contributing to the national understanding of wildland fire science. There's a lot in that one. I'll speak about it in a moment. Three is advanced social and human behavioral research. And four is exploit emerging tools and technology to enhance the effectiveness of our actions in the wildfire environment. And so a really simple example of that, which I just articulated earlier around the diurnal moisture recovery. You know, we're in 2022. You know, we're in 2022, and there are sensors that measure this, and we have automatic stations that are recording weather observations instantaneously and then uploading them into a database every hour. Why are we still estimating this? Why don't we just plug a moisture probe into the soil with the weather station and be and know what it is? You know, so there's, and Mike mentioned yesterday, there's some neat stuff with 5G. Yesterday, there's some neat stuff with 5G and 6G technology that might allow us to do that. So, that's a quick overview. Here are kind of a combination of objectives and questions, kind of three that relate to this workshop. Reduce smoke inhalation and particulate exposure and shift to total worker health. Along with the public health impacts, there's some real important mental impacts, both to the public, but fire. Both to the public but firefighters as well. So, when it comes to recruitment and retention, when I started in fire, I didn't see all this kind of stuff on the news. It was kind of like this interesting profession, really good for like introverted extroverts. You get to work in the forest, but be on cool teams and fly in helicopters. And now it's like the pressures are pretty intense. There's social. Pretty intense. There's social media that didn't exist when I was introduced into the fire profession. And so you are always being judged. And if you're following social media, it can be hard to come back from a 14-day deployment working 16 hours a day and then read about everything you've just done wrong and how you're causing the world to end. So really looking at both physical health, but also mental health. Health, but also mental health. Increase understanding of wildfire economics and evaluate return on investment or risk mitigation strategies. I mentioned earlier that we can do interventions, we can change forest structure. We'll see some of that on Thursday on our field trip. It costs a lot of money and it takes a lot of time. If we're going to make bigger investments in that to align with some of the recommendations from the report I mentioned earlier. From the report I mentioned earlier, we want to know that it's going to actually be effective. Finally, and many of you made this comment or this connection is design landscapes that enable the replacement of undesirable fire with maybe what we'll call good fire, prescribed fire, cultural burning, fire that promotes more of those green islands. So, that picture with all the black and the small green islands, how do we invest? Small green islands, how do we invert that picture? How do we allow for more green and maybe a diversity of green, different age classes, and less of that intense black and that, you know, the picture with the bent over trees and the soil consumption? How do we flip that around a bit through landscape design and understanding landscape dynamics? So, those are three of many focuses in our strategic roadmap. Strategic roadmap that do relate to our discussion. So, with that, I know we're into coffee break. Thank you again. You gave me permission, right, John? You said it's yeah, but I took direction. So, thank you for your participation and the opportunity to speak. And I look forward again to. And I look forward again to continuing these conversations through coffee breaks and lunch and whatnot, but it's been a pleasure. I'll finish by saying I need all of your support. So what I've found in work in coming to these kind of workshops is that many of you have followed me through my career and I really appreciate that. And going forward, these are big challenges. The word that jumped out at me was. The word that jumped out at me was complexity. I don't have the answers. And just a really quick story. I shared it with some of you. We had a researcher from CBC that saw a blog about grass problem because of a wet year. And they wanted to do an interview with us. What is BC Wildfire doing about the grass problem, right? And it's like, is it our problem? Whose problem is it? And so my point is, these problems. My point is, these problems are actually complex. They're everybody's problems. And so, in my new role in BC Welfare Service, I really do look to communities like this to support me and the work that I do on behalf of the public service. So, thank you, and I'll leave it there.
