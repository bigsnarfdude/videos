So, yeah, it's my pleasure to introduce the first speaker of today, Sam Van Vaud. We'll talk about frames and profile extractions. Thank you, Johan and the other organizers, for inviting me here and giving me some time to talk about some my favorite parts of mathematics. So, this talk will be, there will be little formalized yet. It will be of the Formalized, yeah. It will be of the kind: like this may be an interesting project, and this may be an interesting project. And you tell me what you think. And also, I like to say this, I always find it a bit weird to say, but I feel like you need to say it. I really want you to understand what I'm saying. It's like a thing in mathematics, but yeah, anyway. So I really want you to understand. So it's a slightly non-standard part of math. So, you know. Part of math, so you know, I'll go gentle. If it's too boring, you can continue formalizing if it's like too hard, and then you have to interrupt me. Okay, to me, this is like standard stuff. Okay, so what I'm going to talk about, oh, and what does it have to do with cohomology? There will be a point where I will say the word cohomology. So, what this is about is a slightly different way of Way of doing algebra with topological spaces. So that way is called frames, and I will define for you what they are. Then that's a very general and old theory. And then I will talk about the connection between frames and pro finite. And then I will, in the latter part of my talk, come to kind of things closer to my own research, which are probably at the moment. Which are probably at the moment a bit far to be able to formalize. Okay, but maybe not. So, how do you associate an algebraic structure to a space? Well, you can do groups and stuff, but you can also do this. A much simpler thing, in a sense, is to say that a point of a space determines a collection of open neighborhoods, and that's a kind of And that's a kind of dual. So, point, the function that I've called epsilon here maps points of x to the double dual of x. But, okay, in what sense? What is the dual of a space? So the dual of a space is a frame. So a frame is defined simply as a complete lattice. So here I'm always So here I'm overloading a bit because all the all the structure is determined just by giving a partial order with some properties. Okay? But I want in the signature also as algebraic data. I want the sups of any subset and I want the infs of any finite subset, including the empty one which we traditionally denote by one. Okay, and then there's one axiom which is Axiom which is that finite infs commute with soups. That's okay for the definition. This is in method. I think I helped it back. Or maybe someone else already. So then once you do that, okay, once you make this definition, you can say, okay, so I can do topology now without points. Okay, some some people disparagingly call it pointless topology. Yeah. Pointless topology. Yeah, so an element, for example, okay, I will use this later. An element is what is a contact set in this world? Well, you write down the definition of compact and you make all the symbols a bit more angry. That's the definition. So, okay, there's something. So, why did I say dual? You would expect things to turn around, and that's of course the case. So, we'll continue. Of course, the case. So, a continuous map now becomes a homomorphism in the other direction. Continuous map is something with the property that an inverse image of an open set is open. So, okay. And in general, okay, a homomorphism is something that preserves the structure. And if it preserves the structure, it also preserves the order. Okay? Good so far? Yeah. Okay, so examples. Well, the one that we started from. The one that we started from, but also the radical ideals of any green. Okay, so there you see the soup is a little weird. I mean, the soup is what you would expect, but okay, it's like not immediately the opens of the space. It, of course, is the opens of the space. I'll come to that in a moment. And okay, here I promised I would tell you, so it also appears in local cohomology. See, for example, so we've been, I, I, I think, yeah, so we've been working, we haven't yet exploited the frame structure, but I think implicitly it's kind of in the background of what we're doing. The right assumption, what is that? Of ideals? Yeah. Yeah, but they might not be, yeah, so you take some ideals. It's just the sum. I think it's a sum of ideals. Not a direction, just a sum of the same. Oh, some of ideas. Yeah, some of ideas. And And also for a slightly more asynchronic example, if you take any compact house during space, okay, you can take its open sets, but another interesting structure is the regular open set. That's also a frame. And then every time you take a union, of course, it doesn't have to stay regular, so you have to regularize. Is a regular or inside? One where the interior of the culture. Where the interior of the culture is sitting, so there's no holes. Okay? Does that make sense? Yeah, so if you take two open intervals that touch, now you take their union, then you have to make it regular. Take the interior of the closure, that means you add the point in the middle. So that shows that kind of this example is also there to show that the suprema. Show that, like, the suprema do some kind of slightly non-trivial things sometimes. Okay, so then now I've told you what is the dual of the space, now I have to go back, right? So how do I recover the space? Well, can I always recover the space? So here's a slightly strange definition. So a homomorphism to the two-element frame is called a point. Okay, and that is Okay, and that makes some sense, right? So this is, oh, I should have said, this is of course a completely degenerate version of sites and topoid. So if you know that stuff, then this is like the version where there are no arrows, there are just orderizations. So then it's called a point, okay, because think L is the collection of open sets. If I say Sets. If I say yes or no to every open set in a consistent way, in a way that preserves the frame structure, then I've essentially determined the point of my original space. And so, okay, some people then call this, some people like to reverse the arrows and not look at the category of frames, but the category of frames up, and then suddenly call them locales. Okay, that's a kind of That's the kind of linguistic game that you can play. And then two becomes one. So, okay, so I've told you how to get the points. Now you also make a topology. So, right, so in general, when you have a frame, you can do this. You can say, I have the points of the frame, and I can make the topology in kind of the way you would expect. An open set determines those points that it says. That it says that say one to it. Okay, that was not a good. Okay, but here's the definition. Yeah, so for each open set, you take those points that give the answer one. Okay, so this is not yet in Matthew, but this should be, like, I think all the ingredients are there to state it. So you have an adjunction. So you have an adjunction between a dual adjunction between frames and topological spaces. Okay? I already described to you the co-unit epsilon and the frame unit is also easy to imagine what it is. So the point is a frame doesn't have to come from a space, right? It's slightly more general. So yeah. Then of course the question you ask is well how Course, the question you ask is: well, how well does this represent? And so the answer is pretty well. So a topological space only needs to satisfy a kind of very weak separation condition called sober, sobriety, to be fixed by this. So for example, what you're not allowed to have is a picture like this, where in your space you have, okay, you have some open sets, and this is the only Some open sets, and this is the only open set, and like there's a lot of points in it. Yeah, I mean, then you've lost them. Okay, so like it should be T0 at least. And there's like there needs to be a slightly different condition too, which I won't state, but which is in math. Oh, I have stated it. T0 and every irreducible closed set has a generic point. Okay, that's the technical definition. And then all Hausdorff spaces are solar. But there's more. But there's more, so also risky spectra here. So, but I will come to that. Yeah, what happens if you take the topological space associated with the frame of the regular ones? Yeah, so this is the next very good. So, this is the next example. So, there may not be any points in this type of properties. So, that's the kind of the point, if you want. You can do a lot of things that you would do in pathology, but in a Would do in topology, but in a slightly more general setting. And so, people who do set theoretic forcing say they like to look at frames of regular open sets, which don't really have this associated space of points, but you can still kind of treat them as if they had a space of points. So, okay, so of course, when it did come from a space, then the points are just the irreducible closed sets, okay? Points, so. Points of the radical ideal frame are the prime ideals, and the topology is the Zariski spectrum. And well, yeah, so there may not be any. Okay, so yeah, so that shows, I skipped, I didn't say that, it was on the frame on the slide. So a frame is called spatial when it's stable under that. But of course, this theory is most interesting for non-spatial. Theory is most interesting for non-spatial frames. That's where you gain something, right? And so, regular open sets, that's the place where you so now, so that's kind of a general story about frames. And I think this is already a first point where one could, at this stage in MATLAB, one could ask someone to formalize that, the junction and just the fixed points. I played with it a little bit in preparing this talk. Little bit in preparing this talk, I had the ambitious goal of just showing this new formalized. So I didn't quite succeed. I was struggling with stupid MATLAB 4 and getting used to new notations and so. But we can do that. Anyone who wants to do that can come see me and we can figure it out, I think. Flow has helped me a bit on the slide here. So okay. So um okay, so then I I want to make the link now with uh pro finite. With profinite. So, to do that, let's remember what a profinite set is. So, just to introduce some notation that will be useful for me later. So, I just write, to distinguish the set from its associated discrete space, I call it ds when it's a space. And a profinite set is anything that's a projective limit of finite sets. Projective limit of finite sets. Then, a simple fact about these is that you are a profinite set if and only if you are compact and any distinct points are separated by a clopping set. So yeah, so think something like Campus. Something like counter space, for example. Okay, so this is in MATLAB. Okay, so this proposition technically is not yet in MATLAB, but that's a matter of linking up some things that are in MATLAB, like state. State is equivalent. Okay, it's written here and the to-do in the profinite type. So that's an easy. Type. So that's an easy PR to do. More generally, I think a first milestone might be to say that even these four things are equivalent. That's slightly more ambitious, but a kind of foundational fact about pro-finite types. I don't think we have protocompletions for categories. Am I right? Yeah. Okay, so that's a thing to mention. I've seen some kind of Marcus Himmel doing end completion. So it's just a little g. Completion, so it's just it'll just be a case of going through that and changing on the add-on. Oh, there is completion. Not in mathly, but I've seen lean code. Okay. Compiling lean code, which is. Yeah, it's a defining as lean. Yeah, you could, but I thought that was a lousy. I'm not so sure. I like definition of three. Yeah, of course definition three, but then you want to know about it, right? That it has the so you take maybe definition three and then you want to know that it's the it's the unique blah blah blah. The unique blah blah blah. And that's what I mean when I write definition four. Okay, so this is what I said. One equivalent to two is essentially already done. I even found the exact files where they are. Okay, and then so I think Adam and Dad were told me that they had done one equivalent to four, more or less, right? More or less, right? The universal property of compact, totally separated spaces, which is like the technical ingredient. Then you can build definitions around it, but that's the technical thing you have to do. So you can't do for it to define for a substance. Right, but you can definitely. It's a task in itself. Yes, that's true. That's true. But then you would hope that if you define it in such a way that you can then import the word. Yeah, yeah, you absolutely hope that. Sometimes reality doesn't quite work. Sometimes reality doesn't quite. Right. Okay, so this is the last point we've we've discussed already. So then, like, the equivalence of three and four is just category. Okay, so given that first milestone, stone duality for Boolean algebras becomes clear. Okay, so this is my claim that basically the important thing is to do this, and then you can deduce a lot of things in a nice way. So, for example, Nice way. So, for example, stone duality. I mean, okay, you have, I think, yeah, actually, PR is maybe it's in method now in the meantime, the finite Boolean algebra, finite Boolean algebra is obvious the same as finite sets. And then you do a little, I would like, I don't know, like it's almost a calc block. You take the int on one side and you take the pro on the other side. You take the pro on the other side and you observe this, and you observe. I guess you also need that Boolean algebras are the incompletion of finite Boolean algebras. I don't know how far Mathet is from having that, but... We don't have int categories. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so this is like a. But this second bullet is like a somewhat interesting categorical algebra. I mean, this holds at a very like high level of generality. High level of generality. It's like a financial something. Financially accessible categories Adamic Rositsky something. Yeah. Okay, this was of course not Stone's original proof at all. But I think it's kind of nice to, I mean, people get, I've been giving talks about Stone to Anthony for a while. People get very scared as soon as you say the word ultrafilter. And here I gave you a proof that doesn't say ultrafilter. Of course, yeah, I said point, right? Well, I said point. Well, so point is not exactly the same thing as algebra, but this is actually an interesting mathematical point here I because I'm making the transition here from frame to Boolean algebra, right? And so a Boolean algebra is a thing that has finite sups and ints, but not necessarily infinite ones. And so ultra filter is the same thing as a BA hum. The A hum from your algebra to two. Okay? And while like, okay, so what that is, is the same as a frame homomorphism from the ideals of A to 2. This is the same. So it's like points of the ideals of the algebra is the same as outer field is of the algebra. Just temperature. The Goolean algebra was going to be the equivalent sets of. The Goolean algebra was going to be the equivalent size of the stone space. Yeah, so that also. So this is. Okay, so here I cannot do a magic trick. Watch. Okay, so people don't, so it's an anecdote time is that Stone proved this, and this is what is very famous. And a year earlier, he published this, and this is not very famous at all. And he published this in the transactions of the AMS. This in the transactions of the AMS and this in a Czech journal, I think, like somewhere. It was in English, but not very wide. And he, apparently, himself was not very happy with this result because the spaces were in Hausdorff, and that was heat heresy. So yeah, I have something for distributive lattices too, but and then I think the algebraic geometry is kind of like, of course, realized. And realize the importance of spectral spaces, right? But so the advantage I think of the roadmap that I've presented is that basically there's very little to change now. So you need, well, the second item stays that, the second and third item essentially stay the same. And the first item, yeah, it's like also easy. I mean it's also maybe already there. I don't know. Maybe already there. I don't know. Yeah? So a finite T0 space, just to explain that first item a bit, like a finite T0 space is the same as a finite pose set. Okay? And so then opens of a finite poseet, that's a general finite distributed lattice. Okay, there is a okay, so what is that? Okay, so what is that? Pro, because here I've written profin T0. And of course, if you define the projected limit of finite zero spaces, you would be done. But the extra thing that I've kind of hidden here is that pro-finite zero spaces is a very famous category. That's spectral spaces. Okay? So this is not a method, and this is a And this is a this this would be a slightly easier thing, I think, to do. Okay. Okay, and I think also for that, it might be nice to use the stuff about frames that I showed you in the first slide, because as we as you know, if you've seen the definition of spectral spaces here, it's like compact, solver and has a basis of compact open sets, which is closed and refined with sections. Okay, how did someone come up with that? Okay, how did someone come up with that? Well, if you look at it on the frame side, you know, I've told you a space is entirely encoded by its frame. These spaces are silver, so they are entirely encoded by the frame, and then it becomes kind of nice as an algebraic condition. Remember, I told you, in a frame, you have compact elements. And you just ask that the compact elements form a sub-lattice that generates. Okay, and that's all you need to say. No tautology. So, okay, of course, then the work isn't done. I mean, you still have to then prove that these things are direct limits of the finite subs. And there's some subtlety here because the morphisms don't quite work right. So I've settled this. Okay. Here's another interesting theorem that might be Another interesting theorem that might be a future target, I think, for math lib. I asked Conrad about it. Alright, Conrad told me he'd never read the proof. Yeah. And I was just like, I thought he knew everything. And I was just like, if you haven't read it, is it right? It's only about seven pages. I'm pretty sure. Yeah, it's amazing. No, it's like one of the, I'm glad you could, to me, it's also my PhD is. My PhD advisor, when I was starting my PhD, told me about this theorem and she said, oh, you know, like if you're bored on a rainy afternoon, that's a good thing to learn, you know, because very few people understand that proof. And so I try to understand, but it's hard. It's like it's hard, I think. I mean, there's like some, because, why is it hard? So why? Because think about the finite here. Think about the finite case. So, this is here's an equivalent, here's a weaker, here's the statement of Hofster's theorem taken through duality, okay, because I find it easier to stay forgetting about topology. So, a finite distributed lattice is always the lattice of finitely generated radical ideals of some ring. Okay, so can you build that ring? There's of course choice. I mean, there's a lot of choice, and that's kind of the product. It's also, so there is research from the underlying type is finite. Yeah, it's finite. And so there's work on that. So Panaszewski has a beautiful paper where he explains how to do that. And then there's a recent book by Dickman, Schwartz and Tressel. Ickman, Schwartz and Tressel, where they actually explain how to get the whole half-sticky. But that's from 2019. So that's quite recent, that they've an exposition and it's like a textbook, like you can really understand everything you want to understand about spectral spaces. I think if one was to go through that with a bright student and try to make them formalize it, it could be a. Formalize it could be a cool thing or a few practices. But this stuff is really being used in the theory of adding space. Right. So it groups up commonly theory about perfectory spaces. You say, well, all these spaces are spectral. And so actually, we can just say, we'll log their schemes. And now we've got access to all the VGA. Some miracle effects. Exactly. So this is what Patrick told me: is that actually in the beginning, he took also at the proof and thought about formalizing it for that precise reason. And then also thought, huh? And then also thought, ah, but this looks like a slightly long-term look. So that's why I put interest on it. So, okay. Any questions? Any more questions at this point? Okay. Oh, here's the subtlety about the category that I kind of ignored. So a projective limit of finite T0 spaces, okay, but continuous. But continuous functions aren't the right functions anymore. That is, so for profinite sets, everything works beautifully, and you know, topology, continuity. And now it's like not the case. You have to define something called spectral. It's a bit like, okay, it's the inverse image of a compact open map is compact open. Those are the right maps in the category if you want all of this to be. That's what you'll get with starting with the final. That's what you'll get when you've started with finite things and then took a program. Yeah. Compact and open. Yeah. It's all very zero-dimensional and not the kind of spaces that you would encounter unless you looked at spectral rings. I see. So in a typical topological space you'd see. So, if you've got a topological space, you'd say, okay, well, this is a unique condition because there are very few compact processes. That's right. Yeah, so for, like, if you have. Yeah, that's right. Standard functions are those that rings one or nothing of the rings. Yeah. Of the rings. Yeah, that's right. This is saying that the. And that is like the inverse image of the. That's equivalent? Any morphism of spectral spaces? It's clear that the morphism of wings in the middle. That direction is clear. Yeah, yeah. Oh, oh, oh, you're asking for like a morphism version of Hoxis view. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, okay, no, no, no, I misunderstood your question. So this is actually, I think that's an interesting, like, that's an open problem, I think. Because I'm gaining. Because one big problem with Hobbs's theorem, all the proofs that are known of it, it's very hard to make control precisely. And that would that would be an answer to your question, right? That would be an answer to your question, right? Any fail has got one button. Right, right. Which one have you choosed? Which one do you smallest one? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that's what Benischewski's work is about, actually. Like, once you fix, is it, for example, functorial ones, you fix a field, maybe, you know, like or something like that. So that's. Okay, something about. So if you go to the slide previously, are these sometimes called? Are these sometimes called proper maps? I think so. I think that's like in toposteori thing, it's proper maps, but yeah, that's basically complement. Yeah, but in that context, maybe not like the tensor, but just often it scores away and just I think it's possible that you can I think you can have a map which is continuous and such that the inverse image of a compact set is compact. No, this is impossible. Okay, you can have a spectral map, but a compact set whose inverse image isn't compact. I think that can happen. Some not open compact where it fails. I think that's possible. I think that's possible, but I don't have, I can think about an example. Because this definition of proper is wrong for non-house-broken. Yeah. But so, okay, so that's kind of a nice segue into the next part because it seems kind of clear that there's something a little bit fishy about this category, right, with these weird maps. Right, with these weird maps, and so okay, this is pretty nice as a diagram, but this is not a full subcategory, and you know, that's a bit what is top C? Oh, continuous. I just put the C for like this topological space with continuous maps, and this is spectral space with spectral maps. I just put it for emphasis that it's not full. Okay, yep. So, one way to resolve this, so now I come to kind of And of some research that I that is my own research interest and that resolves this problem of spectral space with spectral maps. This has been known since the 70s that one can do that, is to consider the specialization order. And then the category of spectral space with spectral maps suddenly becomes a lot more natural. So the specialization order just means x is lower than y. X is lower than Y if it's in the closure. That means that you're making open sets upward closed. Open sets go up. And then you can do a strange thing. You can take a spectral topology and invert it. So you can make another spectral topology on the same set, which has the reverse specialization order. The way you define The way you define this is you take the contact opens and you say, no, no, no, no, I want them to be closed. And then you generate a topology from that. And that's again, it's kind of interesting. That's again a spectral topology. So it again comes from a ring. What is that ring in terms of the first ring? I think that's also not known, but okay. And then you can also patch. And then you can also patch, okay? So, this is known as constructible sets, right? So, you patch your two topologies together. Now, this, okay, and so here is a kind of suggestive proposition for you now. This is a space, okay, so I take the original set, I take the patch, and I take this order. And this is a compact space, okay, but it's also totally separated for the order. Order. So, what that means is, sorry, so this should be a non-squiggly arrow, not a non-less notation addition. So, if x is not squiggly arrow below y, then there is a cloven that separates them, but in the order theoretic sense. Does that make sense? So it's like the same as, remember we have totally separated, like distinct points are separated by global. Now we have Now we have if x is not below y, like distinct but in the order sense, then you can take a clopen upset that contains the first and not the second. This is the generalization of pro-finite to a situation where you have topology and a partial order. That's called a priestly space, and that's the same as a profine process. That's the punchline. And it's also the same category as spectral space with a spectral mouse. It's just a nicer presentation of it. And I think it's implicitly used all the time in algebraic geometry also. You're working with the constructables and the specialization. And really, you're looking at spectral, you say, no, it's really complex-bored spaces with this condition. And then the maps are. And then the maps are very natural because they're continuous monotones. So that explains why it's spectral condition. Is it easier to state or prove the theorem that every spectral space comes from running? No, it's the same problem. I mean, you just take the constructible topology. The problem there is you have to build a sheaf out of nowhere, right? That is like. This is just a ring. Yeah, this is just a ring, yeah. Yeah, this is just a ring, yeah. No, no, no, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. No, no, no. Okay, of course, then as a sanity check, you take the ones where the order is trivial, that gives you profinite sets. And as I mentioned, so you have to think about what does it mean to make a finite process discrete. Well, you just put the discrete topology on it. And then this is also the pro-completion of finite process. Of finite process. So it's a completely analogous to profinite sets. Okay, let's see. I was going to talk a little bit about... No one noticed, but I dropped sheets from my table because I realized there is not enough time to talk about all that. But I was going to add a little bit of algebraic structure because, of course, this is kind of the foundational work. Now, you all know much more. You all know much better than I do the algebraic geometry implications of this, but it's also surprisingly maybe used in the theory of computation itself, okay spaces. So the idea, this is a very general idea, but algebraic structure on such a profinite poset corresponds to co-algebraic structure on the dual lattice. And so one example is of course the Z hat. This Z hat. Then, this is the spectrum of the Boolean algebra generated by arithmetic progressions. Where, yeah, I mean, here you have to do some parsing maybe. I mean, this is like a collection of things in 2 to the z. And I first take those things that are arithmetic progressions, and then I generate. That's one way to see this. That's one way to see this. One way even to define the pre-profining group. You make that algebra and you take the dual. And then, oh, and then the point is, why is it a group? Well, it's a group because the group structure on Z half, that just comes from the shifts that you can do on arithmetic regressions. So it's one way to present this type of, this just an example to. This type of this is just an example to present algebraic structure in this collection. Very simple. Yeah. Shift is a unitary equation. Yeah. And the sum is. Yes, that's right. So that's the action of one. Yeah, then you have to generate high-income things. So that's the action of one. Okay, and this is actually used in proving a very classical theorem that I would suggest is also. That Bella would suggest is also like I don't think it's been formalized in any group of system. Is that if you take a linear recurrence in Z and you look at the times when it's zero, that's a finite union of arithmetic regressions. The only proofs of this, all proofs of this at some point must use something for finite or the addict because it's an open problem whether you can make this. Problem whether you can make this effective. So, even though you can prove it's a finite union of arithmetic progressions, it's not known if you can decide whether this is empty. It's not known whether an arithmetic progression, whether a linear recurrence has a zero. And what's that? There's a proof in Castle's book of local fields. Okay, an application of Elliot number. Right, yeah, yeah, exactly. No, it's a beautiful idea. No, it's a beautiful proof, really. And yeah, anyway. So yes, there are people who say who in computer science who's phrased this is saying that we cannot even decide the halting problem for a linear Turing machine. Okay, that's correct. I think that's essentially just a linear recurrence. Then, so building on that. Then uh so so building on that there's uh yeah of course in general right showing that a subset of a three monoid on two generators is hard to compute you can get a million dollars for that and um and and in okay here I'm of course not at all claiming that this can directly be useful but but there is a place I just want to say this like there is a place where pro-finite stuff appears which is the following look Which is the following. Look at a very simple class of languages. This is like way inside P, okay? Regular languages, the things you can express with regular expressions. This is a Boolean algebra. And this, its spectrum is the free profinite monoid on two generators. Okay, here, why monoid? There you have to do some work to make co-algebraic structures. Some work to make co-algebraic structure on regular expressions, but we can do okay. You can like divide regular expressions by other regular expressions. This is all Z01 like the same as the alphabet? The alphabet, yeah, that's I'm just using, oh yeah, for exposition, I'm using, but this could be any fin. So there's an even more general theorem that in fact this always applies. Take your favorite kind of algebra. Kind of algebra. The profile and completion of it will be the extended spectrum of the Boolean algebra of recognizable sets. I haven't defined for you in general a recognizable set, but just to say that this fits in rather framework. And okay, then here, for the last slide, let's get meta. Simply type lambda terms are themselves algebraic objects. Are themselves algebraic objects. They are just arrows if you want in some critique in those categories. Okay, this is a little bit like saying that you can implement mean in the. Okay, we do that sometimes higher order stuff. It's of course a complete baby version because I'm just talking about simply types. Okay, so that means you have types and you have products and arrows and that's all. No detail now. But then something we've been doing with a PhD student of mine in Paris and his Karis and his co-advisor is to define profinite lambda terms. And given this theory, and you can say that a profinite lambda term, what should it be? The theory tells you it should be a point of the algebra of recognizable sets inside lambda terms. Okay, and so here you can have a lot of fun and you can, for example, recover the free profile monoid as profiling at lambda terms of a specific type. And so it kind of sets all this, combines some, we're trying to combine. Combines some, we're trying to combine. This is like this here, so we're trying to combine profinite with lambda calculus. Right, so extending any usual methods from profinite monoids that I know a bit about to this setting. Okay, so the takeaway is that for stone duality, just to summarize, I think it's mostly linking up some existing parts of the library. Then moving to profile and postets, that's a little more work, okay? That's a little more work. Then there might be some new application domains. I mean, of course, I didn't mention at all because Babylon will speak about that, but condensed math. I think this is like the absolute level zero scaffolding. But then also to be able to do condensed math, you will need some of these kinds of things that I've talked about. And then Hotzer's theorem, Skolom's theorem. And in co-algebraic structure, I think it's a longer term project. Is a longer-term project.
