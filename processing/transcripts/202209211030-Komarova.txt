To speak at this conference, and today I will talk about evolutionary modeling of cancer with an emphasis on the protective effect of aspirin. So, the basic idea is that we will use mathematical methods to study microscopic evolution of cells in organs, kind of what happens to mutations, how they get selected, how cancer starts in the given organ. And then we make a connection with a much larger. With a much larger scale, the scale of populations of people rather than populations of cells. We'll talk about the epidemiology of cancer. And I'll show you how we can connect the two and how microscopic modeling can give us predictions about the development of cancer in people as a function of age. So I'll start with this part. I'll start with this part. And this is older work that describes some of the approaches that we've been using over the years to model evolution. So this is an old diagram that shows the development of colorectal cancer and it's a sequence of mutational events. And I want to attract your attention to two types of mutational events, a loss of function mutation and a gain of function mutation. A gain of function mutation. So, loss of function is one of the first events here. It's the inactivation of the APC gene. And a gain of function, the example here is an Anca gene called KRAS. So let me tell you about both of these types of mutations. So a gain of function mutation is when a gene gets modified by a mutation and it gives the cell an advantage. So it starts. Right, so it's uh it starts dividing more, it stops cooperating. Some bad things happen. Uh, a loss of function is uh quite different. So, this first event that I described is just one hit, right? So, it happens one single mutation gives rise to a change that can have consequences for the organ. In the case of loss of function mutation, it actually takes two events, and I'll explain why. So, let's suppose there is Explain why. So, let's suppose there is a gene, for example, this APC gene or retinoblastoma gene. So, this gene, its function is to keep the cell from doing bad things, right? It doesn't want it to stop cooperating. It doesn't want it to start dividing. And there are always two copies of any gene in our bodies, in our cells, right? So, if we get a mutation in one of these and inactivate it, there is still the other one. There is still the other one that keeps bad things from happening. So you have to inactivate both of them to start seeing an effect. So here's a gain of function. It's enough to mutate just one copy and you already see a difference because this mutation does something. This second mutation inactivates, so it loses function. So it takes two mutational events to see any change. And why is it important? Well, because mutations. It's important? Well, because mutations are very rare. So, in this case, the probability of such an event is 10 to the minus 7 per cell division, per gene. So it doesn't happen very often that one gene mutates, and so you have to wait even longer for both of them to acquire a mutation. Nonetheless, this is a very important evolutionary system. Very important evolutionary scenario in evolution in general, but also in cancer. There's about 200 genes that have this type of function and have been implicated in various cancers. So as I already mentioned, in colorectal cancer, it's the APC gene that we'll be focusing on, but there are many of them. So this type of scenario has been studied widely. And so what can a mathematician do? What can a mathematician do here, right? We can calculate the rate of inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene. Like, how long does it take from here to here? And so, in order to illustrate this, I will start embedding this mutational model into a dynamical model of cells. So, cells divide and die. Every time a cell divides, there is a chance, U, that it acquires one of these mutations. One of these mutations. So, the simplest process is what they call a Moran process. Here, cells are in a box and we don't keep track of the cell's location. All the cells are kind of the same. The only difference is that this mutation, right, the green of the color scheme is off. So, these are cells with no mutations. These are with one mutation. So, at each time step, we pick a cell for division and we pick another cell for death. So, after For death. So after this update, the total number of cells remains the same. So it's a constant population model. And it kind of mimics the cycling of cells inside a healthy organ, right? So one is chosen for division, another one is chosen for death. And it keeps going like this. And so if this dies, right, you can pick a cell anywhere else in the system for division, regardless of where it is on the screen. And you do it until the first double hit. You know, the first double-hit mutant appears, and so we want to calculate the rate of that happening. So, when you choose a cell for reproduction, it's done on the basis of its fitness. So, fitness is an important mathematical factor here. It's the rate at which a cell divides compared to other cells. It's a relative quantity. And you can also make death dependency. Dependent on the type. So the division rates of cells are RW for normal cells are mutant. For mutants, the death rates are like these. And we can write out the probabilities of the mutant reproduction or wild type or normal reproduction. And so this is a Markov chain, actually. And you can calculate everything there. So I'll show you some numerical results. Show you some numerical results that illustrate different types of things that happen here. This process has been studied widely in many contexts. But so here, the horizontal axis is time, and the vertical axis shows you the population. So we always start with just normal cells. And the leftmost graph corresponds to the scenario where the mutation rate is very, very small. Small compared to what? It's small compared to 1 over n squared, where n. Small compared to one over n squared, where n is the number of cells. Mutations happen very rarely. So a mutation can happen that makes this intermediate type and maybe not from the first trial, but eventually it'll kind of rise and displace all the normal cells. And then after a very long time, another mutation happens in these, which creates a double mute. And that's, you know, the beginning of cancer. Beginning of cancer. If you reverse the assumption of the smallness of U and make the mutation rate an intermediate quantity, something different happens. So in this scenario, intermediate cells appear and they can come up and die, come up and die. But before they ever reach dominance in the population, see, this is a low scale. This is 10 to the 3. This is like 10 to the 1. Is like 10 to the 1. Before they reach dominance, they manage to generate another mutation inside them, which gives rise to double mutants. Because the mutation rate is larger. So there is a chance that they create a mutant before they reached dominance and resided there for 100 years. Finally, in the case where the mutation rate is the largest, we have almost a deterministic process. This is the least. Process. This is the least interesting scenario. Every time you run a simulation, it always happens in the same way because mutations just flow. They just happen. You can describe this with all ease. Okay, so these two are the most relevant scenarios if you look at these parameters and compare them with what happens in nature. Here, the mutation rate is too large, doesn't happen. So, to describe this, we have developed a coarse-grade approximation where Approximation where we have a very rough system where either all cells are normal or all cells are intermediate or this is the event where we create the first dangerous double-hit mutant. And you can calculate the rates of each of these. The most interesting, mathematically speaking, is this rate of going from here to here. This corresponds to this scenario, and we call it stochastic. Scenario, and we call it stochastic tunneling. So, to calculate this rate, you can do this in terms of mutation rates, the fitness of this intermediate mutant, and the population size. So, let's just, I'm not going to dwell on the derivation of this. Let's just take a note. We calculated the rate. It kind of serves as a proxy of the rate of evolution. And now we say, okay, Moran process is unrealistic. Is unrealistic because cells don't live in a box, right? So we want to include space, spatial locations of cells. How do we include space? Well, the first attempt that was made was one-dimensional. Let's put cells on the string. So what is the process now? You kill a cell, and then only one of the two neighbors is allowed to reproduce, because that's where the empty space is, right? So it kind of goes like. Spaces, right? So it kind of goes like this. So cells know their location and they can only replenish a cell that just died from a neighboring location. So in this case, you can calculate analytically the rate of evolution, and it happens to be faster. This used to be a square root, now it's one-third, and u is small. Okay, so space somehow accelerates evolution. We can do it in 2D, it's harder. Is harder. And the same result holds. The more rigorous result was obtained by Rick Duret. So and his colleagues. So what happens here? Why does space accelerate evolution? Well, there is an intuitive reason for this. So in a process where cells don't know of their locations, let's run the simulation. We're still going to plot them in a two-dimensional space. In a two-dimensional space, but just mind that they don't care where they are. One cell dies, and another cell anywhere else can divide to replace the whole, right? So here, intermediate mutants, which are depicted in blue, can be anywhere, right? They don't have the concept of neighborhood. Here, on the other hand, if you have a spatial system where cells can only divide into their neighborhood, mutants tend to stick together because they're relatives. Stick together because they're relatives, right? And they kind of populate the same spatial location. And so, in all this theory, the intermediate mutants are weak. Most likely, they have a fitness that is slightly less than that of the normal sounds, which corresponds to biological reality most of the time. So, here these intermediate mutants are on their own and they are And they are usually out-competed by the normal cells because they are weaker. Here they stick together and they end up only competing among each other because they compete with their neighbors. And they feel much better about it, right? Because they're all kind of these weak cells clustered together and most of them are not in competition with the more advantageous normal cell. So these islands persist for longer. There are generally more of these cells. Generally, more of these cells in the spatial simulation. And obviously, then they give rise to double-hit supermutants faster, simply because there are more of them. So that's how space accelerates evolution. Okay, so space is not everything. Another feature that we can add to the description is the hierarchical structure. As you know, cells are not all created equal. There are stem cells and they're differentiated cells. So in this simple, most primitive model, we have like a stem cell. We have like a stem cell sitting at the bottom, and it first divides to create like a copy of itself and a differentiated cell, and then it goes through binary divisions like this. So, these ones get killed, all of these will divide, then these divide, then this divides, and finally the stem cell replenishes everything, right? So, this is a process. It's a very simplified model of what really happens in organs, but it retains this hierarchical structure. So, and you see it. So, and you see that the celebral is different, right? The pole is there, sitting there. So, in this case, we can also calculate the rate of evolution. It happens to be slower than both the spatial model and the first basic model, the Moran process. So if we plot all of these results together, the rate of evolution as a function of mutation, we see three lines. This middle line corresponds to the mass action, the simplest Moran process. The simplest Moran process. And you can see that space accelerates evolution, higher rate, and the hierarchical structure makes the rate of evolution lower. Okay, so this may signify the architecture of organs that many of them have, right? So a lot of epithelial tissues, such as colon, skin. Skin do have a hierarchical structure. And there may be a reason for that. The reason being that the rate of evolution under such a structure is actually lower than it would have been otherwise. And why do we want the lower rate of evolution in this case? Well, because it prevents cancer. It pushes the onset of cancer to older ages. And perhaps that's why evolution chose this solution to, you know, make You know, make to create or organs that have a hierarchical structure to delay the onset of cancer. Another model that I'll briefly mention is a more sophisticated model of hierarchical cell division. So we have differentiated cells, the ones that perform their actual function. They don't do much. They just divide and die. And there are stem cells that can divide in two ways. They can divide asymmetrically. Two ways. They can divide asymmetrically like this. So a stem cell creates a stem cell and a differentiated cell, or they can divide symmetrically like this. So either they proliferate, creating two stem cells, or they differentiate by creating two differentiated cells. So all of these patterns of divisions have been observed, obviously, in stem cells. So we put them all in a model, right? So it's kind of a complicated system. So a cell, a stem cell, if it decides. A stem cell, if it decides to divide, first it has to say, Am I going to divide symmetrically or asymmetrically? If it's asymmetric, okay, good. If it's symmetric, it has to decide whether it does this or that. So all of these components can be put in the model. So instead of this binary, you know, perfect structure, we have something that is much more kind of sophisticated. And it was very nice to be able to obtain the rate of evolution as well, even in this system analytically. And it's slower than the And it's slower than the original rate that we calculated for the most primitive moran process. And here we can also investigate how the rate of evolution depends on the symmetry of cell divisions. Turns out that it's the slowest for symmetric divisions. So if we plot this rate, the ratio of the symmetry, if all the cells divide symmetrically, as opposed to asymmetrically, we can plot the ratio of rate. Asymmetrically, we can plot the ratio of rates as a function of mutation rate, and we'll see that the difference is huge. It could be like 10 to the 4 fold difference between the rate when the cells divide symmetrically versus asymmetrically. Somehow, the best thing that an organ can do is to have a hierarchical structure and have the stem cells divide symmetrically, which kind of Which kind of when we first obtained this result, it was a little bit weird because when we first learned about stem cells, asymmetric divisions is kind of what they do. This is kind of, there was always a signature thing about stem cells. But then if you look through the literature, stem cells were first discovered and studied in Drosophila flies. And Drosophila flies don't have cancer. They're too small. It's not one of the problems that they have to solve. So, in bigger organisms like mammals, where cancer can be a problem, it turns out that stem cells divide symmetrically quite often. So, these data started coming in, and so our theory was rewarded. So, there is a reason for that. It actually delays cancer. So, the conclusions from this is that two-hit mutant creation is slower in hierarchical populations and it's the slowest. Populations and it's the slowest for symmetric stem cell divisions. So now we are going to apply this to colonic crypts. So we will, in our application for today, we choose colon cancer. In fact, the stage of colon cancer was called, which is called advanced adenoma. This cancer develops in tissue that looks like this. You see, these are four. Looks like this. You see, these are folds of epithelial colonic tissue. Each fold is called a crypt. If you take this and amplify it, it kind of looks like this. And this is where the proliferating stem cells reside. Okay, so we're going to apply our modeling to these compartments and see if we can connect this microscopic modeling with the larger scale modeling where we are talking about population. We are talking about populations of people and the statistics of cancer development. So there is a twist in the story, which is aspirin. So we are actually interested in how the development of colon cancer is affected by aspirin. And the reason for this is this amazing study, very large-scale study, which was conveyed by John Byrne and his colleagues over many years. Over many years. So they looked at a large cohort of people, and there was a placebo, and there was a group that was given aspirin every day. And they wanted to see if there's a difference in the rate at which colon cancer develops. So they didn't look at the general population, but only at the patients with Lynch syndrome. Lynch syndrome is a type of colon cancer. A type of colon cancer, which comes in families. So, some people are born with a mutation that kind of takes you one step closer to colon cancer. So, these people usually develop colon cancer in their 50s. So, they have a much higher likelihood of developing this condition. So, this was the group that was studied. And what was found in the study is that the proportion of people Proportion of people diagnosed with cancer was much higher in those patients that didn't take aspirin placebo compared to those who took aspirin. So there was a significant difference. So somehow taking aspirin helped. There were other studies. So this is a meta-analysis. So they kind of took a lot of literature and looked at the risk ratio. So risk ratio is a statistical concept. Is a statistical concept, epidemiological concept, which tells you whether something helps, right? So, risk ratio is the risk of people developing cancer, those who take aspirin, divided by that without aspirin. So, if it's less, this is one, see, if it's less than one, it means that aspirin helps. And in all these studies, they found that there is a delaying effect of aspirin. And these are, um, so again, aspirin versus placebo. These are different. These are different studies, which contain different numbers of people, but they also show the same thing. And the study that's central for our work is that of Chan, Andrew Chan, and his colleagues. They had a large cohort of nurses that took different amounts of aspirin. So, zero pills a week, from half to 1.5 pills a week. Point five pills a week from two to five, uh, six to 14, and more than 14. 14 pills a week is two pills a day, which is kind of it's some people do that, right? It's not out of this world huge dose, right? Uh, so and they found that, so let's look at this largest dose. This is risk reduction. You can see this is the risk of developing cancer is reduced by a factor of two. Cancer is reduced by a factor of two in these people. And the reduction is less for a smaller dose. Okay. So we wanted to see how this works and why this may work. It's a long-term study with experimental colleagues. So Aji Gaul, City of Hope, and Rick Bolland in UCSD studied colorectal cancer and they performed experiments both in Experiments both in vitro and in vivo to see how aspirin affects cells. And with Dominic Wodertz and Yifan Wang, who was a postdoc at UCI, we used this data to kind of put everything together in a model that spans between microscopic modeling and epidemiology. So the experiments performed by our colleagues. Experiments performed by our colleagues. So here I describe the in vivo ones. So they take cell lines and they insert them in a mouse and they grow tumor basically in the back of the mouse. And we were able to deduce the rates of cell divisions and cell deaths with and without aspirin. So here are photographs of these tumors that they grew, and there is an aspirin dose which Dose, which from zero to the largest physiological dose. And so they were able to measure the growth curves of these tumors. So these are days and this is just tumor volume. How do you deduce division and death rates from that? You can do that. So that's where modeling came in in these experimental studies. We did it in 3D and we were able to And we were able to get out both division and death rates of cells. So these are fits of our models to the data. So we know what happens. We were able to measure division and death rates under different aspirin dose. And here's a result. As a function of the dose, what happens to the death rate of cells? You can see that in all these cell lines, it increases. So the more aspirin, So, the more aspirin was applied, the higher the death rate of cells. What happens to division rate? Well, the opposite. The larger the dose, the less cells divide. And this just shows that exactly the same result was found in in vitro experiments. So, from these two studies, we know what happens to the kinetic parameters of cells. And now we can put them in a model. So, the model has Put them in a model. So the model has to explain the following. This is the advanced adenoma incidence in the population of people. So males and females are separate here. Black is average. And so this is just a general study of all the people. We know that under aspirin, this is reduced by about a factor of two if they take a large If they take a large dose, how can we explain that given the information that we know about division and death of cells under different doses of aspirin? Okay, so this is what we did. So we created and parameterized the model of late adenova generation. We implemented the effect of aspirin through modification of kinetic parameters, and then we connected that with the epidemiology and measured the aspirin risk reduction. So let's see if these changes in So let's see if these changes in parameter values in division and death rates can explain this effect on the epidemiological data, on the age incidence curve. So again, this is the picture that I showed you. It's going to be more complicated than what I talked about at the beginning. Here, this explains kind of just a process with two mutational events. In late adenoma, there are more. Adenoma, there are more. So, first, this is a normal cell. It can inactivate the first and the second copy of the APC gene. That's this process that we talked about. But there is also an ANCA gene, a one-step event, a gain of function, which is KRAS. So you can go from here to KRAS and then inactivate the APC. Or you can inactivate the first copy of the APC, then turn on KRAS and then inactivate the second copy. Or you can start with inactivating. Or you can start with inactivating two copies of the APC and then go KRAS. Three different pathways. And all three mutations in the same cell comprises advanced adenoma. And here APC goes this way, the tumor suppressor gene, a loss of function event, and the vertical arrows are a non-cogene or a gain of function event. So there are more processes here that can calculate all these rates. Calculate all these rates based on the division and death rates of cells. Another complication here is that these modified cells, when they form, so when the crypt kind of acquires these mutations, like the double APC mutation or any KRAS mutation, there is this weird process that was recently discovered. It's called crypt fission. This fold kind of Kind of divides. It's not a cell dividing, making two cells. It's a crypt or a fold of epithelial tissue that divides and forms another one. So they kind of multiply like this. So this is what we have to put in the model. And until recently, a parameterization of this model would have been impossible. We actually tried years ago and we couldn't do this because there's simply too many parameters. But recently, and due to this paper, we learned. Recently, and due to this paper, we learned that many of these parameters have been measured. And we were able to actually get something meaningful from this model for the first time. So there are several parameters that are known, like the rate of fission is gamma here, division rate of crypts. And we know relative fitness of all these different. Fitness of all these different types. So it's kind of nice. We know the mutation rates, okay, we always knew this. We know the number of stem cells per crypt, and we know the number of crypts. So a lot of these parameters are known. So in this paper, this model was used, which is an ODE representation of a stochastic model. So you can write down ODs or you can do this, make this model into a Gilead. Make this model into a Gillespie simulation that is stochastic, but it describes this very concisely when written as a bunch of ODEs. So you go from, you go between different states, one, two, three.
