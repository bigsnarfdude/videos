Today, I will talk about non-compact manifold with positive scalar curvature. Now, this is offline. The main goal of my talk is to try to discuss the following things. That is, L be an open manifold. Top R is given non-vective constant. And we want to discuss under what kind of condition do we have the infinite scale. Do we have the infinite scalar curvature? Is less people than zeros? Now, here g is any complete Riemannian metric. Now, I want to emphasize that the completion is the only condition for the Riemannian metric theorem. Now, I will discuss, explore this problem in the following two steps. In the first step, I want to discuss the certain non-compact manifold, non-compact oval manifold admits Oval manifold admits no config positive scalar curvature matching. In particular, in this for those manifold, the intermolecular curvature is always non-negative. Or we also discuss for some manifolds, there is no complete and uniformly classic scalar curvature metric. Or equivalently, for those manifolds, the infamous scalar curvature is less or equal than zeros. Now, this is the first part of my talk. Now, this is the first part of my talk. In the second part of my talk, I will discuss the various Eru-type theorems. This is that we want to study under certain geometric normalization assumptions. We want to ensure that the infamous scalar curvature is less than equal than a given some constant copper. So, this work based on a joint work with Talk based on a joint work with a group of people. Here's Jianzhen Hao is my current PhD student. Jian Wang is my postdoctoral and Ren Chang Wu is my current PhD student. And Jianwang is my friend, Jing Jianzhu, who is here, is my former student here. Now, let's get started from some basic facts of the scalar curvature. By the definition, scalar curvature is a trace of symmetric two-time. Is a trace of symmetric two tensor which which equivalent which is a symmetric two tensors and if the manifold the dimension of the manifold is greater than three then the spherical curvature is a weak curvature invariance in this case so a nice way to understand the spherical curvature is look at the look at the volume of small geodesic balls here now this is a formula here capital R P Here, capital R P denotes scalar curvature at P and this omega R n this one is included both with volume includable with radius R. So by this formula, we see that the largest scale curvature is, smaller volume means. I'm always curiously at the falling Q property of the falling of the scale equivalent. That is, for all compact matter, at least for all compact matter. Compact manifold, at least for all compact manifolds, whose dimension is equal three, always admits a negative scalar collision matrix. However, not all compact manifolds admits positive scalars. Actually, this is a classical result due to visionovity. I think it was discovered by about 60 years ago. And since then, to study what kind of condition for a differential For a differential manifold, but have a Poisson scalar curvature become one of central problems in geometric and topologies. So, in other words, there must have been certain global effects for partial scalar curvature on manifold. Let's look at some examples. We don't exactly search for the microphone. Okay, now here is some typical example on global effects of scalar curvature. That is all correct, which is dimension between 3 and 10 admits no positive scalar coefficient metric. Actually, this is a famous Galois conjecture. This was proved by Shen De Yao about more than 40 years ago. The work actually is the original proof is from Manifold between three and seven. However, by the recent work due to Chadosh also Chadosh, their argument works well with Their argument works well from three to ten. Okay, and later, uh, by Roomster Lawson, says through the following things, said all contact kata adama manifold, which is a CHOSU, admits no positive scalar curvature metric. So here we are said a manifold M is said to be CH if it admits non-positive section curvatures. Positive section covid. Okay, now that the final example is quite interesting to me, is at least in 1998, Yeru drew the following result that let Sn be a standard sphere here if the metric G, a new metric G on the sphere is at least bigger or equal than G naught. That means the length of any curve with respect to metric G is at least than that with respect to G naught. That with respect to g naught. And the scalar curvature of g is at least m times n minus one, then that implies g equal to g naught. Okay, this is a typical three examples. Now, I would like to tell you that the observation behind those typical examples is the following one. That is, at least to me, non-existence of positive scalar curvature on the manifolds depends. On the manifolds depends heavily on the proportion of the manifold. Usually, the compact manifold admits no positive scalar curvature, but have more complicated properties. For instance, in dimension two, hygiene surface admits no positive scalar curvatures. Now, the third one is that one cannot, the third observation is that one cannot enlarge the metric in order. The match it in all directions and increase the mean increase in the scalar curvature simultaneously. Actually, this is due to the observation of the observation due to Romov. Now, here's the statement, let Mg be compact remaining manifold, Ng norm be a compact manifold with constant separate curvature, kappa, and let F be a map from N to The map from n to n be a rip sheet, one rip sheet, sorry, and a non-zero degree map. This can be regarded as kind of normalization conditions. Okay, then the infamous scalar curvature should cannot be bigger equal than this constant. Cn is the constant, depends only on n, and injectives of n tilde g tilders. Here, n tilde, g tilde is the universal curving space of n. Of A. Now, this is very interesting observation. So, let me look at the previous example in viewpoint of these observations. Now, let's show that a little series. So, let S and G naught be the standard unit sphere. So, if G is bigger equals than G naught, then the idea map from the new manifold S and G to the standard sphere is of course one which is deeply one. One reaches and deeply one map. So, by the observation of chromos. So the interim scalar curvature, it cannot be than the constant here, this constant. And actually, on the standard sphere, we can calculate this Cn. We can calculate this Cn. We can calculate this. And actually, it is equal to this once. So this is a type thing. I mean, the series is contained in the observation of the observation. Okay. Now, let me show you the next one example. That is, let Mg be a compact carton atom manifold. M is any compact manifold. So that there is a map. So that there is a map F from M to M in zero degree map. Then we can like to show by group observations that M admits no positive scale of commutative metric. Okay, I will show this by group observations. Suppose not, then there's the metric G is positive scale, positive scalar commuter metric for N. Here, P and C stand for positive scale of commuters. Okay, then we can choose lambda, positive lambda, lambda. Lambda, positive lambda, large enough, so that from this new manifold to this constant set curvature, so must be one riches. I mean, for any matchings, we can choose a lambda large enough to make this one is one rich. While this is the cartoon Adam manifold, so the injective values can be the injective values of its universal covering space must be infinity, right? So by the So, by the observation of grommets, the internal scalar curvature cannot be the same as this one, while this is equal to zero. So, we get contradictions. Okay? So, okay, this is for oh, this is for two examples. The pseudo-world typical manifold that means no positive scalar curvature is called SYSN. Here means. Here means Shun Xiao Shik manifold. Now that explains what's a shun SYS manifold to you. So let n be a compact manifold and beta 1, beta, beta 1 and beta n minus 2 in the first cohopological class of the manifold. You can just image it in differential one fold. Okay? Then if the n is a if m is a let m A let n be a fundamental class, then we do cap product with this n minus two once it forms, and this will be in the second homology class. If this tap product is not contained in the image of who is map, then we will say it is S by S. Okay, now let me show you examples. The M dimension torus and this manifold here, sigma two, is genus. Here, sigma two is genus, a high genus manifold surface. The product with n minus two or s is a this two kind of manifold are s y s manifold. Let me show you why. So we just take pickup coordinates theta one, theta n minus two from these factors. And we do the cup product. And this cup product is actually the homology class of sigma two, which is, of course, because. Which is, of course, because sigma is biogenous, so it cannot be spherical. So, this is S by S now at the beginning of the 80s, Xuan Yao and later by the Shik proved the following statement. That is Lat M in compact SYS manifold. The dimension is between always between 3 and 10. Then such a manifold admits no positive scalar curve. Okay. Y'all interested? So, this is for compact case. So, how about the non-compact case? So, we still begin with certain simple examples. First one is that N minus one torus product in real line cannot admit a complete PNC magic. Actually, this observation is due to Gromo Blossom about 40 years ago in his famous. About 40 years ago, he gives famous IHES famous. And while the second example is quite interesting, that if we pick up L minus two tolerance products with a frame R2, then such a manifold will admit complete positive stereo counter matching. Let me show you why. Yeah, it's very simple that actually the parabolic, that we have parabolic metric for R2, which is written in this. And this parabolic metric actually. And this periboliate metric actually is actually section computed positive. So we just do the remaining product. So this manifold do admit a complete positive scale of computer metric. However, it did not admit no complete and uniform positive scale metric, which is written by UPSC radars. I think this is also due to problem of analysis. To chromophanos. Now, the third little example is that if we pick up L minus Q torus and the product with R3, that means three-dimensional computer space, and the resulting manifold actually admits complete and uniform positive scalar commission metric. Now, let me try to construct that. We just pick up a half sides, which denote by S2 plus positive. Possible numbers. And then attach this is a half sphere. So we get the resulting manifold is actually a C1 manifold while scalar curvature is at least two. Then we can use natural flow to smooth it and get a UPSC metric. Okay. So those three manifolds are all cut on out of my manifold. Actually, it's a flat metric. But I But I would like to tell you that some non-compact CH manifold even admit a complete UPSC magic, for instance, like the last ones. So that means non-compact case is the situation of non-compact case is much more complicated. Okay. Now, let me show you some more complicated results. Result. This is resulted due to global blossom. That is, the TN be an standard torus, TK be a sublinear, linear subtorus of TN, then they can show that the Tn the delete, the TK, admits no complete positive scale. Actually, there is nothing so-called lambda 2 in matrix manifold. And they can show that all Lambda 2 imagine manifest. Can show the all lambda to united manifold at this. So, this is only a special case to be used. Now, later, very recently, the shoe, Angle, and Yao, or independently by Chudoshi Li, Charlie, through the following result, block Mn, block end between string tanks, and this can show that any over manifold, let M be any over manifold. Then they do the connecting the sum with Taurus. The connecting sum with torus, we can show that such a manifold admits no complete PLC metric. And two years later, this result generalized by Chen Shu Li Chen. She proves that actually we can use SYS manifold to replace this TN. As I mentioned before, that TN is a special SYS. Okay. Okay, and uh now very recently, Xiu Li Chen, Jian Chen Chu, and Jing Tian Shu is in this audience included the following result. If n is 345, any compact aspherical manifold. But N be any any compact aspirin manifold, and N be open manifold, then the connections. The connections of their manifold to this manifold admits no complete PLC metric. Okay, here a spherical means IO homotopy group vanish. Only first fundamental group may not tribute. Yeah, okay. Yeah, any questions? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it vanished. Yeah, yeah, just means a spell. K-Taiwan, man. Another name for a spell is K-Pai1. K-Taiwan. Okay. You got any questions? Now, last year's, in his four-direction notes, Roma proposed the following conjecture that's called non-contact domination conjectures. Now, here's a statement: if the contact Statement: If the compact oriented manifold X naught cannot be dominated by a compact manifold with positive scalar curvature, then it cannot be dominated by a complete manifold with positive scalar curvature either. Now, here, now let me explain some terminology to use. We say that let x be a compact manifold. We say that x dominated x not if there is a map f from x. Map f from x to x naught with non-zero degree. This means dominate. And if x is an open manifold, we say x dominate x naught if there is a map from x to x naught so that outside a compact set, it is constant. So for those manifold, we still can define degree and we assume the degree in theory. Okay? This means dominate. Now, let me say some remarks to the terminology of dominate. For a compact manifold, if x dominates x naught, that means the topology of x naught a little bit complicated than x naught. For this, our manifold can dominate the spanish sphere because the topology of sphere is the most simplest. Okay. Now, for open manifold, if For open manifold, if x dominates compact manifold x, not that means by our definition, that means there is a compact set k, and topology of k is a little bit complicated than this right. Okay, so with this is with those things in mind, it seems natural to bring the following answer, which is a special case of form of conjecture should be truth. That is, let X not be a contact S by X. Let X naught be a contact S by S. X is an open manifold, and K is a contact set of X, and F is a map from X to X naught, which is constant outside a contact set K. And with deeply equal to one, then X admits no partial scalar. So this is a special case of Roman conjectures. Well, here's some remark. If the above conjecture is true, sorry, above conjecture implies Above conjecture implies those results are mentioned before, because all those results are concerned manifold with connected sums. So that means x connected some n. For all those manifold, we would have map from connected some manifestation, connected summation manifold to x dot integrity one because it is connected. You also can construct this map. Okay, so this is the first remark. The second remark. remark. The second remark is that for those cohomologic classes, first cohomology class beta 1, beta n minus 2, as defined in SYS manifold, without loss generative, we can always assume beta 1, beta n minus 1 is linear dependent on. This because the first beta number of the sphere is zero. So first hohomological sphere always vanishes. So we can always assume this. Now, here's our result, which we joint work with J1, Lin Zhang Wu, and Jing Kenzhung. Now, let M be compact SYS manifold, the dimension between 3 and 10, but let gamma k be a compact summer manifold of n, and n be open manifold. That is, there is a map from n to n, so that this is proper. This is proper actually map is proper and the map the map is proper or the map outside k it can be extended is map to gamma k for some contact domain and the deeply f equal to one for those for all those prof benefit we can always define deeply and we assume deeply is equal to one then we now here is our conclusion then so if the first ed number of gamma is less than to n minus Is less than to n minus three, then m admits no complete PLC match. In particular, for those manifolds, this is the open management, right? For those manifolds, the infamous scalar curvature for any complete metric manifold is known plus. Now, the second conclusion is that if gamma k is spherical and the coordination of gamma k is at the least three, then n admits no complete uniform positive sphere. That is, That is, for all complete manifold on those manifold sorry, for all complete metrics on those manifold, the unimal scalar curvature is non-narrative. Non-positive, sorry. This is our theorems. Now, here are some remarks. That is the same conclusion should be true. It's also true if beta one and beta n minus two is linear dependent on that our our arguments would fail. Our arguments expel in this case. So if take gamma k be a point of the end, the both theorem gives an affirmative answer to the special case of Roma's conjecture. Okay, because Roman conjecture only considers gamma in one point. And in our case, the gamma can be a summon manifold, certain assumptions. Okay, indeed, we can define the notion so-called open SYS manifest, and we can sure so the open s by. And we can sure solidify SY manifold carry no complete PS in that is scale with dimension between three and seven. Now, now here's example of Ogon SYS manifold. The manifold considering serial one or this simple manifold and product are here are n is closed as closed s by s manifold. R or open s by six. S by s equals six. So all those manifold over manifold admits no positive, complete positive scale. Now, the main argument of the proof of this theorem is to use minimum surface technique together with clear phological analysis. Okay, this is for non-existence of PLC imaging. Next, we will go to discuss non-existence of UP. Discuss the non-existence of UPC magic. Let's begin with a conjecture due to Gromov. In his golfer paper, he proposed the following result: a following conjecture. Let X be a compact closed manifold, such that X minus one point admits no complete battery with quantum scale curvature. And let B be a X boom removes the small ball just look like this. And then the G be a matrix on V with scalar curvature at least bigger than 40 constant sigma. And if the low neighborhood of this of this boundary is low neighborhood of this boundary with respect to metric G is always diffimorphism with S and the interval. Then the row cannot be good than this point. The row cannot be good than this point. This is not often used, okay. And he and he also point out that if x is s y s manifold and delete one point, then by showing your argument, with dimension reduction argument, you can prove this about conjectures. Now, the following picture illustrates the main idea of the proof. Let me show you how to do that. Sorry? Okay. Yes. He now, this is a boundary of the B, and he assumes that if the low neighborhood, this is the low neighborhood, if the low neighborhood of the V is homomorphic with this Sn minus one, then L cannot be too long. Yeah, okay. Yeah. This is a kind of misguessing. We suggest okay. Any questions? Okay, let me show you. Okay, now let me show you how to do here if the manifold is SYS. Now let beta be a first cohomology in the definition of SYS manifold. Then, as I said before, that we can always assume beta restriction on the sphere is the. Restriction on the sphere is varnished equal to zero. Then we just do a coverings with respect to beta. That, or you can just image to open the manifold around the beta. So we get non-conductive manifold. And we just take a band from this covering space. This looks like this. Because the beta is restrained to this sphere is zero. So it looks like that. Looks like that. And then. Looks like that, and then uh, now we just take it is sufficiently long. Uh, and if row is large enough, then we can use new bubble arguments to get a mu bubble, which is denoted by sigma here. And sigma will not touch the boundary because we always consider the minimizer of this brain action. So, the second evaluation is the negative, which implies that such point of sigma. Which implies that such kind of sigma mark always admits a positive scale prediction. However, it is SYS. So, according to the Shuing Yang result, it cannot admit PSI net, which is a contradiction. That means load cannot be too large. So, this is the argument. Okay. Y'all, any question? So, if you have a slice, Now, this is our result. We say that let N be a compact SYS manifold, the dimension is still between 3 and 10, and the gamma be a sub-manifold of n with code dimension at least 3. We assume that gamma is spherical. That is, the forest map is subjective. This means spherical. And the scalar curvature is at least extended. At least big than sigma, then any two tubular neighborhood u1, u2 of gamma, let u1, u2 be any tube neighborhood of gamma, and we can show that distance between the boundary of u1 and u2 cannot be bigger than this one, especially by this with estimate, this kind of with estimate. Especially, we can show that n does not admit completely symmetric. Okay. By this estimate, we can imp uh this estimate implies that the m by m delta gamma does not does not complete, does not admit a complete uniform scale metric. Because if it is not, there is the UPC, there is a metric, complete metric on this manifold with scalar curvature bigger than to sigma. Than to sigma, then we can, then this boundary distance, the distance of boundaries would be large enough, but contradiction to exist in qualities. This is the general result. Now, if gamma equal to p, then automatically it is spherical. So this implies what the norm of cells. And this is difficult. And this is difficult in our proof that beta i in our case beta i with certain gamma may not equal to zero. So more careful analysis in mediums have to be careful things. But for limit of times, I will not go into immediate. So how many minutes do I have? Not even this. Okay, so we have. Okay, now let's move to the next part. So we are scared. This is the summary of the first part. That is, we can define an open S by S manifold. And those manifolds admit no PLC, complete PLC image. Or in particular, the internal. In particular, the infamous scalar curvature of those manifold is campaign positive. And Lat M, the second one is that M equals SYS manifold, and we can share that M products with R and or M get it this manifold some amount of gamma are open as well as manifold provided the gamma is because the number of gamma is not not Big number of gamma is not too large. Now, the second one, the last one is that right n be closed as my manifold, gamma being spherical, and could measure at least three, then the infinite scale curvature cannot be non-possible. This is my first part of the work. Now, let's move to the second part, which told the root type serial computer. The end of this part, as I said before, that the aim of this part is to try to discuss some geometric normalization of metric G that implies the infrared scalar curvature is bigger or equal to kappa. Here, kappa is some different numbers. Now, the observation behind this is that for certain compact manifolds, in quantitative scalar curvature metric, one cannot increase the scalar curvature in scale of curvature in large manifold. Scalar curvature in large manifold in all directions and many space. Now, let me show you a very simple example. That is this is a standard two-sphere metric. If G is bigger equal than G0 and the scalar curvature is bigger than Q, then by those Bonnet formula, we can see easily that G must equal to G0 in this case. Okay, now for three-dimensional case, this is for three-dimensional, for high-dimensional case. Look a high-dimensional case, which is proved by a loop type. That is, let this be a standard sphere. And if G is bigger than or equal to then G naught, and scalar curvature, bigger than equal than to G naught, then G must be equal to G naught. Or in particular, in such for those metrics, the integral scale of quantity is cannot be than this once. I would like to point out that G big than bigger equals G. Figure equal cell genome can be regarded as kind of normalization in this case. Now, here's a remark. In this case, the identity map is one link sheets with big link one, which will sort of be as the geometrical normalizations. That is, the status field can be replaced by any strict convex pipe surface in the states. type surface in the states and uh uh actually loot type series was proved by originally i should say the root type series was proved by deloc operate uh and the one rips uh the first uh remark is that one rips condition can be relaxed to the earlier non-increases and the final uh one is that because of the root type serials Because of the root type series, the standard sphere is actually delta gap lens extreme for some delta vectors. If I will try, I will explain this technology. Yeah. Sorry. Area increase? Area, two areas. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, two areas. Only for surface. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. That means any surface. That means any service. Are there any questions? So by new bubble arguments, we are able to share the following result. That is, blood, this one is standard sphere, standard 3-sphere with a pure antipodal points removed. And HBNO is a constant bigger than one. Then we can show that. Then we can show that if the if the met new this G is a new metric which is bigger than this one, here G hat is the standard spheres of unit standard sphere and the scalar curvature is bigger than this bigger than this, then h must equal to one and g must be equal to g hat. Now here's some remark. The theorem should be true if g big than equal to h square times g hat and the scale. Times t hat and the scale curvature of this and the dictionary that is one. These are the more natural assumptions. I mean, I cannot do this. Actually, a special case of our result implies that the remote theory will still read the measuring things in choice. Now, the third one is that the condition H at least one cannot be removed. Otherwise, we will have count examples, worry count examples. On examples, okay. So, the last point is that we do not know whether the result is true or not if the owner o' ply are not n trips. Okay, now here's the main argument. We use the new bubble argument to do this. The observation behind this is that the standard, the model space, this is the model space, can be regarded as a variation of. As a variation of two coordinate law, new bubbles. Here, law is distance to the north pole on the inner sphere. We want to construct a similar foriation on new magnets by new bubbles. Now, to do that, we first to show the existence of initial mu bubble, which denotes by this is the sigma norm is a kind of new initial mu bubble for suddenly by perturbation arguments. And then we want to show that this. To show that this the sigma naught, we have the projection from those part O is those part of the projection to sigma from sigma naught to equator is non-zero degree. And then we want to construction the fluoration start from this sigma naught by new by new bubbles. And the fluoration, which is and actually we were sure that the induced metric of the of the for Of the for the leaf of the foration is agree with that from GF. And the third one is that we want to show the section curvature domain, which swept by the Fourier is equal to one. And finally, we want to show that how manifold can be swept by these four entities. I should say that there's several interesting work in this direction. For instance, Professor Lengui Tang. For instance, Professor Lengbi Ten and Dr. Li proved the new type series on spherical cap with biogenation by visual flow. This is very interesting. And very recently, there is a paper in AirCard. I think is Wang Jingming, Chung Bo, Xia Zhang, and others proved that the Lou type theory, the Lou theorem for four-dimensional case is also true without spinning assumptions. They use new bubble combined with harmonic, which wrote something. Is harmonic which wrote something like that. Yes. Yeah. Now, here I want to say that the advantage for three-dimensional case is that mu buck is two-dimensional. So cost-blade formula plays crucial roles in here. If we consider high-dimensional case, for instance, SK products with certain manifold N, where M is in large, for instance, Taurus or United States center situation much more complicated. Sense situation is much more complicated because we cannot use cosplay from specific directions. Now, here seems natural problems. Let n be a compact or notable Riemannian manifold with a scalar curvature bigger equal than k times k minus one. We assume that there is non-zero degree and one leaf is map from n to this model space. This is a non-zero degree and one leaf map can be regarded as. If that can be regarded as certain normalization conditions, if those things are true, then we conjecture that n is locally isometric to the model space. This is a compact version. Now we also have non-compacted version. We can use computer space to replace the torus and ask the same questions. So, Dogier's remark: there will be no such if. Such as if provided the scale curvature strictly bigger than this, sorry, it's actually that if the answer to the answer to a bow problem is affirmative, then there would be no such F provided scalar curvature is really big then is constant. And actually, if we started to look at it carefully, there are three times. It carefully there are three types of models based that is standard sphere and a minus standard sphere product is R and S K case dimensional sphere product is A minus K in space here code dimension is the two so we we have we can we can have have three type problems three point problems and this is the this is a the this model space is compact while this is non-compact but Well, this is non-compact, but it's a two n's. And this one is also non-compact, but with only one s. This is a completely different case. So, yeah. Now, this is a result due to Wei Ping Zhang. He proved that let N be a non-compact and complete manifold. And he considered the map from N, M is over manifold to S so that it is a constant outside the compact. That it is a constant outside the context set and degree none equal to zero, and the scalar curvature of degree equal to the standard one is a skeletal standard sphere. Then he proved he showed that infinite skeletal must cannot be possible. Now, here is a recording. That is, let M G be non-compact and complete spin manifold. Sorry, in his theorems he must because he used to copy. So he has to assume manifold is biggest. To assume manifold is biggest. So spin manifold with big skeletal to be sense this one, then there is no math from n to s n, so that it is a possibility complex at this constant. That big zero. Okay. In particular, I conjecture that this is this in for this case, the root type theorem is also true. Now, the problem is that is it possible to share the same result without spin assumptions? Now, this is also a conjecture related by groups, relates to our problem, our conjecture, but because of time limited, I will not go into details. The difficulty for high-dimensional case is that the manifold may not be equal to manifold. If the manifold may not be spin, then we cannot use dirac update or cost money from at least directly. So recently, I make a mistake here, and this is title. And my post-code question, so the following result, we consider the model space S3 products with n minus 3 products as the model space. We show that if the manifold is Is this manifold scalar curvature is at least six, which is a which is scalar curvature of S V. And there's a map from M to this model space is non-zero quickly. And one if it's map, then Mg is locally isometric to this model space. Sorry. I missed the condition that we I should assume that the geometry of n is should be bounded. That is second curvature. If the section curvature of n oh sorry in this case we need not to show any sorry I'm confusing. So let me show you this say again that this is the model space. If mg is a local Space, if Mg is local under these conditions, we can assure that Mg is local locally asymmetrical model space. Okay, so this probably is true. Or in particular, we can that means infinite scalar curvature of G is less than six for those manifolds, for those manifolds. Now we also consider the non-compact case. Non-compact case. Let MG does this. This problem is for non-compatible case. Let Mg be a non-compact orientable manifold and completely manifold with scalar curvature as at least six. If the map F from N to this model space is plot and one link with non-zero degree, can we show Mg is isometric to this model space? This is non-compact versions. I should say that non-compact versions are much more. Say that non-compact version are much more complicated than some compact ones. Now, here is a simple example: a simple observation that the root type theorem are not true for included space. Now, this is a very simple example, control example. Last sigma n, we have polybear voltage of revolution in m plus one between space. So, this is also a graph of our So, a graph of Rn, right? Glass P denotes the standard projection. And if you distraction on the parabolic, then it should be one leaf sheet. And of course, it is deeply one because this is a deep model, actually. Okay. But the scalar curvature is strictly fixed because this is sigma is parabolic energy. So scalar duration is strictly everywhere fixed and times. n times n plus 1. So this example illustrates that the Lou type theorem for Euclidean space is not true. So by this simple observation, we can construct a negative answer to the problem for non-compact case. That is, we just take, let m be a manifold which is a which which is a which is a not mg be a manifold which is a standard the remaining product with these two pal sn to paraboli and of course the scalar curvature is big than this one strictly bigger than this one and let f be a identity and project you know to s m factor it is project it's identity identity and to respect to Map and to destroy to this one is project so it is a one rate map of course with no zero degree actually but the scalar curvature is is strictly big senses so i i mean for no compact management the loop type serial is not true so there must be some extra condition now here is also examples observation Examples observation. I think this is observation due to growing. There is no path and one leak is a map from this Euclidean space to that one to standard Euclidean space with no zero degree. If the scalar curvature of Rg is uniform positive, uniform positive, uniform abounding. I think this is due to processing. And we can modify this argument to show the following result. For any data, Uh for any delta uh sorry for any positive delta that mg be a now here mg is a dimension is from between five to seven and be a non-contact orientable and completely valid metric with scalar curvature strictly big with a scalar curvature at least six plus theta then there's no pop the one big sheet map from n to the model space M to the model space. Okay, so, or in other words, under assumption of CLMQ, we have the informal scalar curvature must be less than 6 plus delta for any delta process. Now, here's another observation. So, any contact perturbation or you can space Or you pit a space between the dimension figure equal to between three and seven. With scalar coefficients and negative, it must be trivial. Actually, this is kind of positive. And we can also have the similar result in this case, S3 times product with R minus N3. That is, if we assume manifold N is between, dimension manifold N between four and seven. The n between four and seven. The scale of curvature is at least six, and f is a map from n to the model space. We plot and one mix map with non-zero degree. Then mg is isometric to the model space, provided as f is isometric outside a compact set, just like a quantum message. That means you cannot do compact compact perturbation. With scalar temperature at least six. So that means one cannot do compact perturbation on this model space with scalar temperature at least six. Okay, well, this is quite interesting. That if we take the look at this model space, that is S. Model space, that is S3 product space R. This is quite interesting. And we can show the following related result. Let the four-dimensional manifold be non-compact or unable complete manifold with scalar curvature is at least six F B A map prop and one which is a map with non-zero db. Now there is an extra assumption. That is we should assume this manifold is geometric bonding. That is curvature assumption. That is, curvature, supermarket of curvature operating is finite, and the injective radius is also of the manifold is possible. This is extra assumption. Under this extra assumption, we can show which result. Now, this is another series. Let NC be the in above be above the series. If scalar curvature. If scalar curvature is strictly positive than six, then we can show that there's no one lipid map from math n to model space with non-zero gibberish. So by this theorem, I guess the geometric bounded condition on both theorems is not necessary. But without such assumptions, I cannot be okay. Okay, so under the same assumption is, in other words, under assumption in theoretical file, we also always have that scalar curvature, even of scalar current, cannot be excellent. This is kind of the loop-type series with non-compatible can be regarded as non-comparative version of the loops. Now here in the main part, I would like to mention the group of observations. He introduced a following notion which I call the epsilon gap length trim. If match G0 on Y, Y is a manifest, is the epsilon gap length trimmer. If there is no G big equal than G naught on Y satisfying that scalar curvature of G is at least epsilon bigger than this of G. is the epsilon big sample sensitive. The genotype called a gap length triangle if it is epsilon gap length or positive capital. I'm sorry that complicated. And he asked the following questions that does get extreme extremity is always stable under the manual product space? Manual products based in PD space. That means if y is epsilon length cream, does y product based piece space is also epsilon length scheme. Now, by our assumptions, we can ensure that for any delta positive and n is between one and four, the delta gap length extremity of Gap lens cremity of three-dimensional sphere is stable under the most sense. This is the conclusion. Yes, I think I should soften sentient.
