And also I wanted to give a shout out to the people at Paris and their amazing breakfast, because that gives you the opportunity to at least think well, I mean the breakfast was nice. Maybe that's all it is. So I am going to talk about Cartonstaff algorithms C V maps and their reflective limits, but let me first mention that a few open problems that people suggested and a few questions that people have been asking about have been Asking about have been revolving around how to study arbitrary sister algebra from the point of view of dynamics. Of course, you have to define what arbitrary means and what dynamics means. But somehow that's why we're here because like performance of algebra allows us to see system algebra as a dynamical system. And in particular, in this talk, we are going to find. In particular, in this talk, we are going to try to follow that methodology, but we have to restrict the class of sister albums that we are going to study. And in particular, it has appeared a few times already the notion of amenable groupoid that I'm not going to discuss, but I am going to discuss its sister algebraic counterpart, namely nuclearity. So, this appeared for real, I mean, it appeared in. For real, I mean, it appeared in the SNEPS talk and for real in current yesterday. So, let me define it. So, A is nuclear if there is what people call a CPAP system for A. So, if there are maps, say from A to A, this map is a bit. This map is a bit boring, this is the identity, but you also have maps from A down to Fn and app back from Fn back to A, psi N. And these are FCP, which means completely positive. I'm sorry for lying to you. It actually means completely positive. So such that this system commutes asymptotically. So the So the so if I take psi n of phi n of A, this converges to A for any n for A. Now, this is the, as I said, this is the analog of amenability for croupoids. In particular, for a double house of croupoids, it is true that the reduced system oil-based nuclear if only if the cruise is amenable. This was proven by Takisi in 2014. In 2014, at least the difficult implication, I guess. But this allows us to play, well, to follow the strategy of Christian Corney and Wilhelm Minter. So let me, so anything that I'm gonna say up until I say something else, this is all Christian Corney. I'm Winter and this is a series of works for from 22 and 23, let's say 23 here. So they realized that you can propagate this system. So you have A, sorry, and these are finite dimensional. Of course, if they were not finite-dimensional, I could choose them to be A. But they are finite-dimensional. So, and what they realize is that you can propagate this system. So, you have A and A, and you have the first step here, phi 1, psi 1. And then you can do this again, right? So, you can apply now phi 2, it f2. F2, sine2 here, right? And then you can keep going. Now, in principle, this is not a really interesting observation, but now we can partake in some mini-school tune and forget about the top row. So we can consider the maps, these maps here, that I'm going to denote. So this map, which goes from F2 to F3. From F2 to F3, I'm gonna denote raw32, following Australians' way of reading. So from right to left. And this induces, so what this gives you, is a system, say that I'm gonna know fn and then rho n plus 1 n. By the way, I understand. Uh by the way, I am restricting myself to no to separable CSO algebra here. It's not really necessary, but let's say there everything is a sequ everything are sequences. So in particular, what they proved, well, what you can now do is you can take the product of all the events, this is some sister algebra, and now I can portion out the The sum, so the C0 functions, the C0 sequences in here. This is now a sister algebra, and now I can define in here a certain operator space given by, say, rho n of fn, and then the union of all these. Now, what is rho n of fn? So, rho n is the map going, so if it only has one index, it's a map, so rho 3 is a map going from f3. Going from F3 to here, that does exactly what you want. So rho n of xn, this is just the class of 0, 0, and then xn, and then rho n plus 1n, xn, and 0. Things like this. So that is a well-defined CP map from Fn to here, and this is a well-defined subspace that is not closed because That is not closed because, well, it isn't, so let's close it. And what they realized is that there is a product on this. So observe that you can define a product here. So, and I'm gonna call it so. So, if I write Xn, I mean an element in Fn. So, you can You can define the product bullet in this manner, and you can just say that this is equal to the limit of, well, so I cannot multiply, so these maps are not multiplicative, they are only completely positive, so they preserve positivity, but they do not preserve negativity. So I cannot multiply xn and yn and then take the rows. What I can do is take the limit in L. is take the limit in L of rho L rho L say uh n x n rho l n y n so what I can do is if I have an element x1 here and an element y2 here then I can push them further down the line I can throw them into the sequence get to some beacon of L multiply them there Multiply them there and then take that to this operator space here. Now, it turns out that this is well defined. And A is actually isomorphic to this space with this product. And this is, I think, I mean, this is, okay, maybe not a serve, but theoretically. And this is, so what they prove. And basically what this tells you is that if you want to study the class of supermost nuclear systems, you might as well just study the class of such inductive limits that satisfy that this product, the That this product, that this net or sequence is cochine. And that's what Christine defined as system encoding. So definition, so the system is sister encoding, and now you're gonna immediately see why I Why I do not want to give many definitions in this talk. So, if so, for any xn in fn and in the epsilon, there is a big enough index n such that so for any l larger than m and j larger than n, N, we have that the product at index J and the product at index M are epsilon curves. So let me say it like this. So if I take rho L M of rho M N of Xn star rho M N X N this is excellent close to rho L J of the same thing. Of the same thing, substituting m's with j's. So this is a technical condition that is automatically satisfied if your system comes from A, if you started with an A. Now the point in case being that this is not necessarily the case. In general, you can have systems that do not necessarily come or do not a priori come from CBAB approximations of nuclear distal. But if you have such a system that defines that If you have such a system that defines, that satisfies this, then this theorem applies, and in particular, I mean, this is precisely telling you that this net, this sequence, is for G, so this is a well-defined sister algorithm. And now, if anybody has any questions, now is the time to ask because I'm going to change it all. So, let me. The definition of ends is still finite in nature? Sorry? Exactly are also finitely natural. Yeah, they they those events are these methods. Yeah, yeah, they they are all finitely served. So what was the the what's the subscript on that swiggles? Excellent. Yes, it's an epsilon close to this technology. So now the idea is: okay, well, so we can, we have a method that witnesses nuclearity of A, of any Nuclearity of A, of any nuclear system, it witnesses nuclearity in finite stages. So, what happens if A has a Cartan subalgebra? Can I witness the nuclearity, well, the Cartan sub-algebra of A in the finite stages? And conversely, if I have a system that somehow preserves Cartan subalgebras, does the limit, this limit, admit a Cartan subalgebra that is also. Admit a Cartan sub-algebra that is also the limit of the Cartan sub-algebras that we started with. And that's a whole mouthful. But let me give you a couple of examples. So example. So what happens if A is a BN? So say A is a Belian and unital. Well, I can take a function and evaluate it at, say, different points. Say different points xi. Right? These are my events now. And what is the upward mass? What are the upward mass? So they send. Now this is a finite dimensional system algebra and it has an I matrix unit and this gets sent to solve Get sent to some HI where these guys are now a partition of unity subject to some, so say Hi's resistance. So they said Hi's are a partition of UDD subject to some open neighborhoods of the n first points that you chose for your dense subset here. Dense subset here. And this is the first class of examples. Second is: well, take an amino group. So take some folder sets and you immediately see, well, we all know how to prove that this guy, that the reduced is amenable, is nuclear. And to do this, you just send, say, UG to well, you cut down with the projections onto Fn. Now, by these projections onto Fn, I mean this guy is canonically represented in L2 of gamma. So the projections onto Fn are the characteristic functions of these sets. Now these Sets. Now, these I can see as a matrix because Fn is finite rank, so this is a matrix. And to go back, again, I take a matrix unit, say, labeled by G and H, and I send this to 1 over Fn times lambda of the element that sends H to G, which, if I'm not mistaken, is this one. And now, I mean, you can check that. And now, I mean, you can check that I'm not lying, and you can check that this defines a CPAP for abelian system groups, and you can convince yourself that this works for those classes of examples. And following the line of thought, that if something works for spaces and something works for groups, then something must work for group actions on the spaces. And if something works for group actions on spaces, then it also works for twisted etc. And it also works for twisted and hard novels. So let's just do that. So, for time reasons, let me take the theorem. And now the theorem is a bit annoying. So, because it has a lot of things. So, now if you take, so it has two parts. Just as this theorem had two parts, even though I didn't write them, but this has two parts, maybe if But it this has to part namely if D in A is a cartoon pair Diego, sorry, your lambda and your dots, you're using lambda and B to mean the same thing? Yes. Thank you. Thank you. What was I? Yes. So if you have a carton there, then you can play, sort of play the same game, mix in one and two. Same game, mixing one and two, maybe not, I mean, substituting two instead of group elements, taking open bisections, and maybe playing with the twist a bit. But if you have a Cartan pair, then there is what we call a sister encoding Cartan system. Namely, so these are, say, the ends in Fn, so sub-algebras, usually the canonical diagonal sub-algebras. It's not really necessary, but they are going to be the canonical diagonal sub-algebras. And so maps like this that satisfy a bunch of conditions such that so. Um so satisfy conditions that look like this, and therefore you will forgive me if I don't write it down, because it takes a long time to write that down. But they are, so you need a condition that tells you, well, the limit of the DNs is a billion. So first of all, so this system preserves commutativity. This tells you that the limit is abelian. This tells you that the limit is abelian, the limit of the DNS is abelian. The system also preserves normalizers. And by preserving normalizers, I don't mean, or preserving combinativity, I don't mean that dn is mapped into dm plus 1. I just mean something like this. So that if you take dn and dm and you see them, the images, further down the line, then The line, then further down the line, there are images commute up to epsilon for any epsilon. So, this is not the same thing as saying that my systems are given by homomorphisms and maps between, say, the canonical cartons, preserving cartons, per serving conditional expectations, preserving normalizers. But again, I don't have much time. I don't have much time, and it is 9 a.m. in the morning, so these perception community normalizers and conditional expectations. If anybody later on wants to ask me what these things mean, feel free. And the system also is topologically free. So we define all of these things, and they are somehow the Somehow, the analog of studying the analogous notions for group points. But in particular, in Matt's talk, he mentioned that the nice thing about groupoids is that you have points. In system algebra, we don't have points. You have functions. I mean, of course, you can take by Gelfand duality, okay? But Gelfand duality doesn't work if you don't have homomorphisms. And again, these are only C D ones. So I don't have. So I can, I don't have points, I only have functions. So I have to define what topologically free means only in terms of functions, and what preserving conditional expectation means only in terms of functions. And likewise, the second part of the theorem is that this is also true. So any C-strain coding Cartan system will give you a Cartan pair in an canonical manner, and these things These things match up nicely. So, if you start with a Cartam pair and you take any such thing that I can tell you how to define and take the limit, then that limit, the pair, is isomorphic to this pair. But there is one problem. I mean, okay, there is no problem. There is one problem in the sense that if and this problem already was witnessed during Sven's talk and during Matt's talk and during probably also during Rufus' talk will be as well and the problem is I mean the problem here Or a priori problem is that this matrix exists. Now, what do I mean by that? I mean, I mean, well, he said yes, it does exist. And you know what I mean. So the problem is that nowhere ever did I say that matrix units, which we see as bank functions, right, we see as functions as contained in some small open set, nowhere. A small open set, nowhere did I say that functions that are contained whose support is as small are mapped to functions whose support is small. This I didn't say ever. And now the problem of this function is that its support is large. And okay, maybe not this function, but I mean, this is a matrix, sorry. Maybe not this matrix, but this one. Now this matrix is Now, this matrix is more annoying. This, to some people, would be Kazan's projection. This is annoying because this matrix is a matrix that has no one, but its conditional expectation is very small. So, in particular, I didn't tell you how to define it, but the limit, this conditional expectation, which will be a limit, so this is E from A to E. From A to D may not be faithful. Because if I have an element, a matrix unit, say some EII, that gets sent to this guy, and this guy gets sent to this guy, and so on and so forth. The limit of the conditional expectations of these matrices is zero, but they are of norm one. But they are of norm one, and they are positive. So this matrix, so this map will not be faithful. I didn't tell you how to define it, but you sort of can see it. But this is solved by the theorem that I have not seen anywhere, but I'm sure some of you know. So let me just state it, and with that, I will be done. And the theorem is that faithfulness is automatic. So if, so suppose you have DNA. Suppose you have DNA, and I guess in this conference, when you see DNA, this is like clearly a catampere, but it's not in this case. So this is an ASA, and the inclusion is regular, and there is a conditional expectation back. Right? So everything, so it is a Cartan, except it's not faithful, not necessarily. Is not faithful, not necessarily, but I know that A is nuclear, then B is fixed. And this is some form of Felix absorption principle in the case of, say, topologically free twisted. Topologically freely twisted metallic also coupoids. You can prove it in that manner, or you can also prove it following Renault's proof. So these three conditions tells you that there is a topological 3Dologically compact, let's say, uncountable Aussie group point, twisted. I may be missing something. This is telling you that that group point happens to be available. I mean, if that To be amenable, I mean, if that group happens to be amenable, then its reduced and its max system algebra is not the same. And in particular, this E, which happens to be the conditional expectation of the reduced proposed system algebra, is also faithful. Because it is the conditional expectation from that system algebra. So I guess that's it for today. Thank you so much for listening.
