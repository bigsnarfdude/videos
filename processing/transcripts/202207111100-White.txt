Opportunity to speak at this conference. So, my talk is going to be about LP bounds for some eigenfunctions of pseudo-differential operators with double characteristics. So we'll just start with a general discussion of pseudo-differential operators with double characteristics. So, if you come across this term, double characteristics, it means that you have a pseudo-differential operator whose symbol is vanishing to the second order along. To the second order along some set, typically a sub-manifold. For me, in this talk, I will just consider pseudo-differential operators which vanish to second order at exactly one point, which I will take to be the origin of my phase space. And my phase space will be the cotangent bundle of Rn, which I identify with R2n. And I write the coordinates on R2n as X and C. And I'm going to work semi-classically in this. And I'm going to work semi-classically in this talk. So let's let h be a small semi-classical parameter, which you can think of as Fox constant. And I like to work with bio quantization. So I've put at least the formal definition of the bio quantization of the symbol A on the phase space. And so in this talk, I'm going to consider semi-classical pseudo-differential operators on Rn that have the following form. So they will be the vial quantizations of a symbol. Quantizations of a symbol of the form T0 plus H times P1, where T0 and P1 are smooth and belong to a suitable symbol class, which we'll get to on the next slide. Assume that the principal part is independent of H, and just assume for now that P1 is just well-behaved. And I'm going to assume that P0 is complex-valued. And I'm going to assume, so regarding the real and imaginary parts of the The real and imaginary parts of P0, I'm going to assume that the real part of P0 is non-negative and vanishing only at the origin. And for the imaginary part of P0, I'm going to assume that it vanishes to second order at zero. And then, of course, when I make these two assumptions, I actually have that the principal part, P0, is vanishing to second order at zero, just for the simple reason that if the real part of P0 is non-negative and vanishes only at zero, then the gradient of the real part must also be squared there. Part must also be spherical. And then, as a motivating example, we can consider a semi-classical Schrödinger operator on Rn with a smooth potential that is complex valued, whose real part is non-negative, whose real part vanishes only at zero, and whose imaginary part vanishes to the second order at zero. Okay, so now let me be a little bit more specific about what symbol class is. What symbol classes the symbol of my operator should be in. So, first, an order function on RNC1 is a measurable function taking positive values, essentially that grows at most polynomially when you go from point to point. And then, if you have an order function on the phase space, you can associate to it a symbol class, which I call S of M. And this is the set of smooth functions on the phase space that are controlled together with all derivatives by the order function m. By the order function m. And for this discussion, we're going to assume that there exists an order function m on R2n, bounded below by 1 and lying in its own symbol class, such that P0 and P1 are in the symbol class corresponding to M. And we will also assume that the real part of P0 is elliptic at infinity in the following sense. If you go far enough away from the origin, we assume that the real part of T0 is bounded below by a constant. Is bounded below by a constant times your order function. So essentially the real part of p0 can't go to zero in any direction in R2n. And then if we want to view P of H as an unbounded operator on L2, we equip it with the semi-classical Sovelev space corresponding to the order function m, which is just the set of L2 functions which are mapped by the Weyl quantization of M into L2. Into L2. Okay, and so then what you can show when you make these assumptions is that if epsilon is sufficiently small, the spectrum of P of H within the half plane, real Z less than epsilon, is discrete, consisting entirely of eigenvalues. And then using Gording's inequality, you can actually show that the spectrum is confined to a vertical strip minus constant times h up to Constant times h up to epsilon. And of principal importance in many applications involving non-self-adjoint operators, for instance, return to equilibrium problems, eigenfunction expansions of semigroups, you are interested in the low-lying eigenvalues of your operator D. So by definition, we would say that a family of complex numbers, z of h, indexed by the semi-classical parameter, is a low-lying eigenvalue of your operator. is a low-lying eigenvalue of your operator. If for each h, z of h is an eigenvalue of p, and z of h is O large of h as h goes down to zero. And then regarding the low-lying spectra of operators with double characteristics, we have this result due to Michael Pittrick and Karol Provnostarov. And they showed that if a sub-principle part admits an asymptote, a semi-classical A semi-classical asymptotic expansion in the symbol class SM, and the quadratic approximation to the principal symbol P0 at zero satisfies a partial ellipticity condition, which we're going to get into in the next couple of slides, then there exists a complete semi-classical asymptotic expansion for the low-lying eigenvalues of p. And then, so that's sort of the spectral theory background for this discussion. What I want to talk about are actually the low-lying eigenfunctions. Eigen functions. So the eigenfunctions which would correspond to a low-lying eigenvalue. And it turns out not much is actually known about them. So for example, at this level of generality, it's unknown if they possess, say, WKB expansions. And so in this talk, I'm going to discuss the problem of obtaining optimal LP bounds for low-lying eigenfunctions and present the result in the case when additionally we assume that P0. When additionally, we assume that P0 and P1 extend holomorphically to the suitable tubular neighborhood of R2n in the complexification of R2n, C2n. Okay, so to motivate the bounds on eigenfunctions, let me take a tour through the spectral theory. So what's going to be of great importance when talking about the low-lying spectra of a pseudo-differential operator with double characteristic zero is the quadratic. zero is the quadratic approximation to the principal symbol at zero. So because we assume that the principal symbol is vanishing to the second order at zero, if we Taylor expand P0 at zero, its Taylor expansion will begin with a quadratic form, which is complex valued and as non-negatively apart. And if you have a complex valued quadratic form on the phase space, R2N, and you form its unique C bilinear. form its unique C bilinear polarization, which I denote by Q, X, N equal, and Y. This bilinear polarization can be represented uniquely using the standard symplectic form on R2N in the second slot by means of a matrix, which I call capital F, known as the Hamilton matrix of Q. And then using the Hamilton matrix of Q, I can define a distinguished subspace of the phase space, which plays a role in spectrum. Which plays a role in spectral theory as follows. It's called the singular space. So if we have a complex-valued quadratic form on R2n, non-negative real part, Hamilton matrix F, the singular space of Q is by definition the intersection, J runs from 0 to 2n minus 1 of the kernels of real part of the Hamilton matrix times the imaginary part of F to the J intersected with R Qn. And then as a stepping stone to stating the spectral To stating the spectral results for low-lying eigenvalues of operators with double characteristics, we can consider the case of quadratic differential operators on Rn. So let's say we have a complex-valued quadratic form on R2n with non-negative real part. If the quadratic form is elliptic along its singular space, just meaning that Q cannot vanish anywhere in the singular space except at the origin, then the Weyl quantum Origin, then the Weyl quantization of this quadratic form, viewed as an unbounded operator on L2, its maximal domain, has a discrete spectrum consisting entirely of eigenvalues of finite algebraic multiplicity. And furthermore, you can write out the spectrum explicitly in terms of the eigenvalues of the Hamilton matrix of the quadratic form. So I've just put that on the slide here. So essentially, So essentially, the spectrum is going to have a lattice-like structure in the right half plane. And sort of your intuition for this result is that when Q is elliptic along its singular space, the bile quantization of Q will behaving kind of like a harmonic oscillator. Okay, so this was the first work by Hitchrick and Prov Dostarov. And then once you have the spectra of quadratic differential, Spectra of quadratic differential operators understood. We can investigate the low-lying spectra of your differential operators with double characteristics. So let's say we have an operator of the form we've been considering, where we assume that P1 has an asymptotic expansion in the class SM. If the quadratic approximation to P0 is elliptic along its singular space, then one actually has a complete asymptotic expansion for the low-lying eigenvalue. For the low-lying eigenvalues of p. And it's given in terms of fractional powers of h, but essentially to the leading order, the eigenvalues are going to be h times the spectrum or the eigenvalues of the Weyl quantization of the quadratic approximation plus the value of the sub-principal symbol at zero. Okay, so that is the spectral theory. And now let's turn our attention to eigenfunctions. Functions. So I'm going to state a result where you need to assume some analyticity of the symbol. So I'm going to introduce the relevant symbol class for that. So if we have an order function on R2n, we can define sm hall as the set of all symbols on R2n, which extend holomorphically to an open bounded neighborhood, to an open neighborhood of R2N of the form R2N. Of the form R2n plus W, where W is an open-bounded neighborhood of zero in C2n, extending A such that this extension is holomorphic, and this holomorphic extension is controlled by the order function. And then regarding my symbols P0 and P1, I'm going to make all the same assumptions as before, but I'm also going to assume that P0 and P1 are now in the class SM Hall. SM Hall. And so our main result is as follows. Let's say we have an operator where P0 and P1 obey the assumptions from the previous slide. And let's say we have an L2 normalized solution to the equation Pu equals 0. This covers the case of low-lying eigenfunctions, just because if you have a low-lying eigenfunction, the eigenvalue is O large of H, you need to subsume the eigenvalue into the sub-principal part P1. So I state the Principal part P1, so I state the result as a solution to a null equation. If the quadratic approximation to P0 at 0 is elliptic along its singular space, then there exists a small enough value of the semi-classical parameter such that for every p, between 1 and infinity inclusive, there's a constant c so that the lp norm of u is bounded above by a constant times h to the n over 2p minus n over 4 when h is smaller than. When h is smaller than h0. And of course, we take the convention here that when p equals infinity, n over 2p equals 0. So I should say that this is the second work that has tried to find LP bounds for low-lying eigenfunctions. The first was done by Katia Krupchik and Günther Ullman in a 2018 paper, where they established these bounds, the same bound. The same bound in the case when the real part of the quadratic approximation to the principal symbol is positive definite. So the real part is, so the quadratic approximation is globally elliptic. And they're able to do this for p between 2 and infinity, inclusive, and when p, p naught, and p1 are c infinity. So a large part of my motivation for working on this project is to generalize their result by weakening this assumption. By weakening this assumption on the quadratic approximation to match what we have for the spectral results. So, in any way, you want a result where you're only assuming that the quadratic approximation to the principal symbol at zero is elliptic along its singular space. It's a weaker condition. So, we're able to weaken the condition on the quadratic approximation at the expense of assuming at the moment that P0 and T1. That P0 and P1 have a holomorphic extension. And ultimately, I'm hoping that we can get a true generalization of their result, the C infinity case. And then let me also point out that these bounds are sharp. And you can see that as follows. If you just take the semi-classical harmonic oscillator on Rn and you take its ground state, we know that that's an L2 normalized semi-classical Gaussian centered at zero. And you can compute the L2 norm of that. can compute the L2 norm of that explicitly and you find that the L2 norm, sorry, Lp norm is precisely the right-hand side of this inequality. Okay, so let me just finish by just giving you an example of an operator to which this would apply. So you can take a Schrödinger operator on Rn with a holomorphic On Rn with a holomorphic potential, you just assume, as we did before, that the real part of the potential is non-negative, vanishing only at zero, that the imaginary part of the potential vanishes to second order. And assume only that the determinant of the Hessian of V is non-zero at zero, and also assume just some moderate growth of the real part of the potential and some control, some polynomial control over the. Some polynomial control over the holomorphic extension. Then, what you can show essentially by direct calculation is that this assumption that the determinant of the Hessian of the potential at zero being non-zero implies that the quadratic approximation to the symbol of this operator, which is just c squared plus phi, has trivial singular space. And this was pointed out in a 2018 paper by Pitcherkin Beck. Paper by Pitcher Kinbetts. And of course, if your singular space is trivial, then your quadratic approximation is trivially elliptic along the singular space, and any low-lying eigenfunction of this operator must satisfy the whole thing. Okay, so I think I'll stop there so that we have time for questions. But thank you very much. So we have enough time for questions, comments, ready, pretty soon. Last commands, please. I you at the beginning you uh not generally it was service, but you were saying that you cannot have uh WK in this level of generality. It is known because if you start when you say square attachment plus we could with your assumption of homophobic homophyte condition. normal figure condition, then you can hope, for example, to solve the Econa equation, wi square 1 V minus 0. You can solve it, a case with small perturbation of the real, you can solve the very common equation, I think you can find a WP reconstruction. And the question is how you control the control the quality of the comparison with ideal functions. The existence of this, I think, in this case you should obtain the existence of IDE functions. Consider the case, for example, we consider where we need a similar problem when we consider the magnitude of the short when you consider the magnetic, the Schrodinger, a semi-classical magnetic H nabla minus A square plus V, which is the sum. We have the same problem to find for relatively small magnetic controls, we have to solve some Economic equation using that analysis. I I I suppose that with the assumptions that you put after for the Assumption that you put after for the LP with the LP estimate, possibly you can not in full generality, but for Schrödinger operators in your result you have the L B norm of the U and you want that achievement. And you want that achieve as h goes to zero. Yes. The results are very bad for b greater than two, right? Your estimate is negative of h. Yes. Does this mean that qualitatively the results are very poor or is there any optimality of the exponent for that? X. Oh, the exponent, yeah. Well, as I was saying, I mean, if you take the ground state, I don't. You can just look at it. So, for example, the L infinity norm of this is precisely h to the minus n over 4, which is singular. Yeah, so I mean, it's not great, but it's optimal. I was wondering, does this similar space have anything to do with some electricity properties of the Yeah, yeah, yeah. So there's a whole body of literature, which I didn't get into here, that says that you have one of these operators and its quadratic approximation is elliptical on its singular space, then you have sub-elliptic estimates. So in this result here, you're H not sufficiently small. Is there something in your proof that gives you a sense of semi-classical analysis? You're using semi-classical analysis, very often you construct a paramatrix here, and I'll make the value small enough so that maybe if you worked really hard. When I was writing the slide, I even debated just putting h much, much less than one here. What is the motivation? What is the motivation in, for example, so one can ask Je in general the motivation for looking at L P estimates in this product. Is the paper by Ulman motivated by some application? Yes. So when you assume that the real part of Q is greater than zero, what you expect of the low-lying eigenfunctions is that they were micro-localized in the phase space. That they were micro-localized in the phase space to a ball of radius H12 at zero, which requires you to try to. So essentially what they say is that this LP bound is a reflection of that micro-localization, the scale H1 half. But this is difficult because the usual semi-classical calculus is not sensitive at that scale. It was not motivated by the Proloop format. Yeah, well, I think as I understand it, earlier in his career, he was quite interested in operators with double characteristics, and so maybe he was coming back to this. I haven't asked him, but any further questions? All my participants, further questions? Any questions? Okay, so let's thank the speaker again. This was the last talk of the morning sessions.
