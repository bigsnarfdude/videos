It was a community for me, so I'm very pleased to learn a lot of these things. And my talk, unfortunately, will be very algebraic. In fact, it will be DG linear algebra. And I'm also sorry for taking slides, but I was marking exam papers. I can't really use my algebra anymore. So my motivation comes from algebra, I'm afraid, but there might be some links to some electric geometry and other things. Maybe we can discuss this. Can discuss this itself. Oops, maybe that's it. What happened to Turkey? Okay, so this is joint work with Marko Schimick in Sheffield and also some work with my PhD students. Work with my PhD student, Matthew Mr. Lester, who just started. This is based on earlier work, and I'm going to use most of my time to explain some of the formalism we use. So that's already some time ago, and take COVID, if you want. And we worked on other things, and then people told us, what about, can you do some other calculations in other contexts? For example, A infinity context. So we haven't really done anything like that. But understanding the DG context is already quite useful. So let me start with. So let me start with the algebraic, purely algebraic broken, so very basic, which comes basically if you do a representation theory of algebra over a field. And then of course we have the Hochschlukhology, so I don't have to say too much about it. So you can take the bar resolution, which gives you projective resolution of AS and A enveloping module, and then you can take its Hochschliel cohomology. The cohomology gives you the ocean cohort, or convalescent parts and X over that. Over that functor. And then we know that the Hauser commodity is very important. Once in algebra, of course, classically, that's where it comes from. HA0 is the center. That's what we really will be after lately. And then, of course, you also the lower, higher chromology groups, which have other information on the inner derivations, and of course, controlling deformations in all sorts of ways, which also makes social homology so important, geometrical applications. So, what we really want to study is the relation between the What we really want to study is the relation between the Haush homology and the center. And so let me just bring you in this purely algebraic background what that means without saying too much, but it's basically straightforward. So you take the category of, say, left A modules, and then you can look at the derived category and look at the full subcategory given by the bounded derived category. So you have the finance conditions. And then you take a a homology class, a Holschild cohomology class, say Etter. Class, say etter. So it lies here. You can also interpret this as an element over the derived category, the home from the derived category of the envelopment algebra of A to the envelope shift of A. And this induces you then a natural transformation of the derived tensor product. So you get something which you call a she of eta. For each class eta, you get such a natural transformation. And actually, A is flat as a right A module, so this means actually that this becomes relatively simple in general. Relatively simple in general. So actually, this derived tensor parameters A gives me the identity functor of the derived category, and the shifted one is basically the shift functor. So enfold iteration of the shift functor. So what that means is, if you put this together, you get a natural transformation from the identity functor of the derived category into the M4 shift functor. And in fact, you can show more is true, it actually graded commutes. Graded commutes, it's actually a nice transformation. Graded commutes with the shift function in this way, so it actually lies in what's called the degraded center of A. So that's the first instance of the center here, which comes up. So you get an element in this graded center of A. And if you now take the restriction map coming from the embedding of the derived carry, of the bounded derived carrying into DA, then you get a well-defined map, which is actually a characteristic homomorphism. This is a characteristic homomorphism, which is a homomorphism of gradient commutative. Which is a homomorphism of graded commutative K algebras from the Oshaw commodity of A into the graded center. And so, this is actually a very interesting homomorphism in algebrais and rotations theory study this quite a lot for a lot of questions. So, I just want to give you one sample example to give you some flavor about, purely algebraic flavor about this. So, if you have a K algebra, so this is a nice result of Lang Yao and from also some time ago, pre-COVID. So, A is a K algebra of finite local dimension. So, it means that Dimension. So it means that you take the supremum over all the projective dimensions. It's finite. And if the characteristic homomorphism is injective, then A has finite Horseshoe homology decomposition. So you can actually study certain questions. And of course, this is also related to smoothness of algebra. So somehow understanding this characteristic momorphism is quite useful in algebraic sense. So the question is, can you extend this further? So for example, you want to study this characteristicomorphism, you want to understand if when it's injected. We want to understand when it's injective, surjective, or even isomorphism. In fact, it's almost never an isomorphism. But we'll see certain interesting aspects concerning injectivity and surjectivity in two final examples. I will put that there before I have the time. And our question was, is there a unifying and systematic way to study this Cartesian morphism, also go away from the algebra case, which we consider as a one-object case, to go to something more general? For example, to take DG algebras, but then you can just take DG categories. You can just take DG categories. So, what I'm going to do now is I will extend this framework in a more general segment. And for this, I'm afraid I have to start to introduce some notation. In fact, the hardest part of our paper was to get the signs and gradings right and convince the referee that we did. And even when the paper was published, we got an email and said, Are you sure this is correct? He said, Okay, we have a referee board who was happy with that. So, okay. Anyway, so if you feel Anyway, so if you feel unhappy with gradings and signs, just let me know. I think it works. But anyway, so of course, yeah, what I mean just if I talk about the graded vector space, I mean index by z, and of course you have the tensor product, it's a graded tensor product, and the grade homomorphism. We also want to use the notation as usual, omega n and sigma n, and it shifts up and down. So all this is standard stuff. And of course, as I said, I want to do DG linear algebra. We work over. G linear algebra, we work over field only. And it's an interesting question: what happens if we don't work over field? Actually, the spectral sequence we're going to construct later is not working in this way. So at least we cannot identify. But you still can do some practices. Okay, so yeah, so a DG vector space is just a great vector space with a hydromorphous multi B minus one, such as square zero, of course, and what are differential grade vector spaces are just chain complexes. So, and then you can take tensor. And then you can take tensor products and homes, and you get again dg vector space. So that's all quite. And if you have a dg vector space, of course, you can take a somology. That's now a graded vector space. And we use this notation here. And because we broke over field, we have nice kind of Twinness type formulas, which we actually will be needing later. So that's just setting the stage and some notation, standard notation. Now, let's try gently to extend this construction to remote. Construction to a more general setting. So, we want to have Pauchial cohomology of DG categories and finding the right notion of a center for DG categories. So, in order to do this, I will go step by step. I look at linear categories first, then graded categories, and then DG categories. And in fact, we will use all of them later. They will all appear. So it's not really just some educational aspect of it or deductive aspect. So let me just say what I mean by linear category. I mean, you know all this, there's a category where the I mean, you know all this. There's a category with the structure of vector space on the morphism sets, there's pre-linear composition. And of course, they're induced linear maps. I just give my composition in the category C, so you can write it in this form. This also fixed my notation. And of course, if you have a linear, I mean, if you have a K algebra, that's just a linear category with one object. No, in the endomorphism algebra, it's just your algebra. Incomposition is just an efficient case. So that's the baby example we have seen at the beginning. What's the graded category? Well, we have to introduce the grading. Category? Well, we have to introduce the grading. So we want that the morphism set is a graded vector space. And here we will see later we have to be careful how we do this. There are many ways of doing this, of course. But in this case, so again, we have asymptotic composition homorphism and their identities overlay in degree zero. And actually you can check that the degree zero part of the graded category is of course a linear category. And in fact you can put any category, make it into a graded category by placing it into degree zero, for example. It into degree zero, for example. Again, the one-object case gives you a graded algebra. And for example, if you take the ground field K and you take A, the algebra K delta that squared, the normal one, and then of course you would just get DG vector spaces for now. What's a DG category? So that's a category together. Now we have a DG vector space or chain complex on the morphism set. The morphism set. So we have again associated composition and identities in degree zero, so they are the same. And again, if you have a one-object case, then you get a DG algebra of this case. Okay, for example, if you have a DG algebra, you can also check that the category of DG modules over C, a DGC modules, is a DG category, and also any kind of full subcategory of finally generated free GC modules and so on, I mean presented things can play with that. Okay, if you have a DG category, then Okay, if you have a DG category, then of course what you want to do, so you have a chain complex, you want to take its homology. So let's take the homology category. And slightly different notation than other people use, so this is due to colour, basically. So the homology category of A is the graded category, which has the same objects as your category A. And the morphine space is just, well, you take the homology of the morphism space, which have a DG structure. So, and what you get, of course, if you take the multi-category of a DG category, you end up with a graded category. Category, you end up with a graded category. And then again, this one object case is always going around, of course, then you recover nothing else in the graded homology algebra of your DG algebra. And later, the last example I will look at, a very interesting one, also from an algebraic end topological, which is the DG algebra of co-chains on space. So I hope I don't have time for that. Okay, let me give you some other examples of DG categories which come up in algebraic geometry and in algebraic concentration. In algebraic geometry and an algebraic status. So, yeah, let me just mention briefly: a complex of modules of an algebra is called perfect if it's quasi-isomorphic to a bounded complex of finite generated A modules. And here's a nice example. Keller is one of the pioneers of the use of DG categories in essential and in geometry. So you can take the DG category of perfect complexes of an algebra, and it turns out that the somology category actually recovers the so-called perfect perfect. Category actually recovers the so-called perfect derived category of X. So you really get a link now, derived category of perfect complexes of A. And the grading comes from, and this is actually a triangulated category, so the triangulated category also, because of the shift functor, induces your grading. And if you do this over a steam, say over C, nice maybe, then you can look at the DG category of perfect complexes of Korean sheaves over X. sheaves over x and again what you get is the derived category of perfect context would be perfect category of x. We also would like to use automorphisms because they indicate the symmetries yeah and so you would like to decorate your categories also with some symmetry. So what is that? So again you start with a linear category that's just a linear automorphism. And then of course you can use a linear automorphism of a linear category to produce a graded category by just putting it in the By just putting it in this way. So you take n-fold iteration of t and then put this in the n-tree. So this actually gives you a graded calendar. So you can make a linear category into graded category this way. And c can then, of course, be recovered as a degree zero part of this. And actually t extends to a graded automorphism by this basic trade, which is fine. Okay, so if you had an automorphism T of a DG category A, that of course will then also introduce an automorphism. That of course will then also introduce an automorphism of its homology graded category in this way. So I think I need a little bit more of notation. So given any graded category C, then we can take its identity functor, that's a graded automorphism, but it does not necessarily have to come from a function on the degree zero part. So there's more information there by miss. But if you have, again, a one-object case, so C is a graded algebra, then an automorphism is. C is a graded algebra, then an automorphism is a great automorphism of the graded algebra. So basically, you don't see this in the one-object case. There's one functor we also will use. We call it priority functor. That doesn't do much, but it's quite useful to play and go from one to another, from graded to ungraded, and so on. So the parity functor just is defined as identity functor on objects. And if you have a morphism, you just take minus one to the degree of. Degree of F times F. So now I have to talk about centers, and now we have to be careful which center we really want to mean here. Again, let me start with a linear category first. So if you want, that's a graded category concentrated in degree zero, but just a linear category. Then we can define what's called the Bernstein center. And that's just a by definition, the natural transformation there is a set of natural transformations from the identity functor to itself. From the identity functor to itself. That gives me a commutative algebra onto composition. And for example, if you would take a linear category with one object, an endomorphism algebra A, then this is just a user center we have seen at the very beginning. So it's basically the same thing. Now if you have a graded category, then we want to talk about the graded center. So we want to have a graded vector space. Now we define this, so we have to be more careful here. So we take elements in degree n, these are families. These are families for each object we see of morphisms in degree n, in the n parts, which should be natural in the sense that for each morphism we have this commuting real H. So this takes care of the gradient as well. And this turns out to be a nice center. And it turns out that this graded center is in fact the graded commutative algebra, again using composition morphisms, and the zero part is contained in the Weinstein centrum of the zero part of C. So you can play now with all these kind of So you can play now with all these kind of settings, and it's quite useful. And yeah, it might not necessarily be equal to C is not concentrated. Right, so I also would like to introduce automorphisms to that. So, well, we have a graded category with automorphisms. Then we can cook up a graded center, which is a graded subspace of the graded center, which is decorated by T. So that's just basically the graded vector space, as you can imagine. Vector space, as you can imagine, is a subspace of all those consisting of elements which are compatible with T up to the sine. So you have this hormonal there. And if you take the graded category C with a parity functor, well then you discover the original graded center. So this allows you to play a little bit and decorate things if you want to look at symmetries in some sense. And the first lemma you can then check is not hardware, it's a kind of T-Diris, basically, is Basically, is that you really get what you get. So, if you have a linear category together with an automorphism, then the degree n part of the graded center, which you get out of this, of the graded center, of the associated graded category in the sense I just invoked, of which graded automorphism, is given as a subspace of the natural transformation from the identity functor to the enfold iteration of the automorphism functor. So, basically, just write it in this way. And of course, again, And of course, again, if you think about the Brainstein center, it was defined by all natural transformation of the identity functor. You just recover it by taking T giving the identity functor. So you get that back as well. Right. And if A is a DG category, then of course this graded center is a DG algebra and homology gives a graded algebra. So that's, of course, okay, let's talk about Hoch homology now. So we have the centers and our Hoch homology. That's fairly straightforward. That's fairly straightforward as well, using a little bit of post-simplicial techniques. So, again, let me start with a linear category, and I want to bookkeep the differences between linear, graded, and DG, even though comology is what you define in these settings. So then you can define what is called the Hochschel, or better, Hochschel-Mitchel complex. So Mitchell was somebody who originated this in the 70s. There's a paper with a strange title, Rings with Several Objects, where you can find these constructions for a small category. For a small category, basically. And then what we do here, we have a linear category, and what you get is you get a cosimplicial vector space, and that's a co-chain complex. And the S term is given in this form. So I don't write the differentials here, but this is standard definition. If you look at the classical Haushel complex, it's not in this way. And then you take the Haush-Mitchell chromology of this linear category by taking the chromology of this complex, of this Bautian complex. For S equals zero, of course, you will recover the center of C of the linear category, the Benchstein center. And of course, if you have again a one-object case, you recover everything which I've seen before. Now, you can also introduce coefficients, which is also very important into topology. So, you can introduce automorphisms and coefficients. So, actually, you have the three decorated stuff here, the category, there are automorphisms if you want, and coefficients. So, what is a coefficient system? So, what is a coefficient system? Yeah, the easiest one is just a linear functor from a CC bi-module if you want. So, you just plug it in, and then the last part you just put M instead of C, and then you have Ocean homology with covarisance in such a C C bimodule. And so here's one interesting example maybe, which I should mention. If you have two linear functors between linear categories, then you can set up such a C bimodule. C bi-module M by just declaring mxx from x0 as applying f in the first variable and g in the second. So write this as dfg. And if you take its cohomology, then you get a graded vector space. And in some sense, you might think about this as derived natural transformations from f to g. So some derived version of the natural transformation of f on g if you want to interpret it. If f is identity, then of course you just recover back the classical situation. Back to the classical situation. Okay, so now let's take a graded category. Now we have a graded cosimplicial vector space, so we get an internal grading as well. So we have a coaching complex whose S term is a graded vector space in degree T by this extra term in degree D. And then you can take its Hoch-Mitschelchmology in the same way, and you get a commology D. So the Hoschel-Mitchell cohomology of the graded category is now a graded commutative algebra. Now, a graded commutative algebra, and we introduce some notation which will be useful later. So we know that this is graded, H, H, S, G, C is graded. And so we have an internal grading T, and we normally write this not in this way, but actually in this way. You can imagine later for this practice in course, this would be quite useful. So we write as a negative. That was one thing we have to think about. But it works in this way. And yeah, you can. And um yeah you can also write this one in this form using this functor t I introduced uh and uh this is also quite useful. Okay, so this is just some notation and uh in particular if you take again the zeros part of the graded yeah the zeros part of the post-truth commodity I've written graded but of course you could just to emphasize that I'm not working in the graded case but this is post-chromology what you only what you get now is a graded thing. What you get now is a graded thing, and this is the graded center of C in this case. Right, and again, yeah, maybe I shouldn't say too much, not so much time. So, let me just say that you can introduce automorphisms in the same way, and all works fine. And yeah, so you can play with that as well. And using the parity functor, you can go with blank. Right, now let's take the Digit category and the bimodal. So, I introduced, I could have done this also in the other cases. I could have done this also in the other cases. If you want the coefficients of not just for A, it doesn't really make any difference. What we get now is a bi-complex where the S term is the DG vector space of this form E0 S A, M. So this looks like this. And then of course, you have to define the Haush commodity of this object. And this needs a bit more care. So what you have to do is you have to take the total construction of, and this is basically you together, you take the total construction of E0 A, M. E0 a, m. So this is this object of the byte complex. And then you take, you know, this gives me then a co-chain complex, and you can take its Hoshi-Michel commodity, and you will get what we call the Hoschomitch commodity of the G-cate with some cognitions. So now we have all the players in place. Now, how do we relate, how do we construct the characteristic homomorphism in this general setting? Okay, I think again I have automorphisms here. Let me just ignore that. Let me just ignore that. So, as I said, we want to relate the Hochocromology of a DG category to its very center. And so how do we do this? Well, here's a way of doing this. So if you take the DG category, and maybe you take a bi module again, someone just ignore it, but you have worked sense. Then we have this by complex, as I've just introduced, yeah, before. It's exactly this by complex here. It's exactly this bi complex here. And so what you can do is, uh you you've yeah, you have a bicomplex so you filter it in two ways and you get two spectral sequences, two for one. So first you calculate the internal t-direction, the fraction first. And now we really need the fact that we work over a field and use this Kunis statements, namely we can actually homology commutes with products and we're working with fields, we can actually put the haste inside the homes and we have nice tensor products. The pumps, and we have nice tensor product C, so that works. It will not work if we don't work over fields. Now, this E1 page then, of course, carries a Hochster differential in the S direction, the other direction. And then its cohomology is exactly the Hochschule-Witchdomology of this graded category H dot A, this coefficients in H dot M. So, what you then get, if you identify everything, you get a spectral sequence we call the characteristic spectral sequence. So, for every DG category and every So, for every DG category and every such forcence, you can decorate, you could also put some automorphism if you like. I haven't put it here. You get a spectral sequence, where the E2 term is basically the chromology, the ruled information of the Hoch-Witcher chromology in the graded sense of the graded categories here, and converges to the Hoch-Mitchell chromology of the DG sense. So, that's the spectral sequence. So, that's, of course, a big thing. So that's of course a big thing and uh you can imagine if you have in general it's very hard to well with all spectral sequence you need some way, some fringing to make sure actually you can calculate things. So I will at the end I think we have still two minutes so I can show some examples but so let me just mention this is a right plane spectral sequence of a chromological type of differential is in this way. It's interesting to even look at the one object case as you take a DG algebra Because you take a TG algebra C and some biomodule, then this vector sequence seems to be new. We asked some people, and nobody had ever seen this. In fact, this is quite nice also to make some calculators. So my student is working on this in the one-object case to make some particular calculations in the moment. So, yeah, so let me just say that I wanted to talk about the characteristic homomorphism. How do we get it? Well, the We get it? Well, the Gaussian homology from the Haushel cohomology into the graded center, you can define it by using the actual homomorphism of the spectral sequence. So in the classical case, you would get it as we have defined, but in this case, it's a way of doing this. So I wrote it as a theorem. There's another way of defining it, and then you can show it. But you can also take this as a definition. So if you take a DG category together with an altomorphism, also if you want, then this X-homomorphism Then, this H homomorphism is given as this characteristic homomorphism. So, this is a really homomorphism from the Hochield homology, gradient algebra, to the gradient center. And so, this has all this information. So let's see how we get this. So, if you relate it to the classical case, so what is the actual morphism? So, let me just mention it here. So, yeah, so let's take just for simplicity, so the Vimoding is just. So, the bimoding is just an entity under here. That's just so there's nothing happening here, but you can always decorate that. And what you get is this factor, you take this vector sequence, and the actual morphism is basically this, right? So, what you have to do then is you have to identify this part here with this greater center. That's basically what we have to do. And this gives then this uh this uh homomorphism. By no means we know that this is injective or subjective already here, you can see. Was surjective already here, you can see that many things can happen. So, this is your inclusions injective, but here you have a surjection. So, that already allows us now to ask questions and study questions also in the classical case using this vector sequence. And a very easy corollary follows immediately from this, that the calculator often is subjective whenever this calculistic spectrum sequence degenerates. That's just a triviality because all the differentials are trivial. So, you see, you have this map here, and then the rest is a more. Have this map here, and then the rest is isomorphic. So you see that you get a suggestion. So that is quite useful for many applications. Oh, I should maybe mention the other spectral sequence. We say we get two for one. That's a bit of a trash kind of thing. You can also look at this information. So this actually looks at the homology, a homology of the greater algebra. So it also has, the algebraic setting has some information. Okay, but let's now come to 15 more minutes. Let me say at least. Let me say at least two applications, more in geometry and topology. So you have seen the algebraic applications, and in fact, we can actually prove many of these results, some of these results about injectivity by using the spectral sequence. So to reprove them. Okay, so let's look at the following situation. You have a smooth projected variety, say over C, but this all actually makes sense in general. You have a nice notion of Oshial homology. We're just taking the diagonal. Taking the diagonal and then push forward the structure sheaf, and you can interpret this also as in the derived non-derived category of Core and sheaves over the products. And this gives a nice construction of the Hausschl homology. And in fact, one can show, if you use Keller's machinery, actually what one can show is that actually the Hausschl homology of the derived cadet coming from perfect complex on X, where is the shift functor, is Whereas the shift functor is in fact just recovers this motion commodity of the scheme. So that's a nice way of interpreting the motion commodity of a projector scheme also as Haushamology of a DG category. Of course we all know there's a famous decomposition is not isomorphism of rings. So if somebody asked me about what multiplicative structures this spectrosequence has, we don't know. That's quite tough. For example, this one is not normally a ring isomorphism. It's not normally urine isomorphism. And but anyway, you have this decomposition and you have this tangential homology here, which is quite useful. And now let's look for the very particular case for this example. Let's take algebraic curve, a smooth projective algebraic curve over C. So I only work over C now. Then we know that every current sheaf has a final resolution by a complex of vector buttons. Final resolution by a complex of vector boundaries. So that category is actually just a bounded-derived category of Gorent sheaves for X. And then you can look at the characteristic homomorphism as we have introduced it. And it turns out it behaves very interestingly. It depends only on the genus. So it really depends only on, in some senses, if you want, on the topology of the curve. It turns out it's never an isomorphism. In fact, we have the following result. If the genus is greater than zero, then this characteristic homomorphism index. zero, then this characteristic homomorphism in degree two is not injective. And in the case of g equals zero, so the projective space, then the characteristic homorphism is not surjective in degree one. So all sorts of things can happen. So it's really, so there's a lot of information in this in this cartridge homorphism which one can get out. So actually this generalizes some remarks, some results by Cadarauro and Groufax Flenner. They prove the result of methods for elliptic curves. So Methods for elliptic curves. So let me show you a little bit about how this proof goes. I think we have enough time. So let's take the first part. So the genus of x is greater than zero and the atrocious humor is not injective. You can, first of all, you have to find Z2, the greatest center of dbx. That's actually on the E2 page and is becoming, is the target of the X. And is becoming the target of the atomorphism in the way that we have defined it. But this actually is zero because we're working over a smooth algebraic curve, and the global dimension of x is one in this case. So this is a particular situation, a hydrogen curve, of course. And the carry of coin sheaves is actually a nice algebraic carry. So what's called hereditary. So all the higher x functions vanish. So we have zero there. And then you're basically done because for curves, the HKR decomposition is just an isomorphism of HH2 and H1. Of HH2 and H1. That's all what you have. And if now the genus is one, then you can calculate this, that's known. This is of dimension one, which is greater than zero. And if the genus is greater than two, then this is of dimension 3G minus 3. So in both cases, it's greater than 0. So there's absolutely no chance that the kernel, so in all cases, the kernel of the actual in dimension 2 is not 0, so it's not injective. So there's just So, it's not injective. So, that's just by using this information and using the actual morphism. The second part is a bit so for genus zero. So, we have the projective space and then you can calculate again the HKR decomposition. So, what you get is basically you have something dimension in degree 0, you have dimension 1, in degree 1, you have dimension 3, and 0. Otherwise, then there's nothing. And zero, otherwise, and there's nothing else. And then you can invoke some classical results by Benin-son. The category of current sheaves on X is a derived equivalent to some representations of Rigid data. It's actually given as a category of finite dimensional representation of a finite dimensional algebra, which is just a pass algebra for the conic equivalent. And so that's quite classical. And then the dimension of the center is, of course, nothing over x, it's nothing else than the dimension of the center over. The dimension of the center over for this algebra. So you can just use no algebraic machinery, and of course, the reputation theorists have worked on that. And there is a nice result by Krause and Ye, which shows that this dimension has dimension one and degree zero and infinite in dimension one and degree one. And dimensions infinite in degree one and zero otherwise. And then again, comparison shows that the actual morphism cannot be subjective for T constant. not be subjective for G plus because you have these considerations here. So that's basically an example from algebraic geometry if you want or algebra. Now let me finish, I think I should have enough time, with one example from topology. I mentioned at the beginning the DG algebra of singular co-chains of a topological space with cofrescence in a field K. Now the characteristic spectral sequence we have constructed in this case becomes very simple. I mean somehow what you get is What you get is the Hoch homology of the singular homology converging to the Hochschlich homology of the co-chains of X. And somehow we call this a Moore's spectrosequence because there's some algebraic incarnations of that due to Moore, I think in the 50s or 60s even. And in this case, everything is kind of, yeah, we're in a kind of commutative world. So what happens is, of course, the characteristic X-rayomorphism is very simple. It goes from the singular From the host homology into the singular homology. The host homology of the code chains of X to the singular homology of X. And because of kimonitivity, that's why the center is just the single homology. So basically we have an edge homomorphism, which is just relating the information of the Hush commology of the code chains to the single homology of X. Singular commology of X. So somehow it's kind of nice. You have some purely algebraic thing, and of course, some. thing and of course something which algebraic ecologists are very happy about looking at singular homology. And of course to look at these kinds of situations is not new. For example Cohen and Jones worked this out for an X is simply connected and then the target is signalomology of the free loop space. So in this particular case they studied this in certain instances and they also looked at some spectral sequence which are special cases of that. Some people in Russian homotopy Some people in Russian homotopy worked over that. If you take a closer random manifold, this is also related to string products and string topology. So people were really interested in understanding this homomorphism. And later, a more algebraic topical, quite general statement, still in the connected topological spaces, for the singular topology being of finite type like Courier by Ashley. So there are some algebraic topological literature. Now, let me just mention something. So, we want to use our machinery to understand this situation. So, let me first remind you, you all know this, of course, if you have a, what do I mean by a formal space? So, I will call it the product space formal over the field K, if you have homophobism between CX, A, and of DG algebras, which can use an isomorphism chromology. And the chromology is a DG algebra of trivial function. So, that's what I want to call formal space analysis. That's what I want to call formal space. And of course, there's a variety of interesting examples: Russian epomology sphere, story, compact connect, legal classifying spaces of those bracket H with unsold, compact KL manifolds. To mention just the sum of them. Then actually, you can prove the following result. If x is a formal space over k, over 3k then, the calculus x m was surjective for all t. So that's general statement. So that's general statements. Let me sketch this. So if x is formal, then of course we have a sequence of quasi isomorphism which connect the co-chains with the homology, with the cohomology of this. Now, and we can use invariance of Ho-School homology under quasi-isomorphism of DG algebras. So basically we get an isomorphism of algebras of the Hohschield cohomology of code chains and Hochschlier homology of the singular hormone of x. And then of course this means, nothing else in our terms, that the spectral sequence, the characteristic spectral sequence. That the spectral sequence, the characteristic spectral sequence, or Moore spectral sequence, as we call it in this setting, degenerates. And so the characteristic atrophomorphism then, of course, is again surjective, as we've seen in a more general framework before. So this basically shows you that if you have a formal space, then this characteristic actual morphism is always surjective. So the topological examples are slightly more in the surjectivity realm than the other ones. Now, if the space is not formal, what happens then? What happens then? Can you still have surjectivity? And the answer is yes. And there are several interesting examples. So one is the, say, three-dimensional Heisenberg manifold. So for me, it's just a classifying space of the integral Heisenberg group of unit triangular three by three matrices. That is not formal in short, and it's also not simply connected. And the homology algebra can be calculated and it's uh six-dimensional and as you would expect from Eisenhower. Uh that's what you get. That's what you get. G is not nilpotent, sorry, g is nilpotent, but not abelian. This actually invokes that x cannot be formal. So that's a bold result by Hazigau. But you can actually show, if you make some calculation, that the actual, yeah, so this is actually subjective. So there's a way of showing that even though it's not normal, you can, you know, spectral sequence does not collapse, but you can check that the absolute is subjective. Actionalism is subjective. So, the question is then: what happens for general topological spaces, which are not formal? Can we say anything? Well, at least in characteristic zero for the moment, you can say that. And in fact, we don't need formality. So the characteristic HMO is if k is a field of characteristic zero and access any topological space, then the characteristic etchel morph is surjective for all these t. And yeah, in this case, I'm not discussing. Yeah, in this case, let me just sketch it a little bit. We can replace again over theta of characteristic zero, we can replace a DG algebra CX of co-chains by cross the isomorphic DG algebra that is strictly greater commutative. And then of course we get again isomorphisms, creating the Holschoke homology of the code chains with the Hauschel model of the strictly coordinative algebra and also the singular homologies of C and X. And x. And then we can use Hodge decomposition for Oschelle chromology of commutative ideas in characteristic zero. That's some feature in characteristic zero. So you can write in this form, but I don't really need to know all the pieces. I just need to understand that the zero piece is just a singular homology of x. This comes in due to, I think it's probably for a claw, but you find it in the book of Load A and B. But the homology, actually, if you look at the spectral sequence as we have constructed. If you look at the spectral sequence as we have constructed, survives the Moore spectral sequence. So this means that the HMS has to be subjective. And now the question is: what happens if the characteristic is not zero? So does this actually subjectivity hold in of any field K? So we don't know yet. So that's something my students will and won't. So I think you would invoke uh what you want to invoke is like E infinity structures in this way on the coaches and maybe you can. In this way, on the coach once, and maybe you can have discussion rewards as well. I think I stopped here. Thank you. Yeah, I was wondering if you could give a bit of intuition for this characteristic morphism. So, in terms of deformation theory, so the Hochschield, second Hochschield cohemability, infinitesimal deformation of a category, what does that mean? Deformation of a category, what is that giving us in this center? Yeah, so I don't really know. But you're absolutely right. You should have an interpretation of some kind of deformations of these DG categories. But we haven't really looked at it. That's a good question. In fact, I mean, what we really would like to do is to do this in an A infinity setting. But then the question is, what is the right A infinity center? I mean, there are several candidates for it. But I think you would be able to lift that. And then, of course, you. To lift that. And then, of course, you're probably in business also for people who are interested in practicing geometry because you have the Foucault category and all this kind of thing. Maybe you can do some calculations, I don't know. So, this is basically, in that respect, it's a linear algebra version of something you might want to. But you're absolutely right. So, the deformation theory is something one should look at. So, in that example, where would it map to? Once again. In that example, where would it map to? In which example? You take HH2, say. Take HH2, say. So, which was it? The topological example or the other one? Maybe the other one, sort of the perfect complexes on X. Okay. This one? This one? Yeah? Yeah, or just, you know, maybe any smooth projective X. So you take HH2, the characteristic homomorphism lands you in the second graded component of the graded center. So you want to describe the image? Yeah, I'm wondering what. The image. Yeah, I'm wondering what the image means. I don't know. Is this just for curves, or is this the general? That's just for curves. So where does the characteristic homomorphism map to in the case where X is a projective variety? Ah. Okay, so yeah, basically, if you take any, if you take the from here, so basically what you get is, this is the information you get. This is the information you get. You will take the perfect complexes in general. And of course, in that case, we have made a lot of identification in the case, of course, because things are easy. Of course, you have the constructive. But this is basically the general statement. And I'm sure if you take a particular complex variety, let's say, where you have some more information about the carry of porn cheese and stuff, you might be able to do similar calculations. But we haven't done it. But that's a good question. I mean, so that's a general. So this comes out of the spectral sequence, basically. So you can take this as a definition, even if you want. So just take the actual models and look at the spectral sequence. So there is, yeah, so we have, as I said, we have more questions than answers with that. But I think it gives a calculation a tool which might be useful in certain situations. Did you say at the very end that you had an E30 version of this? We haven't yet. But I think this should go into, I mean, you have the Infinity structures on the on the code chains, right? And that might help you, you have more rigidity to actually prove this result. So the decorators more but but no, we haven't done that. But but no, we haven't done that. I should say there is a very nice paper, and I should mention these names in the algebraic setting. Benjamin Briggs and Vincent Elinas. So I think this is from 1970s. They actually look at the A infinity context, and it's a very nice paper. I don't know why it's still not published so many signs to check the same way, but I really want. Check the same, but I really recommend this is for the one-object case, and there's a lot of the machinery for algebras and representation theory aspects, but they have also some other aspects. So that's what we are trying to see if we can somehow leave this in a more general case. Well, that's the thing, Brian. Have a two-minute break, stretch our relax. Thanks so much. So I just wanted to say thanks. So yeah, I think it's not a dollar by looking at one. So that's already some really exact formality question. But I'm quite sure this is the true answer that it's not. So the topological world is kind of in some sense. So far on silver experiments and totally like oh yeah, the checklist of the side of the check that is terrible. I'm not sure what format there is. I mean, if it's something that is on to call it all. It gives a natural transformation something that's greater than natural transformation. In other words, for every object, you get the self-examples agreeing. I just printed out anything else. That's one of two pages. The other one is thing on regular. The other one is thing on regular software. It's just kind of twice that. But there is a need to erase now, so there's something that ordered the client. It doesn't make sense because we're controlling B and the object E is the same. And then the takes heat to itself shift by n takes by n. So when you get a mass a natural kind of shift.    Somehow what that means is that the starters of one of them will not play ball. It sounds a bit sort of if you know that that object says control structure as a local directory. And uh characteristic form of the game. And if there's any worthful insight about description, I mean how to find the points. It seems to be slightly inner center. But every single one of the texts would be that I don't know what is the same. So this group has it's almost like saying like obstruction theories are covered by people. I think it's stuff that we need because it's changing. I I don't know, I mean, I kind of missed this. So they might be interested in what it was for and changed. Let's say if you match it, it doesn't go down. It gives a it gives a few functions like that. Yeah, and then you say to an element H2O, any object, you may ask a question about it. You may ask, does that object perform along with that? The elements that we're grabbing. For what I have. Which is an which is an X2 quadratic function from the X which I have. Two E. So it would not be that's the image. But in a way, another means instead of the same. So you have a So you have a video if I need to call it. But I guess what I was thinking is that the center, like an element of reasonable support. Objects a degree to the colours of the colours of the colours of the city.
