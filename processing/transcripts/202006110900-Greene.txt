Good morning, John, and good morning from San Francisco. I'm very pleased to be here and to talk. I'm talking, I'm bitching for Andrew. Andrew was supposed to give this talk, but the O is Okinawa. He's on an extended stay in Okinawa right now, where it's the middle of the night, so he's unable to give this talk. To give this talk, so be speaking instead of him. Right, well, moving along then. Okay, I'm talking about the rectangular peg problem. Motivation is a problem by a similar name, which was posed over a century ago by Toplitz. It's called the square peg problem. And it asks whether every asks whether every continuous Jordan curve in the Euclidean plane contains four points at the vertices of a square. And I forgot, I'm going to put these slides on my webpage. You'll be able to see them. I'll have them up there shortly after the talk's over. Right, so it's a curious question, trying to say something about the topology and the geometry of the Euclidean plane. And the geometry of the Euclidean plane. It's still open. You know, it's sort of the lowest dimensional topological geometric problem you could kind of think of. And it's great. It's completely elementary. You can tell the person on the street about it. They'll have an idea of what you're talking about. And it's hard. It's crying out for us to find the right outlook from which to understand it, and we still don't. To understand it, and we still don't. So it's just a fascinating problem, something to turn over from time to time. Right, so I'll set the meaning of the terms now. And I thank Andrew for some contributions to this next slide of depicting some Jordan curves, which are named after Camille Jordan. And so here we see some various figures. Figures, the boundary of the Julia setup at bottom left is where things get really hairy. These are the Jordan curves where we don't really understand whether or not there should be a square peg yet. And here are some inscribed squares. So actually, I have no idea whether that Julia set I just mentioned has an inscribed square, but it looks like it should, right? And Air Jordan has one depicted there. One depicted there. So, what we're looking at, then you know, you don't care about the sides of the squares so much, they can pass between the different sides. The Jordan curve cuts the plane into. And it's just you want the four vertices of the square to lie on the curve. Okay, so that's what the problem asks for. And you might ask why this is a sensible question. And I can't, you know, I have this memory of somebody giving a great kind of intuitive parameter counting argument for why. Argument for why four makes sense is the right number of vertices to be looking for. But yeah, I just can't remember. If anybody has a good intuitive heuristic why that might, why squares might be located on every on every Jordan curve, I'd love to hear, but you can tell me afterward. What I can say is that if you tried to just look for three points, it's too easy. You can find every triangle on any Jordan curve and you can find like, you know, even stronger assertions are possible, but they're just everywhere. Assertions are possible, but they're just everywhere. Whereas five points are too many to request, dissimilar ellipses inscribe dissimilar pentagons, basically because different ellipses have to meet in at most four points. So four is right in between. And that's where things get interesting, which we're familiar with from our line of work. Okay, so some reason to maybe focus on squares. And okay, so some progress. We have not long after the problem was posed, Arnold M gave a solution to the problem for convex curves, smooth ones anyway. And begin to brought some of the ideas that we'll talk about today to bear on the problem that maybe aren't obvious from the problem statement. Looking at some configuration spaces of rhombi in the figure and an easy mod2 homology argument. Argument. With more sophisticated ideas, Schneerlman in the next decade was able to solve the problem for all smooth Jordan curves. I could say more about that. Well, we have this breakout session, so I can just, you know, I can talk more about any of these things then, but I'll just kind of move along quickly now. And he shows actually that a generic smooth curve will contain an odd number of inscribed squares, which is quite striking. It's quite striking. And both Mke and Schnellman, you know, they don't quite need smoothness. I think C2 suffices. And so, you know, there's some tweaking of regularity conditions on the curve you can play with. And that's something people have done over the years. Oh, but what about continuous ones? You see, there's a very tempting approach now that we know that for smooth curves, we can just approximate a given continuous curve as a limit of smooth ones. Each one has a square. ones. Each one has a square inscribed in it, a square peg. And so you just pass to a convergent subsequence of these. Okay, but the issue that nobody's been able to really grapple with is that these squares can just shrink down to points. And there are these figures of like logarithmic spirals that keep people like Rich Schwartz and Terry Tao up at night by their own admission. Oh, this is being recorded. Oh, this is being recorded. Oh, anyway, those are really problem curves. So, we really don't know how to deal with this shrinking problem. And it's not clear whether anything I'll have to say today is going to address this issue. So, then we are going to steer away from the original square peg problem into a relative. And there are lots of relatives of this problem. So, like I mentioned, we could talk about very So, like I mentioned, we could talk about varying the regularity condition on the curve and trying to find inscribed squares. There are higher-dimensional analogs of these questions. I think if you're interested, there's this wonderful survey I think a lot of people by now are aware of by Benjamin Mochka from a few years ago in the notices. It goes through a lot of this progress and some of these related problems, which are very, you know, very cute, very striking. Very cute, very striking. So, those are the variations. And okay, well, now I wanted to talk about more modern progress and take some steps towards the rectangular peg problem. And the first step is an argument due to Herbert Vaughan from the mid-70s. Herbert Vaughan was professor emeritus at Urbana. Professor Emeritus at Urbana-Champaign at the time and gave a talk that was attended by a fellow named Mark Meyerson, in which he presented this result. And what he shows is that you might not be able to locate a square, although we suspect so, but you can at least always find a rectangle in any continuous Jordan curve. And he never wrote it down. It was just in this talk. But you can find a citation in Meyerson's paper, and it's kind of curious. It's kind of curious to imagine what might have happened if this had never gotten just recorded by Meyerson. We would have lost it, or if it would have become as it is now, kind of the sort of thing you hear in the common room or over lunch. It's a proof that it's a resultant proof that a lot of people just seem to know. It's in the air. And I wanted to go through that proof because it lays some important ideas for the ultimate solution of the rectangular peg problem. peg problem. So here's the proof. Here's Baum's proof. And here's the main player. This is the set of unordered points on gamma. Gamma is the Jordan curve. And this space is a Mobius band. And to see that, it does It doesn't matter what choice, I mean, any it'll be homeomorphic for any two choices of Jordan curve, right? So I'm going to pick the unit circle to show that it's a Mobius band. And what I do is I take a pair of points on my circle and I just associate to them the parallelism class of line passing through them. If it's a duplicated point, then I'll take the tangent line to the circle. So there you see five pairs of points that all describe the same parallelism class. Describe the same parallelism class of line. And so we are getting a depiction then of this space as an integral bundle over RP1. And moreover, we can see what its boundary is. Its boundary is the set of duplicated points on the curve. So it has a connected boundary. So that certifies then this is a Mobius band. And there are other ways to see this as well, of course. Polygon identification. The kind of polygon identification picture is a little more familiar. So, there we go. So, this is a key player and what's to follow, this Mobius band. And what Vaughn does is tells us to consider this continuous map that takes a pair of points on a Jordan curve and assigns it firstly the midpoint of those two points and then the distance between them. So, we're getting a map into the upper half space. The upper half space, Euclidean space. And in this proof and in many to follow, it's important to think about what is happening at the boundary. In this case, the boundary, a duplicated point is just going to be sent to a copy of the point, zero. And anything that has the second coordinate zero is coming from a duplicated point. So the image of this mapped in Mobius band hits the bottom of that. Span hits the bottom of the half space in a copy of the Jordan curve. Okay, and at this point, right, we want to understand, well, when could we take the same value on two different pairs of points? And you note that this happens exactly when your pairs of points span diagonals of a rectangle. You know, those two chords, those two line segments, have the same midpoint and the same length. At the same midpoint and the same length, and you get a picture as depicted. This is the important principle that's gonna we're gonna see variations on, which is that the phenomenon we're interested in, inscribed rectangles in our Jordan curve, are parametrized by self-intersections of a map, of this auxiliary map. So, the thing we're after then, we have more tools to study intersections of maps and sets. Maps and sets as on the right. And that's going to be our approach to finding our inscribed rectangles. So that's the idea. And well, how are we going to find a self-intersection of V now? We're not going to use the Jordan curve theorem. We're going to reflect the image of this mapped in Mobius band across the R2 cross zero plane. R2 cross zero plane in R3, and you'll get two Mobius bands glued together into a Klein bottle. It's been mapped in, and it's one-to-one along that plane. And well, you know, any map of the Klein bottling is going to have a self-intersection, and it's, you know, it's going to be to one side or the other. And if it's to the one, it's always to the top, you know, one on the bottom because one on the top. So V gives a point of self-intersection. Intersection, and so we found our inscribed rectangle. Voila, okay, so that's it, lovely. And it leaves you wondering, right? In fact, any map of the Klein bottle to R3 has to contain a lot of self-intersection. If it's an immersion, then there are going to be whole loops of. You know, whole loops of self-intersection. So you're going to get many inscribed rectangles. And the question is just how to quantify that. Can you get a square? And the rectangular peg problem arises as a guiding, you know, as a more pointed question as to how to quantify this. So it asks, So it asks, so we've given up on continuous curves. They're too hard. So we're just looking at smooth curves from now on. Although you could, of course, equally well pose this problem for continuous curves. It's just, and you should, we should think about that next. It's just, we don't know how to approach it quite yet. So we're just going to talk about smooth curves. Take any smooth curve and any rectangle. Can I find a similar rectangle inscribed in that Jordan curve? Curve. And an illustrative example is the ellipse. And what you see depicted are four rectangles that clearly fit into a one-parameter family that sweep through all possible similarity classes. Great. And great. So this rectangle. Great. So this rectangular peg problem, we learned it from Machka's survey and after the fact found a reference to Professor Stewart's case book of mathematical mysteries. It's in there. So we're taking steps towards its solution. Yvonne's step tells us at least there's one rectangle. Here's a step in the wrong direction. In the wrong direction, there was an alleged solution, probably nobody, how many people were really aware of, no, nearly 30 years ago. And it picks up Schnierlman's idea and it tries to take it a little further. If you fix a similarity class of rectangle distinct from the square, we're going to count inscribed rectangles with a sign. And the argument made is that the sign count of these is two. The sign count of these is two, you see. So you're going to get at least two rectangles in that similarity class. But Mochkov's survey thing went through this argument to vet it and found a mistake. Actually, the sign calculation was off. And in fact, the sign count gives zero. So we don't have a good reason then from this framework to understand, to believe that you should get. Any rectangles, let alone two. So it suggests maybe some limits to this kind of classical intersection theory boardism style argument. But, you know, for 17 years, this alleged solution stood. And following Machka's detection of this error, the situation just reverted to what was previously known: that there's a rectangle. Previously, we know that there's a rectangle in any continuous curve. And well, I guess actually, we had Schnierlmann's theorem, right? Schnierlman is about smooth curves. So we know that there are squares, but what about any other rectangles? So that's how things stood then for about a decade. And then something happened, which I think is probably what drew most of this crowd's attention back onto the problem. And this was this remarkable paper, remarkable short paper by Cole Hugelmein. Short paper by Cole Hugelmeier, in which he used Hagar floor homology to make new progress. So, what he showed a couple years ago is that you pick any n greater than or equal to 3, there's a figure down below, you can find a rectangle whose diagonals meet at an integer multiple of pi over n. Here, n is any. Here, n is any natural number greater than or equal to 3. And in particular, when n equals to 3, when n equals to 3, the only integer multiples worth mention are pi over 3 and 2 pi over 3, but those, you know, those describe the same rectangle. Those are complementary angles. No, they're supplementary angles. Closer to the point. So, what that's So, what that says then is you can locate such a rectangle with aspect angle pi by 3, or in other words, aspect ratio, the quotient of its side lengths, square root of 3. I'll see a figure in a moment for n e close to 5. So, this is Hugelmeier's theorem. So, in addition to a square, you can find the rectangle of aspect ratio root 3. You can find one in various You can find one in various finite sets of rectangles parametrized by these various non-negative integers n greater than or equal to three. I'll show you a picture for n equals five, like I said. And it would, yeah, so what's the plan for the talk? We're just marching through these steps toward the solution. And each step, there will be four. It just involves a little shift in perspective each time. And they're all kind of variations on a theme. And they're all kind of variations on a theme, but they're kind of like the outlook's crystallizing, and a new tool is coming in each time. And, you know, once the new framework's in place, it's pretty direct to give the argument what's being asserted. So, you know, we already had Vaughan's idea of parametrizing self-intersection by, or rectangles by self-intersection. Here we're going to see a little variation on that. So, here we go. So, here's Hubemeyer's first great idea. It's to resolve that map. It's to resolve that map we looked at before into a four-dimensional version. So he's telling us pick N and fix it. And instead of mapping into a copy of the complex numbers cross non-negative reals, we'll just map into C cross C. So here's what you do. You just take, it's the midpoint in the first coordinate, just like before. And in the second coordinate, we're taking the 2nth power of the difference. We're taking the 2nth power of the difference as a complex number. Okay, so here's a picture. And what is this picture of? These are five pairs of points. And they are the pre-image. Yeah, this is the pre-image of some point in the target. So they all have these five pairs of points. So, they all have these five pairs of points, all have the same midpoint. And, well, I claim that if you have two pairs of points for which this second coordinate is equal, then really that chord that they define will have the same length. And they're just differing by some multiple of the angle pi by n. And okay, it takes a little bit more work to see them. This map looks pretty clear. And so now it's a similar principle as before. It's a little bit more refined, though. So we are looking just for inscribed rectangles in our curve with an aspect angle in a given set, multiple of pi over n. And these are parameterized by self-intersections of this map, Hn. So So, like for n equals 5 in this picture, I find that I have a self-intersection of h5, then I'm learning that, you know, I have a picture like what's shown here, and two of these pairs of points, two of these pairs of points lie on the curve, right? So, like red and gold, those will give you then four points at the vertices of a rectangle, the aspect angle pi by five, but you don't know if you get red. 5, but you don't know if you get red and gold. Maybe you get red and green. That gives you a rectangle with aspect angle 2π over 5. Okay. So we're trying to find self-intersections of this map H now. It's going to give back the asserted inscribed rectangle. Okay, so we have to work with this map. And the easiest thing perhaps to do is to blow it up in a sense. Instead of having Instead of having, you know, everything kind of, you know, when z and w coincide, when we look at a duplicated point, instead of it just shrinking down to zero, let's record how those points come together. So I'm just going to write out the previous map in polar coordinates, but that offers the advantage that when points coincide, I can do something a little more refined. I can keep the tangent factor to the curve. And this is, you know, still a. Still a smooth map, in right? The curve gamma is smooth, so I can actually blow up. If it were continuous, you know, all bets are off. So this is our blown-up map. Well, again, it's, you know, self-intersections parameterize the rectangles we're after. So that's what we're going to try and do. Find some self-intersection. It's mapping the movie strip into this four-manifold, and it's doing it in a controlled way. It's doing it in a controlled way. So, what you notice now is, like in Vaughan's case, the boundary map to a copy of the Jordan curve in C cross zero. Now, what we're seeing when we're at a duplicated point, we're getting a copy of the Jordan curve in C, but as we go around, we're carrying the tangent direction as we go, and we're actually raising it to a power. So, as we go around the boundary, we're really getting kind of a one. We're really getting kind of a one-two-n curve goes once around gamma and then two n times around in the tangent direction. So it's a non-knot, okay. Well, rather, it is a sorry, it's a core of this open solid torus we're looking at. It has some wrapping. And here's the very clever idea. The boundary is just an open solid torus. So this four-manifold X we're looking at, it's just a thickened. Manifold X, we're looking at just a thickened open solid torus. So I can stick it into anything with a genus. Well, I can stick it into any three-manifold cross, a thickened three-manifold by matching that boundary, an open solid torus, to an open solid torus in the free manifold. Let me just do that in S3 with a Hagar solid torus and put in a little twist when I do so. And carry the Mobius band, this mapped in Mobius band, along as I do so. And what happens? And what happens then is that with that twist inserted, the boundary of this Mobius, this smooth image of a Mobius band, is mapping onto a torus knot inside of S3. It's this one, 2n, 2n minus 1 torus knot. But we know this torus knot doesn't bound a smoothly embedded Mobius band in S3 cross non-negative reals. 1n is at least 3. This is Batson's famous. This is Batson's famous result using, well, precursors to oopsilon and so forth. Non-orientable four-ball genus can be arbitrarily large. I think that's the title of the paper. Great. So this is the result of Hagar fluorhomology getting used. And so whatever this M is, you know, has to self-intersect. And then voila, there's the inscribed rectangle we were after. There it is to the right. There it is to the right. Okay, but what? Oh, I just wanted to say the proof technique doesn't get you the square, sadly. It doesn't seem to, which we know is true, but this proof doesn't really seem to get it. But, okay. Sorry, I need some coffee. Well, so I think that's kind of Josh. Do we really need Hagard Fleur and Smooth here? I mean, you know, like if you're just interested in not bounding a Mobius band, do you really need all this sort of technology? I thought Batson's result was notable because it got that sort of non-orientable genus arbitrarily large. But I mean, weren't there sort of prior techniques to address just the Mobius band? The just the Mobius band, yeah. Peter Feller, did you want to weigh in? Maybe not. Yeah, you might be right, Matt. Yeah, well, Marco Golo says you don't. So, okay. You don't need these bats, and in this case, I think that I mean, that's I think that's what he. That I mean, that's I think that's what he meant, and that sort of jails with my understanding. But thank you. Okay, thanks, Matt. Thanks, Marco, by the way. Sorry, I meant to ask Peter and Marco. Here, let me quickly draft a slide citing your work. Okay, here we go. Here's Feller and Gola. They recovered Hugelmeier's result and the case of a square even for curves obeying a weaker regularity condition and smoothness. And indeed, Smoothness. And indeed, to answer, sorry, I'm up a little earlier than usual, man. Yeah, the proof goes, again, it's a kind of a 4D proof. You use some branch covering and intersection form, but you don't need any infinite dimensional analysis. Certainly no symplectic geometry. What would that be doing here anyway? So great, that's progress, progress. That's progress. Progress. It's always good to know, you know, how much technology you need to get the result you're after. Great. So we have assorted rectangles therein in our smooth Jordan curve. Great. Step two. And now it's going to turn to step three. Step three is, oh, well, what do you know? It's Hugemeyer again. Well, what do you know? It's Hugelmeier again. So, a year later, Hugelmeier kept working. He got a full third of the rectangular peg problem. What do I mean? He says, same setup as before. Now, you know, the set of angles you can look at, you know, you're interested in angles between zero and pi by two. How many of those angles can you guarantee you get an inscribed rectangle? Inscribed rectangle with that aspect angle. And he says you can get at least a third of them. That's his updated theorem. And actually, you can get back the earlier result he proved as well using this technique. It's kind of notable. So, what do we do? The framework shifts just a little bit. Again, we're going to go back to one of those maps. Go back to one of those maps, just look at the one corresponding to n equals 2, which didn't tell us anything before for the reason that it's actually a smooth embedding. You know, you check that it would be parameterizing inscribed rectangles whose angles meet at an angle of pi, but no such rectangle exists. No degeneracy. So this is a smoothly mapped in Mobius now. A smoothly mapped in Mobius band now. Hey, Paolo. And what we do is take this Mobius band and we are going to rotate it. We rotate it by an angle phi in the second coordinate. And let's see, when we do that, the Mobius band rotates. Notice that the boundary of the Mobius band. Notice that the boundary of the Mobisque band, which is a copy of the gamma cross zero, it remains fixed. It's not the, you know, the second coordinate is what's rotating, but at zero it's staying fixed. So getting a new Mobius band, but it shares its boundary with the one we had in the first place. And what's happening is that when we rotate the Mobius band through an angle of 2 feet and look at how it intersects with the original Intersects with the original one in the interior away from the boundary. These intersection points capture inscribed rectangles in gamma with this fixed aspect angle. So that, you know, you check that. So it's a little bit more refined than what we were doing where we were only able to get aspect angles in restricted classes. Now we can get anyone, but you know, we've moved away from. But we've moved away from looking at self-intersection to the intersection of something and its rotation, two things. All right, well, fortunately, we have techniques for studying how that could happen. And now he does something very innovative next. I think of all the different steps I'm going to take, this is kind of the most intriguing step in a sense, because he's going to introduce an ordering on Mobius bands. And this isn't something that, you know, has a lot of, well, something that I've seen before. Lot of something that I've seen before. So, what's the strategy now, of course? You know, you just want to show for a third of the angles that we rotate by, we're getting some intersection. Okay, so here's some innovative idea coming next. I guess we'll blow up as before, which we can do, right? Gamma smooth. Again, all bets are off if the curve is continuous. And now, what he'll tell us to do is look at a pair of rotations of M, and let's suppose. Of M. And let's suppose they have disjoint interiors. You know, we don't believe that could ever happen, but that's what we're trying to prove. So we take a pair of rotations with disjoint interiors. In fact, if they blew up, then their boundaries will be disjoint as well, too. And here's what I was saying. There's a comparison you can make between a pair of disjoint Mobius bands based on essentially based on linking number. I don't have a whole lot. Essentially based on linking number. I don't have a whole lot more to say there. But it's just a variation on a theme. You should think about how cores of these Mobius bands are intersecting. I don't want to go into the details here. Fact, it's an anti-symmetric relation. One rotation is less than the other, if and only if the other is not less than first. And it's a kind of a linking number argument. It's, to me, It's it's to me, it's reminiscent of this. If you have two loops on a ciphert surface that meet once, and you do the ciphert pairing of you know the push-off of one loop with respect to the other or vice versa, those two linking numbers add up to the self-intercept, you know, the intersection on the surface, which is one mod two. So one of them is going to be odd, one of them is going to be even. That's akin to what's happening here. And the next thing, which is really nifty, is you take three rotations. is you take three rotations assumed pairwise disjoint. You can compare any two of them and in fact this ordering this comparison is transitive on those three. So it's given an ordering and anti-symmetry is a linking number argument. Transitivity then since three are involved maybe it's no surprise it's a triple linking number argument. So great. So then equipped with this really innovative Equipped with this really innovative ordering, there's a result in additive combatatorics that comes to the rescue. So, combining this ordering with additive combatatorics, you get the result. And since we've got a little time, maybe to illuminate, let me explain how you actually can get aspect ratio root 3 by this argument as well. So you assume. You assume aspect ratio of root 3 is avoided. So you have your mapped in Mobius band. And since root 3 is avoided, that means if I rotate my Mobius band by 2 pi over 3, it's disjoint in the interior from the original. So I can compare those two, the Mobius band and its rotation by 2 pi over 3. And let's just say that rotation by 2 pi over 3 gives you the Mobius band which is bigger. gives you the Mobius band which is bigger in this ordering. Okay, so I have this Mobius band, its rotation by 2 pi over 3 is less than. Let me rotate those both again by 2 pi over 3. And then I'm learning that the rotation by 2 pi over 3 is less than the rotation by 4 pi over 3. Then I can do that again and learn that the rotation by 4 pi over 3 is less than the thing I started with, the original Mogius band. You see, I get these three rotated Mogius band, each one less than. Rotated Mobius span, each one less than the next in turn in a three cycle, and that's sort of that's contradiction. So, you know, two rotations had to intersect, and that's giving us a rectangle of aspect angle pi over three. So that's how you can get back Hugelmeier version 1.0. And then, with more sophisticated ideas, you get a third, third of all angles. What's very interesting is, you know, we What's very interesting is, you know, we've sort of forgotten about the Jordan curve. I mean, we're encoding it with the Mobius band and then just using some very coarse properties of this Mobius band. And you can look at Mobius bands that have these coarse properties more generally, you know, that they kind of wrap twice around as you go around the boundary in the angular direction. And remarkably, Hugelmeier goes on and gives examples of Mopius bands with these same coarse properties that actually. These same course properties that actually intersect exactly a third of their rotations. So, you know, they're not coming from any Jordan curve, but what they serve to illustrate is the limitation of this proof technique. So, I mean, to me, it's, I mean, there's some really interesting ideas here in this proof that I kind of want to train on some other toy problems I have. But as far as making progress on, Making progress on inscribed rectangles, we're hitting a wall. We really want to know why it is that any two of these rotations should intersect. This result is they're actually not derivable from any gamma or just not known to be. Well, you know, I'm about to solve the rectangular peg problem, so they're not going to be. But um you know you could probably judge that more directly. But at the moment, I couldn't say why not right yeah for Jordan curve. I mean already your intuition suggests you should be able to find at least rectangles with arbitrarily arbitrarily skinny rectangles in any Skinny rectangles in any smooth Jordan curve, I should be able to get very skinny rectangles, although I mean, proving that is a little challenge. You know, very, very small or equivalently, very, very large aspect ratio. And actually, this Mobius band, it doesn't intersect very small rotations of itself. So that's already suggesting why it shouldn't come from a Dordon curve to the Dordon curve. Okay, so how do we make sure these things intersect? So, how do we make sure these things intersect for our Jordan curve? And this is the final step then, doing good on time. Well, we're going to go back to symplectic geometry. So we're shifting perspective. And so here was kind of the key insight ultimately. The idea is, you know, we're working in C cross C. We're talking about, you know, things intersecting things, differing. Intersecting things differing by rotation. Well, I mean, we have a framework that guarantees that. So we thought, well, let's try and put a symplectic form on C cross C so that the Mobius spans Lagrangian and these rotations we're looking at are just Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms. Okay. I mean, it's a non-orientable manifold with boundary, but who cares? We have, in that case, at least something we might believe based on the Arnold Gibbs. We might believe based on the Arnold-Giventhop conjecture, which is that, well, that should make us think then we should get at least two points of intersection between Mobius bands and its rotation. So we should actually really be picking up intersection points. Okay? So we should really be thinking about doing floor homology with these Mobius bands. So that was kind of the direction to steer. And of course, you know, you have to come to graps, come to grips. Come to grips with the fact that Movie Span is non-orientable and has boundary. But ultimately, there was a shortcut around setting that all up. And it comes back to the fact that Klein bottles non-embeddable in a curious way. So this ends up working then. So here's the theorem of me and Andrew. Indeed, any rectangle up to similarity. Any rectangle up to similarity can be found on any smooth Tordon curve. And we're ready for the proof. It's going to look a lot like the earlier proofs. I'll give the proof and I'm going to give you the proof structure and then I'll come back and revisit three key details and elaborate on those. But at least you get the proof structure from the center. So here's what we do. What we do: we take this ugly map, F, and all will be explained. Don't worry about the constants involved, but you see, it's just a variation on things we've looked at already. You know, we've got our Jordan smooth Jordan curve. We're looking at the midpoint of two points on it, and this thing which in the second coordinate, it's got some bells and whistles on it, but it basically looks like a variation on Vaughn's map. I mean, if you take the absolute value, you're getting back Vaughn's map, essentially. It looks like It looks like Hugel Myers as well, right? And when z equals to w, you just set the second coordinate equals to zero, and that defines a smooth map. So as before, we're getting a Mobius band. It's a smooth embedding and it hits C cross zero in a copy of the Jordan curve, like before. And at least away from its boundary. And at least away from its boundary, it is smooth, and it is Lagrangian with respect to the standard symplectic form on C2. So that is a detail that I'll fill in. You could check it just by calculation, but I'll give you a better reason. So, great, we've kind of realized our setup. We take our angle phi. We take our angle phi, and we're going to consider rotating in the second coordinate as before. And just like in the third step, Hugelmeyer's proof that we just went through, we're parametrizing inscribed rectangles just with this slightly adjusted map and intersecting the Mobius band and its rotation by two feet. Okay, so that's the thing we're trying to argue is always non-empty. How are we going to do it? We've got these two Mobius bands coming in together. We've got these two Mobius bands coming in together at their boundary. Common, they have a common boundary. We want to show that they intersect in their interiors. So, this rotation is a symplectomorphism. Like I said, it fixes the boundary. And so, both the Mobius band and its rotation are Mobius bands. They're smooth, they're Lagrangian away from their boundary. And where they meet at the boundary, it's controlled. And I'll And I'll elaborate on what I mean by that. They meet in a controlled enough way that we can smooth their union there. So maybe you think of them coming in together at an angle of two feet. So they're not really smooth there, but you can smooth it. You can smooth it in in a nice, and so that it's nice and Lagrangian, so that this kind of nasty bent annulus collar of that. Collar of that intersection smooths to a nice Lagrangian annulus. And when we do that, then we're getting a nice smooth map in of a Klein bottle, which is Lagrangian everywhere. Great. And then we invoke a very curious result. This is a result from 13 years ago due to Shev Chishin and Nemorovsky. Nemerovsky, they proved there does not exist a smooth Lagrangian embedding of the Klein bottle in standard C2. Wow. So, what does this mean? It means that that smoothed Klein bottle that we're looking at has to self-intersect. And wherever it self-intersects corresponds to the place where M met the rotation by 2 phi, because each of those constituents are themselves embedded. So they have to intersect each other. Have to intersect each other. So that's what I'm saying. They intersect, and therefore we get the inscribed rectangle that we were after. All right. So that, you know, that's the proof. That's the proof aside from why is the Mobius ban Lagrangian? Why can we smooth? And where does this theorem come from? But 15 minutes. We could pause and see, is there any comment on the See, isn't there any comment on the proof structure at least before we talk about some details? So it looks like you actually use smoothness of the Jordan curve, but it looked like maybe Kugelmeier only used C1. Is that correct? Like, is there sort of an a priori equivalence of the two problems? An a priori equivalence? Well, I mean, often in these types of things, you know, like things sort of break down. Like things sort of break down dramatically at C0, but like once you get to C1 or something, things tend to not be any different when you increase the regularity beyond that. And I'm just wondering if that's sort of the case sort of for intuitive reasons here or if there may indeed be a distinction between your result and Kugelmeyer's in the cases where they overlap. I didn't think too hard on it. Hard on it, and uh, maybe invite Marco or Peter to weigh in or anyone. Well, uh, are the examples that Hugemar constructs where he gets exactly one-third of the aspect ratios for things that are not that are not coming from some curve? Are those examples like C1 or C0? They're smooth. Yeah, so I don't know that. Yeah, so I don't know that that really gets at it. Yeah, no, I just haven't thought hard on it. You know, I was happy to. No, it's fine. I mean, I'm happy with smooth personally. So, you know, just curious about it because it seems, I mean, that's sort of the heart of the original problem is really sort of analyzing these types of things. Yeah, I mean, you could wonder, you could ask whether what we're doing works for C1 as well. As well. I've wondered that, but just didn't think hard on it. Okay. All right. So let me supply some details at this point. So why is M Lagrangian? Well, here's the intuition. Well, firstly, our Jordan curve, which is assumed smooth, is Lagrangian. So if I, with respect to the standard symplectic form on C, and so if I take its product, And so if I take its product with itself, I'm getting something which is Lagrangian, like a Lagrangian torus in Cross C with its standard symplectic structure. And so then I can pass to the symmetric product, and I have a natural embedding of my Mobius band without its diagonal in there. And it's Lagrangian, at least away from the diagonal where the symplectic form degenerates. Formed and generates. So that's supposed to make you think, you know, okay, so this thing really should be Lagrangian-Mobius band away from its boundary. And what about that mapping F? It's really just kind of a coordinate. It's just writing out the natural map from C cross C to the symmetric product, which is then identified with C cross C. It's just writing that out explicitly. And we'll need to work with this in the next detail. So let me write it out. In the next detail. So let me write it out. We get it as a composition of these two maps called G and L, which don't correspond to pi or that biholomorphism. They're just a different factorization of F. L is practically an involution. It's a square root of multiplication by a half. And G is really identifying a pair of points which differ in the A pair of points which differ in the angular coordinate by pi and doing a little rescaling. So it's really, you're thinking of g as basically the quotient map from c, it's essentially doing what this projection pi does. Oh, it doesn't matter. The points are just, you know, the first one's a diffeomorphism that rescales the symplectic form. And the second one is smooth and it preserves the symplectic form at least away from C. Symplectic form at least away from C cross zero. So then the composition, this mapped in Mebius strip F is therefore Lagrangian at least away from C cross zero. And backing up a step to, you know, if you don't apply G, then what are we doing? We're looking at L applied to gamma cross zero, gamma cross gamma. And that's just going to be similar. And that's just going to be some Lagrangian torus in C2. That's what we're going to work with next. So, this is why the Matius bands, Lagrangian. Now, why can we smooth? So, this was a bit of a problem. You know, you have these Mobius bands coming in together. What tells you that you can smooth them in a nice Lagrangian way? So, to do that, it's To do that, it seemed best to work with the upper level with these tori. So, what we're going to do is instead of the Mobius span and its rotation by phi, we'll work upstairs with the image under G. We'll take these tori that correspond to gamma cross gamma and its rotation. And we're going to just try and smooth them where they meet along gamma cross, gamma cross. Cross gamma cross zero. We'll try to smooth them in a nice way and then project down phi g. That's where there's actually a little bit more technology available. So they intersect each other cleanly at this curve. Right, they're two-dimensional manifolds in a four-manifold. The best thing you'd hope for is that they're transverse. They're not, but you know, the intersection is the next best thing along this curve that the tangent spaces to the. You know, the tangent spaces to the tangent planes to the Lagrangians along this curve intersect in the tangent line to the curve. So that's a nice situation. That's a nice framework for doing smoothings in the symplectic category. They're rotationally invariant. And so we're going to use a version of the equivariant Weinstein theorem that was put to use in a Potsniak's thesis we were directed to by Poltorovich. We were directed to by Polterovich. Yeah, we asked around with some symplectic geometers as to whether this was possible, and we were very quickly reassured. And Polterovich gave us some very useful pointers looking at Posniak's thesis. So yeah, we apply the Weinstein theorem. And basically, what it's telling us is that we can model the intersection of these Lagrangian pori nearby this clean intersection by this. Clean intersection by this pair of standard-looking Lagrangians inside of this standard-looking symplectic manifold, S1 cross three copies of R. So the way these Lagrangians look inside there, there's this S1 factor, and they're just kind of coming together as like a pair of axes being pushed around a circle, you see. And then the idea is you just smooth those axes into something like a hyperbola, and that's your smoothing. You do it in a rotationally. You do it in a rotationally invariant way, and you smooth those Lagrangians. And that's it. That's it. So it works out. So you're smoothing the tori upstairs in a rotationally invariant way so that then when you project down, it looks like you had your Mobius bands and you just smooth them by their boundary. So that works. Last detail. How deep is this theorem that there are no Lagrangian Klein bottles in C2? I mean, it's kind of, it's a curious question, which surfaces, I mean, you know four space is enough room to embed any closed surface you like, but not quite enough if you insist they be Lagrangian and it's a symplectic and it's symplectic force space. So, yeah, I didn't really know. So, yeah, I didn't really know about these kinds of questions until a couple years ago and learned this neat fact from a lecture Denya Rue had given. So, you know, the classification of which surfaces emit Lagrangian embeddings in C2 was done, except for this one case of the Klein bottle, you know, in the 90s, I think. It had been left open by Givental. And Shevchin and Nemorovsky give very different arguments. I wanted to just tell you Nemorovsky's argument. Zamorovsky's argument. So we'll start off with our Lagrangian Klein model. You're imagining it's, you know, for sake of contradiction, it's embedded in C2, but we'll just take it in an arbitrary symplectic four-manifold to begin. And assume that it's non-homologous, mod2, which would be the case if we were in C2. So we're going to study what could happen. What could happen. And what we'll do is a variation on Luttinger surgery along it, which can be defined for Klein bottles. Usually it's done for Lagrangian tori, but you can do it for Lagrangian Klein bottles. A certain set of Lodinger surgeries. So we do a particular one, and when we do the surgery, we got a new symplectic core manifold and a kind of the core Klein bottle inside of it. And what Nemirovsky argues is actually this new Klein bottle is. Morovsky argues is actually this new Klein bottle is homologically essential in the result. And that's a very pleasant argument involving kind of the Rochlin form and some characteristic glasses. It's very pretty. No real symplectic geometry going on. Nothing deep anyway. Great. And, you know, this Ludinger surgery is done symplectically, and it has this nice feature that away from this compact set where the surgery is done. Compact set where the surgery is done, the four manifolds are symplectomorphic. So they're symplectomorphic at infinity, if you will. Okay, well, this precludes X from having been C2, you see. This is a result of Gromov from his seminal paper on pseudo-homorphic curves. If you have a symplectic four-manifold asymptotic to C2 at infinity, you know, symplectomorphic outside a compact set. Symplectomorphic outside of compacts that it's symplectomorphic. You need to exact, otherwise, you can be blow-up. Excuse me? You need exact, otherwise, it can be a blow-up. Any exact symplectic for manifold, is that right? Yeah. Thank you. Very good. And that said, then, that you see that prohibits X prime from having been That prohibits x prime from having been C2. Otherwise, these would both have been C2, and then we'd have something homologically essential in C2. It doesn't happen. So we're using symplectic geometry at the level of depth of Brumov's theorem. All right. So those are the details. And just a little And just to look beyond, to close, some questions. You can ask many questions. You should look at Mochka's survey if you want some relatives to think about these problems. But we could ask, for example, can we always find a square in a smooth Jordan curve where the vertices appear in the same order around curve and square? There's an on-example. And you can ask the same for rectangles. And our proof just doesn't see cyclic orderings at all. And this might be a case. And this might be a case where actually getting the floor homology machine up and running would maybe address this question. Another, okay, which quadrilaterals can you inscribe in any smooth Jordan curve? We could get all rectangles up to similarity. Can you get anything that fits in a circle? That's open. And And lastly, I'm curious whether, you know, if you look at a smooth Jordan curve and you want to find a square, you can basically find it. And I'm just wondering if there are kind of algorithms or ways to approximate, you know, approximately find the square. And, you know, we have results like this, like for finding, you know, constructive versions of the Bauer fixed point theorem. My favorite proof of which is this: there's this combinatorial analog, which Berner's lemma, about colored triangles in triangulations of the simplex. This gives a reproof of Brouwer's theorem and it gives a method for approximating fixed points. So, I'm wondering whether there might be some kind of combinatorial models available to, you know, you're really thinking of inscribed squares as. Of inscribed squares as now you're thinking of them as intersection points of a Mobius, a Lagrangian Mobius span and its rotation. So I'm just wondering kind of if there are constructive techniques for locating or approximating, you know, when you have a Lagrangian and you disjoint it by, or you don't disjoint it, you move it by a Hamiltonian isotopy. You know you're going to pick up a certain number of intersection points. Is there a way to actually approximately locate those? This is kind of at the heart of what I'm asking. This is kind of at the heart of what I'm asking, and I'm wondering in particular if there's sort of combinatorial models that might be useful in doing so. And that's the talk. Thank you very much. All right. Well, let's give Josh a nice round of applause. And given the late hour, maybe we can defer. Late hour, maybe we can defer the questions to the breakout room. And I guess it's almost 12 noon, which means we would launch into the
