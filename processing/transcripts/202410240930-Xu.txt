And today I will talk about our recent work on this so-called Port Hamiltonian system for the hyperbolic equations. And also, we designed some numerical discretization for that. And this is the joint work with my former PhD student, Xiaoyu Cheng, and she's currently at At Lian University for the postdocs, and two collaborators from the University of Chinese, Professor Jaap Ventwecht and Hans Ziwat. So here is my Chinese name here. So hope our foreigner friends can remember my Chinese name. So here is the outline of my talk. Outline of my talk. So, I will introduce the main motivation and the background for this problem. And the first part, I will introduce the so-called Paul-Hamiltonian formulation for the incompressible O-line equation with a free surface in differential form. And the second part is the discretization part. We use the idea of the port Hamiltonian system to design the system to design a new kind of discontinuous Galaxy method for that. And we also show some numerical results for that. So the evolution of the infinitely different dimensional system, for example, in visit in a fluid mechanic, ideal MHD or Sch√∂dinger equation, they can all discrete type the Can all discrete typed by the Hamiltonian formulations. So, for the Hamiltonian formulation, there are three key points. The first one is the Hamiltonian functional and the total energy of the system and also the Poisson bracket to define its dynamics. So, that is a key point of the Hamiltonian system. So, this is a fundamental framework in the classical mechanisms and also describe the evolution of the system over the time. And the main component, I already mentioned that, it's the total energy of the system. The second is the Poisson bracket. So, for a Hamiltonian system, there is a very nice symmetric symplectic structures and also very important. And also, very important since it is a closed dynamic system, so there is no energy exchange with the environment. And the pulled Hamiltonian system we want to discuss is the so-called open dynamic system. For such kind of system, it is an extension of the Hamiltonian system and will include the interaction with the environment. Interaction with the environment. So, to describe the part Hamiltonian system, we will need the two set of the variables. The so-called state variable, it describes the statement in the energy exchange in the system. And also, so-called port variable, that it means the boundary effect for the system. But the international structure will use the so-called Dirac structure, which will encode the interaction rule and the conservation energy. So we will have a power balance for such a kind of system. So I use this picture to describe how it works for this so-called pod hamtony. Hold home, Tony. So you will see that for the whole system, you actually have the storage from the original system. And with this so-called direct structure, we connect with the this will can be seen as the central over the interaction structure. So it will connect the energy storage and the energy dissipation. The port variables. The port variables will describe the interaction with the environment. So that will in PDE form that will describe by the boundary. So there is the introduction for this so-called Paul Hamiltonian system in the paper of the 2014. So this is many come from the control systems. Control systems. So, the form here we want to use the so-called differential form. So, this is a very extremely clean framework to analyze the PDEs. So, they can work for any dimensional and any coordinate system. So, with this form, it will be easier for us to develop the numerical scheme. The numerical scheme respects all this relationship and also make it more possible to capture the essential physics and mathematics of the PDE because we from the very abstract form of the PDEs. So there is in this talk, I will give two parts. I will give two parts. The first part is the work on the port Hamiltonian formulations for the incompressible Ola equation with a free surface. And the main challenge of this problem is there is nonlinearity and involved the free surface and also have the mixed boundary conditions. So we will give this mainly focused on the mathematical analysis. The mathematical analysis. So, we will mainly focus on give the so-called Hamiltonian formulation and also the pawed Hamiltonian formulation and also present the Poisson bracket in these systems. So, the second part is that we will construct the so-called direct structure on a triangle. Structure on triangulations. With this form, we can easily design the so-called discontinuous Galochan method for the hyperbolic dynamic system with this pot-Hamiltonian formulations. I will give all the details in the second part. So, the first part is that you will see that we consider the incompressed. Consider the incompressible Eula equations with a free surface. So, you this is just a simple picture to show the domain and we have the free boundary and the fixed boundary part. So, for that problems, we will use this so-called differential form. So, this is very very Very abstract form for the audience, but I will give the example for the 3D because in our paper we actually write in this very abstract form, but for the easy understanding, I give the differential form in R3. So for the zero form, it's just a function. And for one form, it's actually a vector. And the two form is also a vector. Two form is also vector in 3D form. So, also we have this product in the differential form. So, you will see in one form the product is just a cross product. And the one form with two form product is just the product for these two vectors. And for the exterior derivative operator for one form, for zero form, it's just the gradient. zero form is just the gradient and for the one form is a curve operator and for the two form is divergence operators so for the old Hamiltonian framework we will have the in inhomogeneous boundary conditions so we will have the exchange energy through the boundaries so this is a very uh strict uh direct Direct the extension for the Hamiltonian system to an open system. So the key point is to use the direct structure to describe this system. So in the analysis part, we actually in the paper, we have three kind of formulation. We use different variables to describe the incompressible ELA equations. So we have the so-called velocity free. The so-called velocity-free surface formulation, and the second is the selenone velocity boundary potential and the free surface. And the third formulation is use velocity, vorticity formulation, boundary potential, and the free surface part. In this talk, I will only present the first one to show the main idea of the The main idea of the analysis. So, the function space here is also we have the so-called differential form Soble function space. But here we will have this is just the divergence-free boundary, divergence-free conditions in the space. So, but we use this all use exterior for. All use exterior for uh derivative here to to to uh to define it. And this is uh this delta is actually the co-derivative term. So this is a classical form for the incompressible O-line equations. So this is quite standard for the free surface describation. And I will change this form to the so-called differential form. Differential form. You can think that this is just the change operator form to describe the equations. But with this form, all this variable is still the same, only the operator with derivative or operator with we have original, we have the gradient, or we have divergence, but all this will. But all this will use the differential form to describe it. So it's the same equation, use different formulation. And for the original Hamiltonian formulation, we will need the so-called Poisson bracket. So to define a Poisson bracket, you need to satisfy this three. To satisfy these three conditions, the first one is the so-called bilinear form, because we have two functions here, and the second one is the scale symmetric, and the third one is Jacobi identities. So the first two properties, the so-called will give us the so-called power conserving properties. And the third one, all All three properties will ensure the consistency and the closure of the abstract structure defined by the Poisson bracket. Actually, the first two properties is easy to prove, but for the Jacobi identity, it's actually much harder than these two properties. So you need to to make sure your structure the bracket is the Poisson bracket you actually need to prove this Jacobi identity so for our formulation for the incompressible Ola equations with velocity part we can define the Poisson bracket like that way so with that the Poisson bracket we can prove that it's bilinear it's scan symmetric and also Scale symmetric and also can prove the Jacobi identities. So, with that form, we can use because the Poisson bracket is defined as that dynamic of the system can be used this form to define the dynamic of the port Hamiltonian, sorry, Hamiltonian system. So, this is just the standard way to define the Standard way to define the Hamiltonian system. And in that case, it's actually corresponding to the homogeneous boundary conditions. That means there is no energy exchange with the environment. So the Hamiltonian is conserved because of the state symmetric. So you automatically get the Hamiltonian conservation here. So, but to describe the so-called HOD Hamiltonian, we need to define what is the so-called direct structure. Desirect structure actually is a subspace of the space of the power variables. So, with these power variables, we require that the direct structure satisfy this so-called the secondal property that's Orthogonal property that means D equal to D orthogonal. This orthogonal means that they have the orthogonal property here for all variables in this subspace. So with this definition, this Dirac structure will be power conserving. You can prove in a mathematical way to prove that. To prove that. So the structure will have the two kinds of variables. The first part is the so-called dynamic variable. You can think that this is actually the original part of the variable evolution part of the equations. And the second part is the so-called equation. Second part is the so-called port variable. This port variable is actually contributed from the boundary effect. So this is the direct structure, the main two part for the definition. And for our case, so we have for this velocity free surface variables formulation, we have the direct structure can be defined in that way. Defined in that way. So the formulation looks not very clear for the audience because it's more abstract form. But you can see it's actually the dynamic of the original system of how to behave here. And this is just come from the boundary effect. So we can prove that with this definition. Prove that with this definition, it is a Dirac structure. It satisfies property of the Dirac structure formulations. So for that case, we can use this Dirac, use this, we can also give the Poisson bracket for these variables because it is mainly from the original Poisson bracket from the original. From the original Hamiltonian formulation, but now you will have the boundary effect here. Originally, there is no boundary effect, and you can define the point Hamiltonian system in that way. So, you will see that for that case, there is an extra term from the boundary, from boundary. So, if it is a homogeneous So, if it is a homogeneous boundary condition, then that term will sorry, then that term will disappear. So it's come back to the original Hamiltonian formulations. So you will also see that if we take this functional, any functional f equal to h, then you will come back to this evolution with. Evolution with the boundary effect. So you will see this is the main difference compared with the Hamiltonian formulation and the port Hamiltonian formulations. So that is what I want to introduce for the incompressible OLA equation. You will see that there is two gradients for the definition of For the definition of the Port Hamiltonian system, the first one is the direct structure, the second one is the Poisson bracket to a corresponding Poisson bracket for these direct structures. So the second part is that we want to use the so-called port Harmitonian idea to introduce the discretization for the Critization for the hypopolic system, but here I will use the linear hyperpolic system as an example to show how it works. So here I also give a differential form for this linear dynamic system. So for that case, you will see that we also use this differential form to differential key form here to describe our space. And all this one. And all these variables is also in this abstract in this differential sub-left space. And the derivative all here is the exterior derivative. But it is a very abstract form here. And I give several examples here. So you will see that it's actually many application equations can be written in the form which. Be written in the form which I gave before. So, for example, the scalar wave equation, any dimensions, and this two-dimensional linear shallow water equation, you can also use this form. And this three-dimensional Maxwell equations and classical Kling-Gauden equations, all these equations actually can all be written in this. Written in this abstract form here. So, for this linear system, we can define the so-called direct structure here. So, this direct structure here, I directly give the formulation here. And the key idea is a key proof here is also we prove this direct structure d equal to d. Structure D equals D orthogonal. So it's the same definition from the original Dirac structures. We can also prove that it has the so-called power conserving property for this Dirac structures. So the corresponding Hamiltonian formulation can also be here. So this is quite standard because this is a linear linear system. So it's easy to get it. So here I just skip it. So for the classical the Hamiltonian for the classical formulation here, so we will see that if we have the boundary effect, so you will see here is also in the boundary effect for the homidony. For the Hamiltonian derivative here. So this is not energy conserved. But if the boundary effect equal to zero, then this is a conservative. Automatically, you get the conservative here. So the second part is actually the key idea for the scheme design. Scheme design. So you see that if we have the two direct structures, so for example, I have gave the picture here. This is DA and DB. Both of them, they are direct structure. So the mathematically is beautifully that the composition of this two direct structure, you can prove that it's still a Dirac structure. So this is a very Structure. So, this is a very key idea for the design of the numerical scheme. So, we can, then we use this idea, you say we have a triangulation in each of the elements. We have the direct structure in each of the elements. So, all these elements can be connected each other with the direct structure. That means we the That means we the composition of the all all this composition of the all direct structure in all of the triangulation part will still direct structure. So this is actually the key idea of this work. So you will see we if we have many of the dirac structures then than all of Structure, then all of the composition is still a direct structure. So, in that way, we can actually give the functional space in the so-called broken sublev space. We have the differential form on each of the elements, then we give the so-called broken sub-left space on each of the elements. So, this is a similar like. Is similar like we have the DG scheme. We give the broken sublife space in each of the elements. So the same way to do that for that. So in that case, we will give the so-called direct structure on these triangulations. So you will see the product here will define Defined in this in each level in each of the elements, then summation together. And also, here we also have the boundary effect for all of the elements, actually. Because for each of the elements, you will have the boundary effect. So you ha have all this boundary effect summation together. Affect summation together. So, but you will see that in that case, because in each of the elements, you will see that means we have the boundary output for our current element, but for the other element, we will have the boundary input part. So, you will have the information from me to the other one. For the other one, it will have the boundary effect to. A boundary effect to receive it. So that means we will have the boundary effect with input and output part. So we can give the definition for this input and output part for our this triangulation form. So actually this is not unique. You can have the parameter here. This parameter theta is actually between zero and Actually, between zero and one, you can actually change it. But this formulation is actually gives a key idea for design the DG scheme. You can think that this is somehow how kind of numerical flux we have the information come from the element and the information from the neighborhood. So, this is a key idea to design the scheme. And we can see that. And we can see that with this tessellation part, we can define this so-called pseudo-poisson bracket because currently this form is more complicated compared with the original form with the PDE case. So we have all this triangulation part for our formulation. So you will see that here we have the Have all the element summation and all the element boundary summation and also the boundary effect here. So we but we can still luckily prove that this formulation is also satisfy the it's the Poisson bracket, it's satisfy the so-called bilinear is a is very simple and Very simple, and the skins we can prove the skin symmetric and also the Jacobi identities. So, Jacobi identity is actually much harder than the original form in the PDE case because we have the more in this cancellation form. And mathematically, we can also prove that we have the exchange. Have the exchange of the energy. So you will see the boundary effect still there, but this all the boundary will be all the boundary effect in the in the discrete form, in the discrete form. But here we can also use the scale symmetric formulation for the Poisson bracket. So with this input and output port Hamiltonian system, we can use this idea to design the numerical scheme because we just choose the finite element space from the so-called broken polynomial differential forms space. We can have the, we can choose, for example, we can choose cancellation is simplex. Cancellation is a simplex. We can also choose the cancellation can be the half a cube. So, of two kinds of elements you can, both of them you can choose for that. For example, I give the example here. So for dimension equal to 2 and i equal to 1 case, I give the with different form you can see there is. form you can see there is the basis function like like that so you you can just use the standard finite element space but all this finite element space is defined in each element because we will use the DG method to define that so it's defined all this basis is defined in the element so here we will So, here we will have the discrete energy exchange here. So, you see that this is automatically come from the tensorization form because the space here, we choose all this final element space is the subspace of the broken Soblef space. So, all these properties will automatically get from the From the part which I mentioned before. And we can get the so-called Port Hamiltonian discontinuous Galokin form. So it's actually quite similar to the standard DG form. And here we will have the numerical flags, numerical flags here. So you will see that. Here. So you will see that this numerical flux is actually very similar. The truth of the numerical flux is very similar to the variables because the idea is that the interaction of the two elements, we use the port variable to connect each other. But for the DG form, we also have the interconnection between two elements with numerical flow. Two elements with numerical flux. So, this is actually the very similar idea. So, we can directly use the port definition of the port variables, then we can automatically get all the good property of the original port harm connecting system. So, then we can automatically prove that this DG scheme has Scheme has its Hamiltonian. And also, we can also have the error analysis for this case. So I will simply show some numerical results for this linear case. And this is for the two-dimensional wave equations. And you will see if we choose. You will see if we choose simpletic root-kuta method, then we the Hamiltoni is conserved. And this is for the shallow water equations. We all have a good convergence for that. And this is also, this is the two-dimensional Klein-Gauden equations. And so for such kind of For such kind of problem, if you have the long time simulation, you will have the fixed error for that. So, if your scheme can have the Hamiltonian conservation, then this fifth error can be much more better for that. And this is a Hamiltonian. It also works for the three-dimensional case because our Dimensional case because our formulation is actually one formulation for all these equations, then you can choose different operators. You can automatically get the scheme for the different equation and for different dimension case. And this is also three-dimensional wave equations. Mark's very also working. So, to conclude, that we have the work for that case, we have the Port Hamiltonian formulations mainly focused on the mathematical analysis for the incompressible Oli equation with a free surface. And we give the three sets of the variable formulation, but here I only present the main idea for the first one. The other one, you can also get it. Also, get it. And based on the Paul Hamiltonian formulation, we also give the design for the so-called discontinuous Galaxy method for that. And there is some reference. The first is for the analysis for that. So it's in the mathematical analysis journal. And the other one is mainly focused on the linear case. But for the non-linear, it's the same. But for the nonlinear is the same, the for the uh for the uh Hamilton port Hamiltonian uh definition is similar, but we we didn't uh finish all the computation. So here I didn't give the all the detail for the linear, nonlinear case, but the idea is actually similar to extend to the nonlinear case. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.
