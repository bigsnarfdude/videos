Chen Hongwu from University of York. And I'm going to do the easiest, present easiest part. He's going to do the technical talk. So that's a very good talk. The previous talk was very good because it's a really nice transition to what we are going to talk about. Just HIV. And just I start with some figures like 39 million persons with HIV, 1.3 new cases worldwide. Right, people remain uninformed about HIV, and there is a decline in common use, especially for the young generation, but also for the retired population. Because what they do when they are retired, they go for to cruise. And going to cruise, they have a lot of fun. And they're not suspicious about HIV. They think that's only about young generations. So there's an increase of HIV for the retirement. Of HIV for the retired people. So if you want to go to a cruise and have fun, use conduct. Ask your grandchildren to use some condos. The HIV attaches CD4 in cells, but I think everybody knows it here. The transmission is mainly through sexual intercourse and body fluids. And actually, one of the last part of your talk was dealing with PREP. It's an extremely effective PREP and An extremely effective preventive means, but still difficult to access, even if it started like in 2016. I will come back to that. There are three stages in the infection. The first one is when you get the infection. Then you have like from two weeks to a few weeks, like having a flu-like symptom. So for you, it's like a flu. Then nothing. Like a few, then nothing for almost 10 to 15 years. So that's the second step. And then the third is EIDS, when you have like a strong symptoms. For a long time, you don't know that you have HIV inside of you unless you get tested. So this is why, for the youngest generation, for the retired people going to cruise, they released They released the PrEP, which is a pill. And the name brand is Truvada, the generic Truvada and Escovi. And the preventive treatment against HIV transmission is available in Canada since 2016, like in France, actually. You have two ways to take it. A daily day, if you know you are going to have sex whenever, like next practition. Your sex life is written. Really nice, or if you are like planning exactly, it's going to be on Saturday evening or something like that, you can take two hours, one peel, two hours before, and then the next two days, one peel, one day after, and one kill after. That's when you plan. So if you don't plan having sex whenever, take it daily. It's better. And what is interesting in the model that we The model that we that was new in the model that every three months to get the prescription renewed, then you have to see the doctor and you have to go through a screening test for everything, HIV, of course, but also the STIs and all the STDs. What is nice is that you can see also whether you have other STDs which reduces the risk of infections. Come infections just to infect other people. The injectable form should be released soon. I mean, when I say soon, it's like six months to one year. It's been approved at the European level, so it should be in France, because I'm talking about France next year. So only two shots a year, instead of one kill a day, two shots a year, and you are protected from HIV for the whole year. Whole year, okay. So, just to show you, like, the difference between the culture and the countries, you can have access to the crap depending on which country, continent you are from. In Northern America or Europe, you can have access easily. In Africa, Southern East countries, it's a little bit more difficult. So, the mathematical approach was the following: you have not Following. You have not a SIR model, but an SI, that was my equation. So once you get infected from HIV, you keep it for life. So there's not remote. You just don't lose anything. So you go from S susceptible to I with a red beta, and they're like the mortality of the population, which is new, which is the same for every compartment. And the new part is the prep part. The prep part because there are like two behavior or kind of decisions that have to be made. One is political or economical decision. Economical because for one month when started, one month treatment, let's say one pill a day, would cost $400 a month. Now in the generics, it's $100 a month. So, if you want to treat the whole country, it's going to cast solid. So, you have to think about who. And the political, because some countries they said, oh, we don't have any people having HIV, gay people don't exist. So, the access to this is different. In France, for instance, they say it's going to be free for everyone who wants to get the PREM. In North America, when studies like, if you want to, you can have access, but you have to. If you want to, you can have access, but you have to claim. So it makes a lot of difference between the functions phi and f, depending on the infected and the susceptible component. And the other thing is like, after three months, which is the tau, you have to decide if you want to renew the treatment and go to the screening and do it again, or just leave it and being susceptible to get HIV again. This is not a political or economical reason, it's like your personal reason. And this personal is like a feeder. And this first group is like theta. Theta, you decide to go back, one minus theta, you just leave it. And that only depends on you, whether you decide or not. So, and then Cr√©goire is going to show a little bit of math after. The model is the following. Nobody, since this morning, just explained it a little bit like how you build a model. You have the compartments, and when you have a compartment, And when you have a compartment, you just see what is coming in and what is going out. So if you take the S compartment above, which is the first line, what is coming in is positive, what is going out is negative. So what is coming is like the new people, young, having a sexual life and deciding to be susceptible. I mean, they don't decide, but they are at risk. And what is living is like the man. And what is leaving is like the minus people dying, which is minus, and leaving by just having some contact with the infected with the red beta, so it's minus. So they leave this arrow. Then they leave this compartment when they decide to go to the prep. So this is this one. So it's depending on phi and f. And the plus is the one minus theta from this compartment going here. Okay, so when we build a model like that, you just So when we build a model like that, you just see what is coming in, what is going out, and this is how you build all for the infected and for the PrEP. For the PrEP, it's a little bit different because it depends on the time here when you started to take the PrEP and you decided to remove. Because you have a loop every six months, you come back, you start from zero. So that's why it's a little bit more complex. Okay? And I let Gregoire talk another. Let Gregoire talk about the rest. Thank you. So this slide is a bit more for my person. But yeah, so for my person, basically we are solving the age structure equation with the method of characteristic. And then just by shifting the variable and introducing a new one, we are able to reduce the model. And so, what is important to see is that the first part of the equation for acceptable is the same, but we are replacing the Same, but we are replacing the term coming from the protective compartment by a delay term. And so this delay is just a manifestation of what is happening in the prep compartment and the time elapsed during the protection phase. And what is really new is that we are able to get rid of the PDE and then to replace with a different sequence but with delay again. So then we apply this model to French data. So we use Truvada data from France, from 2016-2019. And we apply this for the whole MSM population in France, for men who have sex with men. So that's the first result. And and use yeah what I didn't say is that for recruitment rate for phi and f we use a function like ill function and logistic function and so what you can see on the first simulation that we run over 10 years is that at the first site we have the impression that there is no effect of a threat but because we are looking at a very high number population and so the Population, and so the effect is retrieval. And that's why we choose then to look at the incidence. So, as has been said before, like HIV, it's a long-term disease, and so when you are in the infected compartment, you cannot be removed. So, the only way I would say out is through the natural death rate. And so, we look at the incidence, and so we can see on the shape of the curve that there is something happening about. That there is something happening that when you are looking at the scale, like the effect is really low. And so that's why we decided after to look out for smaller number of people, but like the more concern by STI and HIV, and so the high-risk population. Okay, so that's why after. Yeah, for this one, we were just basically plotting the basic population number depending on C. basic production number depending on C, but as I said also before, at the scale of France, the basic correlation number for HIV is less than one, so the effect here is not important. And so I'm moving on the part I was telling you. So about high-risk population. And here we can see that the effect is much more visible, that infected is reaching a plateau. And we compared the two incidence graph that we plot for total population and high-risk population. And you can see that both y-axis and its axis is a very different impact. So you can see that the impact of threat for high-risk population is very important. Population is very important and is a good way to maintain the break. Same, so we also plot the cat plot C, the function for recruitment as a parameter for the basic production number, and so we can derive threshold value where we can say that basic production is less than one. And as a conclusion, what you can say is PrEP is extremely effective when you can have access to that and when the politicians grant it, this access to everyone. And deciding to stop PrEP is not without consequences. That was the previous slide, but if we just predict, if you want to stop having access to PrEP, this comes back up very quickly. comes back up very quickly. And it's mandatory screening for PrEP users may have an important impact of other STI spread because you have this screening every three months, which is like very like a good pace for screening. And the solutions reduced are not. I mean the way to infect other population exists. Political, economical, and population confidence are the keys. And just to show you, like, that's Show you like that's an advertisement in France for like the STIs, just how to detect, and it's like I translated it here: like transmission universal detestation level. So it means like sexually transmitted infection is better to get tested, otherwise we won't let you out. And it's for free for young people under age 26 without any prescription. Any prescription. So you go to the lab, get tested, it's anonymous for free, no prescription. So that's really quick. And that's the people working on this. And before saying thank you, you can just go down. You can go back. You can just like in that order get in the paper. Thank you. Time for one question while I get the next slide up. So when you think about how the shots are going to behave, so talking about every three months you have to go in up the testing rates, et cetera, et cetera. So for the moment, I don't know because I work with a clinician in Lyon and he just told me about the shot is going to be released and it's two. And if they stop the screening, that's going to be not a design. Stop the screening, that's going to be not a disaster, but something that is good is going to stop. So, I hope they're going to keep the screening every three months. Hopefully, because this is a good way to reduce the incidence for the other SCIs. This is really possible. And I was reading that women can also take it, so women can also take it. So, is it very much? Yeah, yeah. So, is it being in France, is it being sort of pushed out to everyone? Yes, but actually, it's most of the time it's. Actually, is most of the time it's for
