Thanks, Alicio, for the introduction, and thank you for giving me the chance to present our work here. So, the title, as you see here, is Imaginary Projections: Real versus Complex Coefficients. So, I start by defining okay, if it works, yes. So, I start by defining what imaginary projection is. Given a polynomial with a Given a polynomial with complex coefficients in n unknowns, the imaginary projection that we denote by IP is just the projection of the variety of p onto its imaginary part. So more precisely, the imaginary projection of P is just a set of solutions of P. So whenever that P vanishes, all the points, and for each point, we project it to its imaginary part by projecting. imaginary part by projecting component-wise to the imaginary part of the complex number. Therefore, instead of Cn, now this is a subset of Rn. And let me just quickly name some of the connections and motivations we have also heard about on the first day and also later. So the first connection is to stable polynomials. A geometric point of view for stable polynomial is that its imaginary projection Projection, the intersection of it, and the positive ortant is empty. And then there are different generalizations of this stable polynomial if we replace the cone by some other cone, if the positive orton by some other cone, or stability with respect to polyball, and so on. Now it comes with a bunch of applications. So, in different branches of mathematics, for example, in combinatorics. Example, in combinatorics, applied algebraic geometry, and so on, and in theoretical computer science, statistical physics, and so on. And then the second connection is to hyperbolic polynomials and hyperbolicity cones. And this one, in a couple of slides, I will explain that how is the correspondence, how it relates to imaginary projection. And the highlight here is hyperbolic programming, of course. And then the last connection. And then the last connection is to amoeba and co-amoeba. So, for amoeba, in the definition, just instead of projecting to the imaginary part coordinate-wise, we take the logarithm of the absolute value. And in co-amoeba, we just take the argument coordinate-wise. And then we see that the complement of all three, so the imaginary projection amoeba and co-amoeba. amoeba and coamoebo, they are all so in their closure, the complement consists of finitely many convex components. Therefore, they define a natural class in recent development of convex algebraic geometry. Okay, now from this slide we need to remember the definition of imaginary projection. Okay, now let's see, let's just have an overview what we want to talk about today. So first we do some warm-up examples. We do some warm-up examples just to see how to compute the imaginary projection for some simple polynomials, and then we review some previously known results. Then I will state our main classification theorem of imaginary projection for complex conics and briefly go through some of the steps of the proof. And then we also compare the case of imaginary projection for real conics that was known before. Connix that was known before, and the complex one. And we provide examples that highlight the differences between real and complex coefficients for conics. And then we let the degree to be higher and then just see some results on the imaginary projection of higher degree bivariate polynomials. All the results that I will present today is from a joint work with Stefan Gardel and Work with Stefan Gardel and Torsten Theobald. All right, so we start with some warm-up examples. At first, we just have one unknown, so it's z. Simply, we can just solve this polynomial. So the solution set is plus minus i. And then if we take the imaginary part of the solution set, we have plus minus one. So this is a subset of R. Now, next example, now we have one more very Now we have one more variable, so you have z1 and z2, but the polynomial this time is linear and the coefficients are real. So this is a general step. We take z1 to be x1 plus i1 and z2 to be x2 plus y2 and xi yi are real. Now that we do the substitution in p, we can write the polynomial p as its real part plus i its imaginary part. So p is zero if and only if these two So, p is zero if and only if these two are zero that are written also here. So, we have a real polynomial system now in xi and yi. And what does it mean that we are looking for imaginary projection? It means that we are looking for which y1 and y2 in r2 there exist some x1 and x2 such that these two polynomials are zero for them. So, here we see that from the second polynomial, we need to have y2 equal minus 2 over 3y1, and then these two are basic. One and then these two are basically independent. So, at any point that we have this equality, then we have some real solution for x1 and x2. So, the imaginary projection is shown in green here. So, the last example is basically the same linear polynomial, just these two coefficients are multiplied by i, so that we have some non-real coefficients. Again, we do the substitution for 0. We do the substitution for Z1 and Z2 and separate the real and imaginary part of the polynomial. And we see that from the beginning, we can see so for any Y1 and Y2 real that we put in this polynomial system, we get some real solutions for X1 and X2. Therefore, the imaginary projection is the whole plane. Now, the last example, we let the leading degree to be one more, but the coefficients are real. And so after substituting. So, after substituting and separating, we have one quadratic polynomial in x1 and x2, and one linear polynomial in x1 and x2. So, of course, the linear one is easier to start with. We want to solve it for x1 and then substitute in the first one and then go further. But to do the substitution, we need to assume that y1 is non-zero. So, let's first check what happens if y1 is actually 0. So, by setting y1 to be 0. So, by setting y1 to be 0, you see that the only values of y2 that give some real x1 and x2 for this system is if y2 is between minus 1 and 1. Therefore, the imaginary projection on y2 axis is this line segment, the green line segment that we see here. Okay, now we can safely assume that y1 is non-zero, so we solve the second polynomial for x1. Second polynomial for x1. We substitute in the first polynomial, clear the denominator, and then we get this polynomial here. So let's again first check what happens if this coefficient here is 0. We can see that if y1 squared is equal to y2 squared, then we get no real solutions for these two polynomials. Therefore, we just exclude it and then assume that y1 squared is not equal to y2 squared. In this case, we can solve this polynomial for x2. We can solve this polynomial for x2 squared, and we see that there exists a real solution for x2 if and only if both numerator and denominator are positive or both are negative. So if both are negative, then there is no intersection in their solution set, but if they are both positive, then their solution set is shown here in green again. So the green subset of R2 that we see here is the imaginary projection of this polynomial P. Okay. And now let's see some previously known results. So always bold Z is just a vector Z1 up to Zn if I missed to write it somewhere. In 2018, Jorgens, Theobald, and DeWolf showed the two following results, that if P is a complex polynomial, then the complement of the closure of image. Complement of the closure of imaginary projection consists of a finite number of convex components. Then they also compute the imaginary projection of some family of polynomials, some families of polynomial, for example, the linear ones. And they show that precisely when the imaginary projection is the whole space. So in the previous slide, we saw two examples of linear polynomials. One was one imaginary projection was the whole space, and one in one it wasn't. It wasn't. And they also show some results on the imaginary projection of multilinear polynomials. And now, the two of them, Jorgens and Thielwald, also show that what is the condition that now the imaginary projection relates to hyperbolicity cones. So if P is real again, and then it is homogeneous, then the components of the complement in imaginary Of the complement in imaginary projection coincide with the hyperbolicity cones of P. And therefore, the components are all unbounded, and then they also find a tight upper bound for the number of components. Then there is this important lemma that again, so the three of them in the same word here, they show that how a fine transformation works with imaginary projection. So, whenever that I say, Projection. So, whenever that I say affine transformation during this talk, I just mean a combination of a real linear transformation and complex translation. So, they show that under real linear transformation, the imaginary projection is transformed by the inverse matrix, and on their complex translation, the imaginary projection is shifted in the inverse direction of the Shifted in the inverse direction of the imaginary part of that vector that we are translating with. So they use this lemma to characterize the imaginary projections of quadratic polynomials with real coefficients, but any number of variables. But now I only focus on two number of unknowns because this is what we are going to generalize to the complex case. So they show that by a fine So, they show that by affine transformation, any real conic can be transformed to one of these eight normal forms. And then for each of these normal forms, they compute the imaginary projection. For example, they show that in the first and in the seventh case, the imaginary projection is the whole plane. And for the rest of them, you can see the imaginary projection here in green. And the defining sets are also written up. Defining sets are also written above. But then now the challenge to take it to complex coefficients is that we cannot get to these eight normal forms by affine transformations on conics with complex coefficients. Therefore, we need a new classification, a new method to make a new classification and find new normal forms. So we do some existing classification. Some existing classification for complex conics, for example, the one by Neusted in 1981, but then they are not for several reasons they are not really proper for the classification of the imaginary projection of conics. So we decide to first just focus on some smaller problems, for example, to think about if the complement of the imaginary projection for a complex conic can have one unbounded and one bounded. Unbounded and one bounded component. So, can the complement look like these two components here? We can always do a transformation and assume that y1 goes through them like this. So, because we didn't observe something like this with real coefficients, we kind of wanted to show that this is not possible. And we do it by looking at the imaginary projection on y1 axis, so this red part here, and we want to check the And we want to check the behavior of imaginary projection on y1 axis when we set y2 equal to. And then we also at the beginning, we just set a to be one. So a is here this coefficient. We can write p, this complex conic of the form az1 squared plus bz1z2 plus cz2 squared plus this. And then all the coefficients are complex. But then we see that to check this behavior of imaginary projection here, we need to separate the cases. So we need to To separate the cases, so we need to based on what is the value of b squared minus 4ac. So, is it real? Is it non-real? Is it positive or negative? But if you look at this expression here, you see that this is exactly, so b squared minus 4ac is exactly the discriminant of these first three terms here that are exactly the degree two part of our polynomial. So, this is what we call the initial form of the polynomial. Initial form of the polynomial p. Whenever that I say initial form, this is the degree two part of the polynomial. And this is a homogeneous polynomial in Z1 and Z2. It has two roots over the complex projective line. Therefore, we see that, okay, this is a good starting point for our classification for the imaginary projection. So there are six possibilities for these two roots, and we'll see them now. And we'll see them now on the next slide. So, here is the main classification theorem. So, P is a complex conic, and then lambda 1 and lambda 2 the roots of its initial form. And then, so we make two main classes for the imaginary projection. So, the first case is if the conic has hyperbolic initial form, and this And this has two classes, and then next case, when we don't have initial form, and the rest of the classes. Now, what are these two classes? So, these are all based on the configuration of the roots of the initial form. If the roots are both real and are equal, then the complement of the imaginary projection is one, two, or three unbounded components. And if they are both real, but they are not equal, then the complement is always four unbounded components. Always four unbounded components. The next general case, so the next big grouping that we have is that so p does not have hyperbolic initial. Now we have the following four classes. The roots are equal and are non-real. Then the imaginary projection is the whole plane. One is real, one is non-real. Then the complement of the imaginary projection is either empty, a single point or a line segment. And the roots are both non-real, and one is equal to the conjugated of the other one. And then the complement is either empty or is one open bounded component. And the last case is if that they are both non-real, they are not equal and they are not conjugated. And then the complement is again either empty or one bounded component. And in particular, we show that in the first five classes. That in the first five classes, we can always so the components of the complement of imaginary projection are always spectrohedral. But this is not necessarily the case for the last class. Okay, now I show this theorem once again in pictures. So we have two main cases. Initial form is hyperbolic, is not hyperbolic. We have two classes here and four classes here. And four classes here. So p is the conic always, lambda are the roots, and then gamma is just some complex number. So, for example, in the first class where we have a double real root, we bring it into one of these two normal forms by affine transformations. And in the second class, to these normal forms, so all the normal forms are written here. And then here come the pictures of their imaginary projection. Their imaginary projection. So, in the first class, we can have like two unbounded components: three, two, one, and here we always have four. And also, these are the imaginary projections for the second case where the initial form is not hyperbolic. So, you see that in the first case, we only have unbounded components. In the second case, we only have bounded components in the complement of imagination. In the complement of imaginary projection. And now, if we put the case R2 aside and look at the imaginary projections that are not R2, we can remember that in the case of, or at least I can remember now, that in the case of real coefficients, we only had six of these types appearings. But now, if we count, we have 10 of them. So we have six here, we have four here. So there are four of them. Here. So there are four of them that did not appear with the real coefficients. So those are exactly these four that you can see here. So one unbounded component was not appearing. A single point or a line segment being the complement of the imaginary projection was not appearing. But the last case maybe is not obvious to see because, okay, this is a bounded component. Here we also have a bounded component. Have a bounded component, but this one is the one that the difference is about the algebraic degree of the boundary curve of the imaginary projection. And this one we'll discuss in detail. So now I will formulate the differences more formally in these two corollaries. So the first one about the arrangement of the components. So over complex, the number of unbounded components in the complement of image. Components in the complement of imaginary projection can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, but over real, it cannot be 1. And the second corollary is about the algebraic degree of the boundary curve. So over complex, the boundary curve of imaginary projection is always algebraic. It's not always algebraic. And then if we look at its Zoriske closure, it can be irreducible. It can be irreducible of degree up to eight. And this bound is tight. But then, over real, the boundary curve is always algebraic. And then the irreducible components do not have degree upper than two. So they are at most to their degree. And we also answer a question that was asked by Jürgen, Steelwald, and DeWolf in their work that they also classified the imaginary. They also classified the imaginary projection for real conics. So they asked that if f is a complex polynomial, then is imaginary projection open if and only if it is Rn? But also they also said, okay, one direction is obvious. But here we have an example that shows that this is not necessarily the case by letting some non-real coefficients there. For example, this appears in our For example, this appears in our class 2b, where we have one real, one non-real root. And so we bring this class into the normal form that is written here. And if we set, if we take gamma to be some real number which is non-zero, then we see that the complement of the imaginary projection is a unique point. Therefore, the imaginary projection is open, but this is not R2. Okay, now. Okay, now I will give one example that highlights the first difference here. Also, sorry, also, we see that what is the spectrohedral structure that we talked about in our main classification theory. So, here we have this polynomial z1 squared plus 2z1, z2 plus z2 squared plus 2i, z2 plus 1. So, here we have some non-real coefficients. One. So here we have some non-real coefficient, and we want to find the imaginary projection. So we see that the initial form has one double real root. And therefore, let's look at our first case once again, what it was. So we could bring it to one of these two normal forms for some complex gamma. And then the second case that is in red here, if gamma is non-real, then it looks like this. It has one unbounded complex. It has one unbounded component in the complement, its imaginary projection. And then also we can show this one component as this with this spectrahedral structure. So it is the set of all y1 and y2 in R2 such that this matrix is positive definite. Okay, now back to our original example. First, what we do is that we use some What we do is that we use some affine transformation using the matrix A and the vector W to bring it to this normal form. Okay, so we see this is exactly like here, A12. And all we need to do to find this, to find a complement of imaginary projection is replacing the imaginary part of gamma by two. And once we do it, then we just need to do the inverse. Then we just need to do the inverse transformation to find what is now that component for our original polynomial. And we do the inverse transformation on y1 and y2, and we get this expression for the complement of imaginary projection of q. Now before I give another example for the second difference between the case of real and complex, let's see the general steps of the proof of the main. Of the proof of the main classification theory. So, first is that we want to find, we want to make the initial form as simple as possible. So, we use a real linear transformation first to simplify the initial form. And once we have the simplified initial form, then we use some complex translation to cancel some of the linear terms or the constant to get to our normal forms. Now it is enough to calculate the Now it is enough to calculate the imaginary projection for each normal form. And as we have seen in warm-up examples, we can substitute for Z1 and Z2, and then we can write the polynomial P as its real part being 0 and imaginary part being 0. So this is a real polynomial system in unknowns x1 and x2 and parameters y1 and y2. And the total degree in x1 and x2. Total degree in x1 and x2 is less than or equal to 2. Now, the question is: that for which parameters y1 and y2 the system has real solutions. There are two main methods that we use here. One is taking the resultant of the two polynomial to get a univariate polynomial. So, we eliminate x1, for example, to have a univariate polynomial in x2. Now, we get a quadratic polynomial in those cases, and then In those cases, and then now discriminantal conditions can tell us that when we have a real root, or in some cases, we also use the fact that if we have a univariate real cubic polynomial, then it always has a real root. But then there are also cases that we can just use the nature of the polynomial system to show that there are real roots. For example, if we can show that one of these polynomials in x1 and x2 is In X1 and X2, is a hyperbola with asymptotes like this, and the other one is a hyperbola with asymptotes like this, then we can claim that there will always be a real intersection point. And these are the cases that we can show, for example, that imaginary projection is R2. Well, in the last class, instead of explicitly representing what is the imaginary projection, we go an indirect way. So we break it into two steps. Into two steps. First, we show that in this case, we cannot have, or in general, we cannot have more than one bounded component. And we show that in our second case, so whenever that there is non-hyperbolic initial form, we cannot have unbounded components. So first look at, let's also look at the first one. We want to show that the complement of the imaginary projection cannot look like this blue subset of R2. Again, as we've seen before. Again, as we have seen before, we do it by looking at the projection of imaginary projection of P on Y1 axis, and then we show that this configuration cannot occur. Therefore, we cannot have the two bounded components as the complement. And next, we show that if the initial form is non-hyper hyperbolic, then the complement. Then the complement never contains an unbounded component. Again, by looking at what happens on one axis for the imaginary projection. And these two together prove the statement of the last class that we have either one bounded component or no bounded component in the complement. Now, let us see one example of this class that is also highlighting the difference, the second difference. The second difference, so the one about algebraic degree between the case of real and complex conics. So let us take the polynomial p to be z1 squared plus i z2 squared plus i over 4. And then we see that by using discriminantal conditions on univariate quartic, so degree 4 polynomials, we get that this subset, the green subset of R2 that is shown here, is the imaginary projection. The defining set is also written here. Set is also written here. Now, the polynomial that is appearing in the defining set is irreducible over a complex of total degree 8 in Y1 and Y2. And its vanishing set is this red subset here. You see that not all parts of this curve is part of the boundary of imaginary projection. So let's see all the properties of imaginary. So let's see all the properties of imaginary projection, not all together here. So the imaginary projection is Euclidean closed. The boundary curve is not Zariski closed, as we see here. So the Zariski closure is defined by this irreducible polynomial and has this component here that is extra. And the degree is 8, as I said. And then, so the complement here is this. So, the complement here is this one unique bounded component around the center here. And in this case, this is not a spectrohedron. And this follows from a characterization of Helton and Vinnikov that we see there is a general line. So if a generic line intersects that goes through the interior of this component, intersects the defining polynomial in less than the degree, so it's 2 less than 8, then we can claim that this is not. We can claim that this is not a spectrohedron. And we also show that, in general, for a complex conic, the algebraic degree of the boundary curve, the irreducible components in the boundary curve cannot go higher than 8. So this is the higher number that we can get and is shown in this example. Okay, so so far up to here, the theorem and the corollaries about the differences are proved, but Are proved, but let us put together all the cases where the imaginary projection is R2. So we have shown that the imaginary projection is R2 if, first of all, we have to have non-hyperbolic initial form, because in our first class, we always had unbounded components in the complement. And in that class, in the first three classes, we have precisely found what are the expressions, what are the normal forms. The expressions, what are the normal forms and what are the conditions on the coefficients that give R2. But in our last class, we do not explicitly know that condition, but we know that there exists some conic in that class that the imaginary projection is R2. For example, here is one example. And so the imaginary projection is R2 because for any y1 and y2 in R2, if we set x1 to be If we set x1 to be minus y2 and x2 to be y1, then p vanishes on that point. Therefore, we can take y1 and y2 to be anything. But we are interested to know that what are all those polynomials. So we want to know that what is exactly the subset of the space of all complex conics that correspond to those conics whose imaginary projection is the whole plane R2. But since we have already found these. But since we have already found these conditions, the problem only reduces to the question that if we have p written in this form, where alpha and gamma are complex and we have such conditions, so alpha is not plus or minus i, then for which gamma and alpha the imaginary projection is R2. So, this is an interesting question that we would like to answer, for example. So, imaginary projection, the classification of imaginary projection is not known for any higher degree or any more number of variables. Even for the case of real coefficients and bivariate cubics, this is not known. But we can let the degree to be arbitrary high and then classify and determine the imaginary projection of some families whose imaginary projection is going. Whose imaging projection is going to be R2. So let us go to a higher degree then. And this is the first result that, and also this is interesting because we use the real classic, real topological classification of plane curves and the method that we used based on initial form to classify the imaginary projection for complex conic to show that how for some families. Show that how for some families of polynomials the imaginary projection is the whole plane. So let's see how and let P be a complex bivariate polynomial and then the degree is odd. Now if the initial form has no real roots then the imaginary projection is the whole plane. And let me sketch the proof. Let d be the degree of the polynomial and since we have no real roots for the initial form we can write it in this form. form we can write it in this form as this product such that none of the alpha j's are real and then so as we have seen so we separate the the real part and the imaginary part we have two real polynomials in x1 and x2 but then in this case we see that the degree does not drop so the degree in x1 and x2 remains d for both polynomials now if we homogenize them with x3 now we Homogenize them with x3. Now we get two real homogeneous polynomials of odd degree in a real projective plane with coordinates x1, x2, and x3. Now let's see one be the defining, be the variety of the first polynomial and c2 the second polynomial. Now we have two degree odd curve in real projective plane. And then the real topological classification of projective curves says Curves says, projective plane curves says that always, if we have an odd degree curve, it contains a pseudo line. And that means that any two such curves will intersect in at least one point in real projective plane. And all we need to show is that that intersection point does not lie at infinity. So, if that intersection point was at infinity, or equivalently, if x3 was zero, then we show that We show that this condition for the initial form implies that this product has to be zero. But then there is no non-zero solution for x1 and x2 here because all alpha j's are non-real. Therefore, the intersection point cannot have x3 equal to 0 and it must be in the affine piece with x3 equal to 1. So we have shown that for any fixed y1 and y2 in R2, the two polynomial, there is a real solution for. Polynomial, there is a real solution for the two polynomials P, the real part and the imaginary part of P in X1 and X2. And this completes the proof. And the last result that I want to show is about how to fix the number of strictly convex components in the complement of imaginary projection as any given number. So before Torsten, yours. Before, Torsen-Jorgens and Torsen-Tilbald showed that for any positive integer k, there exists a polynomial such that its complement consists of at least k strictly convex bounded components, if the coefficients are real. And the method that they used for the proof is that it's basically using the fact that the Is basically using the fact that the imaginary projection of the multiplication of polynomials is taking the union of their imaginary projections. So we have already seen how we can produce the first three imaginary projections. They all come from conic polynomials. And then once we multiply their defining polynomial, we can get such a picture. And this has so here we can after putting these two together, we have one, two, three. Have one, two, three, four unbounded components. And then by this intersection, we get four strictly convex bounded components. But now we also know that if you have only real coefficients, then the imaginary projection is always symmetric with respect to the origin. Therefore, they don't really have the freedom to move this component around. So in their proof, this is always fixed, but they keep increasing the number of. They keep increasing the number of unbounded components here and then at the end intersect it. So the number of these components always jumps like from 0 to 4 to 8 and so on. But if you allow complex non-real coefficients also there, then you can make this component first of all as small as possible and then move it around. So you can break the symmetry and then move it around and intersect it with as many components as you want. So instead of giving a bound, You want. So instead of giving a bound, you can exactly fix that number of strictly convex-bounded components. And yeah, this is how this theorem can be improved by allowing non-real components. But one interesting question also here is that, so what is the optimal degree here? So with this method, the degree that is created for that polynomial is always the number that appears here. For example, if even we For example, if even we want one bound, strictly convex bounded components, we see that we get the degree to be six, but we already see that here with degree two, we can have such component. And so this is interesting that to ask that what is the optimal degree for which we can fix this number. And that was all that I wanted to talk about. Let me summarize. So So, we give a full classification for the imaginary projection of complex conics. We break it into two main cases: if the initial form is hyperbolic or if the initial form is not hyperbolic. So, in the first case, we have two classes, in the second case, four classes, and these six classes are based on the different arrangement of the roots of the initial form. So, in the first case, we only get an unbounded component. unbounded component in the complement of imaginary projection and its number is one their number is one two three or four and in the second case we only get bounded components and their number is zero or one then we compared the imaginary projection of complex and real conics and then we saw that by having by letting non-real coefficients By letting non-real coefficients, we can get an arrangement of the components for the complement of imaginary projection that we do not get for the real case. And then we also talked about the algebraic degree that in the case of complex coefficients, they can have irreducible components in their Zoriski, they may not be algebraic, first of all, and then in their Zoriski closure, there might be irreducible components of degree up to eight, but this degree is. Eight, but this degree is up to two for the real case. And then we also showed that open imaginary projection is not necessarily the whole plane, the whole space, if we alone on real coefficients. And then we went to the higher degree and we presented two results. The first one was using real topological classification of plain careers to show. Of plane curves to show that how the imaginary projection of some families of arbitrarily large-degree polynomials is R2. And then the last result was that how we can fix the number of strictly convex components in the complement of the imaginary projection and how this improves the case of real comics. And thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Masa, for this so nice and clear lecture. Are there any questions for her? Mitya, I have a question. So I'm just curious: are there any results about complete intersections? I don't know. Thanks. Thanks for the nice stuff. You're welcome. I don't know if my co-authors know something about it, please go ahead. But at the moment, no, I don't have something in mind. If I may add a comment. So at the end of my talk, there was a similar question. At the end of my talk, there was a similar question by Muni and Nice asking about imaginary projections of general varieties. So far, we have mainly considered the hypersurface case, so imaginary projection of a single polynomial, because that was already challenging enough. So when you ask about complete intersection, of course, you look at more general varieties, lower dimensional varieties, and the field is wide open. So we don't know very much about that. So, we don't know very much about that. Okay. The problem that you face in general is that you need to understand the number of when there are real solutions of some polynomial systems, right? Yes. Maybe I was late. Can you tell me a little bit about the motivation? me a little bit about the motivation why um so why which part why sorry so why did we generalize the case of imaginary projection for real conics or why in general people are interested in imaginary projection yes yes yes your first one or two so he came late uh as he mentioned you can go back to your slides You can go back to your slides. Yeah, put slides one on and two. This was there. So, because there are, so this is kind of, I think, like previous days, people talked about the applications of stable polynomials and so on. And so, here, for example, let me move. So, we can see that, for example, how imaginary projection is related to stable projection. Projection is related to stable polynomials. Yes, I know, yeah, of course. Yeah, this is, for example, one reason that people are interested in imaginary projection of polynomials or also like the connection that they have to hyperbolic polynomials and so on. Okay, and then you okay, amoebas and co-amoebas, yes, yeah, okay, okay, good. Thank you. Yeah, so maybe I can ask something. I mean, first of all, since this slide is open, I wanted to come back to this anyway. So like these connections to theoretical computer science and statistical physics, can you comment on this? Least what you actually never go through. Well, honestly, no. No, no worries. Yeah, normally it's like we are just interested in solving some math problem and you just do the math, but then you also know that there are applications here and there. But yeah, I mean, personally, I didn't go through the applications to see what they exactly are. But yeah, I don't know. Maybe Dorzhan can comment. I don't know. Maybe George then can comment on this. I don't know. Sorry. I can. I mean, of course, the main connection is to stability. I mean, I see it from that point of view that this is the geometry underlying stability. Therefore, I mean, you have all these things in theoretical computer science, statistical physics, as O mentioned in several talks, the partition function and so on. But in fact, also more recently, there are also like papers from 2012. Like papers from 2020, people look at the imaginary parts of chromatic roots, so at the roots of chromatic polynomials and things like that, which is exactly in the spirit of these things that Marza was talking about. So therefore, they're also like independent of the other sources that were already mentioned earlier talks related to stability, really connections in, say, theoretical computer science communatorics directly focusing on these imagery projections. Projections. So, as a short answer, I can give you a reference. Yeah, yeah, I would be happy to see. Thanks. Okay, maybe I should move from this slide of application to the next one. No, but applications are important. It's good that you have that slide. I came in late too. Good. Do we have any further questions for Maz? Any further questions for Melissa? Maybe just a comment. I mean, I think regarding computer science, I mean, it seems that in certain sub-communities of computer science, semi-definite programming has been very important, at least for approximation algorithms. And so, you know, if one were to speculate, I mean, I'm really just speculating here, but the relationship between semi-definite programming and hyperbolic programming, there's a lot of geometry underlying this. A lot of geometry underlying this, and so at least my suspicion just personally is that if you understand the geometry of these imaginary projections better, then be able to better understand the geometry connecting these different kinds of optimization techniques. I mean, it's again, I'm only speculating and I'm sort of reaching a bit, but I think the better understanding of geometry you have, the more likely you are to be able to make connections between these different algorithms. I know that there's connections between semi-definite programming and hyperbolic programming. Between semi-definite programming and hyperbolic programming, that people want to make, but it's still kind of tenuous. And so, I don't know. I would imagine that a better knowledge of this geometry would help in that direction. Thank you. Sure. Yeah. Okay. Do we have further questions, comments, or greetings? Josue, you want to say something? To say something? Yes, I have a question because here you have discussed possibilities on the number of possibilities for this imaginary projection. Have you ever done any kind of experiments of what happens when you put maybe random coefficients or if there is some structure when you put try to produce examples at random, or you didn't consider this? I think, yes, at some point. I think, yes, at some point we were doing it. That, for example, we got to some conjectures that there is no more than one bounded and so on. Okay, I mean, part of the conjecture was coming from the real case, but part of it also from some experiments. And yeah, if I so, so this is not part of the project, but I think at that point we were observing more like four unbounded components for some reason. Let's let me go to that slide one second. Me go to that slide once again. So, yeah, I think like some something like this was the one that was appearing for some reason the most. But yeah, I mean, that part I don't precisely remember that how we were choosing exactly, first of all, the random coefficients and yeah, well, we did some experiments just to guess to get to some. Just to guess, to get to some of the guess that we wanted to prove at the beginning. And I think, yeah, this was the largest observed among them. There is probably a reason for that. Yeah. Yeah. So thank you very much. Yeah, because this is in the case where the two roots are different, right? Roots are different, right? Which should be different. Roots are different, but they are both real. So maybe, okay, maybe that is the case that we were randomly choosing the real coefficients. Non-real probably then was, okay, yeah. So then that would have been that the one with non-real. Can I not move this? The one with non-real ones probably was like the one bounded component, I guess, then. Or R2.
