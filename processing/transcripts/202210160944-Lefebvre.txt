Yeah, I'm very jealous because I would love to be to be there with you, with you guys. I'm sure you're anxious to go and be in the mountains, so I'll try to do this as quickly as possible. So I'm a professor in biology at UOttawa. So I'm interested in also like the general aspect of diversity in biological systems in general and complex biological systems. Also at the Department of Mathematics at UToronto and in Physics at UATO as well, and the Cranbill-Brain Institute. In the Cranbill Brain Institute. So, that's the menu for my small talk. I just wanted to actually put this light up. I know it's only 20 minutes, so it's not a need for a menu, but just to acknowledge the lab members for making a lot of this work in motion. Scott and Tofik, of course, but Axel Hot, who's not with us today, also contributed quite a bit to this. So, I'll be talking about diversity and stability in general, trying to put a more general perspective of what it means for systems. means for systems to be diverse and stable and resilient, talk about how we could model resilience or test it in complex models that inform us about neural activity and maybe talk about diversity as aesthetic mechanism for controlling resilience. So my personal motivation in these questions, I like to talk about why I'm doing this, is basically that I'm interested in understanding how, you know, why the brain is stable and a resilient system and how does it. Is stable and a resilient system, and how does it self-organize? What is the role of diversity in general? What we can do about it in presence of disease. And the purpose of all of us, I guess, is to close the loop between these complex neural systems across animals with this wealth of experimental data across scales and how to close the loop with modeling. I think it's no surprise that diversity is out there. Okay, so we see it in the nervous system in general, you know, from genes up to organisms. Okay, this is something that is. Mechanisms. Okay, this is something that is spanning across scales. We can think of excitability, we can think of spiking properties, we can think of gene expression, circuit variations, and different motifs of these different things. And if we focus on cell specifically, just like Taufik mentioned, I think, and I can only quote this from the paper from Hascheler and Wu, which is basically that it's no surprise now, it's kind of a given that cells are heterogeneous, that diversity. Are heterogeneous, the diversity is present, but the question becomes: what is the biological function that this diversity could be playing? And speaking of this function, I dare to ask, is there different types of diversity out there in nervous systems? Do you all play the same functional role? How does it influence neural activity in general? Is there such a thing as an optimal level of diversity? How does it impact the resilience of those circumstances? How does it impact the resilience of those circuits in the context of epilepsy? And maybe we can extend some of these concepts to other types of networks that we see in nature, like ecosystems, in aluminum biology departments. That's very interesting for me as well. So in terms of cellular diversity, so just what Tofik mentioned, so we know a lot about how this intrinsic diversity influences the dynamics of these systems already. Okay, so we know that this redundancy promotes resilience and persistence of function. This is work from even. And the persistence of function. This is work from Yves Martyr. Notably, tunes activity and synchrony in these circuits, shapes the pattern formation in excitable media. When you start looking at neural activity and the surface of the cortex, for instance, you know that this diversity will actually play a role in generating patterns of activity, promotes information encoding and optimality of integration. And also, as just Taufik mentioned and Scott, might suppress these adverb transition. Suppress these abrupt transition to synchrony. So, if we just focus on these key words, like the obvious thing that is stemming from all these different things is that there's a clear relationship between diversity and stability. And by stability, I'm talking mathematically about the fact that systems will relax back to their state or maintain some stability over time. And we saw examples of that yesterday. So, the take-home message of my slides, if you want to kind of run in the mountains, run. Slides, if you want to run in the mountains right away, it's just basically: I'm interested in looking at how cell-to-cell or trying to demonstrate mathematically that this intrinsic biophysical diversity is actually a control mechanism from these biological systems and this neural circuit to maintain their resilience in the face of change. And that is a mechanism that could potentially fail in the epilepsy. So, interestingly, so maybe I had to put that slide there because I've learned a lot from the field of macroecology. From the field of macroecology. So, these questions about the role of stability and diversity have been raging for over a century in the field of macroecology through this what we call stability-diversity debate. So, these are examples of a lot of different complex networks that we see in nature that are not specific to the brain. So that's the connectome of sea ligands. We have this seed dispersal network in Africa, and this food web in some river in the US. And the idea is: what is the relationship between the complexity of the network and its stability? Because what Stability because, uh, what has been observed, at least from the modeling perspective, and what we understand about these networks, is that these complex networks seem to lose stability whenever their complexity increase, meaning that we think of their size, the density of their connections, osmantic connections, connection probability, the degree distributions, and things like that typically have a destabilizing effect. Of course, there are variations to that, there are exceptions, there are specific traffic structures that will promote stability, but generally there's still a dilemma there or a question. Still, a dilemma there or a question is why complex networks are so diverse and also so stable over time, and what happens when this is not working and they fail doing so. So, as Taufik explained, the hypothesis is that the seizures that we see in epilepsy is just a manifestation of a failure of a neural circuit to regulate modulatory perturbations and that would predispose them to critical transitions or bifurcations, which is. Critical transitions or bifurcations, which is the mathematical work that Scott also mentioned of transitioning between different qualitatively different states. And so I'm exploring in this work, like that just as biodiversity in ecosystems, which we're all familiar with, and it's kind of a given, that it has an important role to play, that this sort of diversity that we may observe in a neural circuit could enhance its resilience in the face of those potential transitions to CETER. To CETHER. So, in order to do that, I've been interested in how we could interrogate resilience in a network that would also help us understand how these neural circuits work. So, create a model or look at a generic model which would encompass the excitory, inhibitory type models that we've been seeing. So basically those that seize, and try to understand their generic properties so that we would obtain also information about these EI networks. So, just the technical words here, so we created non-near balance EI networks that are exposed to a slowly varying modular fluctuation, okay, that would be continuously interrogating the stability of the system and basically provoke it and see how the system would actually react or adapt to it. So, just briefly, there won't be a lot of equations here, but we would have a slow time scale system, it would be the minute, hours, and even days. And even days would have some form of linear relaxation properties. There would be some recurrent synaptic connections that would be through some form of response functions of the neurons, so the excitability curves that we discussed, some baseline activity that would presumably or possibly be different between cells, and also this slow modulatory fluctuation. We could think of this as neuromodulation, cycles of environmental perturbations like temperature, things like that would be no impact neural circuits function. That would be no impact neural circuits function and also stimuli. And in these types of networks, there are only two types of diversities already we can see and that we can separate. The first one would be topological, basically relating to the connectivity, so the synaptic connectivity of these circuits. So we can think of AI balance, we could think of connection probability, the mean number of neurons, their synaptic coupling, or how varied are these synaptic weights and so on and so forth. I won't go into all the parameters, but there's a different one which is intrinsic plasticity. a different one which is intrinsic plasticity or sorry intrinsic diversity would be a cell-to-cell variation in the excitability properties where we would have different profiles of of response to to input and in this particular case we look at this the variance of this diversity basically so the variance of the inexcitability and look at how it impacts the dynamics of that circuit so just to summarize if we have a homogeneous system that has no such intrinsic diversity it could still express connectivity diversity Express connectivity diversity. So be widely connected in different ways, or have a small world network architecture, have very diversified semantic connection, but the individual cells themselves would be identical to one another with respect to their excitability profile. So we would have the same sort of excitability or response as a function of activation. But if we introduce heterogeneity, so this intrinsic cell-to-cell diversity, then we have basically a profile or a variation. A profile or a variation in the excitability of those different cells, and their responses to perturbation would be widely different. So, if we just examine how the system is actually responding to these perturbations, so that's an example here. So, you see at the top here, we have the response of the network to a slow modular input. So, that's the SFP in blue over here that is fluctuating. And the system is constantly shifting between stability and instability. So, it's basically constantly being shifting or experiencing bifurcation. Shifting or experiencing bifurcations or critical transitions. So we can see this by Leni Apunov exponents. Okay, so this is a measure of a numerical measure of how the system becomes stable and are stable. But basically, the system, in absence of an intrinsic diversity, is basically experiencing a lot of transition between stability and instability. And we could think of this as being seizures here because it's a very long time scale simulation. We can think of hours. This transition to instability could represent transition. Could represent transition to chaos or transition to synchrony or just divergence from the asynchronous state. But basically, the take-home message of this slide is really that homogeneous systems, or the ones that do not have this diversity, are very susceptible to critical transition. They are basically volatile and fragile in that regard. However, if we consider heterogeneous system, when we look at this diversity between different Of this diversity between different profiles of excitability, then all these fluctuations of these transitions in stability are gone. So, here I'm not so interested in whether the system is stable or unstable, but how frequently or if at all it will transition between states of stability. And that's basically a way to think about seizure-like activity, this transition between a synchronous and highly synchronous activity as being a sudden shift in stability. So, this system is we could think of being highly resilient. We could think of being highly resilient in presence of this intrinsic diversity because its stability properties are persistent. So, all right, so that's great. But how is diversity actually doing that? So, that was just a numerical observation. And of course, you know, being a math guy, of course, this is not sufficient. And I had to put some equations and think about what this could mean for epilepsy. So I'm not, you know, don't spend too much time reading this slide, but the take-home message here is. Take-home message here is in the field of macroecology, notably in other complex network fields, we use random matrix theory to address these things. So basically, what it says is that the complex dynamical system, if you compute its Jacobian to examine its stability when its size is becoming large enough, the eigenvalues or the stability points or stability features of that system will actually reside in a disk in the complex plane. In the complex plane. So, if we think of computing all the eigenvalues of this super high-dimensional system, the eigenvalues will fall within a disk. It could be an ellipsoid of different shapes, of course, there are different variations of that, but generally they're contained within a specific region. And we can compute what this region is and locate it and understand how it changes as a function of different current parameters. And here in this particular example, we have all the eigenvalues located in what we call the spectral disk. So that would be a region in A region in the complex plane where all the eigenvalues are contained and would have a radius we call the spectral radius that defines or contains the area where all these eigenvalues are. And of course, we know that if some of those eigenvalues are on the left-hand side or versus the right-hand side, we will observe stability or instability. What I'm interested in is actually the contraction or the changes in the size of this spectral radius. So basically, how it changes as a function of parameters will tell us how susceptible to How susceptible to bifurcation it is. So, if it basically expands, it increases the probability for that circuit to actually, or that system, to experience bifurcations. So, we might look at how the spectral radius changes as a function of this diversity to see what it actually does. So, when we take a homogeneous system, and we just saw that it experiences a lot of transition between instability and instability, so it's poorly resilient, we see Poorly resilient, we see that the spectral radius is actually changing a lot. So it's basically contraction and expansion of the spectral radius, meaning that the eigenvalues are going in and out as this slow modulatory drive is applied to the system. So that's an example of why we see such a poor resilience. Basically, we are constantly having eigenvalues crossing the imaginary axis and causing a wide variety of different types of bifurcation. Transition to synchrony is an example of one of those potential transitions. Those potential transitions. But when we introduce this intrinsic diversity, we start to see something interesting. Basically, that when we have very little modulation or the system is very quiet or it's not being stimulated a lot, the heterogeneity or this intrinsic diversity actually has the effect of enriching the dynamics, so basically expanding the spectral radius. And when the most varied influences are very intense or high amplitude, Are very intense or high amplitude, it has the opposite effect. So it contracts the spectral radius. So it seems that intrinsic diversity in this context, for these, you know, this wide class of complex high-dimensional networks, diversity or intrinsic diversity has the property to tune the stability of the system in a context-dependent way, context being this neuromodulatory or modulatory influences. So basically, that intrinsic cell-to-cell diversity tunes the spectral rate. Cell-to-cell diversity tunes the spectral radius or this spectral radius gamma or the dispersion of eigenvalues in a context-dependent way. So, when we have low mozilla content, diversity enriches neural activity, which kind of makes sense as these cells are becoming more and more diverse in a system to generate activity that is interesting. And when it's high modular content, so it will be intense perturbations, diversity stabilizes neural activity. So, this is what we see here. We have the spectral radius as a function of heterogeneity or intrinsic. Of heterogeneity or intrinsic cell-to-cell diversity, and then we see that as it increases, the spectral radius is basically either decreasing for a high input or increasing for low input. But what's interesting here is that if you just look at where this white arrow here, during this region, there is no difference anymore in the spectral radius between different types or different amplitude of modulation after a certain level of diversity, meaning that as you increase diversity, Meaning that as you increase diversity, if you reach states of diversity that are quite high, the system gradually becomes independent of neuromodulary fluctuations. It gradually stops responding or stopped changing stability as a function of these perturbations. So this is something we can confirm numerically, for instance, in a wide variety of different connectivities, okay, looking at different types of network structures. But the idea is that these transitions rates are basically how frequently the system is shifting. How frequently the system is shifting stability decreases massively as a function of this intrinsic diversity. And here, the diversity is on the vertical axis, okay, and here is the intensity of this neuromodular influences. And within that box, basically, as you increase diversity or heterogeneity between those cells, you enter a region where you have actually no dependence whatsoever with respect to these perturbations, meaning they have no effect on stability anymore. Meaning, they have no effect on stability anymore, and you cannot cause a bifurcation by perturbing the system because the system is simply too diverse. And yeah. So I'm just going to conclude on these last two slides. I talked a lot about intrinsic cell-to-cell variation and excitability and how this kind of shifts the stability of those systems in a very generic model. But what about the connectivity? So in these types of systems, whether you increase the connection process. System, whether you increase the connection probability, the network size, the response gains of the cell, synaptic strength, the number of degree, the degree distribution, the degree heterogeneity, they all increase the spectral radius, meaning that it will all cause an expansion of this cloud of eigenvalues and increasing the probability for bifurcations. So, and bifurcations like seizure-like transitions or something like that. So, basically, all these different connectivity parameters are gradually involved in fragility. Involve in fragility. They're involved in the loss of stability as opposed to this intrinsic as these intrinsic properties. So, what's interesting here is that we might think of this intrinsic cell-to-cell diversity as a compensating mechanism that will stabilize these systems while we observe change in connectivity. Like during learning and development, for instance, the connection probability will increase and the synaptic weights as well, okay, through synaptic plasticity. And this will gradually have an effect of. And this will gradually have an effect of promoting bifurcations. But a way to compensate for that would be to have an increased intrinsic diversity. So that's an example here where you're basically increasing the connection probability in one of those networks. This is a process that takes a lot of time. This would be development or learning or something like that. And you can see that in absence of intrinsic cell-to-cell diversity, the system gradually becomes unstable or becomes prone to bifurcation. So this is the Diapuna. Prone to bifurcation. So, this is the Lyapunov exponent that is basically crossing this critical line zero there. So, and promoting instability. But if we introduce this intrinsic heterogeneity, you repeat the exact same process. And now you have a system that is highly stable and is not experiencing any transitions in stability. And that's the same thing here, where the connection problem is now is fixed, but we're increasing the size of the synaptic weights. And by size here, I'm not saying just purely excited theory or pure unit theory. There's both there, but they're. Both there, but their average strength or average number is increasing. And you can see the same effect. So, without this intrinsic plasticity, you have this constant loss of stability, this susceptibility to these transition. And this is basically gone in presence of intrinsic diversity in these networks. So, anyway, I wanted to conclude that by saying that models sometimes work. And I hope this can help us understand a bit more what is the functional. Understand a bit more what is the functional role in neural circuits, but also in ecosystems as well. Thank you so much.
