Today, I will speak about skew collaborative algebra and the partial algebra. And skew collaborative, in some sense, is the same as S legular. And I also have Basong in the title. So it's fit with the topic of this workshop. And the main object in my talk, in fact, is Atlanta A with positive beauty. And we have a great algebra. And we know if this is We know if this is SQL Cala VL, then this is SQL Calabio. But if this is Calabio, they will not implies this Calabi L. But if this is convictive, so we know there's economic puzzle structure of grow A, and if this collapse out, then Then, just like in geometry, it has a trivial colloidal boundary. So, we can define on this partial structure module derivation, just like a modular vector field. Modular derivation. And for here, it's always Calabia is always skewed. So, we have a La Cayama automorphism. Automorphism same way then I will speak about talk about the relation between the Lacama automorphism and the modular derivation. In fact, if the modular derivation is zero, then it is called the button structure is called a newly modular, and we get the disease identity. Identity. So it fits the general story. Calabio appears as the deformation of newly modular Poisson structure, just like an informal deformation or some other deformation, like this. So let me start from. If R is a coordinated algebra of alpha smooth volarity, then if we take the coordinated algebra of x times x, then we get the coordinate algebra is the enveloping algebra. So it is smooth. And in fact, because r is alpha, it is homologically smooth. It is homologically smooth. And by Haushad, Haus and Lausenberg theorem, we know the Hausschet homology of the algebra is the same as the differential forms, is the same as differential forms. And the Hausschomology of the Adbla is the multi-vector, multi-derivations. In fact, in the most case, it's the R dual. R dual of the differential forms. And to have a tuberculic bound by definition, it's the highest pallet flage forms. It's a rank one free module, length of fully module. And in this case, we call X is calabiality. In general, the highest kind of differential form. The highest color differential forms is just an invertible R module. And in this case, I will explain R as a so-called vertical duality of dimension T. And suppose R is a smooth domain of dimension T, and we know the Horseshoe co-modulate of R is just the Horschl co-modulate of R which coin. The commodity of our waves coefficients in this enveloping algebra. And in this case, if R less than the dimension, this is zero. If I is equal to D, then the Hausschet homology of the altibler is the Haushak homology of R with coefficients in this envelope algebra. So if R is a non-commutative, then there's no modular structure here. There's no module structure here. If R is non-community, but if we use this structure, we get a bimodule structure. We still have a bimodule structure. This just flows a definition because if us is Moose, then the colour of this map of this multiplication is a locally completed intersection. Complete intersection. So we can use localization and two complex for regular sequence. And we can get this one. And so for a general algebra, associated algebra A is said to have a wonderful duality of dimension T. If A is homologic smooth, that means A as a bimodal is a perfect object. And the And the X group from A to A E, if I not equal to D is zero, if I equal to D is evolved by bimodal. And in this case, then we have a twitch boundary duality. That means for any bimodal N, A bimodal N, the Hausschede cohomology of A with coefficients in N is isomorphic to the Horschad. How should the homology of the grade E minus n and with coefficients in this module? And A is called a skew colopy of dimension D. It's just it has one particular duality, but the biomodule is this special one. It's A. It's A. But this means the bimodal structure of this one is the original bimodal phase, just by this our automorphism, by this automorphism. So we can also define graded skill calabia in graded world, but if it's graded calabia, because we have a is a homologically smooth. A is a homological smooth, then A is a huge scale collaborative. But if a graded algebra is greater skill collaborative, it may not be greater collaborator by example of Larry's and Logaspi. And uh so And the the automorphism the automorphism here is called La Crama automorphism of the altible A, but it is not neutral in neutral sense, but the neural up to you know inner automorphism. If the Laca Lacremorphism. Lake L ma automorphism is inla. That means we can take the μA to be identity. The A is called Calabi L. Okay. Then now let's go back to the fielded algebra. As I said here, if A is a positively fielded algebra, then we have an associated created algebra. And as I said, And as I said, if Go A is one divided, then so it's A by a general lifting principle. And if Go A is skew calabial, then so is A. But if A is calabial, we cannot get A is skewed calabial. And the Lacare mode are the morphism of the Automorphism of the fielded algebra for this Lacama automorphism. In fact, we can find the Lacama automorphism of A. And μA induced automorphism in the created level, then the Lacrim automorphism of GOA is the induced automorphism of BOA. For example, both while algebra and enveloping algebra for finite dimensional reagulus are fielded information. I will define a moment of polynomial altibula, of a polynomial adequate. So the polynomial altibula are collaborative. And the white algebra is always colour BL, but the enveloping algebra is usually skewed colour BL with Lacare model often like this. So the enveloping algebra is collaborative if and only if the adjoint, the chase of the adjoint action is always zero, always zero. So now if we suppose Go A is commutative, then Go A is a Poisson structure defined by the commutator, induced by the commutator. If we define this way, but it may be trivial. This was maybe trivial. But if we start from non-community algebra, A. Algebra A, then we can always find a maximal integer L such that the congregator between FnA and the Fm base belongs to F M plus N minus L A. We can find the maximum L. And we get in the same way, we get the Poisson structure. And if A is non-commutative, then this Poisson structure is It's launchable. And you might talk later, I will assume A. In this case, if A is commuted with the colonic passenger, and we call A is a field deformation of Go A. And we here we also assume. Assume Grow A is a community T-dimensional alpha-sumosa algebra with a chiropolitical bond. This just means Grow A is a collabial algebra. And we should move because this is a rank one three module and we assume L that is a so-called Elta is a so-called water form of Goa. So, so Goa is a D-dimensional collaborator A is a D-dimensional secure collaborative with the Lacare model of morphism of mu A. Then I will define Go A as a modular derivation as I said here. And And the main purpose of my talk today is to discuss the relation between the Laca automorphism mu and the model derivation of Go A by using so-called homologic determinants. Okay. And suppose R is a smooth Poisson algebra and of dimension T with And of dimension D, which is the trivial colonial bound, and eta is a water form. Then we can like we can define modular derivation like in geometry. In this way, define a modular derivation by A. Here, HF for L F in R, this is the bracket, Parson bracket defined by the Parson picket. This is a Hamilton. This is a Hamiltonian derivation associated to F. And we use IOTA HF. IOTA HF is the contraction map along the between the different forms. And this is a degree minus one morphism, R morphism, in fact. And we take the computator between the differential of the Of the collective latentials and the contraction map because d is of degree one and this one is of degree minus one. So altogether, this is a degree zero. So if it acts on t differential forms, we still get the t differential forms. So t differential forms is here. So you will Here. So if we divide by T, we get the element in R. So we get a map here, get a map here. And in this way, by eta is both a derivation user in user sense and Poisson derivations, Poisson derivation. And for example, if R is a polynomial algebra, and the fourth colour difference for The fourth color difference form is just the Fourier R module with basis dxi, dx1, dx2, dxn. And if we take the water form is the virtual product of dx1, dx2, dxd, then the modular derivation is like this. And if we I maybe I need this to go back to the needs to go back to the envelope universal adjournment for envelope of the atlas and in general in general uh y1 the collective length form is just a finite projective r module is finite projective r module and so we have a dual basis So we have a dual basis for the finite projective module. Say we take a dx dxi and the dxi star, dxi star is in the dual module of model i is a is a derivation. We can view it as a derivation. But in general case, the general In the general case, the general software y1, the R here is the general dataset of Mohica Y1. It's usually greater than or equal to D. For example, if you take for the sphere, then we get R is greater than D in some cases. This makes things much complicated. And we take S is the subset of such kind D tuple integers, I D is let's say R. If R is equal to D, then this has only one choice is one, two, D. And two simple. And to simplify the notation for any i in the set, I use dxi to be these different forms, and dxi star to be the derivation. Then dxi, dx star, is a dual basis for the highest differential forms. And using the dual basis, we can get some formula. We get we can get some formula. Maybe I see this. And we can describe the model derivation of R with disable tools, a fixed volume by the dual basis of the highest color differential forms. So, like this. If R is a polylong algebra, then we get the Polynomial algebra, then we get the one we showed before. I will use this formula later. This is the formula for the modular television. And by the way, if R is a Poisson algebra, which moves with two colonial boundaries, as I said, the Phi Ada, the model derivation is a Poisson derivation. And for any Poisson, And for any partial modular M and we can twist the Parcel modular, the structure of M by this way. This is the original Poisson structure of M. And at another term, finding on A and modify X. And we get a new Poisson structure on M. Then we call this a twister model structure of M by Phi A. And by using this twister, we can show a twister. We can show a twisted parallel duality between host like this in the Poisson world. But I will not dispute this in this world. So if A is collaborative, and we know this X group is isomorphic to this one. And if I take a generate pi here, and we go. Pi here, and then we call pi is a mu A tension volume of A. And then I have pi A equals mu A acting on mu A of A pi, like this. So pi A minus pi A, where I use the neutral computator, the notation here, then it's this one. It's mu A of A minus A. This one. And I also use delta A is the user derivation operated by the computator. And H A bar is the Hamiltonian equation. And the main ideas is here. We use the homologic. We use the homologic determinant as a bridge to connect you to connect the Lacare model automorphism UA and the model derivations of phi eta in this way. In the first step, I will show the identity map minus mu way. In fact, if we want to show A is collapsed below, we want to show mu way. So we want to show μA is the identity. So the identity mass mu A acting on A is just the homologic determinant of this derivation. I will show later, I will define. And the second step, the modular derivation acting on a bar is in fact the homologic determinant of this Hamiltonian derivation derivation. And the third step is I will show the relation between these two homological determinants. So I will remind you or define the homologic determinant. And let H in general, let H be a hof algebra acting. H acting acting on atripla A, acting on at A. Then H, we are acting on the Hausschet coaching complex. Then H, we are acting on the Hausher convolution here. In general, if we use this is a culture complex, Hausscher coaching complex with coefficients in this special biomodule, AAE. Then we have a very accurate action like this. Okay, but I will show you in group case, in group case, g acting on the linear map F, we get a still get a linear map like this one. So this looks much nice. Looks much nice. And for the action or television action, it's like this one. It's generally like this one. And if I would take oh, okay. Well, s suppose the pi I lost to pi suppose pi is the mu A to some modiform of A. Mu intrusion modiform of A, then we have this one. So we get because the Hoffa acting on the Haushat coaching complex, then it will be acting on the Horshat homology, then it will be acting on pi. It will act on pi. Okay. And because this one is a This one is a fluid A module of length one. So Hi acting on pi is equal to A pi for some A, for some A, unique A in A. So we get a map for any H in the whole field, H acting on the touch volume form. Now we get A, unique A here. We divide denoted by phi H. So we get a map. So we get a map, get a map. And this map is, in fact, almost homologic determinant defined by James and people, if the atom is legular or skill colour. And by the H action on this one, and we get the phi TH pi is like this, and we get. is like this and we get the formula here and from this one and we can we we can get phi is in this this convolution algebra convolution algebra because h is half algebra a is algebra and we lack the convolution in this here and phi is in fact in this algebra is convolution in one invertible and we can find the inverse of of this phi Of this phi. And we define the whole function on A, the homologic determinant of Hashar A is by the phi inverse the convolution inverse of phi. We will use the inverse just to coincide. To coincide with the definition of petri oxygen GMs and iron and the GMs. And this definition also, in some sense, agrees with the most definition. So now I will go to the step one to Step one to prove this one. We view this derivation as we use the Hoffati block as the analog artifact of this one-dimensional diatom generated by this television. And if we use the bar construction to compute the Haushard homology, then as I said, this is a bimodule, a bimodule. So we have a commutator action of all the bimodule, we have a commutator action. And we also, delta A deduation acting on A as a hop action, then it acts on the Then it acts on the Harshad homology, Harsha coaching complex. And because it keeps all the structure, so it will induce the structure, edge structure on the homology. And in fact, these two actions are homotopic while this map, while this map. Well, this map. So we get these two maps induce the same map on the Haushader homology. That means the commutator action on the bimodule is just equal to the half-faction on this oshermost group. So mu A of A minus A pi is say pi is equal to the commutator. So computator let me use the computator acting on pi, and it's equal to delta A acting on pi. So we use the formula of by inverse, then we get the homologic determinant of delta A pi is equal to this one, delta i acting on pi, we take minus here. So So we get the first proposition is the difference of μA with identity is just the homologic determinant of this derivation, this derivation. And the second step we consider the relation between Relation between the motor derivation and the homologic determinant of force integrated at level. Now, suppose R is grow A is a D-dimensional alpha-smooth convenient at as I said before, the Hausshutt homology is just a kinetic flesh form by HKRCL. And the Hausshutt homology And the Haushad cohomology is the dual, the dual of the calendar form. It's in fact those multi-derivations. So we have two isomorphism here. That's from HKRCLM. And we have a capital doctor from this I will define later. And here we have a contraction map. Contraction map. In general case, this is a commutative diagram. And I will use this use both this as a hop action. Then this isomorphism are atomorphism. This isomorphism are atomorphisms. Yeah, here I need I need edges, co-community. edge is a co-community then this is the edge is edge morphism so these maps are all edge morphisms but if it's not it may not be atomorphic but in any case if we will use group algebra or uh universal emblematic both are these algebra are both co-commutative so Okay. This is a general definition of construction map, a flow convention geometry is the same, same thing. And we define the actual model structure on the color differential forms. And here's maybe I speak here. Here's the cup of the button. Here's a cup of product. You just remember that the diagonal is atomorphic. And okay. In HKR theorem, as I said, if R smooth, if R smooth, we have this isomorphism. The isomorphism we can write explicitly here. And if H is commutative acting on R, then we can. Acting on R, then we can get this edge motor isomorphism. And also for the hush of homology and derivation, this original isomorphism is also edge modular isomorphism. So if R, if If R, if H acting on R, R is Go A, then as I said in the second, maybe second page, the hospital chromology of R is this X group, is this X group, and this X group, this is the derivation, there is a dual of collective large forms. So we let add is that generate. We let add is the generator of the DR. So we use at the star, the dual of the generator of this one. So this is a free module of length one. And these are also H module isomorphism. And we still use ADD as the generator of HDRR, the Doesher Homology group. Homology group. And when you add the star, it is the generator here, and STL, you know that the generator of this Husserl homology, that's the generator of this homology group is generated by 8 star. And now the homologic determinant can be computed by this generator at the star. And okay. In fact, the H active at a star, as I define this phi H at a star, and we use the formula, we can get if R is a smooth convoluted valuable with true economic bound, and the homologic determinant of a co-convolutive half-atrible acting on R is given by this one. Given by this one, by this, and in fact, by the key factor, I said before, we take a special case and we start from H acting on eta here and as eta start here, and we go this way, and we go this way, then we can get. The H active eta, we take capital product of Lauris, while in the eta star, we get the homologic determinant of H. Okay, I've skipped. And in fact, I knew the, well, I've skipped the lemma as a to obligate. And we can compute the homologic determinant of any derivation, of any derivation is just the divergence of theta is just the homologic is just the phi eta, the model derivation. So we get we get the homological if we take theta equal to this Hamiltonian derivation and we get this is this one and this is just the model derivations model derivation acting on R so we get this one so model derivations is also related to is equal to the homologic determinant of the Hamiltonian derivations this is the second But this is a second step. And for the third step, in fact, I want to show this homologic terminal is in Goa, in greater. This homological is in A. And if we take the principle of this map, then This but then they are same. Then they are same. So for this, we, because A is a fielded algebra, so AE, the envelope algebra is also fielded, fielded algebra. So we take a field, field a projective resolution of A as an AE bi module, such that the associated grade. That the associated graded complex is the finite generated gladiator logic of Go A, that's bimodulus. And in fact, we can also take the bar construction. No, no, field project solution is just complex in the field field category and all. Category and all the QI is a field projective. Okay. And we can take, for example, that means for any in greater level, you have a finite generated graded electron. We can lift the two-way field electron for starisk filtration, but here we is bounded below filtration. So we can always get this one. One and the bar resolution is also fielded because A is filtered. So we get two filtered resolution of A at the A bimodule. So they are homo topical equivalent in the fielded category. And if we take the graded complex, they are also homologous. They are also homologically equivalent. And by the way, the graded complex of the Barlet solution of A is isomorphic to the Barlet solution of Go A. Let's say we will identify these two adversaries. So if we take the If we take the home functor acting on the homotopic equivalent complex, because home functor is additive functor, we get that this is also homotopic equivalent. And because the big home is just, I take a fielded home. This is take a neutral home. But if Q is finitely generated, the field of home is the is the. Is the neutral home here, but here it might be different. But in any case, because these are all homotopy equivalent, so this is homotopic equivalent. So if we wanted to compute the Haushed convergence group, we can use this fielded complex because they are homologous equivalent. And for this fielded complex, then we have. Then we have a spectral sequence to compute the X group. And we also compute, because bar conjunction is big, too big, but we have this one. This is more because we can also find some special sequence between these two. So we can prove this the ISX group is flow A to A is if I put not equal to D as zero. And if I equal to D, I compare this one user fielded home, filtered home. This is a bounded below filtration. And okay. And by using some switch sequence, okay. Now, and also because this is the n storm in the bar construction, a tensor n minus two. And because this is fielded AE module, this one is fielded. module this one is field a e module so we have a natural isomorphism from from the collated home to to this uh the collated of field home to the uh atrial home we have isomorphisms here and we can check uh because data age has off action acting on acting on the The bar construction or acting on the culture complex and data also acting on the field home. And we can also take the corresponding related map. And here we use the Hamiltonian derivation action. And we can check this is commutative. It's always commutative. Always competitive. So if okay, this is the bar construction, bar construction. This is a graded level. It's a graded level bar construction. And I said that these are isomorphism by isomorphism. And this is a Hamiltonian derivation action. This is derivation action. And we take the corresponding collateral map. And this is isomorphism between two complexes. So they induce the same map on the homologic group. So this is delta A acting on Delta A acting on pi or acting on the homological generator of this homological and we take the principal simple and and this is what we take we take sorry and here this induces And here, this induces action on the partial homology group. And we get this one. And this one is just the homologic determinant acting on A. We take the principal idea. This is just the homological of this Hamiltonian derivation. Derivation. So we get the difference of the identity map and the mu A of A. If we take the principal symbol, it's the principal symbol of the homologic determinant of delta A. By step three, this is the homologic determinant of this one. Of this one, and by step two is the minus phi the active A. So then we connect the mu A and the phi at. Okay. So if in fact the length for any A belongs to F and A, then we can get this these are equal. So new way, So mu A minus identity A acting on F L minus one A is zero, zero. And so for any A in F L A, mu A acting on A minus A is a voltage derivations acting on by L. If we consider the field algebra generated by F1A, you just UG sense or because F L is always greater than equal to one. So F1 is belongs to F L A. If the item is generated by F one, then if if okay if phi ida is equal to zero, that's a new modular, then this is Unimodule, then this is equal to identity acting on the generator's identity. So it's identity. So if the parson structure ongoing is new remote, that means the model derivations is zero. Then A is kind of. And if the involveable element of A is contained in F0A, for example, Go A is a domain in this case, then Go A is unimodular. Go A is newly modular and only if A is tabial. And if we go back to the envelope algebra case, this will explain the choice of the joint function of the adjustment case. Okay. And we can apply this to length of differential operators. And why I apply is the length of different of a whole space. So if we take D-dimensional alpha smooth domain of a field, and we consider that rings of differentials operate in closet sense. Velocity sets velocity sets. Then the partial character on the graded level of the lens differential effects in Newton model. So the lens of differential over a smooth domain is a two-dimensional dimensional carburetor at first. And this can be that can be obtained for other. Can be obtained for other results by amulo by developing the complex, but we use this by we develop this stuff. Okay, that's all I want to say. Thank you very much.
