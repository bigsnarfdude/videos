Okay. So the work I'm going to present today is essentially given in the title that the brain tumors are organized as active pneumatic liquid crystals in vitro in 2D and also in vivo in 3D. And at the end, I will elaborate a bit on what novel therapeutic opportunities. On what novel therapeutic opportunities this provides. So, this is work done mainly by Anna Argento, a PhD student in my lab, together with a long-term collaborator, Dr. Carlos Planck Mercader from the Theoretical Physics Department at the Institut Curie in Paris. And most recently, a very fruitful collaboration with Daniel Beller from the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Johns. Department of Physics and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. So, first, I'm going to give you a motivation, what work we have done in defining a little bit what malignant brain tumors or gliomas are, and how we can use the new information to treat these tumors. So, these are some of the worst tumors in human. worst tumors in humans um they represent a high percentage of all malignant brain tumors um in the malignant brain tumors from the brain malignant brain tumors and they come from stem cells although the exact origin is still uh discussed by various groups and they they are treated now with basic uh resective surgery which takes out Surgery, which takes out the tumor, radiotherapy, and temosolamide. In spite of that, and much research over the last 50 to 70 years, the two-year survival from the most malignant glioblastoma is approximately 5%. So very, very aggressive tumors. Why do the brain tumors kill? Because as you can see in an MRI on the left, they attack vital brain regions that they destroyed. That they destroyed, and they're very fast-growing. Down here at the right, you see a tumor which was detected in a control MRI, and a little bit over two months later, there was this huge tumor that you see here on the right, indicated by the red arrow. So, why are these tumors so difficult to treat? So difficult to treat. Here you have three images of a horizontal MRI through the brain of a patient with a brain, with a glioblastoma. And in this particular mode, you see the outline of the tumor. In the middle, you see again not only the central part of the tumor, but you also see this white area, which is called enhancement. And this is supposed to be the leading. Supposed to be the leading edge of the tumor where you have the most aggressive cells. What is shown in the middle image is actually can be seen during surgery by the neurosurgeon, and that is all taken out. However, the problem you see in the right-hand image, in this particular MRI mode, what you see, you see a huge area of this huge white area, which is This huge white area, which is called area of edema or area of infiltration. This area is completely invisible to the surgeon, and this is where the cells are located that will eventually reconstitute the original tumor on the borders of the resection cavity. So, just a little bit of what we have done in order to treat this tumor. We developed a combined cytotoxic and immune stimulatory gene. And immune stimulatory gene therapy that was tested in primary adult high-grade gliomas. We did a phase one, first in human trial, and this was published in the Lancet Oncology at the end of last year. I'm not going to go into detail, but just this is part of the motivation for our work that the findings from the trial were really positive. We had six patients that survived more than two years, three patients. Two years, three patients that survived more than three years, two patients survived more than four years, and one patient survived just over five years. So, compared to the historical controls, these are very encouraging results. And now we're expanding these trials by combining our gene therapy with various, for example, immune modulators, checkpoint inhibitors, inhibitors of MDSCs. Inhibitors of MDSCs, which are inhibitory immune cells, etc. So, this is the motivation. This is the clinical challenge. How can we model these tumors in mice? So, the way we model gliomas in rodents is by using this system called the Sleeping Beauty Transposon System. And basically, what this is, this is the sleeping Basically, what this is, this is the sleeping beauty transposase, and we transfect these plasmids, encoding the transposase, together with plasmids encoding the genes that we want to use to create the tumor. In this case, for example, NRAS, shRNA for ATRX, and shRNA for p53. So we inject, as you see here in the middle of the slide, we inject. Of the slide, we inject these plasmids into the lateral ventricle of postnatal day one PUPs. And the idea is that we hit the subventricular stem cells, and therefore we transfer them with these plasmids, and then this will create the tumor. We can monitor the growth of the tumor, as you see down here on the left, with luciferase imaging. Imaging and depending on the plasmids we transfect into the subventricular zone, we have tumors which are very aggressive, which are shown here with a red line in the survival curve, or we have tumors that are less aggressive and where the animals survive much longer. And that depends exactly on the mixture of genes that we use to create the tumor. So it's a very flexible. So it's a very flexible, it's a very flexible, very powerful system to create the tumors. Now, you look at these tumors, and basically what you see here is a tumor from an animal that was close to Moriban. And it's difficult to see any particular structure in these tumors. You see the areas here highlighted by the yellow arrows, which is Which are the areas of infiltration, which are darker areas in the middle of a lighter normal brain. But you don't really see any particular structure in the tumors. And why do I put this accent on understanding the structure? Because I was interested in the possibility of finding patterns. You're finding patterns in the tumors that would indicate self-organization and order in gliomas. And I asked the question whether we could find evidence that if self-organization was actually happening, we should find invariant structures throughout various types of gliomas, not only in mice, but also in the human tumors. And after spending approximately Spending approximately three months looking down the microscope, we eventually found these structures that are shown here on the left, where you find fascicles of elongated spindle-like cells, which are aligned. And you see it much better on the higher magnification on the right. You see the darker nuclei and how they are elongated, and the lighter cytoplasm that is shown here. Cytoplasm that is shown here shows you that the cells are elongated and the nuclei are elongated. And they are surrounded by areas where the nuclei and the cells are much rounder. So at this stage, and we called these structures oncostreams because they were found in tumors and it looked very much like a stream because of the elongated nature of the cells. Of course, The cells. Of course, these are histological hematoxyline and neosine sections, so we couldn't see any movement. But we asked the question whether these structures were actually motile. And what I show you here is an experiment where we implanted the cells in the brain of an experimental mouse. Now we let the tumor grow to a certain size, then we sacrifice Then we sacrifice the animal and we cut sections through the tumor. And we put the sections, as you see here, under the confocal microscope. If you look at the low power magnifications, you see here the red section, because it's taken from a transgenic animal, where all the cells in the body are actually red. And we implanted cells which express GFP. So all the tumor cells are green. And you can see here. Green. And you can see here we can select the area which we want to image then under the confocal microscope. In this case, we selected an area which is at the border between the tumor and the normal brain. And what you see here on the right, this is now the tumor under the focal microscope. And you see approximately here where I go with the cursor, the border between the tumor and the normal cell. And the normal cells in red. So we're looking at the invasive area of the tumor. And I'm going to show you the movie. And you see here that the cells are moving in various ways. Here, up here on the left, they're moving along a blood vessel and they're moving in two directions. This is probably the best image to convince ourselves that the cells are moving in what we'll call soon in a nematic fashion. In a nematic fashion. And here, where the T is closer to the center of the tumor, the cells are actually moving in two directions. Together with Sebastian Moch from Arizona State University, we developed a statistical way of analyzing the movement in terms of whether how many cells were moving in one direction, how many cells were moving in another direction. But essentially, in every Essentially, in every area that we look, the cells are really moving, their cells are moving in two directions in a way that we now understand this being a nematic organization. So we have that the cells move and we did a lot of work on what at that stage we are calling oncostreams. And then this slide summarizes a lot of that work, and you see that. A lot of that work, and you see that these structures are anatomically distinct. They are dynamic structures and they move in a pneumatic fashion. They contribute to the malignancy of the tumor. The more oncostreams there are in a tumor, the more aggressive the tumor is. As you see here, the red line has more oncostreams than the green, the survival. I will curve from this green tumor. They contribute to the invasion of the tumor onto the normal brain, which is one of the most difficult things to treat in these tumors. And they also contribute to cell spreading throughout the tumor, because as you can see here, the brown cells are actually microglial cells. And you see that these cells are inside the oncostream and they actually become elongated as the tumor cells do. And we have shown that the oncostream actually helps these cells to distribute throughout the tumor. We were also able to do micro-dissection experiments with a laser scanning, micro-dissecting. With a laser scanning micro dissecting microscope. And we did molecular analysis and found that there are a number of genes exemplified here by the collagen 1a1 gene, which are really overexpressed in the oncostremes compared to the non-oncostremes region of the tumors. So we asked the question: what are the translation? What are the translational implications of this? Do these genes really have a function in the growth of the tumor? And the answer is yes. What we did here, using the sleeping beauty model, we have to control tumor survival in red and in black are tumors where we expressed with the sleeping beauty transposer system an SH RNA for collagen 1A1. RNA for collagen 1a1. So we take out the collagen 1a1 from the tumor cells, and you see that the animal survival goes from 72 days to 114 days. And as you see on the left, in the controls, you have very nice staining of collagen, especially throughout the oncostreams. And down below, you have the hematoxylin and eosin image of the elongated cells moving around. Elongated cells moving around in the oncostreams. And on the right, if you look at the top right image, there's no collagen left in the main part of the tumor. There's only collagen left surrounding the blood vessels. And not only do we lose the collagen, but if you look at the image, if you look at the image down below here on the right, you see in the You see in the hematoxylin and neosin image that all the oncostreams are gone now. So you take the collagen out, you lose the oncostreams, you reduce the malignity of the tumor. So our conclusion is that these structures, which we call the oncostreams, are important for the structure and function and the aggressive behavior of gliomas. Okay, so then we asked what we thought was a simple question. We wanted to study more of the molecular makeup of these oncostreams. So we were wondering whether we in glioma cells in culture. And then, okay, so just to remind you, having detected the The ongo streams in the tissue, we were interested whether we could detect them also in culture so that we could do biochemical and molecular experiments. And we put these cells in culture, and what we found is essentially what I'm showing you here in the movie. And yes, you can look at a square approximately here, or you can look at another square down here in the middle of the section, and you see that the cells are really aligned in a parallel. Really aligned in a parallel fashion. But one of the most fascinating things we found is that the cells formed really strange patterns that you can see here on the left and here on the top of the movie. And just to show you again where these patterns come from. And we were quite fascinated by that. And eventually, what we figured out is that these We figured out that these structures really look like topological defects. And what we found with our in vitro system is that we really had evidence for nematic alignment and topological defects, which I'm going to go into detail now. So now I need to introduce liquid crystals, which are a very interesting phase of matter. And liquid crystals flow like a liquid, but their components have orientational order. They don't have Order. They don't have positional order like you see in the solid down here on the left, but they have orientational order. The molecules that form the liquid crystal are also looking in the same direction. So the main characteristics of a pneumatic liquid crystal, which is one type of liquid crystal, is this nematic alignment that I show you here in blue, topological defects, which I show you here on the right, and quasi-long range order, which I will show you. Long range order, which I will show you in a few slides. So, what you see here is that now we understand that the oncostreams are really the nematic alignment of this tissue. And you see here in red, this would be the director, which shows the approximate direction of the cells. But you see that the cells in this oncostream look very similar to the ones. Is similar to the ones to the blue molecules that you see in a liquid crystal. Topological defects come in various shapes and sizes. The most important ones for this talk are the plus one-half defects, which has to do with the winding number of these defects that I'm not going to go into details. But you see here, this is a comet, and here you have the orientation of the cells, and essentially. The cells. And essentially, this will be the way the orientation in which the cells actually move around the comet. And in the middle of the defect, you have this point here, which is a singularity, where you cannot show the orientation of any of the molecules or the cells that are participating in the defect. Down below, you have a trefoil, again, the singularity in the middle, and this has three arms. This has three arms, and here you see in the black double-headed arrows, in which way the molecules on this, or in our case, the cells will actually move in these defects. How we analyze the defects by ponfocal microscopy. We gather the data, we use orientation J, and it gives us the orientation of the cells throughout the tissue. And you can see up here up in the middle, it looks Middle, it looks like a minus one-half defect, and here on the left, it looks like a plus one-half. And then we use a MATLAB program that tells us all the defects that are present in the tissue. Interestingly, the defects are actually, depending on the defect, they're actually motile. They tend to eventually annihilate each other to reduce the energy of the system. The energy of the system, so that over time you see here upon the upper left that the density of defects actually goes down, and concomitantly, the nematic order parameter goes up, but you never get a perfect nematic order parameter because there are a number of defects that remain. Some of the topological defects down here on the left are very stable and they're stable for many, many hours, but in some cases, Hours, but in some cases you can see the defect annihilation. And if you look now at the white square that I show you here on the right, you will see a blue trefoil and a red comet eventually getting very close to each other and annihilating each other. So there's a lot of dynamics. The trefoil is mainly immobile, and the comet is the one. And the comet is the one that can move, and depends on the type of topological defects in which direction they move. And you see there an example of the anhylation. One of the most exciting things in the field of liquid crystals in biology is that various groups have discovered that the topological defects actually have particular roles that are important for the understanding. Important for the understanding of the physiology of tissues and organs. For example, Lim and Johans and Ladou showed that the cell extrusion and apoptosis in cell monolayers, and that's shown here on the right, and Dr. Lim a couple of days ago showed this. And the idea is that you have the epithelium in this case, and it exerts pressure onto a particular cell. Onto a particular cell, which then eventually is extruded from the epithelium and dies through a process called anoices. Kavaguchi et al. also showed changes in cell density and differentiation in cell monolayers with cell density and differentiation increasing in the plus one-half defects and decreasing in the minus one-half defects. And a particularly beautiful set of Set of experiments done by the group of Kineric Karen who presented a day ago also is that during the regeneration of this organism called hydra, you can cut it in half and eventually it will regenerate these areas here that are called tentacles and this is called the head and down here it's called the foot. And at the base of each of these The base of each of these cell body parts, you have different kinds of topological defects. And there's now very nice work done by this group on how the topological defects manage to create 3D structures. An important proviso, though, is that all these examples are examples in 2D and very Um and very much less has been done in 3D. So what about what about our system? So what's the role of topological defects in cultures of mura and glioblastoma cells? And the most important point to see on the minus one half defect here in the center of this picture, you can see that this. You can see the defect up in the top row. And then you see an apoptosis heat map. So the density of apoptosis occurring in this area of the minus one-half defects, and it goes up, and the cell density goes down. And this is statistically significant, as you can see from the graph below. In the minus one-half apoptosis goes up, and cell density goes down compared to the controls. Goes down compared to the controls on random locations within the culture. A different process that we're still working on and don't understand completely is what happens in the plus one half defect, where apoptosis actually goes down and density heat map also goes down. So there must be other ways in which different defects regulate the cell density. This is not all. There are more complex things happening that we're looking at now. This is from cultures of the glioma cells. And you can see here on the upper left, you see a comet. And I put a red dot with a singularity near the singularity. And the other three are minus one half. The other three are minus one-half defects. And in the minus one-half defect, something really interesting, but which we don't understand yet, but we are looking at it now. If you look in the center of these minus one-half defects, the cells look different. They look paler and they look flatter. And in this case, on the lower right, you see that the cells look almost like they're forming a syncytium. They're forming a syncythium. It's difficult to find out what is happening in the defects. And we're now looking at single-cell RNA-seq data of these very defects to understand what mechanisms are occurring in these plus one-half and minus one-half defects in culture. So far, what I've showed you is mostly showed you this mode mainly in 2D and I'm going to go on to 3D in a minute. I just want to show you again how the histological sections of these tumors are done to study quasi-long range order in 2D and in 3D. So in the left you see we inject the plasmid, we follow the tumor growth by luminescence and then we We sacrifice the animal, take the brain out, and by fluorescence, we see the extent of the tumor. What you see in the middle, we cut sections, and then we do HNE stain. And you can see here very nicely in the pneumatic alignment of the oncostreams outlined by the black arrows. We cut the whole tumor in serial sections and we do serial reconstructions. Reconstructions of these areas of the nematic alignment or the topological defect here on the right that you see, but very importantly, you need to show that these defects really occur throughout the tumor. So, an important aspect of these tumors is that they display something called quasi-long range order. And here I'm going to show you, this is how we calculate the pneumatic order parameter, S. Order parameter S here on the left and the core screening length that you see scheme on the right is a square in 2D and a box in 3D. And essentially, what I'm going to show you is that we really have quasi-long range order, which obeys a power law, which means that the pneumatic order parameter is proportional to a quasi-long range order. a quasi-long range order decay exponent, which is this exponent here shown as minus b. And that gives you in red a power law line to indicate the particular process. So this is just to show you the data of the analysis and the The closer the exponent is to zero, the shallower is this curve. And it means that you have quasi-long range order for a longer time. And for the mouse 2D up here on the left, you see that the gliomas have shallower curves than the normal brain and the black line, the black stippled line here, which is the Stippled line here, which is the limit of the random limit of disorder. And you see the same in the human and 2D. You see that you have quasi-long range order. And the quasi-long range order decay exponent, as I said, the closer it is to zero, the shallower the curve and the longer is the quasi-long range order in the tissue. And you see here, shown by the And you see here, shown by the cursor, that according to the malignity of the tumors, the more malignant tumors have lower exponents and therefore the existence of quasi-long range order over longer distances. And in both for the mouse 3D here on the right and the human reconstruction in three dimensions, you also Construction in three dimensions, you also see that the quasi-long range order decay exponent is very close to zero according to the most aggressive tumors. We compared this. Here you see the numbers of our exponents. And this is very similar to an analysis that Luca Giomi posted in BioRxives. Hosted in bioarchives, where he looked at nine different papers using either a series of systems, either microtubules or actin myosin, actin myosin tubules, bacteria or epithelial cells. So our numbers coincide very nicely with those from all these other studies strengthening the Strengthening that we do have quasi-long range order, not only in 2D, but also in 3D. So an important question is then, how well can we see the defects in 3D? The reconstruction of the hematoxylin and eosin sections is good to look at the reconstruction in the X and Y scale. X and Y scales, but it's not very good in the Z scale. So we developed a different system using light sheet microscopy, where basically what you see on the left, you clear the brain from lipids, and then you put the whole piece of tissue containing the tumor in the microscope, and the light sheet can actually scan throughout the whole tissue. Throughout the whole tissue without you having to cut it into sections, to get a much better exposition of the Z scale. And what you see up here on the left is what looks very much like a minus one-half topological defect. And down below is the reconstruction we did with Daniel Beller with a program called Open View Me. Was a program called Open View Min. And here you see the black dot of the singularity. And you see that the cells are moving. These are actually the directors, but they indicate in which way the cells are oriented. And you see that the directors are moving in the way that you expect from a minus one-half topological defect. And on the right, you see a pneumatic alignment and down. Alignment and down below, you see the directors in green and a general director in black showing you the direction in which the cells are possibly oriented. And this is now in 3D. So we show now that in 3D you have, you definitely have topological. Topological defects and mnematic alignment. And this is another view. I'm only going to show it briefly. But up here on the left, you have this line here. I'm sure with the cursor, which is very much like a line disclination. And to show that this is a topological defect, you You are supposed to cut this at different levels of this line and show that when you look at those images, then in 2D, it really shows that you have the director which changes smoothly around the defect, and that's what you see here in C. So we definitely show that. That this is a minus one-half disclination line in the in vivo brain. And what you see down here, what you don't see here on the left in the black and white image, it's from the light sheet microscope. And then again, if you look at the area outlined here in blue, you see the You see the orientation of the directors in the way that you expect from the defect, and you can go approximately 100 microns through this line. And you see here on the very right again the distribution of the director according to the minus one-half effect. So I'm showing you that there's the first evidence that there are. There's the first evidence that there we can show the existence of the topological defects in 3D in tumors in vivo. So the main take-home message is that glioma cells in vitro and 2D and also glioma tumors in vivo display the nematic alignment, which we call oncostreams. They display quasi-long range order, anthropological defects, all of which are characteristic of active Characteristic of active pneumatic liquid crystals. So that's our overall conclusion here: that gliomasa organizes active pneumatic liquid crystal. So as I started with giving you an idea of what we want to do in the long run, which is to treat the tumors, does this information on the organization of gliomas have any consequences to Consequences to treatment of the tumors we think it has. And here I show you one image taken from the border. This is a tumor infiltrating the normal brain, which you have here on the left. And you see this huge oncostream here. And you see it seems to originate in a minus one-half defect. And one way that you can disrupt the organization of liquid crystals is by filling them with colloid. Filling them with colloids, for example, and the colloids then will disrupt the way that the liquid crystals can actually move. So that's one possibility to use this for potential treatment. Another one would be to use this system developed by Oleg Lavrentovich, where you can stamp particular defects onto a surface. Onto onto a surface. And if you could do that, and you could have a liquid crystal that you can inject into the brain and forms particular defects that it possibly attracts and kills tumor cells. And that's what we call the liquid crystal defensive barrier, which is pure speculation at this stage. But the idea is that can you Can you fill this perivascular space which I show here on the left, which is how recurrent glioma cells eventually come back and pre-constitute the tumor? And can you create a barrier along those vessels using what we know about wicked crystals to block the cells from accumulating again and creating the tumor. So I leave you with this. With this little bit of translational imagination, which we hope will work one day. And this is the lab that we direct the lab together with Maria Castro and the people that participated in this work is mainly Anna Argento, who's here. Andrea Comba did all the original work on the ONCO streams, and she was helped by Maria Luisa Varela and Luisa Varela and Clifford Abel and Faisal Sayette also participated in this work. And this is really the result of a long-term collaboration with Carlos Blanc-Mercader from the Institut Curie. And recently, we've expanded the collaboration to work with Daniel Beller from Johns Hopkins University. From Johns Hopkins University. So, thank you very much.
