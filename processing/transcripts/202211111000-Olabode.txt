Thank you. So there has been growing evidence of extensive recombination or deep evolutionary history of recombination in HIV and SIV, and as seen by some of these studies. For example, this study shown that the ancestor The ancestor of the SIV that infected chimpanzees was a recombinant. So, for example, when you look at the pole region in an analysis of SIV, different SIVs, those from CPZ cluster with RCM in pole, but when you look at the envelope region, they shift relationships. And then in this study, Study, they were able to demonstrate the presence of about 13 recombinant hotspots in SIV lineages, and they also showed evidence of about 14 cross-species transmissions. And then, in the previous study, where we looked at the HIV-1 group and we showed evidence of a deep recombinant history of Of HIV with at least one recombinant breakpoint. So our thought is that if recombination is pervasive, and I think that's a growing thought in the community, that if recombination is pervasive, then we should not rely on subtype references to characterize HIV one genome. And so we have to think of using. We have to think of using some form of reference-free methods to kind of analyze recommendation in the history of HIV. So we developed an unsupervised non-parametric clustering method, which was adapted from community detection methods that are currently being used to study dynamic social networks. Social networks in the social sciences. And so, what community detection methods basically do is to partition nodes of a network into communities based on their relative edge densities. And it applies stochastic block models in which individuals belong to communities that determine probabilities of social links. So the probability that two nodes probability that two nodes will be, two nodes will have an edge is dependent on their cluster membership or how related they are. And we know that in reality, social networks change over time. They are not static. So dynamic stochastic block models are used to study how networks change over time. So how nodes move around in a network. Nodes move around in a network over time. So, for example, this network has three communities in time stamp one, but by time step two, the D1 community had some shifting relationships and was broken into two different clusters. So, stochastic block models are able to measure those changes and also. Measure those changes and also estimate transition rates. So, in adapting this, we assume that we're using, so we're looking at the entire genome length of HIV-1 group M and creating sliding windows. And we're using each sliding window analogously to time. And then, for each window, when we make a network, each node will represent a genome. And then communities will represent HIV subtypes. And then, our assumption for recombination will be that there will be switches in community from one sliding window to another if a genome has recombination. So, we would expect that if a genome is pure, it will remain in the same cluster and form the same associations over the entire genome length. Over the entire genome length. And some of the parameters included in the community detection method, which I would call DSBM from now, includes number of communities, community membership, and transition rates. So in order to test the efficiency of our adapted community detection method, which is DSBM, we wanted to test it on data. We wanted to test it on data where we know what the outcome should be or what the results should be. So we did a simulation analysis. Firstly, we built phylogenetic trees using pure subtypes according to their labels on the Los Alamos database. So we got a bunch of pure subtypes and built phylogenetic, a phylogenetic tree. Then we tree then we the um performed the time scaling analysis using beast uh using that tree then we randomly swapped to simulate the recombination we randomly swapped branches um along the tree and then um to create new trees and then we simulated sequence evolution along those trees um using intellibo then created Then created multiple sequence alignments, then created our sliding windows of 500 nucleotides and 100 base steps, generated distance matrices for each window, and then created networks using iGraph, and then passed it through a community detection method and compared results with other alignment-free methods such as GAAP. Methods such as GAD and RTP. So we show that DSVM significantly has lower error rates compared to other methods. But overall, as the number of breakpoints increases, error rates also increase across all methods. Also, Also, we then went back to the Los Alamos database and selected all the pure sub-type reference genomes, 37 of them, I think. And we ran DSBM or community detection analysis with those sequences. And we have nine pure subtypes. So, again, So, again, the assumption is that if a sequence is pure, it will be assigned to one community and then it will remain in that community over the entire genome. And so each community here is represented by a colour. And looking at this heat map, each column of the heat map represents one sliding window of 500 nucleotides and nucleotides and each row here represents a single genome and then we have the subtypes. And first we ended up with an optimal community number of six. So we detected six communities from this data. That's against the nine subtypes. Our method was identifying six communities. Identifying six communities, which as we are using synonymously as clusters now. And if you look at it, it groups subtype B and D into one single cluster. And this is not new. There are a couple of studies that have suggested that subtype B and D should actually be a single subtype. And then subtype F and K were mostly clustered, were mostly put in one cluster. We're mostly put in one cluster. Same thing for G and subtype G and J. Also, we can see that there's some form of mixing of colors here, indicating that at those windows, that genome was clustering with sequences from another subtype. For example, we see a lot of in this region, subtype G sequences. G sequences mostly group with subtype A and vice versa in some of the subtype A sequences. And also we run a change point. We run a change point analysis. The change point algorithm in R is used in so many fields to Many fields to estimate abrupt change or substantial change in a time series observation. So in this case, we're looking at a change in wind cluster assignment across each individual genome and using a minimum segment of five, which means that when it hits a change, it looks for at least, makes sure that that change is in at least five windows. That changes in at least five windows, we were able to detect breakpoints in a good number of the sequences. However, the change point detection method was not able to pick out all the recombination events. For example, this cluster or this breakpoint here or fragment and here in subtype G has already been described. G has already been described in the literature. It falls in these two regions, but we didn't pick it up through the change point analysis, even though we can see it by observing the heat map. Then we went ahead to do a global diversity analysis, looking at the entire HIV one data. And we had a database of 300 sequences from a previous study. Sequences from a previous study. We selected 525 sequences which were most diverse, did a mapped alignment, and then repeated our sliding window analysis. And here we show that in the global diversity of HIV, there's extensive recombination going on. Again, we can see that there's a lot of colors moving around. And here the white spaces indicate sequences in that window that weren't assigned to any clusters. And on the left, we are showing the transition matrix. So this just tells us the rate at which sequences switch clusters. Switch clusters and the darker the color, the higher the transition rate. So, for example, we have sequences that begin in cluster three, they have a higher likelihood of switching to cluster 14 and vice versa. And overall, global diversity identified. Uh, global diversity identified 29 clusters. This is against the nine pure subtypes and close to 100 recombinant circulating recombinant forms. So we believe that this could be a useful tool in looking at disparity or diversity in sequences. So, in summary, Our results support the hypothesis that recombination is extensive at the scale of the full HIV genome. We confirmed the presence of inter-subtype recombination in HIV reference genomes. For example, we find those fragments in subtype G that have been seen in the literature before. And then we know that recombination cannot meaningfully be defined as a mixture of pure subtypes. As a mixture of pure subtypes over the evolutionary history of a therapy, because recombination is indeed deep down in the history. And I would also say that a couple of studies have emerged recently that also show that there's extensive recombination going on in sequences that were gathered in Africa. I think one of them is the Pangea study. The Pantheon study by Heather Grant. Thank you. I would like to appreciate everyone I've worked with and our sponsors. Thank you. All right, questions? Anyone? Hello, here in Mexico. Can you hear me? Yes, please. So I just wanted to ask you, what do you think, or maybe if you could expand a little bit more on why are there certain clusters that have more likelihood to go into others? Like I think it was a heat map. A heat map showing the relatedness of the clusters. Yeah, that one. So could you explain a little bit further why you think this is happening or what could be the plausible like biological reason behind this? So we've zoomed in a bit. Some of it could be as a result of So basically, some sequences are in terms of diversity are more related or closely related in terms of percentage identity, for example, to others. Like there's a study recently that suggested that subtype A and subtype B should be sub-subtypes of another parent subtype. So they shouldn't be distinct subtypes. Type. So they shouldn't be distinct subtypes. They should be sister subtypes. So what we think is going on here is that some sequences are more similar to others. And so, and because they have regions where they have higher similarity, when you get into those windows, they tend to cluster together. So there's a higher chance for Chance for sequences that are more closely related to switch between clusters. I don't know if that's okay. But maybe you could see it the other way, right? Because they're so closely related, it might seem to separate clusters, but in reality, it's not a single cluster, not fully segregating. So it could be seen the other way around as a confounding factor. Oh, I see what you're saying. I don't think so. I think we looked at some of the major subtypes like subtype B, for example. We extracted data and information from particular subtypes from this particular heat map and tried to look at their cluster assignments. Cluster assignments to see if we could find some of the disparities you're talking about, and that wasn't seen. Okay, thank you. I think there's a question in the chat. Okay. So there is a question in the chat by Nicrosher. Yep, really interesting talk. Thanks. Do the recombinations show any association with drug-resistant mutations or antigenic. Resistance mutations or antigenic diversification? Honestly, we've not looked at that. I think it's something we can zoom in further in the future studies we're working on. I think that's a very good idea and something to look into, but we didn't look into that.
