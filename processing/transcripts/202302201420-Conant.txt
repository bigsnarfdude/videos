That's what you'll enjoy it. Or if you didn't enjoy it the first time. Yeah, so this is a neostability project about something. Maybe slides first. Excuse me, could you please share the slides? Oh, oh, you can't see the slides. What do you mean share it? Is it better now? People outside can see it. People outside can see it, can see it. If you share screen on the computer when it's not. No, this isn't connected to Zoom. You're not seeing it? No. What if you click on the other computer? Did you make sure that it's fine? We can see. It's fine. Does it say computer? Maybe if I keep talking here, it'll be. Is it any different? I don't see the slides in the main screen. I just see it on your little video. Click on the light windows for slides. Exit full screen windows. Why not ask the movement for windows? Because he's very hard, his camera has. So Sergei says you need to click on the right zoom. In principle, you should have be able to see all the participants, right? And so you should make. So you should make a bright window. One of the partition contents should be spiked. This is not connected to CD. So I think it's just going to work. Yeah, so I'm sorry, it seems like there's nothing I can do from this computer. It's fine. Martin, can you can you see the screen? Yes. So maybe you have to choose calorie and stuff. I think that we should go on with the talk and yeah. Okay. I'm sorry. I'll try to say as much as possible. And then maybe I can post the slides after or something. Okay. So yeah, this talk is based on joint work with a bunch of people, Christian Delbay, Atier Halevila. Christian Delbay, Yetier Halevi, Leo Jimenez, and Sylvan Rinoca Kuchi. This was a fun collaboration we started at this fields workshop semester program, and there's a preprint. So the motivation for the project is like a bunch of previous work on stable expansions of the group of integers. And so I'm going to show you a very busy slide, which you don't need to read. It's just meant to give an impression. An impression. So there was a during some number of years, there was a bunch of work done on studying examples of stable expansions of the group of integers, and in particular by naming some new set A with nice properties. Bunch of examples, fun stuff, lots of people. The only one that we need to remember for the talk is the factorials, which is a pretty straightforward example among all of them. Here, I can name the factorials by a new predicate, and this is stable, but you can do a lot. And this is stable, but you can do a lot of other fun things as well. But this talk is not about this specifically, it's about kind of a general observation that comes away from looking at all these papers together, which is that all of those examples are in fact super stable of u rank omega. And the proofs are all very uniform. It's kind of the same proof recipe, even though proving different steps of it required different combinatorial things or different number of theories. Different combinatorial things or different number of theoretic things or whatever, but it's sort of the same recipe and you get the same kind of classification. And so, yeah, this was just a question: like, what's a different way to get a stable expansion of a group of integers? And in particular, is there a strictly stable expansion of the group of integers? Is there a super stable expansion with some other U rank? I didn't know any of examples of this, and talking to people, I couldn't find any in the literature. Kind of the most that I knew was that any super stable, if it's super stable, Any super stable if it's super stable, then the U rank has to be an infinite monomial. It's kind of fun. Yeah. I don't like that. Of course. Okay. All right. So this was the question that I brought to this group at the at the Fields Institute. And we ended up. Sorry, so d you cannot have random mega tension or that's a normal. That's a monomial. Yeah, yeah, that's a monomial. But I could but you can't have like rank omega plus two. No, no, that's okay. But omega times two. Well, okay, I don't, I'm not saying this is a, this is, I'm not saying that the rest exists. This is not an if and only if. It's just. I don't. Okay, I'll say more about 1986 and then we develop 80s. Well, it's two things, right? Infinite ammonomial. Things, right? Infinite and monomial. So they proved infinite, they proved monomial. Yeah, sorry. Okay, but anyway. So in this project, we ended up finding these examples, which in retrospect, if I tell you the example, which I'm not going to do for a few slides, but if I tell you the example, you'll say, okay, well, of course. So I think that maybe the more general picture we studied is going to be more interesting, maybe. So I'm actually just going to jump straight to this more general setting we ended up looking at and kind of proving. And kind of proving some wider theorems. So, in the general setting, forget the integers now for a while. Let T be any complete theory and fix a unary set Q0 definable. So, we assume that the set's stably embedded, which is the usual definition for any model of the theory. Any definable subset of Q or Cartesian product is definable using parameters from Q. And just as a note, by definability, Just as a note, by definability of types, if the theory is stable, which it will be for a lot of our examples, like integers and stuff, then this is automatic. So then the schematic that we're going to think of, a lot of the previous results I was saying were in the area of taking a structure and naming a single new unary predicate and looking at neostability properties of that. So, what we're doing is kind of another step, like we're assuming that this unary predicate Q is already made. Unary predicate q is already named, it's already definable, and then we want to put more stuff on top of it. Okay? So now let math cal q be an arbitrary expansion, sorry, of the induced structure on q. So we do have to expand whatever the theory is telling us is there. And then we just put a bit more, whatever we like. And then I'm going to let t, like t adjoin math cal q, be this expansion of the theory obtained just by naming this new structure on q. Structure on Q. And okay, the definition is a little bit slippery in certain ways, but however you're thinking about this, this is well defined, and you get a complete theory by stable environments. So this is all good. So this is the situation then we're going to be looking at is transfer properties of like neostability from T and math cal Q to this joint theory. Well sorry, but but this Q, currently Q, is an Curly Q is an arbitrary expansion of the induced structure of value Q. And then so the domain of curly Q is the same as of Q. And then you say that you are naming curly Q or Q. What does it mean? Yeah, so maybe it's better to think of this as a theory rather than a structure. And then we're putting the theory of MathCalQ on the set Q. Yeah, and that's probably a better. Yeah, and and the and that's probably a ben this is what I was getting at with my little hedging there about this. It's not that it's a little bit sloppily denoted this way, but in terms of like the picture of going back to the integers later, I think, I don't know. But yeah, I do apologize that it's a little bit, but another way you could think instead is go to the monster model, look at q, and put the monster model with mathcal q on it. And this will be well defined, and you'll get a complete theory by. And that you'll get a complete theory by staple embedded. But I think instead it's probably better to think of this as a theory. Somehow I just didn't like the notation. So anyway. Okay, so. Okay, yeah, but yeah, I apologize, slightly sloppy. Okay, so anyway, there was then a result in the literature about transferring tameness. So this is from a paper by Artemis Pierre, and then kind of more details in a later paper by Junck and Simone. Paper by Juncken and Simone, which is that if you start with your base theory NIP and MathCalQ is NIP, then so is this adjoined theory, T adjoined Q. And so this was kind of a starting point for us in this project. Okay, so I think I'm going to just state our first theorem. So in this setting, the first thing we proved was preservation of stability and different forms of And different forms of stability at that. So if T and Q are stable, or say super stable, or both omega stable, and assume the countable language here, then so is T adjoint Q. And moreover, the U rank of T adjoint Q is at least that of Q, and I guess that of T as well. But Q is where we're adding the new complexity, so that's kind of where the focus is. Okay. Yeah. So we're gonna we'll get back to the intros later, but So we're gonna we'll get back to the interest later, but this is a preservation result. Yeah, we proved a P and PR. No. I mean no. No, we don't. Do you want me to? No, we do not. We do not assume TN. We don't assume Triction. Yeah, so I mean in the omega stable case, they are both. So, I mean, in the omega-stable case, they are both countable. But, you know, I don't know. It might work for total. We didn't write it that way, but okay. I mean, later, I'm focusing later on the integers, which are not omega-stable anyways. So, yeah. So, for stable, if you want to do like a combinatorial proof using the definition in terms of the order property, it's actually extremely similar to the NIP proof. You can almost kind of do Proof. You can almost kind of do the exact same recipe, but using the characterization of indiscernible sequences with infinite co-infinite instead of the alternation. And then the same kind of proof goes through. In the paper, we ended up not writing the proof that way because for super stability and omega stability, it was a bit more intricate. So we did like more of a controlling types type proof. And the key tool is that types in this bigger theory can be kind of decomposed. I'm not getting into any of these details here. It's just a rough picture, but decomposed in terms of types in T and Of types in T and MathCal Q. Okay. And then before I move on to the more complicated dividing lines, how do you are there some kind of sets which are going to be special with respect to Q? I mean, in the sense that if there are some set linear combinations, something that you need to add to, I mean, you need to understand types of. I'll answer the question. Yeah. I mean, there's a quantifier elimination result. I mean, there's a quantifier elimination result that you can prove. I mean, a lot of this kind of stuff underlying this key tool was somewhat folklore, but we have a preliminary section where we write it all out: this type decomposition, this QE results, and then go for another result. I think it didn't quite go that perfectly, if I remember right. But I did say all bases in the key. Yatira would remember, I think. Let me get back to you on that. I think there was some no, no, in fact, I know we didn't, because I'm going to get back to this later, because in fact, the proof of suit, preserving super stability was a bit more intricate than one might think. We actually, I'm going to remark on this again later. We did not preserve super stability by doing this kind of perfect correspondence, lambda stable to lambda stable. We used the characterization using saturated models. Using saturated models from whatever chapter inshallah that is. And that is going to be related to a question I state later. If I have time, I'm not even paying attention to it. Okay. Keep track. I think we're good. 3.05, right? Great. Oh, yeah. So then, as I was saying, we also did a preservation result for NTP2, but in this case, I mean, it was all teed up, really, ready to go in this paper on fields by Chernikov and Hills. And you just had to combine kind of some combinatorial lemmas they proved together with some of this kind of basic stuff about stably embedded sets that we had to clarify and then put it together. So that one works without any hiccups. The ones that then became kind of more interesting were Simplicity and NSOP1. The situation is sort of more complicated there. And so I want to take some time to explain that slightly more carefully. Slightly more carefully. Okay. All right. Yeah, so there's a little technicality that comes in in order to make the proof work. So I'm going to give you a definition. I mean, this is a neostability workshop, so I don't feel as hesitant to get into the messy stuff. But here it is. So the T and Q stably embedded B as above. Look at a monster model of the base theory T, and then given any parameters. Theory T, and then given any parameter set A, I'm going to define, it's not a closure operation, but it's like a, I don't know, bar. Where's Chris Schoen anyway? Hi. So anyway, it's not actually a closure operation, but it kind of behaves a little bit like that. You take the definable closure of A and intersect it with Q, but in the imaginary. So this is all, what I mean by this here is. Here is any imaginary obtained by taking a quotient of some Cartesian power of Q by a definable equivalence relation. So literally imaginaries from Q. Okay? So this is some sort of thing, and the idea is down is next. Down is next. I hold it like this, maybe. Yeah. Okay. So the idea is that this A bar, it kind of behaves like a canonical parameter for the set A, but like For the set A, but like relativized to Q, this fixed, stably embedded set. For example, A is always independent from Q over this R. Q and Q. Q with Q in the sense of the language L? Yeah, so there's no MathCalQ here. This is all working inside T and this fixed definable set Q. Yeah, there's no MathCalQ at this point. I mean, there's more details I could get into where, well, I won't. But yeah. Well, I won't. So QEQ is defined as like imaginaries which are quotients of the QEQ. Exactly, yeah. So like the issue of QS and a letter subtracts? If you like, but I don't like thinking about it too much like a theory. I mean, it's just a collection of imaginaries. So, yeah. Yeah, we had a lot of five people you can. Yeah, we had a lot of five people, you can imagine how many arguments and stuff about this. Did I win all of them? Probably. Okay. Okay. So then... Okay. So then we have this notion, yeah, people may not like the terminology, but we say that Q is algebraically embedded in the theory if this thing happens. thing happens. What is the thing? Take any A, B, C parameter sets with C containing a model, just like a technical assumption. Assume that A and B are forking independent over C. I think in this situation you should, oh, never mind, okay. So if A and B are free over C, then when I take ABC together and do this bar operation, it's in ACL of A C bar and B C bar separately. So it's a weird thing. So it's a weird thing, I agree. Maybe. Is the type Anyakov here? Not. Yeah. Okay, it's too bad. Why? Why? Just curious. Sorry. Yeah, we had a lot of discussions about this. It feels a little bit like a modularity thing, although we couldn't quite perfectly line it up to that. Yeah, I mean, it's saying that. Yeah, I mean it's saying that if I have anything in Q that comes from the definable closure of ABC, it's algebraic over something in Q that's just from like separately AC, separately BC. So it's like I can move the parameters into these bars separately. So it's a tight, I mean I'm glad that people are like staring at it because it is a weird assumption. I mean I'm yeah, basically it's there in order to make some forking calculus work, which I'll mention a little bit. Work, which I'll mention a little bit later. But it does appear in the literature. So, for example, and we kind of took some of our motivation for this and some lemmas from this paper by a type N. So, for example, if T is the theory of Bell pairs of a superstable U rank 1 theory and Q is the sub-model, this is true. Okay, so it appears there. Another example, if T is the theory of H structures, this kind of other side of a superstable U rank 1 theory. Of a superstable U rank 1 theory, and Q is the H, if you're familiar with these, then this happens. So there is sort of precedent for seeing this kind of behavior in the literature. And in fact, one of the questions that we still don't know is, assume the theory is simple, which maybe I should have from the beginning since it's forking independence anyway, if it was to really be meaningful. Is this always the case if T is simple? Or even assume stable? I mean, for any set, an algebraically embedded definable set is an automatically. Embedded definable set? Is it automatically? We couldn't cook up a counterexample. If you remove this caveat that C contains a model, you can make a counterexample. Leo made one. But there was something interesting about that. It was weakly mine. We didn't make a connection. I mean, we tried a little bit, but yeah, there was, yeah, it's possible. I'd be interested to know the example because it's this annoying technical assumption we have to state and then put into the statements of the theorems. It would be great to just remove it. Is that true, statement? To just remove it. Is that true stable theory? I don't know, yeah, or even stable. How about did you try the screw-wid examples? I mean, that was kind of like what time? It was something. Maybe it was a group. I don't know if it was a group. I mean, I didn't feel like that was that's yeah, but I thought it was a good question. I thought it was a good question. The definition of algebraic the Q is something that's a very important thing. Yeah, I'm sorry. So, you know, in this bar notation, there really should be a Q there. Because it's like a bar. So definitely it's all in here. Yeah, yeah. So I was wondering if we see an example with the DSC. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Okay. Yeah, so maybe after the talk, if people have candidates. Yeah, maybe you ask Leo to... Okay. Then I'm definitely not talking about it. Okay. Anyway, so this is an assumption we needed to make in order to make the transfer for simple and SOP1 and simple and NSOP1 to work. And simple and NSOP1 to work. So, in particular, now there's some more. Assume that the base theory T is simple and eliminates hyperimaginaries. I'll say more about that later. But in particular, we have to assume the base theory is simple. Now assume Q, in addition to all of the previous stuff, so definable, stably embedded, assume it's also algebraically embedded, the smear condition. Then we can transfer simplicity and NSOP1 from MathCalc. We're assuming T is simple and Or assuming T is simple in both cases, but can you replace the desumption of initial hyperaminators by changing the definition of algebraic embeddings in respect of the T? I mean, maybe I'll say more about that. I mean, in addition, you'd have to do a little bit more. You always assume that we speak. Always, yeah. So when I say obtained as above, I mean. I mean, we need that in order for this to even make sense as a complete, well-defined theory. As a complete well-defined theory. So no function in the base. I'm going to get to that. Yeah. Yeah. But I will say, as we go through this discussion, I will say something about these conditions. But I just want to draw your attention to the fact that we assume T is simple for both cases, simple and NSOP1 from MathCalQ. Okay. I will say, I will say, I will say. So, yeah. Yeah. So that's the setting. T is simple with elimination of hyperimaginaries, Q algebraically embedded to T, sorry, plus all the previous stuff, stably embedded. I think I'm going to probably forget to say that the whole time, but it's always there. Yeah, and so we prove, first we look at the NSOP1 case, and we kind of do the natural thing of identifying what Kim independent should be. And you just want to try to like, so in this situation, To try to like, so in this situation, so when Q is NSOP1, we show that Kim independence, I should say, maybe here, in the big theory T adjoined Q, is given by the following anchor relation over models, where this is going to be forking independence in T, because we assume T is simple, and this is going to be Kim independence in MathCalQ, and we assume MathCalQ is NSOP1. So, like, the right choices of the anchors in both. Okay, and so what does it say? Okay, and so what does it say? A is free from B over a model if, okay, they're free with respect to T as a simple theory, and also these bars, AM bar, B M bar is free over M bar in the Q theory. If M is a model of T, then M bar will be like a model in MathCalQ. So it works out. Okay, so this is how we proved NSOP1. We identified how we proved NSOP1. So we identified the right ternary notion and then showed that it satisfies the criteria that Nick was just talking about. All the axioms, you know, there's a few different variations of which axioms, as you were kind of seeing in the discussion. So we picked the right variation that worked for us. And we showed that it satisfied all of them. But it's interesting, to do this forking calculus, several of the steps really required transitivity and baselines of independence in T over arbitrary sets. In T over arbitrary sets. And I mean, there might be clever ways to get around it, but there certainly weren't naive ways to get around it. And so that's the main reason why we needed T to be simple. In transitivity, of course, you have. Sorry? In MSCP1, of course, you have transitivity. Yeah, but maybe not over arbitrary sets without adding some of this extra stuff you were talking about. Yeah, so right, maybe the transitivity isn't so. But I think the point is that you could say, oh, well, you have NSOP1 at transitivity, so maybe you switch this to chemindependence, but then we also need a base. Switch this to chem independence, but then we also needed base monotonicity simultaneously. So it seemed like there was really no way to get her out of assuming T was simple for the forking calculus to work. And then we also need this algebraic embeddedness condition as well. Okay, and I will get to each, right? Yeah, so I think that's what I'm going to get to next. So the key technical hurdle, though, and in fact in the first version we found an error that we thought it was much simpler, we had to go and correct it. The hardest one to preserve was One to preserve was by doubt the independence over models axiom. That was the most difficult. And we needed to work with strong types over Q. And in order, and this was very complicated, and so I'm not going to get into too many details here, but to get around this, we had to work with this multi-sorted structure, which we called H, and these are like definable finite covers. Sorry. Sorry, this is all messed up. Well, sorry, this is all messed up. So this is. Yeah, yeah. So it should be multi-sorted structure called H of definable finite covers of Q like this. Yeah, okay. So there won't be time for me to explain this whole So, there won't be time for me to explain this whole construction. The point was: here was where we used the elimination of hyperimaginaries. What's the universe always? Say it again? What's the universe? It's like the disjoint union of all these definable finite covers, and then you put all maps between them and stuff like this. So, I will say, though, I think that the assumption of elimination of hyperimaginaries was really just a convenience to make. I mean, we were already trying to fix a mistake as it was, right? And it was getting extremely complicated. I'm sure you could get around. Extremely complicated. I'm sure you could get around this using the, as you said to me at Charlie's conference, using compact sorts or just working in continuous logic. I'll write out if you wanted to, and that would be fine. But maybe it's easier to just prove every simple theory eliminates. Got a little joker. Okay. So, and again, like, you know, we're very much motivated by examples, and in particular, eventually t is going to be. Particular eventually, T is going to be is going to be a staple theory, so we're not terribly concerned with that. I don't think I gave any examples, did I? Oh, only no, as far as I know, I don't know. But I will give you a specific example that is in a second. Yes. People to see people. Yeah, so I'm going to get to that on the next slide. I hope I'm not going to hold it. Yeah, so this was first just preserving NSOP1. Okay. So then, to preserve, now this is sort of backwards. I mean, to preserve simplicity, you might then say, well, we'll just kind of do the same thing, adjust this ternary relation to however, and show that it satisfies the axioms in the Kim-Colett theorem. But we ran into some problems, actually. But we ran into some problems, actually, in trying to get a characterization of the independence notion over arbitrary sets, which doesn't have, I mean, maybe a little bit to do with what you were talking about earlier, but actually was a little bit different. Like, you know, Christian, we had a lot of conversations about this. The thing we were trying to formulate, just technical things went wrong when we were working with arbitrary sets. So, oh, okay, sorry, I'm skipping, but yeah, so the open question here. But yeah, so the open question here is obviously: is it enough to assume that T is just an SOP1 here? Yeah, like I said, I think elimination of hyperimaginaries is something you could just get rid of if you really wanted to. But the thing that I really don't have a good picture of is why this kind of stuff was really hard to remove from the flooring calculus, even just when we were trying to get NSOP1. Okay, but for simple, so yeah, this is just a resummary of what happens when Q is NSOP1. Happens when Q is in SOP1, if instead you assumed Q is simple, well then again, you might just want to adjust this to be over arbitrary sets and show that it works. But we ran into all these technical problems, and in fact it didn't work. And so instead, we just kind of took a shortcut, took a cheap way out, and said, well, at least if we assume that MathCalQ is simple, well, now this becomes forking independence in MathCalQ. It has base monotonicity over. It has base monotonicity over arbitrary sets, and then it's enough to tell you that this satisfies base monotonicity over models, and then has to be simple by another result by making a time. Like in an NSOP1 theory, if Q independent satisfies base monotonicity over models, then it's simple, and that's a characterization as well. So that's how we end up getting simplicity. And so in the end, this does give you a characterization of now then forking over models in the simple case, but we actually In the simple case, but we actually don't obtain a full characterization of forking over arbitrary sets. There were a couple natural ways to extend this over arbitrary sets, and both of them kind of broke down. It was like, I don't think they were right. I think it's something weirder, which we didn't see. Existence was one of the, I mean, over models, sure, but when you try to adjust this in a naive way to arbitrary sets, the proof didn't work. I don't remember it was technical. We had to, I mean, we thought it. Technical, we had to. I mean, we thought it worked, but then we saw some weird thing that happened. So I'd have to go back to the lines. But right, yeah, like it was very odd, in fact. So that is a question, is what actually is the characterization, in the simple case, what actually is the characterization of four computer dependents or arbitrary sets? I mean, in particular, just putting an A and an A bar here, like, didn't work. I guess it would be a C. But there was something else we tried too, so. But there was something else we tried too. And so that's my, that's then the reason I'm saying this is, in particular, since we don't have a really complete picture of forking in the simple case, we then did not see a proof for how to preserve super simplicity. That was not on the list. So that's the question. If T and Q are super simplicimplic. So that's a question. If T and Q are super simple, then so is the adjoint theory. It should be, but our understanding of forking wasn't fine enough to at least kind of make an obvious kind of SU rank bound thing work. Like that wasn't going to work. And in the stable case, in the super stable case, it would also have failed if that's the technique we were trying to use, but we got around it by using this different result about super stable, the characterization via saturated poles. Characterization via saturated models. That did work. Not trying to look at U rank of types or anything like that. But if you have a, if it's not super simple, then you get an infinitely quizzing training over models, and you have a correct translation of our models. Yeah, I think there's... We can talk about it, but there's some issue with these omega tuples that you get when you take a bar of something. Yeah, like you can get you can get what you think is a really long forking chain, but for a dumb reason or something like that. I think I don't know, I mean we tried various things like this, and it was we didn't we didn't feel like we had enough control. But maybe, I mean, maybe, yeah. So this is why I'm asking all these questions, right? So you're all Questions, right? So you're also just like exhausted, you know. However, did you have a question? Yeah, sorry. So, in the case of pairs, actually, the characterization of independence would be that A and B have to be non-functional independent over N together with the predicate. So, M, N union Q's. So, not just M, but M union is Q. Other the whole thing, you mean? Yes, on the basis. You need to put the whole thing. So, I think we could catch it over. I think we should get rid of the candidate predicate using translators. Yeah, that was one of these lemmas from this attire then you can't paper. Right. Technically the characterization is actually a bit different, which at the end of the day can be translated into these. So but independence instance of T already com comprise the localization of T because it's already defined there. No, but you need to put you need to put the all of all of the To put all of Q, all of the organizations of Q it's present in the different section, the other function on top of Q, I think so. Maybe not. Okay, so let's continue. So now I'm just going to be summarizing things. Oh, yeah, I guess I'm not that good on time, am I? That's fine. There's stuff I cannot say. So let me just. Not say. So let me just, yeah, a lot of discussion to be had, but let me just move on and summarize. T is a complete theory, Q is stably embedded in T. Math calc Q expands the induced structure on Q. Superstability, stability, superstability, omega stability, NIP, NTP2, those are all preserved from T and math. Then for NSOP1 and simplicity, we have to assume T is simple with elimination of hyperimaginaries and Q satisfies this algebraic embedded S. And then we get some transpose. We get some transpose. So that's the whole picture. So that's the whole picture. Now, I want to go back to the integers. I should at least get that much done before the end of the talk, which is fine. When looking for new expansions of the integers, I can't apply these results to T being the theory of the integers, because there's no option for Q. If you take any infinite definable set in the group of integers, its induced structure essentially already has the group of integers there. So we need to expand Q by some theory. Well, you're already looking for an expansion of the group of integers. For an expansion of the group that is. So we first need to name something, but then this is where we go back to that first slide where we've got these options. So it's a little bit more general. I mean, maybe, you know, if this were a chalk talk, I would shift to just staying with integers, but here's the slide. So now let's let M be a stable structure in a countable language. Assume that we have constants for a countable elementary substructure. This is going to be a setup for how to name a new predicate and then be able to get into our setting. So, first, a very simple lemma. So first, a very simple lemma. In this situation, there's a countably infinite set, which I'm calling Q and M, such that the M-induced structure on Q is just a quality, interdefinable using parameters. And the idea here is just, it's not going to be a definable set, but I can find it. It's let Q be enumerated by a so-called eventually indiscernible sequence. I mean, I'm not assuming M is saturated, so I might not actually have an actual indiscernible sequence, but a so-called eventually indiscernible sequence works. Sequence works? Sorry? I mean, take an eventually indiscernible sequence of points in your model and let Q be that set. Well, it is, but with elements of Q variants as we have to do. Yes, with parameters. Q is it sitting inside the small model? Inside well, M is fixed. M is a fixed model right now. And this is the universe. I'm doing old school style. Old school style. Okay. All right. And okay, so now assume M is super stable of U rank 1 and let Q be one of these sets with no induced structure. That's just the point behind Q, is I can find a set, it might not be definable, but it has no induced structure on it. Then there's a result, kind of putting two results from the literature together, that if I name Q, it's still super stable, and I have not. Super stable, and I have not changed the induced structure on Q. It's still nothing. So this is. We'll now assume M is super stable. It's in red. So super stable of U rank 1. And the preservation of super stability is this Casanova-Ziegler. The U rank 1 comes in to show that Q is bounded in this case, for whatever use of that word is. Use of that word is essentially the induced structure doesn't change, and that's what Chris and I proved. Okay. In this special case, you might be able to prove it more easily. We proved a more general result. All right. So the point is that I start with a super stable structure. I can now, I have this option, super stable URank1. I always have the option of naming a set and having this perfectly blank canvas to then put more structure on top. The induced structure is just. On top. The induced structure is just equality. So this is always possible if I start with something super stable, u rank1. Okay? So by applying our results, then we can expand plane q to any mathcal q we want and preserve all of the ones that didn't require these extra shenanigans. So stability, super stability, omega stability. NIP and NTP2, but again, those were kind of on. Now to get Now, to get a preservation for simplicity at NSOP1, you would also need to know that Q is algebraically embedded. It might always be true. I don't know. Especially under all these, now there's more assumptions. Super stable U rank 1, Q is this eventually indiscernible sequence. Then can you prove this algebraic embeddedness? That'd be great to do it because it would remove that discussion. Okay. But at any rate, going back to the integers, then. Going back to the integers, then we now are looking even more specifically. So, the integers, they are super stable of u rank one. So, I can name one of these q's and have it work. And in particular, a particular choice of q that works is the factorial. So one of the examples from the first slide, the one that I drew your attention to, that one does work. The induced structure there is nothing. That's pretty straightforward to prove directly. And we prove in the paper that it's algebraically embedded. This particular example with the factorials, you can generalize a little bit. We can generalize a little bit, but we weren't able to do all of those examples or any eventually in the sequence. We don't know. Something kind of close, but not quite. Okay, but at any rate, at least we now have an option. We can expand the factorials. And this goes back to what I said at the beginning of the talk. If I told you the answer in the integers from the beginning, you might say, ah, okay, but I think this whole journey is nice too. So now we have, yeah, let Q, Mathcat. So now we have, yeah, let q, math cap q, be an arbitrary structure on the universe of the factorials. And now here I think the bad stuff from the first slide has gone away because I'm talking just about models. Put all that on the factorials, call that Z plus adjoin MathCalQ, and then we get preservation for everything. If MathCalQ is stable, super stable, simple, NID, NTPC minus OB1, then so is this expansion. And moreover, the U rank is at least, this would only be interested in. U rank is at least, this would only be interesting in the super stable case, of course, but the u rank is at least that of MathCalQ. We don't get an upper bound, so going back to your omega times 2, I can't give you like an exact example and tell you exactly what the U rank is, but at least I can get U ranks as high as I want. Bigger than omega, they have to be infinite monomial, of course, but we don't get a perfect identification. What's that? Do you have examples where they're integral? No. I mean, not in the internet. I mean, not deliberately. Maybe we can make one, but we didn't do that. I think the group generated by Q, the subgroup generated by Q is most likely not, I mean, it's not going to be definable. The what? If you look at the subgroup generated by Q, it's most likely not going to be... I think the random potential. The subgroup generated by Q will be everything. Yeah, so it's not going to be. You will not get to it using a Get to it using or definitely many steps. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Q is really sparse. Yeah, yeah. So that's what I'll say. I don't think that's going to be. I think the price is currently. The rank? But in a non-standard model, you will not have that the subcrypt generated by Q is all of the stuff. No. But I think you would need to know something about. Right. Right, I see what you're saying. My comment was that equality of the ranked is not going to happen. Most likely, it won't happen. I mean, it will happen if like MathCalQ is nothing. So then it will be ranked. No, okay, it'll be... I see. No, okay. My common is at ranked point. But past omega, how much more can it go up? That's the question. No, yeah, so I think it would require more intricacies to actually identify. To actually identify the u rank. That's going to be harder. But at any rate, going back to the original, now we have an easy way to get any kind of expansion for a strictly stable expansion of the integers. Just put whatever strictly stable structure you want on countable on the rationals, on free group, on two generators, or something like that, or any kind of graphing. So it's very natural examples in retrospects, but okay. But you know, it's obviously that the theorems are much more general. You know, it's obviously that the theorems are much more general than that. So, yeah, I only have like, you know, two minutes, or according to that clock, maybe no minutes. I think there's only one more slide. I don't know. I'll just put it. There's a question at the end. I've been asking people this question, and I don't know the answer. Let alpha be a countable ordinal. Is there a theory in a finite language with U rank at least alpha? I don't need, the best examples I know are these things like. The best examples I know are this thing like DCF0M has U-rank omega to the M. I can't get past it. So, this has something to do with naming unique predicates. You can read this slide if you want, but I just wanted to show that there because it's a big group of people, and I've emailed a few people, you know, the usual suspects, and I still haven't gotten an example case. So that's it. I'll stop there. I'll leave this slide. The next slide says thank you. So, thank you very much, but I want to leave this up in case people want to see. Any more questions? Yeah, so the initial slide, all of those expansions were unhappy, right? Yes. You were just naming the subset. And I guess my question was going to be, okay, when you randomly expand Q, normally you're adding all kinds of functions. And I guess this was going to answer my question. This is exactly it. But you can still do it with Uniary. So if I have a graph, I can find this. I can find this unary set here that kind of code, it's interdefinable with naming the graph. And then this is what gets to this question by the standard result. If I have a theory in a finite language, I can find it by interpreting the graph and then get a unary predicate that kind of captures it. So that's what gets to this question. But yeah, so you can accomplish a lot of complexity with a unary predicate as well using this trick. One other question is, um is your quantifier elimination good enough, you think, to Well, is there any other way? No. I don't know. I mean, the fact that, like... I don't know. I have no idea. We didn't try. I kind of doubt it, given the fact that, you know, all of these other dividing lines required more work as well. Except maybe stable, literally stable, maybe, is the only one that was truly. Stable maybe is the only one that was really easy. But the JLA case will have super stable of yog1. You don't know. You can always find nice algebraically with key. No, I don't know. I don't know that it's so it my conjecture would be is that if q is an eventually indiscernible sequence, that it is algebraically embedded, but we couldn't quite prove our proof didn't quite get to that. Our proof didn't quite get to that. But Paris, you have some. Verus is the only game to have. Well, so she means weak enough CP, I guess. And I think right now we can. You need some bigger model for the I mean if I have a saturated enough model or something but an arbitrary model. So um because regarding actually the question that you had at the beginning the rank millennial I mean could you imagine that some Could you imagine that some Khrushchevsky Francis amalgamation that you could do something in order to create using a dimension so that the RAC is omega times two, doesn't make sense? I mean, like Bazaar black points, all sorts of things. I could imagine it. I mean, first though, before getting into all that, I would just say, well, let's just take the canonical example of a graph or something like that with whatever u rank you want, put that on the factorial. rank you want, put that on the factorials. And can you get, can you, I mean, maybe if the U rank isn't perfectly equal, can you just give a formula for what the U rank is, depending on the U rank of the graph? But yeah, I don't know. You want to, if we try more complicated things. Very first slide. Are all examples of the same form? No. No, in those examples, some of the induced structure is quite complicated. Some of the induced structure is quite complicated, and that's what makes some of the proofs more difficult. Yeah, the factorials is a very, very special case. Proving stability, where you name the factorials, is much easier than some of those other ones I saw in my first slide. Brett? Thank you. Let me remind you that we have a problem session that you might start thinking of the problems that you're suggesting what the problem is. Robin is the use of testing what the tool is.
