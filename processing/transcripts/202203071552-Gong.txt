So I'm going to be talking about an A infinity category from instantons. All of this is joint work with Professor Kohanda. Okay, so what we're going to be doing is given a disk with endpoints, we're going to be building an A infinity category. Well, sort of. There's like a few little problems where it's not really an A infinity category, but like almost an A infinity category. And mostly the problems are related to grading, because you're supposed to have a Z grading for A infinity categories. But for endpoints on a disk, we're going to build an infinity category. And then we're going to show that there's a finite set of objects such that these objects, like that all the objects in the category can be generated by exact triangles. You can like, you know, if you just take exact triangles with like two of the terms being in yours, like in the set that you've already generated, you can get all of them this way. Okay, so to start, I'm gonna talk. To start, I'm going to talk about what the objects of this category are. So, the objects are going to be given by tangles. So, here I have like, see these endpoints, I guess in this case, n is 4. And we have like n incoming strands and n outgoing strands. So, we're thinking of this as like d2, right? Because it started with n points in the disk, and now it's d2. Like, I'm taking the disk and multiplying, like, crossing 0, 1, and then you're just looking at strands. So, this is going to be the So, this is going to be the objects. And then the morphisms are if you have two of these tangles, D1 and D2, you flip D1, and then you attach it to D2, and you join the ends. And you consider this whole thing in an S3. So this is just some link in S3. And then the morphisms are supposed to be some chain complex, right? So what we're going to do is we're basically going to take the chain complex, like the instant. Are basically going to take the chain complex, like the instant on chain complex of this. But in order to do that, you need a little bit of extra stuff. Like, there's this thing called the atom that's just meant to guarantee that you don't have reducible solutions. And you can choose various, like, basically any of the common choices for atoms works in this case, except like if you do the theta web, then you only have a Zmod2 grading instead of like this atom gives you a Zmod4 grading, which maybe. Z modiform grading, which may be slightly better, still not quite the Z grading that an A infinity category is supposed to have, but whatever. So then you consider this space, and then what you want to do is just take the instanton chain complex of it. So you just choose some metric and perturbation data, and then you take the chain complex associated with the link with this metric and perturbation data. Okay, so the next, oh, I guess the next thing was going to be how to compose things, but first let me just briefly talk about what instanton chain complex. This is supposed to say instanton for chain complex and not homology at the top, but oops. So the chain complex for this, for this, something like this is going to be generated by flat connections. It's a chain complex generated by flat connections with a singularity at the link, and I guess a different singularity. And I guess a different singularity at this red line. And then, like, the differentials is going to be generated by anti-self-dual connections. So, like, you take your S3 with the link and you sort of times R, and then you consider anti-self-dual connections on this four-manifold with singularity at the link times R. And then just some basic facts about this. So, the instant on chain complex of the unfortunate. So the instanton chain complex of the unknot has two gen is given by two generators, u plus and u minus. These are meant to correspond to like 1 and x in Havana homology. And then there's like some kind of merge map where like u plus really corresponds to 1 in like actual sense. Okay, and then like what you want to do is you want to be able to compose morphisms. So if I have a morphism from D1 to D2, From D1 to D2, given by some element in the chain complex of this L D1 D2 and some morphism D2 to D3, then I want to be able to get a morphism from D1 to D3. So in other words, I want some map from the instanton chain complex of L D2 bar D3, tensor L D1 bar D2 to L D1 bar D3. And then we're going to do this by like sort of thinking about what we have. So this is like D1 bar D2 and D2 bar D3. And D2 bar D3, these are just like these links. I mean, this is not a good picture, but you know what I meant. And then you have like, and they're like in separate S3s, right? So the first thing you've got to do is like somehow move these two links to be in the same copy of S3. So you do an excision for that. And then you, and then after that, you want, like, so first thing you want to do is like move these two to be in the same copy of S3 so that you can actually like kind of Of S3, so that you can actually kind of cancel the D2s, right? Because you want to go from D1, D2, D2, D3 to D1, D3. So that basically means you want to cancel the D2s. And so to move these two to the same copy, you do this thing called excision, which basically is this math where it's given by some kind of addition of one band cobordism. Addition of one band cohortism times like the two torus. So, in other words, it's saying, like, if you look at the two ends of it, on one end, you should have, like, you it's basically, if you compare the two ends, it's like on one end you cut out two toruses and then you like glue, reglue in a kind of swapped way, right? Like, that's what happens when you sort of take this and this. So, like, what are the tornado? Okay, well, whatever, I think this is like you either believe me or. Like you either believe me or you don't. So then, here in this case, what we want to do is like you take this, the torus is sort of going around like one component of the hoplink that you've added. And then you take the insides and you glue them on this side. And then the outsides are sort of glued like this. So the sides with the links are glued together, and this sides without the links are glued together. And I guess in this, there's like a little And I guess in this, there's like a little bit of extra stuff you need. Like, for example, it is actually important that this torus, the torus run in blue, intersects the red arc. Like, if you had the other atom, the theta web, you would have to intersect it like three times or something. But then now that they're like, your two links are on the same side, now we want to take a map from like L D1 bar D2, like union with LD2 bar D3 to like LD1. bar d3 to like ld1 bar d3 and so the first thing you can do is just like add bands to like sort of get rid of everything that's in between the two d2s so that your d2s are lined up together and now if they were just if d2 were just a braid you can just like cancel them right because like every crossing in d2 would be cancelled with the corresponding crossing in d2 bar with like a ridermeister move but since they're not grades you can't really do that like if you have d2 looking like this and you have d2 bar Looking like this, and you have D2 bar, then you can't just sort of like cancel them. But what you can do is just say, well, we're just gonna add a band, like to every local maximum in D2, you add a band to the corresponding local minimum in D2 bar. And there's like somehow a lot of choices of ways you can add the bands, but it doesn't actually matter in the sense that if you add them differently, you're going to get, well, okay, so first of all, if you add them in different ways, for example, if I put this pink line. Example: If I put this pink line going under the orange instead of over or something, you get like, I guess, a different cobordism, but it would be isotopic. But that's actually still not really good enough because somehow like isotopic cobordisms, they give you homotopic maps, they don't give you the same map. But like, it turns out you can just sort of choose. Like, you can just like everything that you just sort of, just like how we kind of just choose the perturbations earlier, like, you can just sort of choose. Like. You can just sort of choose which you want to do. And then, okay. And then once you've done that, you're going to create some extra components and you just sort of cap them off. And that gives you this map from like from L, from this, from hom D1D2 tensor hom d2 d3 to hom d1 d3. Okay, and then I guess like when you have when you have when you When you have some kind of composition, maybe you want there to be identities. So for a link, for a tangle D, I kind of want there to be an identity element in hom from D to itself. And it turns out that that's kind of hard, but what you can just sort of do is construct a homotopy identity. And so what that means is, so we want to construct some element in like Hong. In like HOM D bar D, sorry, in HOM from D to itself, which is the instant on chain complex of this link, to some element here such that when you compose with it, you get something that's isotopic to the identity. And so the way you do this is you can just take, it's kind of like the same thing we did when we were composing. You just take every local maximum in D and connect it to the corresponding local minimum in D bar. Local minimum in d-bar, like by going just sort of around the same place where you added all these, like when you connected the ends. And then, like, yeah, so then once you do that, you get some kind of, some unlink, and then you just take the element in the unlink, the identity element of the unlink, which is just the tensor product of the u pluses, and then you, this is like this map, this is a cohortism between these two pictures, right? And then you just sort of take the image of the And then you just sort of take the image of the coordinate on the left. Okay, and then I guess to show that this is actually a homotopy identity, what you can kind of do is you say, okay, well, suppose I'm composing with some map like from D to D1, then that's what you're doing is you're sort of adding these bands, and then you're also somehow like adding bands like this from each loco maximum to the corresponding local minimum in D-bar. And then, like, if you just sort of think about what's happening. And then, like, if you just sort of think about what's happening, what's really happening is you're just like merging in an unlink. You're merging in the components of an unlink one by one. Okay. Okay, so, and then the next thing you want to do is you want to compose, like, construct these like mu3 maps, et cetera. So, what that means is, like, the mu3 map is meant to be a homotopy between different sort of Between different between composing in different orders. So, one thing you can do is you can start by like, so basically, composing in one order is like, this is like D1 bar D2, D2, bar, D3, and D3 bar D4 or something. And composing in one order basically means you're like doing this merge and then waiting an infinite amount of time and then doing the other merge. And if you want to swap the orders, you basically want to swap the order of where these two things are. The order of where these two things happen. And that, like, you can just sort of slide across each other the way you usually do. And so, the way you would do that is you basically say, I'm going to take some one-dimensional family of metrics that goes from this order to that order, and you count instantons on this one-dimensional family of metrics. And there's just a little bit of some subtlety here where you have to show that you actually can slide them against a cross. Can slide them against across each other. So, you know, that somehow the two things they're going to give you the same cobordism, but you want to show that like where the action is happening is like is sort of disjoint, so that it makes sense to talk about one like sliding them time-wise. And like, that's just kind of true. It just involves a little bit of bookkeeping where you basically Where you basically say that, like, here in this case, I have, so I have these, like, this is this picture, these three things are like those three up here, and I had this black and orange dots represent the two components of the hop flink. And because the excision, like, okay, so the part that's not the excision is like kind of, it's kind of clear that the action is happening. Of clear that the action is happening disjoint from each other, you just sort of have to figure out what's going on with the excisions. And in this case, like what you do with the excision is you say, Let's call these the first and second components of the hop link. And then each time you do an excision, you have to keep track of where the link is going. So when you do this, you want to make sure that in the first picture, the link is going with the first component, and in the second picture, the link is going with the second component. So basically, what I'm saying is. So basically, what I'm saying is for each S3 with a link, you kind of want to have two tori, right? One that puts the link with the first component and one that puts the link with the second component. And if you just sort of make sure your tori don't intersect each other, then like you can ensure that like these sort of like basically, you can ensure that these crossings are away from each other so that you can slide them in a way that makes sense. So in this case, yeah, like I have these, like in each picture, you have like these two tori, the blue one and the green one, and so they like separate the components. And for one of them, the torus is like, the link is going with the first component, and the other one is going with the second, and you just sort of keep track of where everything is going. And you can, like, if you just, I mean, I guess this is like a lot of detail. I guess this is like a lot of detail, but you can just sort of like it's just true. Okay, you can like, you can do this. Okay. And then I guess the thing I wanted to talk about was like the finite generation. So I want to show that like this category can be finitely generated. And so what this means, so to think about that, you sort of want to think about what it means to be like an exact triangle. To be like an exact triangle. And it turns out there's this lemma in Seidel's book about exact, like, about when a triangle is exact. It's some homological algebra thing. And I mean, I guess his book is for actual A infinity categories, but this still works with Omega C mod 4 grading. And so, like, basically, we're saying that if you have these three pictures. Like these three pictures up here, and you have these maps C1, C2, and C3, then they're an exact triangle if you compose two of them, what you get is a null homotopic. So this H1 is going to be the null homotopy of composing two of them. And then what you also want is that the map, so that like this H1 sort of goes in the opposite direction to C1. Sort of goes in the opposite direction to C1, right? And so then, like, if you want to map from one picture to the to the, like, to the cone of the other two, you would basically take C2 and H1, right? In this case, if you want the first to like the cone of the second, and then you want to say that that's like that that map, well, that like the first picture is the cone of the second, which is to say that this like the cone of that map that you get is acyclic. Is acyclic, so that's, and that's what this is really saying. So, like, the HIs are like the null homotopies of doing two things, and these k's are sort of to show that what you get is acyclic. And this, like, and the construction of the hi's, it follows from like the same, like an argument similar to what Kronheimer and Rafka used to show their spectral sequence. So basically, you have like two. You have like two, if you do two of these, like compose like C2 and C3, then you can sort of look at what the picture looks like where you're doing this composition. So you have one band and then another band, and in this picture you can see this Mobius script, and you can sort of pull it out, pull out a neighborhood of it, and that's sort of pulling out this S3 RP2 out of this cohortism. And then you show that, like, if you stretch along this line that sort of pulls out this Mobius band, what you get is something that is zero. There's no maps because of various, like, basically because of dimension arguments. And then if you, like, and, but if you stretch along this line, then what you get is just the composition of two, right? So this picture is, so like if you take a one-parameter family that goes from stretching this to stretching this, you're going to Stretching this to stretching this, you're going to get like a null homotopy of the composition of two. And that gives you the H maps. And then the K maps, they're like they're a little bit more complicated, but it's like, it's still kind of similar to what something they did. So basically you want to satisfy this, I mean, okay, so showing that this thing is acyclic is almost the same as satisfying this equation. As satisfying this equation, and like in that it's like the same argument, but basically, you want to satisfy this equation, you basically want to consider a polygon of metrics such that on the boundaries, which are segments, then you get terms like these. And in Kronheimer and Rafka's paper, they did something like this for their spectral sequence, too. For their spectral sequence, too, but it's like it was a little bit simpler because they actually had like these maps were actually compositions of like cobordisms as opposed to like this thing that's sort of isotopic to a composition of cobordisms but isn't quite that. So what you do is you kind of can isolate different parts of this picture and you want to show that like what you get is so you want to show that like you get some formula. Want to show that you get some formula like this. So, what you do is you consider this polygon of metrics. In this case, I'm going to consider this heptagon. I think for their paper, they only needed a pentagon, but that's because they actually had composition in a more real sense. So, in particular, for their picture, they never needed to consider any kind of new 3 map because they're like. You know, that there are like morphisms actually composed, like, actually. So, what we're doing here is like we're saying, so in this hectagon, this is like a family of metrics, and then at each vertex, I'm saying you want to stretch along two of these curves. So, for example, like S1L2 here means that this is like fully stretched out. So, everything happening up here is. So everything happening up here is happening infinitely before, and this is L2 is also fully stretched out, right? So that means like you do all of this first, you do, and all of this, and then you sort of, and then like, so here, for example, if you look at what E2 is, it's going from S1L2 to S1S2, which means that S1 is fully stretched out, and you're going from going from L2 to S2. So you're going from stretching out L2 to stretching out S2, which if you think about it, that's actually a mu3 term. It's like you do mu2 with S1 first, and then you have a mu3 that goes from like doing this first to doing that first. And if you look at E1 term, this is like S1 is Felly's. This is like S1 is fully stretched out, and you're going from T2 to L2, which means you just sort of ignore this part, S1, mu1. You're doing like a mu2 with this thing first, and then to go from T1 to L2, T2 to L2, right. So you're going from T2 to L2, like with T2 fully stretched out, that was like the zero, right? Because going from T2 to L2 was Because going from T2 to L2 was what we did, like going from stretching T2 to stretching L2 was basically what we did to do the H1 term. So in this case, like this term, E1 is basically going to be doing like a mu2 with one of the CIs and the corresponding HI, which is, I guess, actually this term. Yeah? Maybe it's explaining. So there's different colors, and I don't feel like I understand what the colour is. I don't feel like I understand what the colours are helpful for. Oh, um the colours are so that if if they there weren't colours then the labels would like so T1 and T2 are similar colours oh yeah so T1 and T2 each kind of hold like an S3RP2. Okay. Like so they're basically this. Okay. Like and so when this is fully stretched out you get zero. Get zero. And then, like, going between stretching this and stretching this is what gives you H1. So, like, in this case, it's like going between stretching S2 and stretching T2 is what gives you H1. Okay. What is the blue here? The blue is the extracobordism. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, and so that's what gives you this like. And so that's what gives you this finite generation. And I guess that's what I have for you. I know I'm finishing very early, but if I had drawn these pictures on the board, I would have taken the whole 50 minutes. All right. So I assume it's it's generated by like crossingless, yeah. Yeah, crossing list. Yeah, I guess like somehow of these and then some straight lines coming down. Yeah. Yeah, it's generated by crossing list diagrams where like you have you can like join upwards or like downwards. But also, I guess I didn't really say this, but like, you know, if you just try to resolve all the crossings, you might end up with extra components. But it turns out you can like, yeah, twist the components away. Right, right, right. I mean, yeah, you end up with something, union, disjoint union, or unknot. That's then the unknown can be. And the unknown can be generated by like. Yeah. And I mean, what? So I actually never understood this. I mean, what in who cares about having an integer grading? I'm not sure. But like, it does mean that whenever I apply some lemma, I have to actually check that line. I mean, I know that if you want to study a infinity, possibly a infinity deprivations or something like that using Coxfield homology, then, you know. Yeah, I mean I guess it was just like slightly lying to say that I had an A infinity category since I didn't have the integrating but let me So having this A infinity category and knowing that it's finally generated by these specific links means that you can find like you can you can You can construct an aim from the algebra from the generating set, like looking at the homes between objects that generate and associate links with, you know, associate to tangles infinity modules over this algebra and then get a, you know, get a pairing theorem and things like that. Probably, yeah. Not any sense for how complicated. Sense for how complicated the standard algebra is like probably things like that. Questions for Share? John, at the point that you get the what are all of you by Was you use this to like you get an algebra and then you have a module. And then we have a module for a crossing or something and something like that, yeah, just sort of a border period. I mean the problem, you know, a few years ago got a similar idea for three months or three months older variants. The problem there is just accumulating. Any other questions? Right? Thanks for having me. We're guessing adjourned. Yeah. See you everyone again. No more coffee breaks. This is just dinner. I'll let it. A little more time. I don't think any of these
