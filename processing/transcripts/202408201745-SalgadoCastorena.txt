Beyond the generic case. So thank you. Hi, my name is Guadalupe. I'm a PhD student at WAM and I will speak about the low density limit quantum Markov semi-group. These are some advances of my Some advances of my PhD program. The online talent, I will speak about only the form of the generator because previously have seen some this. Then I will speak one three generic case and finally I will the main result. The main result about the diagonal invariant state in the previous tree generic case. So, for the form of the low density limit, generators acting on an eye state have this form where involves enough regular N of regular function, and we have characteristic functions on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian, and we have spectral projections and T that are sorry, that are the scattering completely positive maps. So for a trigeneric case, So, for a trigineric case, we consider this Hamiltonian, where the matrix associated with this Hamiltonian is a diagonal matrix, where the eigenvalues are positives and are ordered. The relationship between the frequencies and these eigenvalues are given in this table and the And the associated transition diagram is given by this. For the set of four frequencies, it is given by this set, where we have seven frequencies. One for one level transitions, for two level transitions, and for three level transitions. And for the frequency zero, it's allowed. And the three generic case, sorry. Sorry, name, the 3DNEC name is given by because the one-level transitions appear three times. Now, with these seven frequencies, we can separate in positive frequencies and negative frequencies. So, the generators take this form for form for frequencies positives are this and negative frequencies is given by this and the complete generators is this sum in every frequency now if assume that the regular enough function is given by this exponential the generator associated with each frequency Associated with each frequency can be written as follows. We have this space for positive frequencies where the operator LMN is a multiplus of these projections. And the scalars take this form. And for negative frequencies, the generator associates this. Generator associated at these negative frequencies is given by this expression. But for this, we need this assumption that is a type of detailed balance condition. So, the main result is find to invariant states in with this. In with this Hamiltonian. So we will find some conditions for this Hamiltonian. And we found a diagonal state rho that is invariant if and only if these conditions are satisfied. Even more if all t's are different of. Are different from zero, then the diagonal invariant state is unique. So for this, if we take these values, then the generators take these new phases and with these new conditions. So if row is the diagonal, then the generator is invariant if and only if. invariant if and only if the previous conditions are satisfied. For the uniqueness, we notice that rho is invariant if and only if p is an invariant measure of the continuous time Markov chain with intensive transition matrix Q. If all again Again, these T's are different from zero, then it's irreducible and P is unique. If T are different from zero, the following statements are equivalent. From the Markov chains, which Q, the OR matrix. Our matrix is reversible and the Kolmogorov criteria is satisfied. Finally, the unique diagonal invariant state is in the tidal balance. That means row that is diagonal satisfies this condition. And is oh. Is there any question? Okay, let's thanks, speaker again.
