Okay everyone, let's get started. This is the last talk of basically of a day and then we'll have time for you. If you want to work together, you can work together, you can take a break, you can do what you want. Yeah, so you might have noticed on the schedule that there are three sessions titled Professional Development that I am leading. So, and many of you may be wondering. So, and many of you may be wondering what the heck is that? So, first of all, like in our research careers, we're often very much trained on the technical skills, which makes absolute sense because as statisticians and biostatisticians, we know the work that we do is pretty damn hard, right? So, we really need to spend the time and the energy to do that type of work. But, at least, in my experience and in my opinion, My experience, and in my opinion, there are a lot more skills that are involved in developing a successful career. And so, I've been fortunate to do actually now close to 600 hours of different trainings. And I wanted to share some of the skills with you all that are very, very simple, things you can easily incorporate into your life. And if you don't like it, no worries. It's only three sessions and then you don't have to think about this anymore. You don't have to think about this anymore. But I know we're all busy people, and so I just wanted to share some of these skills with all of you. So please just entertain me, be open to it. It might feel a little bit weird, but just try it out. So the very first skill is about a centering exercise. With the idea being that, you know, as researchers, as we advance in our career, we tend to get pulled in many, many different directions, right? We want to focus on getting. Directions, right? We want to focus on getting this one paper out, but our students email us, we get these collaboration and new ideas, and we're getting pulled in many different directions. And there's been different studies about how research leaders, the ones that are most effective, are the ones that are able to quickly and calmly refocus on their task, re-center themselves to advance. Okay? So this exercise, the centering exercise, is just a breathing exercise. Centering exercise is just a breathing exercise. So, some of you who've done yoga or meditation, maybe you're more familiar with it. And this might feel really weird doing it in a professional setting, but I'm just going to ask you just to try it out. It's only five minutes, and then you're there. So, this centering exercise, it's called GEN, like the name J-E-N, and it stands for Jaws, Eyes, Neck. Okay, so if you like to try it out with me, So, if you like to try it out with me, I'm going to ask you if you can sit with your legs uncrossed. And if you're able to touch the floor, go ahead and put your legs on the floor. And if you feel comfortable, close your eyes or lower and soften your gaze. Put your palms on your hands wherever you feel comfortable. And I'm going to ask you to sit with dignity, whatever that means to you. That means to you. And I'd like you to start breathing normally and bring your attention to your breath. Now, with every exhale, I'm going to ask you to start releasing any tension you may hold in your jaws, eyes, neck. Eyes, neck. Maybe other thoughts are coming to mind. That's okay. Continue to focus on releasing tension on your jaws, eyes, neck. Let you continue that exercise again. Exercise and with every exhale, release tension in your jaws, eyes, necks.      Next breath, take one long inhale. On your exhale, slowly open your eyes. Slowly open your eyes and bring your presence back to the room. I hope this was just a very simple three-minute exercise. I hope that brings some sense of calm and peace as we're getting pulled in many different directions throughout our day. If it's very something you can, if you choose to do it, you can do it anytime. Today's focus is Today's focus is about creativity and clarity, and I'll explain what that means in just a bit. But before diving into that, I want to start off kind of what gave rise to this whole professional development stuff that I got into. So recently I came across this comment from Liz Foslian, who basically on the left, we see this person who made it to the top of the mountain. You know, I did it. It's the strength that we're taught to admire. It's the strength that we're taught to admire. You know, these are the people that got the grant, got the fellowship, got that award, got that paper published in that high-impact journal. And that's amazing, and they're amazing. We think, oh my gosh, like they're wonderful, and they truly are. It's amazing work. But there's also another type of strength. Those people who had to overcome lots and lots of challenges just to get to the bottom of the mountain. Right? These are the strengths that. These are the strengths that I also believe we should also admire. And what I like about this comic is that, one, I definitely agree with this comic, and for me, it actually represents my own career, with the right-hand side being the case. I'm sure, like many of you, you've all had your challenges, and I did too. And it took me a really, really long time to appreciate the fact that. To appreciate the fact that, yes, those challenges really sucked when I was in them, but the way that all of that challenge led to so much growth and so much skills that I would never give back. So, there were two key challenges in my career that really made a dent. So, my first one was starting when I was 17 years old. That's when I went to college. For multiple reasons, I couldn't, my parents just couldn't. My parents just couldn't afford for me to go to college, and I also wasn't eligible to go for financial aid. So I was fortunate to get my first year of a scholarship from UC Irvine, so in Southern California, but that was it. And so for that first year, I had to try to find my way to get money. And I applied to so many different scholarships, got a ton of rejections. So I don't know, some of you, you know, typically when you get your PhD. You know, typically when you get your PhD, the next thing one of your career stages is going through that grant writing process. I don't know if any of you have done that, but basically, I got to do that when I was 17. So I got that experience really, really early on. And it sucked to not have money, but man, I learned how to really build those skills. This was a starting point to later in my grant writing. The second key challenge that happened in my career was when I was an assistant professor. Was when I was an assistant professor in 2016, I had my first baby, Addie, and I just was really struggling. Like, I just really struggled in my career. I didn't know how I could be the mom that I wanted to be and the amazing researcher that I also wanted to be. And I just, I was floundering, honestly. And I ended up meeting a woman who made this comment to me saying, you know, when you see Olympians, When you see Olympians, right, like they have coaches, right? To get to that level of Olympic-level athlete, you have to have a coach. Like, nobody is going to look at the Olympics and see at those Olympians, like, hey, why do you have a coach? Like, come on, just, you know, do it by yourself, right? Nobody would ever do that. So she asked me, like, you know, if you want to be an Olympian-level researcher, why are you not asking for help? Right? And so that was like really transformative to me. And that led into And that led into me pursuing different trainings. Like I said, I've done over 600 hours now. I've trained in time management, stress management, leadership skills, mentoring skills, grant writing skills. I became a grant writing coach. I was able to help different early career faculty members get their first R01, K01, National Science Foundation Career Award. It's been amazing, right? But I had to have those challenges to get there. So, anyway, so I like. So, anyway, so I like, I get it. This whole professional development, like, you know, why are we wasting our time with that? This is like the technical stuff we got to do. I'm going to argue that I think it's valuable. Okay. So anyway, so my next, so I shared with you a breathing exercise. The next exercise is about how we can help either ourselves or our mentees come up with a compelling research idea. Research idea. So, this idea comes from, like I said, I took this really, really intensive grant writing for four years. And this, I learned different skills. And here is, I believe, a structure for how to sell a compelling research idea. I would say this is more for an abstract or an intro. For a grant, it's a different story. It's a grant story funnel. I'm happy to talk to you if you're interested in that, but I think. Interested in that, but I think since not all of us write grants, I thought this would be more appropriate. So, what is this funnel shape? So, the idea is that to really sell your idea, you want to start with the why. What is the problem? There's a problem that exists, and here's why we care to address that problem. Right? The why. Once you've established that, then you can say, okay, the background. You can say, okay, the background. Like, there's current approaches that do exist to try to solve that problem, but they're not good enough yet. There's still a gap that we need to address. And then finally, so you've established like there's a problem, there's some work in the literature, but it's still not good enough. And so here you come in, you sell your opportunity space. Here's your idea, your magic idea to fill in the gap. Right? So, what I, the reason that this is a So, the reason that this is a fuddle shape is because it helps the reader really narrow in to appreciate your solution. Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of problems that can go wrong in trying to develop this. But I think if you can think about like, hey, I want to really focus in to that idea, that's what's going to sell it. And then, of course, you want to end with, hey, here's my amazing idea, and here's how I advance the field. The few. So, when I worked, when I was working with faculty members and also my own mentees, getting this funnel shape is really hard. There's a lot of iterations. And there was always people getting different funnels. And it was all going all over the place. So I was thinking about how can I make this easier? So I came up with something that I call With something that I call the six core questions to gain clarity and creativity. I'm going to read over the questions and I'm going to explain the way that I encourage you all to use it. I'm going to point out I will share these slides and resources with you all, so please take pictures, no worries, but I will also share it with you just in case. So, what are these six questions and how do I use it to especially help well, mentees? Well, mentees, but also early career or faculty members, actually, because I've helped a lot of senior folks that still have trouble. So, first, where are you sharing this paper? What specific journal or specific conference? Number two, the audience profile. Who is your target audience? What statistical techniques should they know? What are their likes? What are their dislikes? Dislikes? What is the problem you're addressing? What approaches exist to address that problem? What are their limitations? What are the consequences of those limitations? And finally, what's your opportunity space? That is, what is your idea to address the gap limitations with those existing approaches? Now, how could you use this? So, for example, another reason I'm sharing For example, like, and another reason I'm sharing it now is because, as I said, we're going to have working sessions, meaning that you can all get together and start working on ideas. And maybe, if you choose, use these questions to guide some of your thinking process. So, how could you do that? Well, for example, I mean, for example, and you don't have to go in order, but for example, suppose we just listened to these amazing talks and an idea came to you, like, hey, I want to do like non-parametric thing with the tail, right? Thing with the tail, right? So, hey, I have this idea. This is what I want to do, right? And some people tend to stop here, like, yay, that's never been done before. It's going to be awesome. People are going to love it, right? But what I encourage you to do then is not stop there, because that's, you're going to set yourself up for getting those rejections. Instead, okay, so here's my idea. Then I'd encourage you, for example, to go back and say, well, answer foreign. Can say, well, answer four and five, meaning, why is your solution better than what exists in the field? Right? If you can convince, like, hey, this is better than that idea, that's a pretty good start to start selling a compelling argument. And then, you know, or another thing, even, hey, what problem are you really solving? And does it really need to be solved? So I'm give another example. So for example, Give another example. So, for example, like suppose I really like generalized linear models, and I just heard this talk from Roland. He did on a regression case, and I want to do it to GLM. And I'm like, yeah, let's do GLM. It's never been done. Actually, we did GLM. Sorry. Suppose he did linear regression, and I'm like, yeah, GLM, this is it, right? But is that really a problem that needs to be solved? Maybe like Roland's regression is just a minor twist and it's GLM. So is that really? And it's GLM. So, is that really a problem that needs to be solved? So, by answering this question, you can, it's not to discard your idea, but it forces you to think, hey, how can I make my idea better? Maybe I don't stop at GLM. Maybe I do something else. Is there really a problem that I'm trying to solve or am I just creating a problem? Then also, this is really, really important. The audience profile. Fine, you have your idea, but does your audience really like it? But does your audience really like it? Will your audience like it? So, let me give an example. So, I wrote an R01, it didn't get funded. And the way that it happened was like I saw all of these Bayesian methods out there. I'm exaggerating, but just bear with me. There were a hundred Bayesian methods, and I was like, We can do so much better. We don't need that Bayesian crap. Like, let's do this other thing. I'm gonna call it Frequentist Say. I'm going to call it Frequentist Say. And I was like, yeah, this is it. Like, it's never been done before. This is awesome. And then I gave it to my NIH reviewers, and I didn't look at my audience, and lo and behold, those reviewers were Bayesians. So here I was saying, you've got to use this really amazing frequentist idea. It's never been done before. And I mean, the Bayesians were very nice. I mean, the Aphesians were very nice to me, but I would imagine that they would say, Well, you dummy, like, why would you use Frequentis when Abesian? There's a reason we use this stuff because it's really, really cool. Right? But this is, I'm exaggerating, but this is a common challenge in that people don't consider their audience. Right? You're trying to sell an idea without really thinking, will these people actually like it? Yes. But when you submit a grant to an IH, When you submit a grant to NIH, how do you know your reviewers are biased or not? Beautiful question. So, with NIH, we're quite lucky in that we have access to the roster of the review panel. So, yes, there are some members that will be new and others who are more permanent. So, the way that I approach it is I just take a look at my review panel and I take a look briefly at their papers. What are they? At their papers. What are they publishing on? Which means things that they like. So these people, they were publishing a lot of Bayesian work, and I was like, no, no, you guys, don't do that. Do something else. So that's one way to get your audience profile. Another way, for example, again, I'll share other ideas, but just focusing on NIH for right now. So NIH, they have a system called NIH Reporter, where you can see which grants have been funded. Been funded. So I initially, when I first approached that, I thought, oh man, like if I see an idea similar to mine, like I can't do it anymore because it's already been done. No. NIH is very conservative. If they're funding a particular topic, they like that stuff. Yes, you can't be exactly the same thing, but it's saying, like, hey, this is in this area, there's some interest. So that gives me my likes. My likes. For other panels like NSF or even, yeah, I mean, NSF, you're like, I think, well, yeah, NSF, I don't know because they don't share their panel information. But I think even, for example, I mean, even thinking about what has been published in the field recently, or looking at, for example, the invited sessions at ENAR and Wienar, like your conference. At ENAR and weNAR, like your conferences, have you looked at those in the past year? What are those invited sessions really talking about? That's what the field is talking about. So, for example, right now, you know, AI, machine learning, that's hot. So, if I were to come in and be like, that's stupid, like, let's not do that. That is just going to throw me off. I have to acknowledge that that exists. So, I'm happy to share other ideas about audience profile, how to get that, because that's super, super important. Super, super important. But just let me, just a few more minutes, and then I'm happy to take more questions. But finally, and then suppose you have your idea: why is number one important? Well, for example, there's a journal called The American Statistician, which is more an educational journal. So that's like what I want to do. Like, even though I have maybe beautiful asymptotic theory and beautiful proofs and everything, if I want to sell it in the American Statistician, I'm going to have. Sell it in the American statistician, I'm going to have to do a lot of work to make sure that it's really easy to use. So that's going to drive: hey, am I going to spend all my time writing all of these beautiful proofs, but maybe I need to focus on selling the ideas simple? So that is where number one comes in. So, anyway, so yeah, so I have found these questions quite targeted. And what I would encourage you to do, if you use these questions, is to iterate. Like, once you have an answer. Iterate. Like, once you have an answer, think: okay, is my problem? Does my audience like that? I don't know. Maybe I need to refine it. Like, I really need to understand what is the problem. So, I'm going to share these slides with you. But in addition, I have created something called, I'm calling a research toolkit. I want to step back, I forgot to acknowledge. So, I came up with these ideas, but I was really fortunate to work with a colleague, Nicole Dozell at Reek Forest University, who helped me refine the material. Who helped me refine the material. So I really appreciate her help. But what I'm gonna, in this research toolkit, what I have, what we I'm gonna share with you, are these questions and then a suggested feedback checklist. So this is maybe your way to check your work or even better, if you're working with mentees, hey, here's a checklist. Do the work, see if you go through this, and then come back to me and talk to me. Right? So it's a way as mentors. So, it's a way as mentors to really put like help your mentee train and learn before they come to you. I've also created an example where you can see what happens from the, like an example that goes from the questions to a fully drafted introduction. So, you can see how you can take those questions and create that funnel shape. So, you can see those steps involved and how many iterations it can take. How many iterations it can typically take. And then finally, examples of seemingly okay but problematic text. So, meaning these are examples that I've seen over and over again, especially as a grant reviewer, of things that, you know, I can see right away why this grant isn't going to be funded. But this is more for an introduction. So, common issues I've seen when working with individuals. Individuals. So that's it. That was it. But I'm happy to take more questions. I will share this in a Google Drive with all of you so you can use it. Really, the main point, you know, as mentors, like I said, and mentees, I'm still a mentee, like our time is precious, right? So here's maybe one way to try to save a little bit of time. Thank you. I'm happy to take questions at this point. Yes, that's right. Okay, great. This is awesome. Thank you. I guess I have a question about the relationship between audience and journal. Yeah. I guess I'm wondering which one comes first. Do you think about your audience before you figure out what journals they read or the other way around? Output transcript: Journals they read, or the other way around? That's a really good question. I would say the audience is number one first. I would choose the journal after, personally. Like after, personally, I would do all of this and then find a journal that fits it. Yeah. Unless, yeah, yeah. Honestly, that's it. Yeah. Other questions? Yes. Yeah, I have a question. Maybe still relevant to our audience. Sure, please, yeah. So, when you use a So when you submit the NIH grant applications, it's different from how you submit the paper because how much of the technical details do you put into the grant application? That's a really great question. So the question is about technical details. Okay, so honestly, the big thing to get a grant funded is you really need to sell the why. Okay, so this is a concept. Okay, so this is a concept my students have heard over and over again. So bear with me, students. But so, really, to sell a grant, there are two key things, desire and trust. That's it. What I mean by that, so this is very much like marketing, because you are marketing, you're science. So desire means people want, like, want to solve that problem. People are interested in solving. People are interested in solving happening with that problem. You have to have desire. If there's no desire for that problem, it doesn't matter how many technical details you have, your grant is out. It's similar, like in marketing, right? Like if I were to say to you all, for example, this is really maybe too much, but like if I said, hey, I have, there's this like, There's this like really green, slushy, chunky drink. And if you drink it every day for like a year, you're going to be the most productive self ever. Come, drink this drink every single day. Maybe some of you are like, sign me up, right? But maybe most of you, I'm guessing, is like, I don't want to drink that drink. I don't care about productivity. Like, I don't care that much about productivity, right? So there's no desire for that slushy, chunky drink. Okay? So, Okay, so desire is really, yes, there's the field is interested in this stuff. It matters. Trust is those details, like, hey, I can do the work. Here's my technical details to show you. I can solve this problem. I can bring this solution to life. The reality is, if you have high or medium desire, but low trust, But low trust, meaning like you maybe left out some technical details, you have a still a really good chance of getting funded. But you have no chance if your technical details are like hot stuff, you have everything, you know, all your T's dotted, whatever that is, T's crossed, I's dotted, but have no desire, your grant is up. Okay, so how much technical details you want to include, I would say, have you sold your audience on the why first? Why first? Okay, that's the main question. Once, and then the technical details is really now keep in mind, right, you're dealing with reviewers who are super smart people, but they come from many, many different areas. So if you're going to include technical details, the way that I encourage people to write it is you want to have, like, fine, have the technical detail, but also a simple explanation so that if I get lost in the technical stuff, I'm And the technical stuff, I know exactly what you were trying to say to me. So I can blaze over that and be like, oh, yeah, that's what they meant. That's a common mistake that I see in grants. People just go, Google the technical, but they don't explain. And you have to keep in mind your audience, because I've seen this, is people who are super busy running after their kids, probably writing, you know, reading the grants. Writing, you know, reading the grants next to a bathtub while their kid is like throwing toys out of the bathtub, right? So your audience is someone who's tired, cranky, doesn't want to do this work, right? But they have to do this work, right? But so if you can sell to that, you can sell to anyone. Yes, Indeed. Yeah, I'm wondering in what respect the language or the writing or the editing or the structure of the language. The editing on the structure of the graphs, or maybe the results? Absolutely, absolutely. Is clarity matters, right? So, trying to write as simple and clear as possible is really one of the best ways, right? Because again, you're dealing with that crinky reviewer. But again, it doesn't matter how beautiful the writing is. If you're solving a problem that nobody cares about, there's no desire, it doesn't matter. Desire, it doesn't matter. Yes. So, put it in the context of you can workshop accepting. Yes. Can you elaborate now? How did we do this with this? Well, that's a good question. I remember watching. You know, we did also a lot of iterations. At one point, there's what the the beginning sentence that made me feel I we are going to get it. Me feel I we are going to get it. What was the you're going to say, how many people's lives? Oh, I don't remember, I don't remember. Yeah, something like that. Yeah, yeah. So the impact part is really, really important. And if there was data back up with the claim, that's right. So it's about how important how big this disease is. Right. So we were really hitting on the desire. Like that was what, like, we were really selling on it. That's why it made us go through so many. That's why it made us go through so many iterations. Yes, that's right. Actually, it connected to that. It seems like a lot of the why often is about some disease application that isn't your thing. It's your collaborator's thing. And how do you work with that? Yeah, okay, okay, okay. Hold on, hold on. Let me back up. So here's a place. Let me answer it this way, and then please let me know if I'm actually answering your question. Answering your question. So, yeah, Yan Yun had mentioned like we shared this fact about how many lives are impacted. I want to be careful with that. So, for example, NIH, like the National Institutes of Aging, they deal with a lot of Alzheimer's disease grants. And a common thing that people present is, Alzheimer's disease is going to affect these million people by 2050. I'm going to really, really need to save the disease. To really, really need to save the disease. That is a very interesting fact. But the problem is, that audience, the reviewers on that grant panel, they've probably seen that sentence over and over and over again. So, you know, they have a tab stack of 10. If you're the fifth one, they're like, oh my gosh. The problem is they're going to glaze over, and then they might miss a point. So, for that, if I was submitting this proposal to Submitting this proposal to NIH because it's a health-related thing, I would not put that sentence there because that's going to be overly used. But for this grant proposal where my audience was mathematicians, right, because I saw the website, I studied who they were, that selling about the details of a disease, that might be more appealing. Because mathematicians, I'm guessing, they might not know that fact. They might not know that fact. I could have even done it better, maybe, and selling an idea that really appealed to the mathematicians. Like more about like, hey, this is a really cool problem, and we have all these mathematical challenges that nobody's ever seen. So that could have been one helpful. So, but I don't think I've answered your questions. I think you're getting at, well, if I want to sell more about the disease and I don't know that information, my collaborator knows that information. Collaborator knows that information. Well, I think that's a great opportunity. I mean, this is what I had to do. I, well, one, you could either, I mean, actually, this, I would encourage this, is like try, you know, the first sentence of the why, I call it the hook, right? You try to hook the reader in to try to read your whole thing. What I want to say is, yeah, so you could try out different hooks, right? Try out the one about the display, like have your Try out the one about the dislike. Have your collaborator write about how many people this disease will affect. Or, and then you write one about the statistical problem. And then you try and bring one together. And you, I, like, what I do with my, I have like a grant writing club. We like share the hooks and we're like, I don't like that one. I like this one. Right? So you get to play with it. You get to iterate. Does that answer your question, Mazza? I think so, yeah. Okay. I guess just, are you focusing on like the, there's all these different problems that. But there's all these different problems this method applies to you versus like here's one really important problem. Exactly, exactly. That's why another reason why, oh, sorry, with this, that's why this funnel points to one thing, one thing at the end of the day. That's another common challenge I see people are trying to save the world, tackling multiple things. No, it's one thing, one thing you want to solve. Justice, I think you had a question. Yeah, so when it comes to trying to sell a product, Schneck, I do see that there's kind of like this trend that people buy the product maybe because they want the product, but they also tend to like buy it because they like the person. So whenever you're preparing these materials, how would that you can like mean your, I guess, like yourself feel like that, right? Because I think that could work unique. Okay, I think I'm not sure. I think I'm not sure if I got it. Can you repeat the question? Okay, if you're like in a sound chip, so if you're like, and this just happened because I went to like Lisbon over winter break, if you're like walking around like the main streets, there's like a bunch of restaurants and there's people that are trying to get you into go eat at their restaurant. So you tend to go in there, not because they're like, oh my god, I want like, I don't know. Because I want, like, I don't know, like, these fruit sparks because everybody sells fruit sparks. But you're just going in because you enjoy the company of the person that might be trying to get you in there. So that's kind of like one of the strategies that people tend to excel at products. And I'm trying to think how is it that you can move like your like um I guess like your charisma to like the right because I feel like that's an area that That's an area that there's kind of like not an open password, clear password. Sure, sure. I think what kind of thing is that. I have a thought on that. I think maybe you could relate to what you were saying earlier about like making it very clear writing because you kind of want to show that you respect the reviewer's time. Sure. And I think that will convey writer if you're not using too much, too many acronyms. I'm not using a ton of overwrought notation. Yeah, you're super flower and cringe. Right. But I think also, like, Right. But I think also, like, the NIH, like, I've been on these panels and they specifically say, like, we're not funding this person. It's not like we don't fund a person because they're nice and they've done good work in the past. Like, that's important for the trust part, but they're not supposed to think about that. It's supposed to be like, you're funding this work, you're funding this team. Like, why is this team perfect for this work? But I think you do want to get across like the passion. Like the passion, like you were talking about this disease, like your collaborator's disease, but like kind of have to make it your disease, too. You know, you have to care about it. I mean, not that you have the disease, but you have to care. And you might not care to begin with, but like, but you probably didn't care about Hutchinson's disease before. But like, now you really do, you really do, and people see it in your writing. No, totally agree. And I think, actually, Jesus, and thank you, Layla, for your comments. Yeah, there's a big, okay, so let me say it this way. So I, like, I still consider myself like a newbie in the field. Like, I'm not a big name professor. I don't, maybe I am, but I, right now, I don't consider myself that. So I am not, let me say it in another way. Like, I've seen grants where big name professor, right? Where big name professor writes, yeah, I did, I got this R01, this R01, did this, did that, done, right? Really, like that's how they sell their grant. Sometimes it works, but I have helped, like my most recent colleague, she's a physics professor at Colorado. She had beautiful CV. She kept getting rejected for R1s in a row. Okay, and a part of the reason was she wasn't selling on the wall. On what she wasn't selling on the why, the desire. So I'm saying, if you are just relying on your reputation, that might get you far, but it's going to stop at some point. Okay, so I encourage you all, no matter how famous you become, to not rely on your reputation. Sell the why. Like your trust is going to be even more awesome because you have all these like R01s or grants, whatever, but don't rely on it. But don't rely on it. Oh, I do have a question, but I don't know how much time do we have. I don't know. What is the time? Oh, we have nothing else today. Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, just to stop and all of that. I'm so interested, why are we stopping here? We should officially stop at the full 20. Oh, we're just now. Okay, I'm happy to talk to you offline, G-Way, and anyone else if you're interested. But, yeah. But yeah, I suggest for people that have something else to show you continue, but then we can continue because I want to hear from you. Maybe I just ask my question so you can answer, give an answer to us in the next few days. Oh, I can do it now. So it seems like everyone has to care about the disease. No, care about the problem. Yeah, care about the problem. So if someone is not doing bio stats, someone in pure stats, there has no experience and no opportunity to do collaboration without how this type of person can get online. Oh, ah, ah, okay, I see what you're saying. That means you really need, you do, so you have, perhaps you are the person that's like this expert in the This expert in the statistical model, like you have, like that is your bread and butter, okay, but you have no application to the disease, then you need to have on your grant a really, really, an expert in that disease, like your co-I or your co-PI, I don't know, that you need to have that combination to sell the grant. And then, in addition to that, you need not only just like put them on, right? Because I've done that, doesn't work, but Doesn't work. But I mean, I don't know, maybe I did it wrong. But anyway, but you also have to establish that you two have worked together. So it might mean, you know, delaying submitting your grant by a cycle or two to write a paper together or establish some type of collaboration together because the reviewers are going to pick up on, oh, they just included them because they need this disease expertise, but they have no collaboration experience together. How can I trust to give them millions of dollars to work on a disease they never even worked on together? Businesses, they never even worked out together. Right, so that's that's an issue of the trust that you're breaking. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, but Tanja, you'd say it's difficult, if not impossible, to get a statistical methods only grant funded by NIH. Like, they're not, I mean, you have to impossible or not. I just, no, I was asked, I feel like it's almost impossible to get an NIH-funded methyltone grant. Like, it, by definition, has to be like some health. MSF is totally different. Some health. MSF is totally different. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, NIH is National Institutes of the Health. So it needs to be somehow related to health. Like your expertise is the stats. That's the problem you're selling, but it has to have some health application. Yeah, I mean, and then if it's not that, then I would try some other funding gens. Yes, yes. Yes, very nice talk. I really enjoy it. Thank you. Professor Development Sechkins. Can you let us know what's topic of cover? Yeah, that's a good question. Yeah, no, of course. Yeah, that's just like, I just wanted, I don't know, I wanted it to be a surprise. Yeah, that's right. That's right. I need to design. That's right. Who is all the hopes? Yeah. All right. Yeah, so this session is, this one was the only one about writing. The next one is about listening. And you might think that's strange, but. Might think that's strange, but I would argue that if you listen, actually, when you're on those grant review panels, if you learn to listen at a deeper level, which I will explain to you, you can hear what your audience desires and trusts. So you can start to listen for that, even as these technical speakers are talking, like what is their desire? And then you can find a solution. You can find something that interests them. So it's listening. And then the last one is about coaching. And then the last one is about coaching, which is about because you know, this is, I'm going to put it from the framework of a mentor. Like your mentee comes to you and they have a problem, like, and this is not my mentees, but like, oh, I still don't have my paper done and it's been 10 years and I don't know what to do, right? So how do you coach a person to help them overcome that problem? I think that this is especially relevant. I think that this is especially relevant. You know, we want to make, we want to train mentees to be independent. And also, just selfishly, we want to save our time. We don't want to be the one coming in to rescue our mentees. How can we help them? And then not only, that's just a mentor-mentee relationship, but also all of us. People come to us asking for help. Like a colleague comes, like, hey, this big name professor is really pissing me off. You know, how can you have that conversation in a way where you Can you have that conversation in a way where you're not, where you can actually help them find a solution that matters without putting the labor on you? A nice analogy is: so, there was an article written, I think, in the New York Times or Harvard Business Review, I can't remember. But the idea was like, how many monkeys are you killing? Meaning, like, as you're, you know, as you're talking to someone and they're like, hey, Tanya, like, I really need help in this. No worries, give it to me. Oh, Tanya, like, I need to send this email. No worries, give it to me. To send this email, no worries, give it to me. You know, so by the end of the day, how many monkeys am I carrying? Right, instead, with coaching, you can release those monkeys or put the monkeys back to the people where they belong. So, anyway, that's it. I get it. I get it. It might not be for all of you. It's only 30 minutes, though. So, I don't know. I think, again, like I said, this is my condensed, you know, trying to make it as simple as possible for you all, because I found these fields quite helpful in my own career. My own. Thank you. So, what's next? So, as I said, I'm going to right now send the Google Drive with these slides and that research toolkit so you can all have. Right now, it's a working session. So, you all, if you want, start working together. There's whiteboards, there's all this stuff, or you can do whatever you want. Or you can do whatever you want, right? It's just, it's free time, right? But this is a chance, it's blocked out time so that you can work together if you want to work together. All right? Thanks, everyone, and I'll see you all at dinner. And oh, sorry, sorry. One thing: some speakers have asked if I can share the slides. For the speakers, if you can email me your slides. Speakers, if you can email me your slides, and I'm going to right now default to saying you are okay to share the slides. If you do not feel comfortable sharing the slides, please just tell me, don't share my slides, Lily. Shared among everybody. Yeah, I'm going to put it in the same Google Drive. So the default is you're allowing to share. And just tell me otherwise. Okay? Yeah, so it stayed. I paid close to what I also
