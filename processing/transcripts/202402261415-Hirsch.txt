And then I'm going to talk about scalar curvature comparison results, and all of this is joined with UHRAN. And basically, what we're going to look at is how some lower bonding scale curvature are going to affect the geometry of the quality of the manifold. Like one of the classical results, for instance, that was just mentioned in Rooker's talk, is the positive mass theorem. The mass theorem and in maybe the weakest form it tells us that if we have one with symmetric g that just is not flat and we have non-negative scalar curvature, then it follows already that the mass is greater than zero. So that's kind of like the typical result for having a zero bond on the scalar curvature. Then what you can also do is to look Then, what you can also do is to look at positive lower bonds on scalar curvature. The additive example that was mentioned by Grung before is Labroux's theorem. And in this case, we're not looking at Euclidean space, but rather. So take metric G minus M. Assume that the scalar curvature is 1 by n times n minus 1. To execute the scalar curvature here. Then it already follows. Then it already follows that G is less than or equal than GSN at least somewhere. And that's basically like the basic version of these theorems. You can think of them as being like the inequalities. But you can also now strengthen those, and there are also rigidity statements. So what happens? There are also rigidity statements. So, what happens in case, say, the mass is equal to zero? So, in this case, we have that G is already equal to the Euxidian metric. And similarly, if we assume that G is greater equal than G as n everywhere, then they already have to agree everywhere. So, you already need the wrong metrics. So, these theorems are just couples inequalities, but they also. Inequalities, but they also allow us to characterize these very important spaces, namely Oxidian space and the sphere. And then, what I want to focus on today is if you have already established like these two kinds of results for the quality master and the Bruce theorem, how can we go further? Also, before we do this, I didn't also mention um you can of course do the same thing for low bolts in the scalar curvature, like the hyperbolic positive mass, but Positive mass change for instance, but not going to focus on this. And then, this is also mentioned, I think, in the morning that looking at upper points in the scale curve, which is less interesting, because locomotives result tell us that you can always find such management. So, the first thing we're going to focus on is stability. And that's basically asking what if this is not exactly satisfied, and say the master is only small, what can we then say the result? And similarly, what is here? The result, and similarly, for this here, those holes start with this nearly holds. And how does this imply? That's called this plus almost plus. And the same thing works for our rules theorem as well. In this case, suppose one of these conditions, say, this one. One of these conditions, say this one only or holes nearly, are we then in some sense close to here? So that's going to be the first focus of the talk. And then we're going to look at something else how we can push the results further and we're going to get actually some very interesting resource instructions. All right, so here, what do I mean with nearly and almost? Okay, in one case it's actually quite easy. So when you want that these assumptions are only nearly satisfied, you can for instance say that the mass is very small and close to zero, or that the scalar curvature is very close to the actual bound. Actual boundary. So for instance, you can have the m is less than epsilon, you can have that the scalar curvature is only bounded lower from minus epsilon, or you can have something which makes slightly more complicated. They take the scalar curvature minus n times n minus one and they take a negative out of it and some functional norm. And you can assume that this is rich norm. Assume that this risk is on. So these are just some typical examples. But now for the other one, what about almost? So what does it mean be close to Eclidean space or be close to the sphere? It's actually much more complicated. So let me show you two examples. So take here some aspect manifold, which look at the script before. Say we have here even some like hole and some quality by the brave finac. Then maybe here we have some spike or some neutrons flock. And it turns out that you can make such a construction while still having very small mass. You can make the mass arbitrarily small, but somehow this manifold is very far away from being planned. So that is what Very far away from being planned, so that's what causes complications. And very similar for the world sphere run. So, you can, for instance, also, if you have here something which is like close to the sphere, you can here have the neck connected to another sphere. You can also have here some spikes. And in this construction, here you can explicitly construct them. And here, you can make the scale curvature greater than n types n minus 1 minus epsilon for n. Minus epsilon for any epsilon, and again it's pretty probable in one model space. So, how can we actually deal with it? And there are basically two main approaches. The first one is called intrinsic light convergence. Okay, so the philosophy is a very important thing. Okay, so the philosophy of budget convergence is the following. So we have here these two bad behaviors. There are also some more behaviors Heibo will talk about later today. But in this case, basically you have this bubbling. And the result of intrinsic pad convergence, one is usually bullying them all up here. And then you still have the spikes. And now the nice thing about intrinsic pad conversion is that it's a very weak sense of convergence. So the spikes are actually very close to... Are actually very close to Euclidean space. So the spikes actually get close to delta. And this way we can still say that if we don't have this bubbling behavior, we actually close with the instance. So that's strategy one. But there's also a second strategy, which I call removal of the bad set. And while I was just selling that the academic conversion is having the advantage, that's very big. So you can actually allow these files. And being very big is also like a bad thing because the conclusions will be then also quite big if you're only close to a clearance space in a big sense. So this strategy over here is basically saying, okay, here take Take these bad features and cut them away. So we're not going to deal with those, I'm not going to deal with those. And then basically we want to say that what we cut away, so here we only cut away small regions, that this is on the one hand side small. On the other hand side, because we're doing this, we can hope to get a stronger notion of conversions. So maybe you can get something like from a forest of conversions or even CC. Four subcontinentals or even C0. Okay, then how can actually prove these kind of statements? They're again like two main strategies. So it often depends like on the situation. So basically, so here you get, for instance, here you can get a principle quite naturally because the proving LaBoulette theorem sort of naturally gives you this additional control. So you would have to look specifically in the proof whether you can get, say, these other types of conversions. But I think nice thing you can hope for is they get things like. Nice thing you can hope for is they're getting some really strong convergence on like a good set and then just dropping away. All right, let's talk about group strategies. And they're again basically creating methods. And many papers, basically some special structures has been exploited, like say you assume that up here we do a spherical piezometric, you're a graph, etc. And then having this additional structure, you can improve these. Structure: We can improve these stability results. And then, if you don't want to make any extra assumptions, what has been recently quite popular is the use of the levels of homotic functions. All linear potential theory. And the nice thing about using the servers is that this is like a proof by plus scalar coverage. It gives you a very precise control of the underlying manifold. And to get the stability results, you need these rather precise controls. All right, and before I flip this around, so basically for now, what we're going to focus on is this case and for the rules theorem, what the corresponding stability looks like. The corresponding stability looks like. Yeah, that works surprisingly well. So this goes back to Brumov about this spherical stability problem. Okay, well it was before giving you just like a very rough idea what the rule skim is. Now let me give you the precise mathematical statement. So the theorem is the following. So suppose you have a main default mng. Assume that it's been or hopefully eventually we can rough this assumption and then assume that the scalar curvature is greater or equal than n times n minus 1. n minus 1 and then moreover that f dmf from n into the sphere with non-zero degree which is also area non-increasing this is this notion has also been mentioned in juvenile talk before but let me briefly recall So that basically means that GF is great equal than the round metric GSN on two forms. So basically whenever you measure the size of the two forms, like that measure will be bigger than this. So for instance, if you have any Lipschitz map, it will always satisfy this, but it's like a much weak assumption. Okay, so assume all of this, then you get that already F is a nice R mesh. Okay, so it's like it's very nice result, which gives you like the choice that is appeared by rigid under scatter curving parts. So how can you actually prove this? So the first proof, not surprisingly given that we call it a rules theorem. And we call it a row sphero, a spider row, and it was using spinners. And there have also been refinements by several other people in years later on to get some slightly stronger notions of this. Then another method is VR View Bubbles. And there's work by who you and she also. Yu and Xi also been previously mentioned, and then there's a recent paper by Genius, Xia and Zafar. And then finally, you can also use space and harmonic functions, which is a joint work the Dimitri Cazaras. The Dimitri Kazaras, Mark Scarian, and Yu Chang years ago. Is that a question? Yeah, for me, all of the manifolds are from package analysis. Yeah, you can also strengthen this or like also like these results. You mentioned before, yeah, I want to focus on the contact case this talk. Okay, so we have now these different proofs of like the rigidity statement. Now it's the question in what sense is stable. So how can we rule out this picture? And basically we have two theorems. Two theorems, one involving intrinsic fetch convergence and one involving the moveable of the span set. So, let me start with giving you theorem one. In the case of analogous statement for the house field, so when we had a pound that's expected to be false, like in Minot's conjecture. Well, like the problem with Mino conjecture is that. Well, like the problem with loop conjecture is that you don't have this additional bound, but that you can also prove La Rouse theorem with boundary. I think the first sentence was written ambiguously by not basically get like a mean curvature condition, and the mean curvature is exactly what you would get from like a spherical cap. So say for instance, you have something with boundary like this, and then if you assume the scalar curvature bound to be bigger than the scalar curvature on the inside, so r greater equal than r sn. R greatly equal than RSN from here, and then you also need to assume on the boundary that H is great for than the one on the sphere, and then the utility results the bottom. Yes. Okay, thanks. You already see something on the spectrum. Alright, so let's start with theorem one, which will be regarding spectrum versions. So we have the following. So we have a family of metrics, sequence of metrics on the sphere, such that they satisfy the following. So first we need the scalar character law of one. So we have the scalar character spread equal to an n times n minus one. times n minus 1 and then the only one is to nearly hold true so we subtract the minus 1 over i n or you can also do some like integral over bonds which are a little bit weaker assumptions then what we also need and I'm going to explain this more in a second we need a Hocker reconstant bond or a units one bond then more Then, moreover, you need a control metric. So, you assume that GIS is the spread equal than the round metric on SN, but this time on one form, so just for the basic like ellipsoids condition. And then finally, that's needed for an intrinsic flat convergence part. We need a uniform diameter bound. And if all of this is satisfied, then follows that GI converts the intrinsic flat sense to brown metric. So you have essentially this picture. So you start with something like this. You have like here like these like big spikes. And then these spikes are getting like thinner. And then like in the limit, they disappear under the Disappear under the convergence. Okay, two remarks about this block. So, first, in dimensional three, there's already been an alternative proof. So, the Pokemon constant of the manifolds is uniformly bounded. I'm going to discuss this in my second remark a bit more. But first, let me mention this result by Brian Allen, Edward Brown. Edward Bryden and Dimitri Cazaras that showed that they gave an alternative proof in dimension 3 if additionally the Tiger constant. Um, the Giga constant and the volume is uniformly bounded. In case of G G constant space like some is a parametric constant. And now coming back to the Pocketbreak constant bond, Savannah of theorem one of the so basically if you're in dimension three and you have um two constant bond and that has And geo constant bond and dotted volume bond. Additionally to these things, then you get also prevented. And then finally, the spoker re constant bond is basically used to prevent bubbling, but actually it only prevents bad bubbling. You can actually have certain kinds of bubbles under these bounds, which maybe is a little bit surprising at first, but the Pocket Request bound Actually, allows this picture. You can make this neck arbitrary neck. And it does not violate the property constant bound. But for instance, like the isometric isometric constant bound would be violated. Just have to make sure that the neck expression is short, then this this would be Also basically what we actually show in the proof is that the volumes converge of the manifolds and then there's a result by Ellen, Rothers and Samani that says that if you have the stronger notion rather than this one. Than this one together with our volume conversions, then it implies intrinsic pattern conversions if you have additional dynamic one. Yes, yes, it's effective. So basically, given like an I, there's a constant that you're like, that intrinsic platform is like C times I. Yeah, it's not like a compactness argument, it's like very intrinsic. Any other questions to the Gospel? Good question. So the spin argument works in all dimensions. The mu bubble is in dimension 3. Then there's this recent preprint which is for dimension 4. And the space of the Monic market argument goes in dimension 3. But now, if you have a look at LaRue, one of the very nice aspects of it is that it only needs a very weak assumption on the metric rather than the stronger one that your length not increasing or like ellipses. And another nice thing is that you can also have very different topological spaces. And both of this is not yet covered in first theorem, but by using the second strategy, by cutting away the bad features. By cutting away the bed region, we can actually achieve this. So, let me draw another picture of what a human cutting away the bedset. So, say we have here these two spikes. And all the talk is actually on the other side of the whiteboard. Okay, and then, for instance, we can define, can like try to access this and then call the rest of the To exercise this, and then call the rest of them manifold omega, and then we can hope for a good convergence there. But actually, it's very subtle, and you have to be careful. Say you have like a sequence where these spikes are like rotating around. Then suddenly we maybe want to define omega to be like somewhere like here. So, the only thing you can ever hope is like some convertions of the pass into a sub-sequence because otherwise. Because otherwise, you have like no of these spikes to take around. So, now let me give you the statement of the second theory run. So, now we have following. So, we have a sequence of manifolds Mi matrix GI, which are all spin. Then you assume that the scalar curvature is. It satisfies again this bond over here. And we also need again this Pocky Ray constant bond to a lot of bad bubbles. Log bad bubbles, I mean if they're like having a very lot of long neck between them. So we assume one actually and then we have some fi which go from mi to sphere. With non-zero degree, and now we also have the area not increasing as in LaBrule's theorem. So, basically, we have the spiritual having the everyone increasing property, and we can also allow arbitrary topologic spaces. And then, if you put then this additional assumption that the volume is uniformly bounded, then the following holds true, and we get precisely this picture over here. So, for every epsilon bigger than z bro, there exists some set omega on this here such that Sn Um as than minus omega, the volume of this is less than equal than epsilon and such that TI converts to the round metric, but now actually in the CF0 sense. So it not just gets something like Rama poster, but actually gets some very nice sense of convergence outside of spikes. Outside of spikes. And as just mentioned before, we need to say that this is only a sub-sequential. Yeah, so basically by cutting away a bad region, you can actually get some really nice control. And going also back to your question, you also have like an effective version. So you get given the closeness here at the scalar curvature. Closeness here at the scalar curvature, you can explicitly contribute to the C0. Are there any questions? Oh, very good question. So the bubbles are like the NMEs. And the nice thing is about the short bubbles is that actually here you have that the scalar curvature. you have that the scalar curvature is much smaller than n times n minus one. So basically we never have to worry about the short bubbles. But the problem is basically these like long bubbles because then you can make scalar curvature as close to n have n minus one as you want. Okay, any more questions? Yeah, exactly. Because then you can do like the usual thing, like make like a function. An usual thing like make like a function minus one here, plus one there, and if the neck is long enough, one goes well. You can also replace the correct one spawn by some total that one's wrong, and then like everything still works. That's a good question. I haven't thought about this yet. We can discuss this a bit more after the talk. Okay, so we have here this stability questions for La Roose era. And this was like one of our starting point where we were looking at how can we take these classical theorems and push them further. Classical theorems and push them further. But basically, stability is one strategy, there's also another strategy that you can follow. Like in all of these theorems, you only classify a single space. Like here, you only look at Victorian space, and here you only look at the sphere. But there are more than two interesting manifolds around, right? So maybe you can refine this here in such a rigidity you get like a abundance of spaces. There's actually like a very interesting or surprising result you can get in this direction. You can get in this direction. So that's going to be then regarding the positive mass theorem. So before I'm going into the theorem, I want to briefly explain again why in general relativity you actually have to deal with non-negative scalar curvature. Why does this appear? Especially since we are not having a GR conference here. Explained by Lukasdot before. So in GR we were always looking at these Lorentz manifolds, but he just brought in here as a cube. And let's call it an m-bar T-bar. It's called an m-bar t-bar, and then we had the Einstein equation that the Ritchie curvature minus one-half times scalar curvature is equal to eight pi stress-energy dependencies. And then in this like n plus one-dimensional RANC manifold, we can then have like here some initial data set, call it mlgk. So you have like. K. So you have like the manifold with the new symmetric, and then the second fundamental form k inside this n plus one-dimensional space-time. And then from physics, you get some properties on this tensor t and then this translates to the Gauss-Kodas equations of the properties over here, and then you have the double-dominant energy condition. And the dominant energy conditions states that the sort of energy density is great equal than the momentum density, where u is one half times the scalar curvature plus trace k squared minus norm k squared and j is the divergence of k minus trace kg and now And now if k is equal to zero, then both of these terms are not here, and all of j is not here. So this will just be the scalar curvature greater equal than zero if the second fundamental form is equal to zero. Also, just this quick review of why actually scalar curvatures appearing. So now let's come to what I call refined rigidity. So the model's result is called theorem A, which I already mentioned previously, is saying that if you have M and G, a Romanian manifold with no negative scalar curvature, it's almost flat and has zero mass, then it already follows. That m ng is equal to Euclid in space. But of course, in the theorem over here, when you look at like the physical perspective, it's kind of like quite special, right? You assume that the second fundamental form is actually zero. So you have here mng k equals zero. And this way you also only get a single space. But there are two more. But there are two more variants. So we also have theorem D. It says, okay, now we don't say that K is equal to zero. And we assume the dominant energy condition, I gap, which again is just a generalization of non-negative scalar curvature. Again, we assume that you are asymptotically flat with mass equal to zero, then it already follows. If there are some extra assumptions satisfied, so something like the K and regularity assumptions on G, K, mu, and J, if there are some actual assumptions, then M and G already isometrically embeds in the Kovsky space. So basically, M and G is metrically embeds in the Kovsky space, and you have second. We embed in Kovsky space, and we have second element on K. And that kind of like helped us bring us to this code to having a more refined rigidity in these cases, because now we are suddenly characterizing not just a single space named Fidden space, but we characterize all initial data sets in Kovsky space. They're infinitely many. But actually, this can be more general. And there's this, like, that you have to assume containers. Kind of this, like that you have to assume plenty of extra assumptions to make this true. So maybe that's not most physical. And there's then new result, theorem C. So if you have now an initial data set, again you have the dominant energy condition satisfied. Gazmatic lad, and then you assume that the mass is zero. And then only I don't. And the only additional assumption we need is that the manifold is spin. Otherwise, you just need the ones to make the mass well defined at infinity. Then it already follows that mnk embeds into a so-called plane wave space-time. Okay, so what are Okay, so what are plane waves? So plane waves come out from like the physics literature and they appear basically in two different scenarios. The first scenario would be if you just take any Lorenzi manifold and then blow up this manifold. And then blow up this manifold across a non-geodesic, so something like a generalized version of like a tangent space. This will always resemble a plane-wave space-time. So, for instance, take a spaceship and go at the speed of light, and then basically your surroundings would look like a plane-wave space-time. And the other thing that's why they're important is that if you want to model electromagnetic or gravitational radiation, they're also modeled with the effects. So let me give you a reversal definition. Give you a reversal definition. So, if you have a plane wave space-time over here, let's call it mbar g bar means m bar is equal to rm plus one and g bar is equal to two d tower u plus f u squared plus the Plus the clearing metric on i and minus one. And this f needs to have some property where the i n minus one plus of f is less equal than zero, so you're superharmonic for all. So basically, this function f depends, this doesn't depend on tau, but only depends on. And then on each of these. And then on each of these r minus ones, it has to be superharmonic. And then what I just mentioned before, on the one hand side, model radiation, like electromagnetic radiation and gravitational radiation. And on the other hand side, there's the so-called Pendros limit, which is, if you want, the tangent space of knowledge as the fluorescent method. Okay, are there any questions of this result before I talk a little bit about u is a mark coordinate and tau is a time coordinate. So basically That time button. So basically keeping Minkowski space, u being dx plus dt, and tau being dt, and then you see you get like the control form of the Minkowski space metric. An example of this kind of example is, for example, by Nausica um space data. Or n no, that would not be an example, but maybe cost space. Simple example could be in cost space. Otherwise, if you just write down any superharmonic function, this will always be an example. Or if you take any Lorentz manifold, if the choice for instance is taken by some algebra, take an algebraic in there, and then zoom in, and then it will also have swarm over there. Okay, let's talk a little bit about proof, which I think is quite interesting because it uses the proof uses false spinoffs. The proof uses both Spinori methods and level set methods. But even though it uses level set methods or space of harmonic functions, it still works in all dimensions. We make a little bit more space here. So the first step is to construct a space in harmonic function. Construct a space and harmonic function. So let u be a space and harmonic function. This means it la plus u is equal to minus trace k norm gradient u which is asymptotes or bear. The gradient u is going to the momentum back to infinity. Well, assuming p is not zero, but if the momentum back to zero, then everything gets much easier anyways. So basic, and then you have these level sets of the space hymnic function. So say you have here this initial data set which looks like this. And then you have inside here all these level sets. And then the goal is the following is namely to show an example of all them sigma that they are flat. In the sense that the Riemann curvature handles vanishing. And once they are flat, then you are able to construct the space-time steps. But to do so, it's not enough to just look at functions. We need a second tool which also fills us. So, Vin has this very beautiful formula. So, given any spinner, which I'm going to write down what happened in a second, then if you take the spinner as well as psi infinity, and times the energy, and plus the scalar product of t and then this is all different multiplication, sine infinity of sinefinity. Then this is equal to some dimensional constant. is equal to some dimensional constant, then the integral of m and then this great equal assuming the dominant energy condition, then you get here the gradient of psi and then minus one half k each j psi squared. So I have like this very nice formula. In particular, this shows you that the positive masculine is true, that e is squared equal to non p, because you have here many. Norm P because you have here manifest in the negative term. And what is psi in this case? So here we have a psi here, we have a psi infinity. So here psi solves deep psi equal to one half trace k0 of psi with psi isentorting to psi and fiddle is here. That infidelity. And what spaces is slipping in? Actually, if you're not using the usual spin-up bundle, but you need to use a spacetime spinner bundle. That's going to be really crucial. So psi, which I'm going to, it's going to be an S bar, which is just a spinner bundle plus itself. So the psi over here is actually just given by psi1 comma psi2. Okay, so we have now a spinner, or like a two-component spinner, and a function. But in order to get the lowest of that and the constructive space, then we need something contractable. So we're going to construct two different vector fields. So let me continue over here. So that's going to be now at the third point. So now we're going to define first the vector field x. First, the vector field x, which is just equal with scalar product of e i v 0 psi times e i. So this way the spinner can rise to the vector field. But we can also do a different notion. We can also define the vector field C, which is equal to, now we're also using the function gradient u inverse times the imaginary part. times the imaginary part of EI mu psi 1, comma psi 1. And now the nice thing about these spinners is that they sort of point in two directions. There's like a function that's just pointing in a single direction. You can think of the spinner as basically pointing simultaneously in this direction, in this direction, in the same time, which makes them something quite powerful. I feel quite powerful. And so now we have this vector field X and this vector field C. What can we say about them? So we want to now somehow exploit that the end mass is zero. So using this written formula, if you choose psi infinity correctly, this is going to be zero. So you get to the stronger identity of psi. So you have now this very strong weighting identity. And now you can work with x and z more closely. And you get two very surprising results. So you get. results. So you get that x is equal to gradient u, you get that z is perpendicular to x or z is parallel to the level sets and you get that the level set gradient of z is equal to zero. So z is parallel respect to the level sets and then you can just choose any rotation for zero by prescribing sine infinity accordingly. Describing sine infinity accordingly, and then you get the flatness. Okay, now you have the flatness, and then finally, you need to construct a space-time. Actually quite subtle. And you also need to work again both with the spinners and with function simultaneously. And the functions simultaneously, but in the end, if you construct the space-time, you precisely arrive at this database. Okay, function malt is all at the same.
