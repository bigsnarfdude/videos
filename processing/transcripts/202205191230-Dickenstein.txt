 Plenaria, investigador superior de CONICET was incorporated at the National Estiences Físicas and Natural Act to Vice President of the IMU of women that occupied and more resentment that in the world, more mathematical mathematics. Of mathematics between them, and it is just that it was first in the year 2000, and their major in the portals, and with the mathematics and visible material for the rest of the world. Suba de work, the algebraic geometry, and their applications, and also a frac that the idea of one of the entrepreneurs that the world is. So this terminal preparation, this has the more organized characters. My plateau, as Mexico y eligami que más cona class que coma charla, butía contarles algunas cosas basic cos que aprendid algebra signals, whondicondo pesada trabajar con applicacions que also requier in some concise mass structural algebra. But that is basically the question that I think can select the sequence also. So, voyage two per unit of the time is to replicate linear or intersect other quiet with ideas, but polynomials and quiet positives and usar subsidies polydributions combinatoria and terminal. So this pretend simplified what have cuatro rectangles, no roja la celeste la madic y la verde. When there, one or two is a election signal to coordinate, like coordinated, but one or two. One is the positive are the four here, the four. Los 4 semijes y el 0. 0 nueve. So, for example, this rectaroja corta estos or tantes, well, all passes for 0.2. So, question is when I have a here, how have a solo question? No, if we have a question here that makes it there, the sero in which condition is positive, I think it facilitates. Positive, I think, facilitating that signal, we have a very simple thing that can be positive, so that can be a solution that positive solution. But more obvious, so if the question is that your societies, of other people, dad a vector, one can see their vector signal, which is a vector in the menu, which encases how. So, a question basically if I have a real matrix of when existing vector positive in the nuclear nucleus, how data is the matrix like Cat, in principle, nuclear base, but with infinite vectors, how you can decide if the one that has to do with the positive. The one that has positives. So, respond and exist positive in the nucleus exactly when the calculate all the vectors of the past for the philosophy of vectors, have the coefficient positive and the men are negative. So, what do you do? Vector in the space of vectors is vector tier. So what do we want to do? This condition and how we can verify. And the response to rapid response is that determining the maximum of the matrix. So what is your space that we can see in that vector of coordinates with central corridors? Venada connects central vectors of their space. And we are definitely the sign of your space, like the colours and part of the sign with not the vectors of signal and all the vectors are space. The support of a vector are all 15 with a non-order. Those consirito space are a vector nano queue support and minimal respect inclusion. It is not in some other vectors in their space. And it facilitates that if two support one has a multiple other and this facilitates that if the dimension of the space that the circuits have entered, And explain a little bit because typically can be more. So it gave a lot of sir quite vector escalate with the order if you have all coefficients in sir quite neural. The signal that has the signal. The signal that has the signal that prescribes the tenants eltants, can have a positive and signal that has the tiene, in that coordinate. And also, conform with a vector has no sipndo, tires, nulla tin el mismo signal que el vertar. So So, for example, we have the space that we have for the matrix that is. So, these vectors, 0, vectors, obviously the philosophy has And these positive positions, and we have positive positions. I don't know about erosion of positive space, because this means two por esteems, but the vector is that they have two eros here, because one thing that has two eross maths of a series.  Part of the determinant. I think a determinant, what you will generate support machines in the silquitos. So, if we are more like this vector in its space and this vector in their space, what you can do is tomorrow combination linear positive linear position, and go ahead and say a vector that has this support. So, it is a part of this sonos. So, the support of the case with the support of 60, and how combination positive this is with a vector in this vector. So, this surface of Rocafella, Rocafella, is a mathematical very famous work optimization in convex analysis, because analysis. Analysis convex analysis, cosa analysis combinatoria, and this space has a basis. So if you want to vector your space, you can see a linear combination of vectors of the basis. But what you are circuits sooner vectors as a combination of positive confidence of all the conformities. So, to contradict the signals, the vector space sufficient, with determining the signals of all the circuits of your space, all the question is how concise all the circuits are. All the circuits. Well, a man control all the circuits of the science. We have a matrix of rango and their specific. All the circuits multiplied, possibly a circuit or multiplication for one ten other, and can repetitions this formula or this expression that you have. Ah, what cardinal demos una, one perango, y the sociamos este circuit. Sociamos estequito. Once you have this sir, and that is their vector in their spaces. So India, if this is the submatrix that has a table that repeated a fila and definitely this as well. If you roll the sumatronica, that has the indices in here, and in Jota the indices. And what is there? And what is there that the signal of the permutation? If the indices in Jota queen are decided to put away. So, this vector is a vector that has clearly, like a series, but more numbers and. Number signs and this vector alternative terminals in a silquito and these are all explicit because they have renunciated and quarreling the demonstration that very demonstration market is the control. So, for example, we have the space for the matrix in this case. In this case, all the circuits, we are going to have one of those cardinal demonoses, and that vectors that meant this, this queen, two veces, but this because this vector 2 is the dependency van produced repetitions and the 0 is the three unoffenders. So, the question is: 2 possible signals of vectors, and Signals of vectors de vector y quality are all the signals of vectors in the nucleo of the matrix. So, this pregnant Latin can respond with the que diamond request in the principle, to float, but essentially have decided how. But I faltered as concigo the signals of vectors in the nucleus. So, if there are very significant maximal menu, that has to see what oriented matrix in these are represented because they have vectors in vectorial space, but there is a general definition because the identifies are orthogonal, it is orthogonal to the vector. If one wants yellow, two vectors are orthogonal, if it is possible to contrarise a vector that has the signal sigma, and another that has the signal sigma first product of zero. But there is a vector in the field, there is a nucleus, so if this has all positive zone, if you have all positive or zero, this vector is not in the nucleus. If the men who have passed is that when the product calendar between a vector of a So, a tier more queue is the first reference of this poro law session, a service. Serve oriented nature, but this uramentes have a vectorial version that interests a signal, sigma prima, that vector signals of a nucleus print, if it is orthogonal to all the vectors of signals of silitos of the files. And for all the vectors, the signals lead. That the signals lead to a nucleus in all coordinates so that there are vectors in the nucleus with these signals. If it is orthogonal to all the signals, all the significant signals are within the nuclear vector. So, what is also, so in vegetables, So, in vegetables, all signals and all the vectors and signals and silicon signals, so that they can say that positive - in the nuclear respondent, if you are quite surprised, there is a positive and negative position. And the question because this proposal can verify effectively, and the content because the view of floating. Flutter. So the other thing that is imagined we have a polynomial system like the system, in two variables with these monomies. So one descriptive system for the ah the exponents of my monomies. This is that and the series, and that is the cuadrado ya zero, this quadrato por and one if this achar are all the exponents that are missing. Exponente que está paración mi systema y sito y los exponents darl systemes equivalente da lamats de coeficientes directamente. So this quiet el first polynomium tiene uno para prime monomio, but the segundo, one for the sea, one for the cuarto, but a quinto el sexto no, no tengo equivalent porcatego, and the same thing. It is the same information that this system can describe coefficients by the vector of monuments. For the vector demonomios. So, it's a thing obvious, is that if I do what this system has a positive solution, voyage contraries, these vectors and this solution, this vector demonomy is the positive solution to be a positive nucleus. So, if it is a necessary condition for this system of polynomial systems, the real positive solution is that the matrix is admitted in positive nuclear vectors. And This is what this is the idea is these points of support are divided. For example, these points are 0, one 3, este que está, the una doses estos 5, es espunto del support, this que estácades xiam el polygo lo in Newton, este lo involvente convexa de mi pointos. So, one a question that we do. Period encounter a inferior para de solutions positive solutions of a resolve effectively systemic system, it is very pero general, like no formula, but that is not a formula. So, in this case, unbiased to contrar the solution. So, how do we encourage that we But we have to contradict a inferior and combinatorial queen. So, this rival, but this is a cabajo sensient. This points negroes of cases are the support of my system as a negro. This point of cases, negroes are the support. Punto da cases Negros are in support of my system. So, a subdivision regular of the involvement with support is pointing a arbitrary alternate. So, a turbo vector or peso, height, we are weight, so arbitrary algorithm. Tomo altur arbitrary, how involve convex and projects, if you want to carry it and project the cars, we are the Lascaras loam the lower convex fault. So the queen in the interior cube. What is that? The project and that projection of subdivision regular when the substance is general queen triangulation of my conjugate. Figures that point because this grand and not reflect and a little bit because. Some geometric because there were a point that marketing is a little more geometric, what we do. But if you obtain a regular subdivision, it is with someone, tomorrow the lower hole, and project. So, in this paper, this is the mulindo, the journal of SAIA demands of applications of regimental. The application of regimentary applications. Use subdivision regular subdivisions of the convex of the exponents of a sparse implementing space that have prefixed to contradict a inferior enumerate solution in positive solutions. The paper is very casual with combinatorium. This fuss for studio obviously with pronunciation topology of Topology of various realities, reality, and the words to the number of solutions real solutions, not positive solutions, and the complexity. So, this is my example that there superiors for the number of solutions about the complexities. So, complex engineering, this is the same. This trees, this is what solution is complex for us. This is not. But the unaccota, mejor in the case, or rallo, which is the big boundary of Bernstein, that involve convex, and polygonal and Newton, and the volume, which is the volume, what we need to simple, sonitari, tenement volume. That simple, sonitari, tengabolum. So, in this case, today, and so that solutions complex solutions with all coordinates, no, no, can we? Or we can solve real solutions, positive solutions, are complex with no more. In this case, this is what I created there two solutions positive solutions. So, what I want to do is. So, what do you want in the minutes that I want? It is how usar subdivision regular support to the consider why we cuadros possibilities. So, this will be in the same system: it is a subdivision regular obtained from someone who is explicit, and there are simples, simplices. Simply says, one of the delta one is 5. There are four que loses of violet and one that has been an ingredient that has all this support between the matrix. So, if they are violent aqueous simplices, which are positive for the matrix, which is positive for the matrix, that is similar to corresponding 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, the coefficients that correspond to the. My coefficients that correspond to these monomies, which is this, but with a matrix of two portraits. So, if what I say is that it is the first column, calculus terminants measure, here the second column calculus terminant and change, which is the last terminal, is voice here of one and signal, more than the term, that if this matrix admits This matrix admits a positive nucleo. So, we are withdrawing their matrices that admit a vector positive thing that checks with the signals, and that passes for this system for this, but not for this. In between four simplices, that is positively decorated, it is possible to generate the system and have four solutions positive solutions. This is a standard regeneration that we have altogether that industry this regular queue so there is a positive, but not dependent of the term simplicity, but there are a serial positive, but what is scalar if numerous points are supported from one's, so. So, what you see with here, first point, one in segment of two, teleceters, etc. Academy because it is coefficient. So, what I agree, if it is theorem, to achieve, here this, because for this election of 8, if you have chiquito, this system for the four solutions positive solutions in this case will be one. But in general, this is a inferior and more in this system una cheque and four products of a inferior sign. And the symbolic precise signature of a formal symmetric form that passed a variable variable for Pidden Marifros valleys vivaspiplas. People, very good. So, what do we want to do with our applications? If I have a curbita in the space of coefficient, the change of Tevoy eligo other coefficients, so if there is a coefficient, we have four solutions, but other coefficients. This is a good thing, and it is very analysis, it is a journal of algebra and essentially. If I want to have a piece with them, these are the exponents, and this are the coefficients, or here we have a coefficient of a violent, where the view well empe.  This one for this portion of a mechanism, that is positive, all three, that is a complete. What we have to do is that it is linear by how exponential. Again, all these exponents are chickens, and this is allowed to violate a problem positive. But in general, a queue decided there is simplicity that part of the same rules algorithm with the practice is very complicated, and a truly queen works together two solutions is a little bit two simplicities that share a facet that is a A proper maximum, the union could be convex or not. So it is necessary there for the men, that has achieved aches that generate subdivisions. So, and with that, we can result for a infinite. Well, infinite, but variable. So, what for me is that, but. The felicitarian workshop, this initiative that I think fundamentally paragraphs to also invisible in the basis of society, and that are difficult. And that are difficult to verify for a paramujerez y para que pomos divertara full pleaser dependar en mathémática. Así que muchísima gracias el esco cornas vecesas de superfices de alcuricas. Well a lota gracias Alicia. No sesi alguna pregunta. Here in the sala no chat. Well, how do we preguntas? Aha decimos, Alicia. Alicia, si, que que jo que día agreada. Yes, I want to agree that to serve here, in some ways, that they have control champions. And I just mentioned not motivating, when we do it because here we have a joint aquarium here, that is not. And we're going to say, much gracias, Alicia, for this work for logas for all. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Glacias, at all. Glaciers. Well. One one of our sixty five
