Thank you. And we'd like to thank the organizers for inviting me in this very beautiful setup. So this is joint work with all these people here. And let me immediately state the main result. So I will consider a smooth variety. Variety, everything will be over the complex numbers dimension n, which is an intersection, complete intersection of two quadrics. So very simple variety in Pn plus 2. And I will be interested in the Cotangent bundle of X, this star X. This star X. So let me remind you that this is a symplectic, holomorphic, symplectic variety, not compact, of course, it's not a hypercolor, but still holomorphic, symplectic. It has a holomorphic to form omega. And the only thing I will need is the fact that omega is exact, it's a differential of a canonical one form called. form called usually called the Uville form. The other thing I will, I mean, which is standard is that the ring of algebraic function on regular function of on t star x is the direct sum is the algebra of symmetric tensors on x, namely sum of h0. Sum of the H naught sim p tx for p greater than or equal to zero. And now I can state the theorem, which is due to all of us. Part A is that this algebra here is just a polynomial algebra. is just a polynomial algebra in n variables. So O of t star x is isomorphic to C X1 Xn and it's an isomorphism of graded algebra with a degree of Xi 2. So, in particular, you see that there are no symmetric tensors of odd order. They are all only, they exist only on even order, and they form this polynomial. So, we have this n function on t star x is defined a very quite canonical map, which I will call phi from x to Cn. This is defined by the Xi. And the claim is that this is a Lagrangian vibration. And for C, unfortunately, I have to assume that X is general. I this is probably not. I this is probably not necessary, but we cannot do better. It was general. Then the general fiber of phi, say phi minus one of lambda, for lambda in Cn Lambda general is a Is an abelian variety minus something small. So more precisely, it's A named as Z. So A is abelian here. And the co-dimension of Z is at least two. And I will sorry. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Of course. And moreover, I mean, I will give a very precise description of this abbey variety. It's a quotient of a Jacobian by a finite group of order two. I mean, this will come later. Okay. Okay, so I'd like to make some comments before touching the proof, and I would like to explain why this is somehow very surprising and at least for me, interesting. So, comments. First of all, this was already known. Known for n oh, I'm sorry, I should say here I'll take n at least two because the case n equals one is completely trivial and slightly different. So, I to be safe, let's take n at least two. So, one is known for n equals two, three. Three. Let me explain why this is known for threefolds. Well, this has been known for a long time. Well, part of it at least. The point is that an intersection of two quadrics in P5 is a moduli space or vector bundle. So maybe I'll go over there to explain that. To explain that, x or n equals 3 is always modular space on a curve or genus 2 of stable bundles of rank two fixed determinant of odd degree. What degree L this goes back to This goes back to, I think, to Newstead. And maybe also Narasiman and Romana, I think they did it independently. So what do we do with that? Well, there is the famous Hitchin vibration, which goes from T star of this, well, let me say T star X. Let's well, let me say t star x with this x into something which is in fact h naught of 2kc twice the canonical bundle of c which is c3 this dimension six and how is it well uh by remember that t at the if we take a At the if we take a vector bundle E here, T E of C of M, let's say of X is canonically H1. I mean, just by deformation theory, it's H1 of the undermorphism bundle of E. And by third duality, this implies that the dual, the cotangent bundle, The dual, the cotangent bundle is H dot of n E tensor K, so it's just the homomorphism from E in E tensor K. Sorry, what what the Oh, the right. So it's a right. And here I should say I should put also a zero somewhere to say that the trace should be zero. So to an endomorphism like that, we associate the determinant. And this is a map like this, and each in proof that this is a In proof that this is a sort of completely integrable system that does all the properties that are written here. So that's n equals 3. In fact, something very similar appears for n equals 2. This is due to a modular space. With a modular space of parabolic vector boundaries on Q1. We just write down the name, and I mean not to explain what it is on P1 form two, and we have each infibration also in that case, which gives results. This is not how we would like really to extend. Would like really to extend this to higher dimension, but we don't know how to do it. I mean, we don't have a modular interpretation for this for this fact, for this second-gen vibration. Okay, so another thing I would like to say is that, so I said this is surprising, this algebra O of t star x It's something very complicated usually. Well, most of the time it's zero. So it's sorry, there is always a constant, of course. So C4. Let's say calabia rules, general type. I mean, usually you don't expect you have to pick varieties which are close to be rational in order to. To be rational in order to get some symmetric tensor like that. But even for rational varieties, it's pretty complicated. I leave as an exercise, non-trivial, to compute what it is for one quadric. It's pretty complicated. I mean, it has to do with the Gaussian of two planes in one vector space. I mean, it's a quite complicated algebra. The algebra. So it's very surprising that when you take two quadrics, you find something similar, very simple like that. And I say, I don't really understand. I mean, we have a proof, but why do we get in this case, such a very simple situation is not clear to me at least. Okay, some of your things I wanted to say. other things i wanted to say uh yeah it's uh another surprising thing maybe i mean if you know a little bit about this intersection of two quadrics they have some very nice geometry this has been worked out in particular in the thesis of mice reed and the geometry is very different in the odd dimensional or even dimensional case in the odd dimensional case you have a In the odd-dimensional case, you have an intermediate Jacobian, a hyper-elliptic curve, and you have a lot of geometry. In the odd-dimensional case, you just have a lattice, and it's not so. But this distinction does not appear here. This is valid for all M. In fact, you will see the proof that sort of reduces in some sense to the odd-dimensional case. Okay. Okay. So I'm going to start to give you the proof, but let me before make some remarks. The first one is that actually C implies A and B. A and B. You see, if you know that, well, let's go first to A. This on a variety like that, there are no non-trivial functions. It's artox theorem theorem, if you want. All functions are constant. Therefore, all functions on t star x are constant on the fiber. Are constant on the fibers, we just mean that they come from downstairs. So that gives this equality here. And why this Lagrangian? Again, well, this is what I put here. You see, you restrict Omedia to a fiber, you want to prove that it is zero, but it is a differential. It is a differential of one form. This one form on A minus Z again extends to A, but there are no closed one forms on the complete variety. So d eta is zero. This is zero, and therefore omega is zero. So both R and B depend of C. Now I'm cheating a little bit because for C we have this hypothesis that. For C, we have this hypothesis that X is general. This is not too bad here because if it's true for a general quadric, the statement is that some two form which is defined everywhere vanishes on the fiber. If it vanishes on the general one, it will vanish just by specialization. So this implies NDP. It doesn't imply, as far as I know, it doesn't imply. As far as I know, it doesn't imply A. And in fact, we have to use a different, completely different proof to prove A in all cases. But I won't talk about that. I will discuss this. So I want to prove C, and I would like to remark that I need something weaker than C, namely suffices. You have a biracial normal with an absent variety, which is defined in codimension one. Well, that's fine in codimension one, meaning that the indeterminacy locus has co-dimensional at least. Locus has co-dimensional at least two. First time I thought I was surprised. Remember that this is not proper, so you cannot say that this is extensive. But I claim that this suffices. Why is that? So if we have this here, so we have a morphism, by rational morphism from A minus Z, Z of three dimensional. Minus Z of co-dimensional at least two to phi minus one of lambda. Now, by the same type of argument as before, this implies that this is, we can say that this is Lagrangian because we look at this from omega, we put it back to A minus. It back to a minus z, as I said here, it's zero, and this is by rational, so this means that the two form, the sympletic form, is zero. So this is Lagrangian, but a Lagrangian, the fiber of a Lagrangian vibration has trivial tangent bundle, if you want, because the Hamiltonian vector fields corresponding to this function here are linearly independent. Here are linearly independent at each point. So, here the tangent bundle is trivial. And here, of course, it's an open subset of an abelian variety, same. So, the tangent bundle are trivial. So, let me call this map U. So, if we look at the determinant of the tangent path, T U. Bar T u it goes from a tangent bundle to a tangent bundle, it's a function of a minus z. Once again, there are no non-trivial functions here, so it's a constant. But is the determinant, this means that this is etal, and et al. and by rational implies that, in fact, it's an open. implies that in fact it's an open embedding okay so it's almost finished but now we look at u minus one it's a by a priori it's only a rational map it's it's by is this is by rational so we have a u minus one in a but any rational map to an abelian variety is everywhere defined this goes back to probably andrevaille i think so this is actually a morphism So, this is actually a morphism. And then we can play the same trick: tangent bundle trivial, each part. It has to be et al and birational, so it's again an open an open embedding. So, you see our phi minus one of lambda is stuck between A minus C and A. So, it's an open subset of A, and the complement is very small. So, the point of this is that we have somehow we can split our proof in, or I think maybe I can now with that in two parts. The first step is to reason purely in a birational way. We want to prove that the gene. To prove that the general fiber is by rational to an abundant variety, the second step will be to control the indeterminacy locus of this map. So there is two parts. Maybe I will write it here. So one find problem begin variety and submarine. And so by rational mark like this two or define in dimension one I will not discuss two I don't have time and it's it's not very I mean it's a it's a complete it's a dimension ground but uh quite subtle and by the way Quite subtle. And by the way, this is where we need the generality assumption. You can prove this only for general X general. But I will focus on the part one, which is more general, maybe more interesting. So let me start now, really, the proof. First of all, I have to define. First of all, I have to define this map file. So I start now from scratch, and then I have this map X and we want to define something from the star X to Cn We'll do something slightly weaker, maybe do that at the level of projective associated projective variety. So we look at the projective bundle, P star X, plus question by C star after deleting the zero section. And here this goes to P n minus one. We'll use lowercase phi here. Maybe I can put phi real this. And I want to define that. What is P T star X? Now I have to keep track of the maybe I should excuse me. I should start with a little recap. With a little recap about pensiets of quadrics. So, suppose I have a pension of quadratics, Qt, like here, of course, seeing P1. And let me say these are quadric in some Pm. Because I want to apply that to some other situation that just is X here. Sphere. But let me assume that the intersection, like we had for X, intersection of Qt, is a smooth, complete intersection. Then I will look at the quadrics of the pencil, which are singular. I don't have a very good notation, so I will submit it. So I will simply call this thing qt. And I claim that this, I mean, this is not difficult, this consists of m plus one point one mu m plus one. This is given by a determinant which will be m plus one by m plus one. We have m plus one coordinates with. And Poisson coordinates with coefficients linear in t, so we find a polynomial with t. And with this hypothesis, I mean, these points are distinct. Of course, there is no natural order, so I will see that as something in sim m plus one of p1, which is, of course, p m plus one. Okay, the other thing I want to recall is that in this situation, there are very simple equations for these quadrics. Namely, if we choose, we can choose coordinates, can choose coordinates xi so that my quadrics are given by. My quadrics are given by one quadric is sum of xi square zero, and the other is sum of mu i x, the same way mu j x j square per zero with different j. This is not a coincidence. I mean, if you see that if you take this one minus mu j, this one. Minus mu j this one, you get something singular. So in that case, the singular locus is exactly of this divisor here. Okay, so that's what I wanted to recall. And now let me define the map phi, lowercase phi. What is the point of pt star x? Well, there are various ways to see that, but I won't really. See that, but I want really to do some projective geometry. So I claim that this pitt star hex here is formed by pairs, of course, a point of x and n minus so x is of dimension. X is of dimension n, the tangent space at X has dimension n. So I want a hyperplane is so H will be a dimension n minus one contained in the projective tangent space. I don't want X to be here, okay. So, I mean, this parameter is hyperplanes in the tangent space. Seen projectively, this is the way you should. You should take all the hyperplanes passing through X and tangent to the quadric, to X at X. Okay, now if I have such an hyperplane, well, a natural thing to do is to cut down my quadrats by By age. So I consider now I consider my pencil of quadrics here. So it's a Qt now. We'll be seeing pencil of quadratic containing X. And I look at the pencil, Qt. So I fix a point here. point here. So this is give me a n minus one plane and I look at q t d h so this is a pencil of quadrics is h which is a p and minus one but they are all singular because this h is tangent to all the quadratics tangent to x so so let me say this a cone over Over as my small q capital case to q pencil of quadrics in narrow p n minus two right this is a cone in p n minus one so I see it as a cone over a smooth quadrate in p n minus two and uh in our In all map phi, we associate to xh the divisor of this guy here, the divisor of singular quadrics in and now I was in n minus two, so I have plus one, I am in uh seam n minus one. n minus one of p1 which is exactly p n minus one so this is actually what I do and this is the map fee so this is not too complicated if you think of it Complicated if you think of it. And now I think I can erase that. Now to define capital Phi, it's sufficient to see what is the linear system which defines this lowercase phi. And there is an easy claim which I will not prove, it's not difficult, but which by the way, it's a rational map. I wrote down. I'm sorry, this is born. Of course, I am. It could be very well. This will make sense for. Will make sense for a general point, but it could be very well that this pencil here is degenerate and that you get something which is not defined. So it's an irrational map. But still, it makes sense to pull back O of one here. And with some easy computation, you find that phi star of O P and minus one of one is O P T star. P d star x of two. In other words, this map is given by a sublinear system a priori of H naught of these. And so this defines the map capital Phi here. Note that this is a consequence, this is defined by quadratic function. is defined by quadratic function so the diagram is not actually is not cartesian we have that the for the the sister action if we apply if we multiply in the fibers by by sister so if we do phi of t times x this will be t scar t star phi of x This means, in fact, that these factors to t star x over plus or minus one, the minus one of t star acts trivially because of this. And so this is actually, and this would be the Cartesian diagram. I will go back to this later. Okay, so okay, so we accept the claim now. I can precise the main result, explain what would be this abelian variety A. So let me use the The special equations that I wrote before, so let me assume that x is defined by sum of xi square, sum of mu j x j square equals zero. And the proposition, maybe I'll define let me define now a curve which I will call C. Which I will call C new lambda not very natural. Maybe I'll write the proposition proposition. So, I want to write down the fiber, the fiber of lower. Fiber the fiber of lower quas phi phi minus one of lambda for lambda general in p n minus one which I think has a seam n minus one of p one and lambda will be general in any case. So, this will be actually complex numbers. I can avoid infinity because I'm interested only in the general lambda here. So, lambda is a set lambda one, lambda n minus one. And now let me define a And now let me define a curve C mu lambda r by the equation y square product of x minus lambda i product of x minus mu j. So maybe data count is useful. useful here we have we are in p n plus two so we have n plus three ui we have n minus one lambda so this makes two n minus two so this has genus g sorry genus of n uh what did i say to n we should have two n plus two uh ramification point so n plus four n plus So n plus 4, n plus 3 plus n minus 1, so this is 2n plus 2. So this is a curve of genus n. And the answer is that this is the Jacobian of C mu lambda. But modular group, the group includes plus or minus one times gamma, and gamma is a subgroup is a group of trans. Is a subgroup group of translations by points of order two isomorphic to Z sorry Z two n minus two subgroup of points of order two acting acting by translation so it's not actually an abenon variety it's a Kumo of our variety we modeled by Or I think we model it by plus or minus one. But the corollary, an immediate corollary, well, not immediate, I'm sorry, it's a corollary. And it's the one which really, and again, I should say birational. I'm sorry, this is only by rational. Everything from now on, as I explained, everything will be from a birational point of view. And this is, as I said, this is enough to. This is as I said, this is enough to okay. Corollary is that if I take this map, capital Phi, the one which really interests me of J of lambda is by rational to Jc mu lambda mod gamma. Minus one disappears. Minus one disappears green plus. The reason is that, I mean, we can see, you can see it in this diagram here. The only point you have to show is that minus one on T star X acts as this minus one on the fibers. This is not completely trivial. We have to look at the reaction on one form and do something, but this is true. Okay, so what we Okay, so what we have to prove now is this. And let me, I guess I can't go there now and give an idea of the construction. Yes, we see already the instruction I should say that if you take the difference, you can use the data. But if you take the definition of phi and try to see what is phi minus one of lambda, you go you're after nothing. I mean, it's uh it's complicated. I mean, you don't it's not the way we we do it. It's the idea, which is very nice, it's not due to me, is to add somehow the parameters to the coordinates. So remember that our x was in p n plus 2. We had coordinates as xi here. And now we embed this in a p to n plus 1, which means that we have to add n minus what coordinates. n minus what coordinate, but the n minus one which appeared down there, y one, n minus one. And we define a kind of master variety, x script, by adding some equations to those of x. That is, it will be an intersection again, an intersection of two quadrics. Again, an intersection of two quadrics, but we sort of include the parameters. So first we put some of xi square plus some yj square zero. This is one quadratic. And for the other, we take the first the equation of lowercase, lowercase. case lowercase x and we add this parameter sum of lambda j y j square zero so we notice that the trace this is a big much bigger we have essentially double the the dimension Essentially, double the dimension and getting a rod dimension, which is important. But when we take the trace over this pn plus 2, that means that we put y equals zero, so all this disappears, and we find exactly our original x. In fact, we will use both. We have this p n plus two, which is which we see. Which is which we see inside of P2n plus one correspond to y0. But then we have also the projection here from Pn plus 2, which I will call pi, which is just xy close to x. Okay, now this x here, this script x, we can look at it as a family of variety. And this goes on to CN by for when we fix lambda, we have this lambda here. I should actually have when I did. I should actually have when I define x, I should have put this morphism here. We have this goes to this is defined by the lambda i n minus one. Sorry. And then now this is the fibers fixed lambda. We have this lambda moving, and when we fix them, we have. Moving, and when we fix them, we have intersection of two quadrics in P and plus two. And now we will use the basic result of the theory of odd-dimensional intersection of two quadrics, which is that the family of whatever it is, n minus one planes is let me make sure that I do things right. We do things right. Yeah. So fact, which is due to wheel, I think. If I take a fiber X lambda, the family, let's say the Let's say the n minus one plane, so that this p n minus one contain in x lambda form a Debian variety. In fact, maybe I should write this like this. So I take this variety. Exists a variety of pn minus one in x lambda, and this is isomorphic to the Jacobian J C mu lambda. Non-canonically, I should say, but not important for me. So now I should say I will only consider the situation for general learning. Consider the situation for general lambda. Also, I don't care, I search for special lambda, I've searched singular fibers. I don't care about that. I look at the situation for general lambda. And now I look at this. So this gives me a family of Fano variety over Cn minus one. You see here I have X. So that f lambda, because this f lambda the family of n minus one plane contained in this intersection of two quadrics. Okay, so that's a nice familiar Fabian variety. I want to relate that to this. This doing is this. I guess I can read this. Now I want to define the rational map F to appear. P sister X. So interesting things are here. So I take this projection by. What is the point of F here? This is a certain P n minus one obtained in some X lambda. And I project it of P, this is the projection to P n plus 2, which is the P n plus 2. So I go back to my small situation with the body, and the claim, which is not difficult to see, is that is in fact tangent. Is in fact tangent to X well, sorry, I should so that's the plan, and I want also to at X which is Is the intersection of this plane here with P and bus 2. So actually I'm doing two things. I should have started with that. I look at, I take this plane, which is now we are in P2n plus 1. This is n minus 1. N minus 1. n minus 1 plus n plus 2 is just 2n plus 1. So for a generic p here, this intersection is just one point. So this will be the point x. And it's not difficult to write our own equation to see that this projection here is, first of all, this is a pn minus one. And for a gene. And for generic again, the projection will be one-to-one. And so we get this element. So we get x pi of p which is in p star x. Okay, and now the claim. So we have defined a map, we call it psi from this family of abelian variety of Jacobian to Pt star X. Before making the claim, you notice that there is no propaction at the moment, so I have to say something about that. Now the yeah, maybe I can go here. Maybe I should I can go here. Have this map sigh here is a variant not exactly what I once said variant and uh And two type of transformation. I can change the sign of the yj here yj. You see that doesn't change the equations here. And when you do this, you restrict to p. You are only. p you are only take care of you only use x so a change on the y doesn't uh doesn't uh change the map here the other one is a permutation permuting the y the yj again you can permute it now permuting uh does something on the land i also permute the On the lambda, you also permute the lambda. But I mean, you can do that. So you have a group, which is a semi-direct product. So in one direction, you have Z2. So the N minus one. This is the change of sign of the Y, and then you have the permutation of the Y, Sn minus one. Say minus one. And the claim is that psi induces f mod g by rational to p distar x. And this is moreover, well, not exactly over, I should make a run here. Because I'm transforming the base also, I'm acting as a base also, but the yeah, so first of all, have the group, the part which is here, which does not change the The lambda, so this still goes to Cn minus one. Now I mod out also by this symmetric group, so now FMOG, and here I have the question by the symmetric group. So this is really sim n minus one C, which is, of course, again C n minus one, but I like to say. But I like to see it like that. And finally, this goes into the star X, which goes into Cn minus one or P n minus one, which is which is the same P minus one. Which was it actually is. Which was it actually is sim n minus one of p1 and this c is just included in p1 i just avoid infinite so the claim is that this is birational That gives all we want. Once you have this diagram here, you just look at the fiber, and it tells you that the fiber here is the quotient of the fiber here, which is G. You exactly identify what you need. Okay, maybe I just finish very rapidly to explain why this map is birational. This map is birational. So the problem now is that you give yourself this image here. So you give H some H in P X let's say yeah so This is Pn minus one. This is a dimension n minus one. This is a projective tangent dimension n, and we want to find the p which project to this edge. So this fact that p we just try to write down, we write down the element. We write down the elements of this p. The projection, so the x part, the projection to p n plus one will be something in h here. So the first coordinate will be h naught h n plus two, which belongs to this hyperplane, even hyperplane h. And then this projection is one to one. I mean, this projection is one-to-one, so the rest will depend on this edge, and we'll have some linear form L1 of H, N minus one of H. And this P is determined by the data of this linear force. I mean, this defines P. defines p and we want to find we uh we know h here we we want to find this li so uh we just write down that maybe i will stay here we now we have to write around the fact that this plane is contained in the big quadric in the x-round Quadric in the X lambda. So we have sum of Hi square plus sum of L i H square zero. And same with the coefficient sum. So this is a sum of mu i h i square plus some lambda i L I L I H square zero. Now you've got this here. What we are searching for, we are trying to find this L i, right? We know this, so we put this on the other side with the minus, if you want. So we have two quadratic forms on the space now. We are on the space, let's say C or P n minus two or C n minus one. N minus two or C n minus one, we have two quadrics here, and we want to diagonalize them. Finding this li is just finding coordinates which diagonalize the two quadrics which are here. And now it's an easy fact that to find coordinates which do that, I mean, there is essentially one choice up to sign. Of course, you can change the sign of the array, and up to permutation. So this gives. To permutation. So, this is exactly the action of this group which is here, and that shows that once you have modeled by this group G, you have a biracial mark. Okay, I think I will stop here.
