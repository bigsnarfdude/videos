Thank you for the introduction, and thanks to the organizers for the invitation to speak here. So I'm going to be talking about a new paper that just hit the archive today. It's joint work with my colleague John Doyle here and Bella Tobin at Oklahoma State. So, to kind of warm things up, I would like to Things up, I would like to just recall the idea of what we kind of study in arithmetic dynamics in general, or even in this case, complex dynamics. So we're usually concerned with iteration of a rational function, usually defined over some number field, so it has algebraic coefficients. And I'm going to insist throughout this talk that our rational functions always have degree at least two. This is to ensure that The dynamics are sort of interesting, and our height functions are always going to converge. So, when we're studying the dynamics of these maps, we're obviously concerned with how points behave under iteration of the map. And the two sort of basic sets that we can break down the dynamics of a rational function into are the Fatu set and the Julia set. I assume a lot of people in the audience are really familiar with these and perhaps a few. Really familiar with these, and perhaps a few are not. The idea is that if we think of these things in, say, the spherical metric on your projective line or your Riemann sphere, the Fatu set is the largest open set where the iterates of your function form a normal family. So it somehow behaves very regularly. And this is usually classified in terms of things like basins of attraction. Like, for example, the simplest sort of function we might want to. The simplest sort of function we might want to iterate is something like z squared. And for z squared, there are two basins of attraction: one out towards infinity and one towards zero. And any point that's not on the unit circle on the Riemann sphere is either going to be attracted to one of these two points. So there's that basin where all the points are moving towards infinity, and everything inside here is moving to zero. But Julia said. zero. The Julia set is the complement of the Fatu set, and it's kind of where the interesting chaotic behavior happens. So the topic I'm really concerned with in this talk is equidistribution. And equidistribution is one of these tools that can be used to great effect to prove a number of theorems. In fact, Of theorems. In fact, there's all sorts of Bakomilov-type theorems and a lot of excitement lately as well in terms of things that you can prove using the tool of equidistribution. So just to motivate this in case, just in case there's anyone who's not really familiar with this idea, a basic example of equidistribution is equidistribution of pre-images under iteration of a rational map. Of a rational map. So let's take, for example, our squaring map, which is the nice and simplest example we can think of. And the idea is that we take a non-exceptional point. So there are points like zero and infinity for z squared, where, of course, you're not actually going to get anything new by trying to take pre-images. So we want to rule those out. And there's always at most two exceptional points. So most points are perfectly fine for this. So let's take something like two as a This. So let's take something like 2 as a starting point. And let's go ahead and look at what the pre-images of 2 under z squared are. So what I'm talking about here is I'm solving phi of z equals 2 to start and seeing, okay, there's our roots. We've got a square root of 2 and a negative square root of 2. And then we start taking pre-images of these things here. Now we have four solutions: 8, 16, 32. And as we keep taking pre-images, And as we keep taking pre-images, you can tell there's some sort of limiting behavior here, right? They're distributing in a very set pattern, and it's right along the Julia set, which we know is the unit circle for the squaring map, right? So I'm going to kind of review the basic equidistribution theorem that we want to generalize here. So for a single rational map defined over some number field K of degree, Field k of degree at least two. And again, I'm going to be assuming this. There will be a couple places where I don't even say this, but I'm never going to be using rational functions that are not degree at least two. You can define a dynamical height in this fashion. So I'm going to talk a little bit about construction of the heights and what these things actually are. Like there'll be a definition of the V height below. But roughly speaking, what you should think of is that the V height here is in some sense. Is in some sense measuring the arithmetic complexity of a number. So for a rational number, which is written in lowest terms, this is exactly log max of the absolute value of the numerator and the absolute value of the denominator. So it's logarithmic, it's absolute, and the more complicated your number is in this arithmetic sense, the larger the height. So the dynamical So, the dynamical hype here is very closely tied to the dynamics of this rational function. So, the idea is that the dynamical height can be associated to what we think of as an idyllic measure. So, the idea is that because we've defined these things globally over our number fields, we can look at every place of the number field, and there's some probability measure on this analytic projective line. This analytic projective line, the Berkovich projective line, such that there's a sort of canonical construction for creating heights associated to these measures. And the dynamical height is going to be the height associated to that idyllic measure. And further, the equidistribution happens in accord with this idelic measure. So we think of this as like a collection of probability measures, one at every local place. And there's some Place. And they're somehow describing the dynamics of this function. So equidistribution theorems back from 2006 now. They were proven independently by Matt Baker and Bob Romley and Charles Favre and Juan Rivera Letelier and several others. There were generalizations. I don't even want to try to get through the whole list now, but there's Want to try to get through the whole list now, but there's a lot of names here. This is a big et al., and I don't mean to insult anybody by not listing everything here. If there were much more space on a Beamer slide, I would try to put a lot more names. But anyway, the basic theorem says something like this. If you have a sequence of distinct points globally, so points in the algebraic closure of K, and your height. And your height tends to zero, in other words, these are points of low height. Then, the probability measure, which obviously doesn't look great here, but the idea is we're averaging over the Galois conjugates of alpha over that base field k. And these probability measures that are equally supported on every Galois conjugate of alpha, they are going to converge in the weak sense of measures, which we'll talk a little bit about in a second, to this idelic. Second to this idelic measure at every place. So, if you think of those as like sitting in, you know, say an infinite place, for example, then these are sitting in the Riemann sphere and they are converging here. So, we say this sort of behavior, we describe it as saying that these points equidistribute according to that measure there. Okay, so let's maybe put this in context of the example we've already seen here. Example we've already seen here. So, and again, the idea of the equidistribution theorem is small height is going to imply convergence of these measures. So this was actually kind of the paper that inspired a lot of these things by Yuri Bilu in 1997. And it was specifically for the standard V height. And the standard V height is what you get if you actually look at your rational map as being C squared or Rational map as being c squared or c to the n in general. And the idea was the idelic measure at the infinite place is just what we call here the standard measure. So I'm going to be introducing this notation as this is the measure associated to z squared. And this is just normalized arc length on the unit circle, right, which is exactly what we would expect from the picture we saw. And in our example, we could say something like this. Well, what we're really looking at are conjugates of an nth root of two. conjugates of an nth root of 2. And of course, with the fact that the height scales logarithmically, that 1 over n can come down in front, and we know that this height tends to 0. And our statement about weak convergence of measures really means this in the analytic sense. If we pick any continuous function on the Riemann sphere, then our averages against those Galois conjugates are going to converge to the integral of f against that standard measure, which in this case just means integrate f. Just means integrate f along the unit circle in the complex plane. Okay, so now of course what we really want to focus on in this talk and kind of the motivation for a lot of what we're going to talk about is stochastic dynamical systems. So what do I mean by a stochastic dynamical system? Well now instead of looking at just one rational map, we're going to look at a One rational map, we're going to look at a family of rational maps. So here's our set S, and they are all rational maps, and again, always degree at least two. And we're going to assign each map a probability. So I'm going to think of defining a probability measure, nu sub one, on S. So nu sub one represents the likelihood of selecting a given map during a sort of random walk. So instead of iterating a single map, now we're just picking maps at random and iterating. Iterate. So if we want to take n steps, we think of this as a selection in Sn. So this is a list of choices for which maps we use. And this we're going to think of as defining a new rational map given by starting with the first map and then composing all the way through to the nth map. And of course, the SNs have a natural product measure, which measures the likelihood of an individual map of length n. Map of length n. And the starting point for our discussion here is really this theorem of Healy and Heinz, which itself was in some sense a generalization of a theorem of Kawaguchi's from 2007. And the idea is that if we pick the phi in some sense so that they are like the height of the maps as maps is not growing too fast. Growing too fast. So, the specific way we want to think about this is if we think of this constant that is sent effectively, you know, up to the degree of the map and some renormalization, this is bounding how far apart the canonical height associated to phi and the standard height are. So, it's a basic result that these dynamical heights that we defined are all v heights and they're all within a bounded constant of this. All within a bounded constant of the standard height. And the idea is that if we associate this constant to every map, we want those constants to be bounded. And in that case, then you can think of defining a height as an expectation over these random n-step maps. And if you follow the same sort of process where you apply the map and then normalize by its degree, this By its degree, this defines a height that we think of as the stochastic height. And they show several things. We'll talk a little bit about them. But the first thing and the main thing is that this is a V height. So in particular, this satisfies that it's also within a bounded amount of the standard height. And in fact, both of these papers actually define these heights on smooth projective varieties. So you can do this in a little more generality. This is in a little more generality in order to work with our results. We're only going to talk about rational maps on the projective line. But yes, I just set up here. So a semi-group generated by an elements is an example of what you're interested in, or it is what you're interested in? No, the semi-group loses some of the data here. So I will talk about the relation here between dynamics of the semi-group versus dynamics of the stochastic family, but don't forget. Of the stochastic family, but don't forget here I'm assigning the maps different probabilities. Okay, semi-group doesn't have that information, right? It's just a list of basically the gamma n's in a sense. Okay, but you could assign a probability to choosing each one, build words for yeah, exactly. Right. And so for a semi-group, this uniformity is automatic with some probabilities. I'm not sure what you mean by uniformity. Oh, this you want the constant Cφ to be bounded. Ah, no. You can definitely form families where, you know, so the S here is not a finite set necessarily. So if it's an infinite set, you can pick maps with coefficients of larger and larger height in such a way that these constants are not bounded. So this is a non-trivial. So, this is a non-trivial restriction here. Sure, but if your S is the semi-group generated by N and V, it's not automatic. No. Okay. These can certainly still be unbounded in that family. Okay. So let me talk a little bit about the relation between this and the usual sort of dynamical height for one rational map. So first off, So, first off, I want to emphasize how similar the construction is. So, this is our construction of the usual dynamical height where we iterate our phi n map and we normalize by the degree of phi n, which is the degree of phi to the nth power. And here, the big difference is that, of course, instead of an nth iterate, we talk about the expectation over all compositions of n maps in the generating set S. And it also satisfies a very, very similar property here in terms of how it behaves. Now, this might look a little unusual on the right-hand side because usually the way this is written is that if you take the dynamical height of phi of alpha, it's the degree of phi times the phi height of alpha. But in fact, because this construction here needs to be averaged over each phi, Be averaged over each phi, and each phi needs to be individually normalized by its degree. These degrees can be different. It's much better to write this in this form so that you can say, okay, now I'm taking an expectation and these degrees can be different. But this equation is, in fact, directly analogous to the usual scaling property we would expect for the dynamical height, right? So, okay. And the third thing we want to say here is that. The third thing we want to say here is that the vanishing of the height is also very similar to what happens when the phi height vanishes. Namely, the orbit under the system is finite. Now, in the case of a single map phi n, when we're talking about the orbit of phi, or the orbit of alpha under phi, what we're usually talking about are the set of these iterates. Right? Right, but of course, in this context, taking random composition of n maps is that analog of this here. So this is actually true. This is a theorem in Healy and Heinz here. But there's one thing I want to note here that's different from the classical case, and that is that in the classical case, Classical case, you usually have plenty of preperiodic points, right? For an individual map, obviously, you can solve equations like, you know, when is the nth iterate of a point going to return to itself? So you could find period endpoints. You can set up things with tails and all that. So these sets are always infinite for a rational map. In the context of doing stochastic dynamics, these sets where These sets where the overall orbit under the semigroup is finite are always going to be finite here in any non-trivial setting. So, if we have more than two generating functions with, well, I have to be a little bit careful. The only case in which that set is infinite is actually when all of the maps share the exact same preperiodic points. So, usually this occurs when one map is, say, an iterative of another. So, if we did And iterate of another. So if we did something like we picked z squared and z to the fourth as our two maps, obviously both of these maps have the same set of preperiodic points, which are roots of unity, zero, and infinity. So this is actually true, and they both have the same height, the same height function, I should say. But in a sense, this is kind of But in a sense, this is kind of trivial. If one of the maps, as long as one of the maps is sort of genuinely different from one of the others, we're always going to be in the setting where we only have finitely many points with height zero. Now, height zero is kind of the special case we usually care about, right? So, like the Julia said, typically in the Archimedean case, the closure of the repelling periodic points. So, these periodic points. Propelling periodic points. So, these periodic points, the fact that we won't have infinitely many in our system, might suggest that we're going to have a lack of sort of equidistribution theorems. But as we'll see, it's not going to be the case. But very quickly, let me give an example here of sort of why this happens. So, first off, if we start with two First off, if we start with two sort of very nice maps here, so I picked the Chebyshev map and C squared, you can see right off the bat that the intersection of the pre-periodic sets is finite. And further, you can kind of see that not even everything in here is necessarily going to be finite under the dynamical system or the stochastic system generated by these two maps. Well, why? Well, why? Well, zeros are a fixed point for z squared, but it's not fixed under z squared minus two, right? Under the Chebyshev map, it is preperiodic because it's going to lead into minus two, and then that leads to the fixed point two. But once the Chebyshev map takes zero out of the unit circle, then any application of our squaring map is now going to send that out. Squaring map is now going to send that outside both Julia sets. So, as people might recall, we have the unit circle as the Julia set of z squared, but the interval from minus 2 to 2 is actually the Julia set of the Chebyshev map. And once we leave that, then both of these maps are going to be taking 4 towards infinity, which is, of course, a basin of attraction for both maps. And in fact, And in fact, really the only sort of non-trivial points that we have with finite orbit under the whole system are minus one and one. So we end up with this sort of picture here. So it's kind of interesting to just remind ourselves what's going on here. So, okay. So with so few, I don't want to say periodic, but you know, finite orbit. Say periodic, but you know, finite orbit points for stochastic systems in general. Is there anything interesting? Well, we already know from this field of study that was initiated by Hinkanon and Martin in 96 that there are a lot of interesting things you can say about the dynamics of semi-groups of rational functions. They only studied the Archimedean case, of course, but we'll talk a little bit about. We'll talk a little bit about the non-Archimedean setting as well. And in particular, you can define a FA2 set and a Julia set for your semi-group that have the usual sort of notions. Instead of all the iterates of phi being normal, now you think that every map in the semi-group is normal. So you think that they form a normal family. But again, you know, are there sort of arithmetic results that are interesting over here? Well, let's think about equidistribution. Let's think about the equidistribution of pre-images and what this would look like under a stochastic system. So, I'm going to pick two of the simplest maps I can think of. I've got the squaring map, or we've got choosy squared. Okay, first off, what do we mean when we talk about pre-images in a stochastic system? Well, here's the idea. Let's start with 2 and we'll think like, okay, it's got two pre-images under our squaring map and two pre-images under our Under our second map g, which is 2z squared. Ordinarily, if we were thinking of pre-images, we'd think, well, maybe I should assign a probability of one-half to each of these, and that's my sort of first level of pre-image here. But in fact, what we should do here is we should take that, and then keep in mind we've got two maps with different probabilities here. So, really, what we should be thinking is whatever the probability of F is. Whatever the probability of f is, I'm going to take half of it and assign it to each of these. And then for g here, we'll take the probability of g and cut that in half. Okay, so when we talk about pre-images here, we're going to weight the pre-images by the likelihood of selecting the map and then the number of pre-images where we keep in mind multiplicity. So, of course, if we continued here. So, of course, if we continued here, we would keep, you know, dividing by 2, and then we would have a probability of f squared because we also could have chosen g over here, etc. Okay, so formally, here's the idea. We're going to think of this as what we're going to call a random backwards orbit. And this is going to be defined by taking one starting point, and we're going to call that initial measure delta naught. Delta naught, alpha. And we're going to take pre-images of alpha for every map in the system, and we're going to weight them by the likelihood of the map, the multiplicity of the map at that point, and then normalize by that degree over there. So we're putting a point mass at every single one of these. So, in shorthand, this is the expectation of this measure here. Now, this happens to coincide. Now, this happens to coincide with what we usually define as the pullback measure under a rational map. So, the pullback measure is basically weighted by multiplicities in this fashion here. Whoops, actually this should have a degree as well. I forgot that the pullback measure itself doesn't have this degree over here. Let me have this. This makes it a probability. This makes it a probability measure again, by the way. So here's our idea. We're basically doing an expected pullback measure on our starting measure, and we're going to use this construction to recursively define our backwards, random, backwards orbit measures. Okay, so the question we have is, do these random backwards orbit measures equally distribute according to some According to some, you know, canonical measures. There are something analogous, like an idyllic measure, that tells us how these things should be redistributing in our stochastic system. So one quick note here, this whole discussion of multiplicities is not trivial, and people who are familiar with arboreal representations and things like that are probably familiar with this issue. Probably familiar with this issue, that you often get things like as you start forming these pre-images, you get points repeating and you see multiplicities occurring here. So this is kind of not as big an issue with just one single map and once. But of course, our family of maps S, we eventually want to take this to be potentially an infinite family, which means that. Which means that we really have to worry about multiplicities as we switch maps and all sorts of things here. So it's not even trivial to show that these limits of these random backwards orbit measures won't charge individual points. It will be true eventually, but it's just not trivial to prove this. Okay, so let's talk about our picture here. First off, we already know that the squaring map has Julius at the unit circle. Squaring map has Julia set the unit circle. It turns out if you work out how 2Z squared works, your Julia set is half, or a circle of radius one half. So what do the random backwards orbits look like in this setting? Well, we asked Sage and we plotted a bunch of them and that's what they look like. So first thing to notice here is in fact Is in fact this is actually the annulus between the two maps, so from radius one-half to radius one. And second, there appears to be some sort of interesting distribution here, some radial measure, which is weighted more heavily towards the inner circle than towards the outer circle. So, this suggests that really there is some sort of canonical measure here that we should be talking about associated to these maps. Again, when I have to give them each. Again, we're going to have to give them equal probability here in this example. So, was that a fluke? Now, we picked two very, very simple maps. The field Julius set of one was contained in the field Julius set of the other. You know, perhaps there was something really special going on. Well, let's fix some less trivial maps. So, here we go. This is a famous example for people who do arithmetic dynamics. This is a map with a really long or a really long time. Or a really large number of preperiodic points over Q in particular. And here's our usual basilica set. So there's the two Julia sets for these maps. So that's where pre-images under F would equidistribute along the red set, pre-images under G would equidistribute along the blue set. What would it look like if we take a random backwards orbit in this system? System. Well, it's this purple set. This set really does seem to reflect properties of both sets somehow. Right? So, okay, that looks nice. And certainly this was part of our inspiration for studying this problem was stumbling upon these pictures here. So, okay. What if we look at a rational function instead of just a polynomial? So this is a So, this is a favorite of mine. This is what I like to think of as Smith's function. This was the function that Chris Smith used to construct points of totally real numbers of very small standard V height. So, in fact, the smallest limit point known of totally real numbers, of the height of totally real numbers, was constructed as a sequence of preperiodic points for this quadratic rational map. Quadratic rational map. And it has a measure that's actually, it's kind of hard to see here, but the Julia set of this map actually is the entire real line. It's a fractal distribution though, so it looks like it's very, like maybe it doesn't get to the origin it does. The actual measure here really does, but it's totally real, and it is actually supported on the whole projection. Supported on the whole projective line. So it keeps extending out. So, okay, let's take our squaring map, whose height is obviously its standard height, and compare it to this, right? Seems like a natural comparison. Well, I don't know about you, but I really like that picture. So this is our random backwards orbit between these two maps. Okay. Well, now it does seem like this thing actually probably is. This thing actually probably is not compactly supported, which you would expect, not inside C anyway. So, all right. What if we take more than two functions? Like, so far, you know, we're talking about these families. In fact, I placed a big emphasis on the fact that S could be an infinite set, and I've only been showing you pictures with two maps. In fact, John Bella and I were kind of shocked at how long we went, only Shocked at how long we went only having drawn two maps. And at some point, we said, wait a minute, we're proving these theorems for infinite families, and we've never drawn a stochastic Julia said, which is what these are going to turn out to be for more than two maps. Well, let's try it. So here's a couple different maps. Some of you might recognize why we picked these. And here I want to emphasize, I favored the first map. Favored the first map, so I didn't assign them equal probabilities this time. The first map, which is F here, has its Julia set in the red, was favored. And you'll notice that the purple sets, our random backwards orbit, does seem to be favoring that red set to some extent. There's also mass over here that perhaps you wouldn't expect so much just from this map by itself. Okay, well. Well, what happens if we shift the actual probabilities? Do we get an entirely different set here? What does the distribution look like? Well, if we shift it, so now the squaring map is favored. It's clear that the distribution has shifted, right? If I go back and forth here, you can see the first one favoring the red set, next one favoring the green set. However, this picture might mislead you a little bit, but it Might mislead you a little bit, but it turns out the actual support of these sets in terms of their distributions is actually going to be the same. All that happens is that the measure along which these backwards orbits are going to equidistribute is going to shift. It's going to shift the mass, but the support will be the same. So, whoops. Oh my gosh. There we go. Okay. So what about formats then? Okay. What about formats then? Okay, I know. At some point, I need to stop just showing you pictures and actually type some math here. But you know, let's do one more and then we'll stop. So here we go. Equally weighted, four different maps. That's the stochastic Julia set. Okay, so let's get back to some math. Okay, okay, one more picture. Okay, okay, one more picture. Okay, let me do one more picture, and then we'll actually talk about some potential theory and some actual math. I promise this really is a math talk and not just my chance to show you a bunch of fun pictures. Okay, this one, we actually really got thinking about this because inspired by the idea of the annualist and a few others, we started asking if the field Julia sets are contained inside each other. So, like, if we look at this and then we look at this whole thing. I look at this whole thing. Should we always see something where our random backwards orbits are distributed in between? Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. It was just sort of a question suggested by your pictures. And maybe you can tell me, I'll tell me in a few slides. But like, assuming that these measures exist and sort of are doing what you want to do, then does like linear change of these probability choices then interpolate like the energy pairing between the two? Like the energy pairing between the two measures. If you take two maps and you go from, say, the pairing of one against itself to the pairing of the map against the other, then it looks like what you're giving me is if I assign probability T to one of them and probability one minus T to the other one. So that's an excellent question. And if I'm interpreting it correctly, the answer is no. And the reason is, I mean, effectively, are you basically asking if like the canonical If, like, the canonical measure is sort of an average of the two? Well, I mean, yeah, it seems like there's something wrong, right? Because you have this like smooth measure which sort of jumps to fractal as soon as you have a positive map, positive probability of choosing that measure in your backward orbit. Is that right? Like if you imagine V1 of F being really small, but close to zero, then this sort of is close to a smooth measure, but far from a smooth metric. Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah. Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah. It is, but you have to be careful. I think the best answer I can give at the moment is that because you have all the different compositions of the two maps, it's not as directly an average as you might think between the two. So it's definitely a little more complicated because of all those sort of cross terms that appear in a sense. All right, thanks. Sorry to interrupt. Can you maybe write the potential of the measure with respect to both? I will. I promise. This is the last picture, and then I'm going to get to actually writing these things down. Yeah. Okay. So as I said, I promise this really is a math talk. I'm not just going to show you pictures. But okay, I like this just to show that the measure actually goes inside the second map. And this whole like spirograph kind of pattern I thought was fascinating. Kind of pattern, I thought was fascinating because there's definitely some interesting dynamics in terms of like where we have these Fatu components. So anyway, we'll talk about that. So, okay. So let's talk a little bit about what we should be proving here. Then I'll write out some equations. And I get the sense that a lot of you already know kind of where we're going with this. So what we want to prove is that, or at least from these pictures, these pictures suggest that if S is finite, there's some Is finite, there's some idyll measure in the background, such that this height should be the height associated to that idyllic measure, and random backwards orbits should be equidistributing according to that idyllic measure at every place of the field of definition. So, in some sense, if you're taking these probability measures here, the heights of these probability measures should be going to zero. So, in terms of like what we can do here and how close. What we can do here, and how close our work is to the work of Healy and Heinz in particular. They extended Kawaguchi's results to allow S to be infinite and to allow for different probability measures on S, but both papers still stated their main results where everything was defined over a single base number field. So the big question for us was if S is infinite and we're not restricting to all the maps being defined over a single number field, can we still sort of? Field, can we still sort of get this result? And the answer should be yes, and in fact, it is, but it's going to require a little bit of work in terms of redefining our notion of what an idyllic measure is, because we're not going to have a sort of fixed countable collection of places for the number field anymore. So, and in particular, note that when s is infinite, these backwards orbit measures, these discrete probability measures that we want to talk about, they actually have countably infinite support. They actually have countably infinite support, even one step backwards. Because if you have an infinite number of maps, you have an infinite number of choices you have to deal with here. So, even defining the height for things like this is not really trivial because all these discriminant terms that you think should be vanishing by the product formula, how do you even know that when there's infinitely many points, these things are actually convergent enough? Convergent and enough for you to apply Tenelli and then bring in the sum and say, okay, advances by the product formula. So there's a lot of sort of non-trivial analysis in the background here. So, okay. The main new construction, and this is actually something I had been thinking about for a long time. And I know Mirta knows because I asked her about this idea back in the Hawaii sectional a few years ago now. Is this idea of generalized idelic measures? So idelic measures. Adelic measures. So, idelic measures where we're going to move from just being defined over a single place to being defined over places of q bar. Okay, so to put this in context, Favre and Rivera Letelier introduced the notion of idelic measures, and the idea was you can have a finite number of bad places where your local height is basically going to differ from the standard height by in a nice. In a nice way, namely, that the difference of the two measures is going to be the Laplacian of a continuous potential function. So they proved their equidistribution theorem for these heights. And this was generalized by Mavracki and Ye, and they were studying parametrized families of rational maps, and they discovered that the associated heights failed to be idelic. They were actually potentially. There were actually potentially an infinite number of places where you actually needed to have this continuous potential and have your measure differ from the standard measure. But it differed in a controlled fashion. So they introduced this notion of a quasi-adelic measure where you allow infinitely many places over your number field, but you control how much they differ from the standard measures. So essentially, our notion of generalized Delhi measures. Notion of generalized Delic measures is going to generalize this, and in the case where one of these is defined over a single number field, it is going to be the idea of a quasi-adelic measure. But we are going to remove that need to be defined over a single field, which I think is one of the more interesting technical things in this theorem. So I really hope that's kind of a tool that's going to catch on and people will try this for other families. Or other families you can construct that, you know, where the field of definition would grow as you construct it. So, okay. So, our basic results are going to be that the heights associated to general ecedelic measures are in fact V heights. We're going to prove an equidistribution theorem for them. I'll sketch the ideas here. I'm not actually going to write the proof out. And we're going to talk about doing this, measuring heights for arbitrary discrete probability measures on Measures on algebraic points of P1. So, our main theorem in terms of stochastic equidistribution is going to be this. If we have a stochastic family that, again, we're going to want some control of the average height of the map. So we call this L1 height control. It's equivalent to the notions that go into quasi-adelic measures in the case where it's all defined over a single field. It is phrased slightly different. Field. It is phrased slightly differently, but the equivalence is in the paper. Then the idea is the stochastic height really corresponds to a generalized Delic measure, and for almost every place of Q bar, and I'm going to talk about what this means. This is not what you would normally think. Usually when we say almost every place of a number field, we mean all but finitely many, and that's really what we should be saying. This is going to mean in a measure theoretic sense, that there's a specific sense of a measure zero set of places that. A measure zero set of places that might be excluded. And any alpha which is not exceptional for the system, the random backwards orbit measures equidistribute according to these things at every one of those places. So it's the theorem you would expect from the pictures, basically. So, okay, let's actually get into the construction now, even though we're slowly starting to run out of time. First off, the standard measure. These are the measures that give you the usual V height. It's normalized arc length on the units. Arc length on the unit circle in the complex plane. In Berkovich space, it's a point mass on the Gauss point. The Gauss point in Berkovich space is like a single point. It's a non-classical point, but it's the boundary of the unit disk in the Berkovich space. And both of these are really the equilibrium measure associated to the unit disk. So again, good reduction at some finite place means that you have the standard measure here. The usual V height written in the The usual V height written in the absolute logarithmic sense is this object here. And of course, the connection to potential theory and kind of what gets all this started is the idea that the local height here, the log plus of your absolute value of alpha, the Laplacian of the log plus function, actually, and this is a normalized Laplacian, by the way, it's divided by 1 over 2 pi, is actually the standard measure. Now, of course, I'm lying a little bit. Lying a little bit really, you should be doing the Laplacian on the whole projective line, and the logarithmic singularity at infinity results in a point mass over there. So, your Laplacians are always giving you measures, assigned measures of total mass zero, but again, that's kind of technicality. If you know that, then yeah, nothing to worry about there. So, okay, what's the idea of constructing the height on a rational function? Well, the idea is you construct the function like You construct the function like this to start. And this constant here doesn't really matter because the Laplacian ignores constants, but it matters for my normalization later. This construction has the effect of doing this pullback operation on the standard measure. So the Laplacian of this thing is this. And the idea is that every time you compose that Green's function with your map, you're effectively pulling back by phi again. Back by phi again. So you can actually make a telescoping series construction. This gives you your standard height or it gives you the measures associated to phi. And in fact, we can use this to define our height as well. The key fact about this is that it is actually a continuous function. So this function here is easy to see that it's continuous by construction. And because this is going to be a telescoping series that's decaying geometrically. Scoping series is decaying geometrically. And of course, every time you compose, the soup of this thing doesn't change like an absolute value. This is actually uniform convergence. So it is actually converging to a continuous function. So, okay. How do we associate the height to this? Again, if you haven't seen this before, I don't know how much sense this is going to make for me to just talk about this in a minute or two. But the idea is that for an idelic measure, For an idelic measure, you're the standard measure at almost all places, so the function here is zero. And for the remaining places, there's this continuous function where you differ from the standard measure by the Laplacian of that continuous function. If you define, so I'm obviously following Favona-Vero-Latelier's construction here. If you define your energy pairing in this fashion and you define for any alpha the probability measure supported on its Galois orbit over k, then the K, then the height is this sum of pairings. So, morally speaking, the idea here is that this pairing, when you give it sign measures of total mass zero, is almost a symmetric bilinear positive definite form. Except when you have point masses like this, that's not really true anymore. If both measures here admitted continuous potentials, then in fact, it really would be a positive definition. Then, in fact, it really would be a positive definite bilinear form here. And the idea would be that this thing going to zero would basically be saying that this measure has to be converging to that so that really it's the pairing of zero. So morally speaking, this is where equidistribution comes from. And the process of proving it is a process of regularizing these measures here by changing these logarithmic singularities and their potentials to sort of cut off versions of that. On that and working through the estimates analytically. So, what do we want to do? Well, we want to do this over, I know I'm slowly running out of time here, and I don't want to go too far. Instead of a single place, we're going to use a framework that was introduced independently by Gubler and later by Alcock and Mohler. And the idea is that we look at all the places, say, over some rational prime p. Over some rational prime p. And we say, okay, a place of q bar that lies over p is really an element of a projective limit. In fact, a profinite set here. So there's this space that's given by looking at all the number fields over Q, viewing them as a partially ordered set with restriction maps where if L is an extension of K, then the places of L naturally lie over some places of K. And lie over some places of k and forming this projective space here. So these end up being our space of places of q bar. And for the notation, we're going to say that these are our sort of compact open basis for the topology. They're given by picking a number field, a place of that number field, and then looking at the places of q bar that lie over that place. So the way this works, I just kind of wanted to give people the pick. This works, I just kind of want to give people the picture. Is you always start with the place of Q, and this is a measure one set. And then, as the place splits, it splits up into unions of places above places of your field. So, for example, if we add a square root of 2 in form k, there's two places, two real places, based on whether you take the positive or negative square root of two. I call these v and w. They each have measure of one over two. They each have a measure 1 over 2. Now, what that 1 over 2 really corresponds to, we'll see in a second here. But then I formed a cubic extension of k. And notice that the root here of beta is going to depend on which conjugate of alpha we used. And in fact, I picked it because when we pick the positive square root of 2, there's actually a complex place associated to this thing. Place associated to this thing. And when we pick to the negative square root of two, it's three real places. So the idea of this is that as these places are splitting, we're naturally assigning them measures based on this normalization factor of local over global degree. So this mu here, which is going to be the measure on our space of places, is given by saying that for this basis for the topology, Topology. The measure of that set is that local to global degree. And of course, the basic idea is that the sum of these factors is always one. So all these measures together work over here. But the interesting thing, and what I wanted to point out over here, is that for this one complex root, you have this local factor of two. Whoops, that should be a three, of course, over there. No matter how many times you proofread, there's always going to be something that slips, right? Something that slips, right? So, anyway, and that's that. So, this is a degree six extension with four real places and one complex place. So this is how it works in terms of constructing this. What this does is it turns this sum into an integral of the space of places y. The height becomes this construction over here, where now instead of doing a Galois, an average over Galois. An average over Galois conjugates of alpha over the base field, we can just take a single point mass for alpha. Okay, now that by itself should probably scare people who are thinking we want to prove an equidistribution theorem, but in fact we'll see that this still works. And we are going to extend it now to be defined for discrete probability measures in this fashion. So, okay, so this is our basic height. All right. All right. So, what is it going to mean to be a generalized idelic measure? The idea of the generalized idyllic measure is we should be able to construct a measurable function from the space of places over p across the Berkovich line over Cp, such that from mu almost every place, this function here is going to be continuous and it's going to define a measure at that place y. At place y. The L1 height control condition is going to be that if we take the soups of these functions here at every place and let it be an infinity, if we don't actually have a continuous potential there, then this function should actually be an L1 function of places. So in other words, we add up all the constants at every place, should be a finite overall constant here. Okay, and again, if this is defined over a single number field, this is equivalent to being quasiadelic. To being quasiodelic. All right, so what are the main theorems here? The main theorem is: first, if you have something that meets these conditions, then the height actually is an essentially positive V height. So in other words, differs by some big O constant, which is related to the integral of those C functions. And yeah, it's essentially positive. So second, there's an equidistribution theorem. Any sequence of discrete probability measures here with height tending to zero, which is measures here with height tending to zero which is well distributed is going to converge of mu almost every place to this uh to this uh generalized adelic measure so this condition is the stand-in because these measures now are infinitely supported so things like you know saying the degree tends to infinity doesn't necessarily mean anything anymore sequence of distinct points and that kind of thing so the condition is basically that they don't accuse Basically, they don't accumulate point masses, and the support should spread out in a nice enough fashion for equidistribution to work. And it's a very simple condition. The idea is you look at the sum of the squares of the probabilities in that measure, and they should tend to zero in that sequence. So, okay. All right. What are the generalized idelic measures associated to stochastic feminism? Sorry, I'm going so slowly here. The idea is this: we start with. This? We start with our basic function for any individual fee, that first step of the pullback. We form an expected version of those to get a first approximation to our Green's function here. And then we form expectations as we compose them with n maps. And of course, these again form a telescoping series. And the same arguments as usual show that this thing actually is going to define, it's going to be continuous. Going to define, it's going to be continuous and it's going to define a measure at every place where this soup is finite. And of course, the assumption we want on the family is that if we look at these things here and average them over every function, it should be an L1 function. So that's our height control assumption. So I'm sorry if that was really fast, but that was that. Was that? Are there generalized adelic measures that are not quasi-adelic measures, right? When we say things like are only happening happening at mu almost every place at q bar, is it the case that this really can happen? The answer is yes. It's actually really easy for this to happen. The idea, so there's an example in the paper. I obviously don't have time to talk in detail about it, but the idea is you can do things like take sequences of Selem numbers that are converging to a fixed point and look at. And look at powers of them. And as you put them together, right? So, an individual Selem number has one large real evaluation, one that cancels it because it's reciprocal, and the rest are on the unit circle. As you add more and more of them, they're typically independent. So the places are basically, I don't want to say products of places, but yeah. They're actually independent random variables if you think of them in the space. Variables, if you think of them in the space here, which is really interesting. But yeah, you end up with these sorts of valuations, and it's quite easy to construct something where for some valuations, all of them line up, and you end up with some really large numbers. But it turns out that if you construct it like this, because the degree is shrinking, you can apply something like the Borel-Cantelli lemma and say that, well, for almost every place, only finitely many of them are ever. Only finitely many of them are ever not one. But the places where you have a bunch of them that are all, say, greater than one will actually diverge. So you'll end up with things where the potential function no longer admits a continuous function there. So the measure actually is not something that we can work with. So, okay, I'll finish then by going back to the original example here. We looked at z squared and two. z squared and 2z squared. What are the measures that we were talking about here? Well, you can actually work this out pretty easily. It is a radial measure, and it's proportional to 1 over r in between in the annulus there. So that's our stochastic Julia set. And on the Berkovich side, it actually works almost exactly the same way, except it's now the line between the Gauss point and the point. And the point associated to the disk of radius 2. And if you have your path length metric, it's actually also a measure like that. Everywhere else, good reduction, it's a standard measure. So yeah. Okay, thank you all for listening and thank you to the organizers. And I couldn't help myself one more picture just because I thought it was cool. I'll stop there. I'll stop there.
