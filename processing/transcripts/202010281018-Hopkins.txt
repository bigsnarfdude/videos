And Roevacuation of root process. Hi there. Thanks very much for the opportunity to speak here. Can everyone see my slides okay? Great. Yeah, so that's the title of my talk, Symmetry of Narayana Numbers and Row Evacuation of Root Postets. It will be a continuation in a lot of respects of what Mike just was talking about. So hopefully you were here for his talk. But if not, it should still be comprehensible. If not, it should still be comprehensible. I'll kind of explain everything from scratch. Yeah, so in addition to these slides, which you can get from the conference website, let me also post in chat a link to a document on my website, which is kind of a more formal write-up about this problem. So, not like a paper or anything, but yeah, so I should also mention that there's a different I should also mention that there's a different talk that I've been giving recently, which would be of interest to people in this conference, about ordered polynomials of posets and particularly product formulas for them and how they tie into poset dynamics. I think that it might have been sent out as an email, a sort of a link to a recording of that. You can also find a recording on my web page. But I thought that more in keeping with the spirit of More in keeping with the spirit of the Burrs workshop style, it would be nice instead of talking about sort of things that I've already done to talk about an open problem, like an invitation to come work on a problem with me. So that would be basically what this talk is. And so this talk is about a problem which, properly speaking, is in the area of Coxeter-Catalan combinatorics. So not necessarily that. So, not necessarily dynamical algebraic combinatorics, but maybe a way that dynamical algebraic combinatorics could be useful for Coxeter-Catilan combinatorics. So I'm going to need to give a really short crash course in what is Coxeter-Catilan combinatorics to motivate the problem that I want to look at. So, what's the idea behind Coxeter-Catalan combinatorics? So, in one sentence, well, Sentence, well, we have a vile group W, maybe phi, its root system. We can associate a certain number to W called the Catalan number of W, which has several different descriptions and counts several sets of objects associated to W. And it's supposed to be a generalization of the Catalan number in the sense that for the type A case of the For the type A case of the symmetric group, we get back the usual Catalan number. So, in a second, I'll show you how all of these kind of different definitions in type A just become familiar Coxeter objects. But let me quickly, without spending too much time explaining each of the different possible definitions of the Catalan number, tell you what they are. So, first of all, the Catalan number can be described in terms of a product formula. So, here I take the product from i equals 1 to r, where r From i equals 1 to r, where r is the rank of the vile group, of h plus di over di. So here the di are called the degrees of the vile group, and there are certain important numerical quantities associated to the group. And h is a really important number associated to the group, which is called the Coxeter number. So it's the order of a Coxeter element. Hopefully, you've heard that before in some of the other talks. A Coxeter element is a product of all of this. Is a product of all of the simple reflections in any order. And so this turns out to be not just a rational number, but an integer, which counts several different things. So here are sort of five prominent definitions. One of them is it's the number of vertices of the W associhedron, a certain polytope associated to the bile group, equivalently the number of facets of what's called the cluster complex, a certain simplicial complex. It's also equal to It's also equal to the number of so-called non-crossing partitions of W, which is the same as the interval between the identity element and a Coxeter element, C, some fixed choice of Coxeter elements in the absolute order on W. So the absolute order is a certain partial order on our Weil group, which, if you're familiar with the weak order, which is maybe a more commonly studied one. Maybe a more commonly studied one. It's sort of the same as the weak order, except where we take all reflections as the generating set instead of just simple reflections. So there's a notion of absolute length, which is the shortest representation of an element in terms of a product of reflections, and that sort of lets you define the absolute order. Again, I'm going to go quickly through these definitions because they're not the focus of my talk, but just to show that there are several, many, many different definitions of the Many different definitions of the W-Catalan number. Okay, then here's a one that's going to be really important for the talk, which is the number of non-nesting partitions of W, which is, again, just a terminology for the number of anti-chains of the root poset of phi. So the root poset of phi is the poset of positive roots of the root system phi ordered by alpha is less than beta if beta minus alpha is a non-negative sum of roots. So in Mike's talking. Non-negative sum of roots. So in Mike's talk, he gave you a nice picture of the type A root posit, which is kind of a triangle-shaped thing. Another definition, again, I don't want to spend too much time on this, is it could be defined to be the number of W orbits of Q mod H plus 1Q, where here Q is the root lattice of the root system and H again is the Coxner number. It's also the number of so-called dominant regions of the she arrangement associated to W, a certain hyperplane arrangement associated. To W, a certain hyperplane arrangement associated to W. As you can define the Catalan numbers for W. But there's one kind of major division, which here I've drawn as a dotted blue line, but maybe it should really be like an ocean. If I had more space, I would draw a much bigger division between things that are up here, which I would call the non-crossing world, and things that are down here, which are called the non-nesting world. The non-nesting world. So you might notice these kind of lines that I've drawn connecting some of the numbers, and those are bijections that various people have defined, which in some sense canonically associate one definition to another. But the relationship between the non-crossing and non-nesting worlds is very mysterious. It's kind of the central mystery at the heart of Coxeter-Catilian theory. So, this is really a big divide that's still. So, this is really a big divide that's still kind of, I would say, is an important and mysterious distinction. And it's also worth mentioning that sort of some things are better from one perspective, some things from the other. So this product formula is only uniformly proved in the non-nesting case. Meanwhile, the non-crossing case has some, the non-crossing world has some benefits too. For instance, all of this makes sense for any cockseter, any finite coxswain. sense for any coxsetter, any finite coxseter group, not just a vile group. Okay, so anyways, those are the kind of coxsetter definitions, which might be a lot if you hadn't seen them at first, but let me tell you what everything is in type A so that it looks more familiar and approachable. So in type A, we get familiar objects, the vertices of the essocihedron, those correspond as we know to triangulations of an n-gon, five triangulations of a pentagon here. The lattice of non-crossing partitions, The lattice of non-crossing partitions, which I defined as a certain interval of permutations ordered in a certain way, well, it's really exactly the same as the classical lattice of non-crossing partitions of a set, which hopefully you've seen before. It was mentioned in Emily Barnard's talk, for instance. Okay, the root poset anti-chains correspond to dick paths. And I think here's a picture which should remind you of what happened in Mike's talk. He basically explained this. He basically explained this correspondence. Q mod H plus 1Q is the set of parking functions in the case of type A, if you know what the kind of commentarial parking functions are, and the W orbits are decreasing parking functions, which are a Cataline object. Finally, here's the Xi arrangement of type A, and its five dominant chambers are highlighted in yellow here. Yellow here. Okay, so there's many Catalan objects, there's many cocks that are Catalan objects. And what I want to focus on for this talk is actually a refinement of the W-Catalan numbers, which are called the W-Nariana numbers. So for k equals 0, 1, 2, up to r, the rank of the root system, the Narayana number w k is, again, it has several different definitions depending on which. Several different definitions depending on which perspective you want to take. So, one thing is it's the H number of the W associahedron. So, if you know about facial enumeration of polytopes, you know that there's the F vector we can associate to a polytope keeping track of the number of faces of every dimension. And there's a classical kind of transform from F vector to H vector. And that H vector is giving the Narayana numbers. It's also the number of non-crossing partitions of rank K. So that poset that I described as an interval and absolute. Set that I described as an interval in absolute order, it turns out is always a ranked lattice, and its rank sizes give you the Narayana numbers. Okay, the Narayana numbers also keep track of the anti-chains of the root postet by cardinality, and this again is going to be a main focus of the talk. There are some other definitions for types four and five, but let me not focus on them. By the way, if you want a nice place to read about Narayana numbers, I like this textbook, oh, it's becoming invisible, huh? Of Kyle Pearson on Eulerian numbers. So the Eulerian numbers are a refinement of n factorial, the number of permutations, in much the same way that the Narayana numbers refine the Catalan numbers. And there's a strong parallel between Eulerian and Narayana numbers. Okay, let me show you again in type A what the Nariana numbers are. So this is the socihedron. Its F vector is 1551. If you know how to go from F to H, well, the H here is 131. To h, well, the h here is 1, 3, 1. Here's the lattice of non-crossing partitions, and its rank sizes are 0, 1, and 2 with 1, 3, and 1 of each rank. Okay, here I've grouped the anti-chains by their cardinality. We see 1,31 again. Here's parking functions, the sheer arrangement, and so on. So, in this case, those are the Narayana numbers, 1,31. Okay, so that is probably too small of a case to really understand anything much about the Narayana numbers, but something you might notice or remember from Mike's talk is that there's this kind of curious symmetry property, which is that the kth Narayana number is always equal to the r minus kth Narayana number, where again, r is the rank of the bile group we're talking about. And I mentioned there's this kind of big divide. There's this kind of big divide in coccidor cattle and cominotorics between the non-crossing and non-nesting worlds, and from the non-crossing perspective, there are good explanations for this symmetry. So, for instance, for the W socihedron, well, the fact that these H numbers are symmetric, that's true for all simple polytopes. Those are called the Den-Somerville relations, and so those explain the symmetry of the Nariana numbers from the osocehedron perspective. From the non-cross-productive Perspective. From the non-crossing partitions perspective, well, that lattice, it turns out, is always self-dual. In fact, there's a particular duality that I'm going to factor in later in the talk that I'll focus on. So anyways, the rank sizes are symmetric just because the poset, again, is isomorphic to its dual. On the other hand, for the non-nesting partitions, the number of anti-chains of the root postet by cardinality, it's very unclear why. It's very unclear why the number of anti-chains of cardinality k is the same as of cardinality r minus k. And again, this is true for all biogroups, for all root systems. So this kind of question mark, question mark, question mark is what I'm going to call Panusha's problem. So his problem was can we explain this kind of mysterious symmetry of the non nesting Narayana numbers bijectively? Testing Narayana numbers bijectively. And maybe I shouldn't call it Penguin Show's problem. Certainly, he considered it, but it's like a natural thing from as soon as you start investigating coccidor-catalyne combinatorics. In their nice kind of manuscript on generalized associed, fomine and reading also kind of point this out as a problem, as like an unexplained thing. So, anyways, that's the problem that I want to invite everyone to work on. To work on, and uh, okay, so more specifically in a paper uh, with this starts out, add no potent ideals, blah blah blah. Um, Penischev conjectures something more specific, namely that there should be a natural involution on the set of anti-chains of the root poset, which combinatorially demonstrates the symmetry of the Narayana numbers in the sense that the cardinality of an anti-chain plus the cardinality of its image under this involution is always equal to R for all. Is always equal to R for all anti-chains. And everything in this conjecture, the word natural is doing all the work in this conjecture because just from the fact that the Nariana numbers are symmetric, it follows that there's some involution which does this. But the point is, can you write down kind of an explicit one? In his paper, Penushev kind of asked for some more specific conditions. Conditions, which I'm just writing here as natural. Hopefully, that captures the spirit of his conjecture. So, Panyashev could not define this involution. Again, I'm calling it P for Panushev in general, but he did give a definition in type A, which turns out to be equivalent to the Lalan-Krevoras involution on DICPAS, which was the subject of Mike's talk. And as Mike explained, Of Mike's talk. And as Mike explained, the Lolan-Krevaros involution combinatorily demonstrates the symmetry of the anti-chain cardinalities for the type A repository. So it's a good candidate for this pan-U-Shov map. Also for types B and C, it's not hard to use a standard symmetry argument, which is sometimes called folding, to get the map from the type A map. From the type A map. So the type B and C case are also kind of, they were treated by Penyushev. But for general types, not so clear what this map should be. Then let me also mention another related conjecture of Penyushev's from a follow-up paper. So this is a conjecture which maybe people are more familiar with in this audience. It's about row motion. So pen you About row motion. So Penyushev conjectured that for row motion acting on the set of anti-chains of the root poset, well, first of all, the 2 times h, where h again is the Coxeter number, the 2 times h to the power of row motion is the identity. And moreover, if we sum along any row motion orbit, we should get a constant average. The sum should be constantly equal to h times r. Yeah, so this. Um, yeah, so this kind of conjecture here, especially this part, was like the first prominent instance of homomycy, and it motivated the definition of homomycy, which we've heard a lot about at this conference. And I can't know for sure what was going on in Penyuschev's head, but I want to believe that he thought of conjecture two because of conjecture one, that he was thinking about this Nariana number problem when he was studying row motion on the anti-chains. And the reason is, is that they're really And the reason is that they're really similar conjectures. So you can rephrase conjecture one as saying that there's some way to partition the set of anti-chains of the root postet into subsets of size dividing two, such that the average cardinality in any part is this constant r over two. And conjecture two is almost the same thing. It says that we can partition the set of anti-chains into subsets of size dividing to h. H is the Coxider number, and these subsets are the row motion. Subsets are the row motion orbits again, and the point is that the average in any part should be r over 2 of the cardinality. So 2 and 2h are not the same really, but it's still quite small compared to the total number of anti-chains, so it's a very fine partitioning of the set of all anti-chains. And of course, we know that conjecture two was proved by Armstrong-Sumpton. Was proved by Armstrong, Stump, Thomas. And as I mentioned, this kind of row motion conjecture of Kenyashev's motivated a lot of the recent work in dynamical algebraic combinatorics. So I want to argue that sort of the study of the Narayana number symmetry eventually led to a lot of the current work in DAC. And now I think it's time to go back. In my abstract, I say we should go full circle. And I only realized recently that that's kind of like a nice, you know, has assonance with the whole cyclone. Has assonance with the whole cyclic action theme of this conference. So I think we should go full circle and try to apply dynamical algebraic combinatorics to this original problem of Nariana number symmetry. Okay, specifically, how are we going to find a good involution on the set of anti-chains? Well, if you were around for Mike's talk, you probably have already guessed what's going to happen. So let's recall from Cameron and Vonderfloss, and also as Cameron and Fonderfloss, and also as re-emphasized by Stryker and Williams, that row motion acting, say, on the set of order ideals of a poset can be written as a composition of toggles. If our poset P is graded, then we can write it as toggling from the top rank, the next rank, and so on all the way down to the bottom rank. So here I'm using T sub I to be the set of, I mean, the product of all the order ideal toggles for elements of rank I of our ranked poset P. And then row evacuation. And then row evacuation is another composition of toggles acting on order ideals, which is many more toggles. So we toggle from the top to the bottom, then we toggle from the top down to the bottom, but we leave out the last row, then we toggle and we leave out the last two rows, and we keep doing the same over and over. So Mike explained this probably better than I'm doing right now. But anyways, row evacuation is the composition of many of these rank toggles. Toggles. And why the name row motion and row evacuation? Well, it turns out that these same kind of definitions, these same kind of compositions, could be used to define promotion and evacuation. So we heard about promotion in Jessica's talk. It's an action that Schusenberger defined on the linear extensions of any posset. Evacuation is a related and kind of a partner action, which in some sense. Partner action, which in some sense is even more fundamental because it has a close connection to the RSK algorithm. Anyways, both of these operations can be defined just like the same definition of row motion and row evacuation, except here the TIs are bender-Knuth involutions instead of the toggles. But anyways, for very formal reasons, actually, just because the TIs are involutions, they square to the identity and they commute unless the indices are adjacent. The indices are adjacent, that already implies some facts about row vacuation and row motion, namely that row evacuation itself is an involution that it generates the stihedral group. So again, Mike explained this. These are kind of basic facts that hold for any graded POSET. And then of course there's the anti-chain version of these two maps for emotion and row evacuation, which Mike again talked about last just Last just half an hour ago. So, again, they have definitions as compositions of toggles, but now we can use the anti-chain toggles instead of the order ideal toggles. So, here are the definitions. And let me just show you one example of what applying row evacuation to an anti-chain of a root postet looks like. So, I'm going to do D4 as an example because we've already seen kind of what type A looks like. So, here's my D4. So here's my D4 root postet, and I've chosen this anti-chain with the elements highlighted in blue. So to compute row evacuation, it takes sort of a lot of work, but let's do it together step by step. So first we toggle starting at the bottom and all the way up to the top doing anti-chain toggles. So I can't add any of the things on the zeroth rank or the first rank. But when I get to the second rank, I can remove these two and add this one. And then I'm not going to be able to add anything in the Then I'm not going to be able to add anything in the third or fourth rank. So, anyways, this is what happens when I apply just those toggles from bottom to top. I get here. Now, I apply the toggles starting at rank one and working my way up to the top. And when I apply the toggles at rank one, I can't add either of these, but I can add this element, so I do. I can remove this, so I do, and I cannot add either of these, and nothing above. So, this is the result. Nothing above. So this is the result of applying toggles from rank one to four. Okay, then I'll apply toggles from rank two to four and I'll actually add back in this element here. That's the result of doing those composition of toggles. And I do some more toggles that actually have no effect. And anyways, I end up at this anti-chain when I try to apply row evacuation to this initial anti-chain. Okay, so that's what row evacuation. Okay, so that's what row evacuation looks like. Again, it takes a lot of work for any given anti-chain, but you can do it by hand on a piece of paper. Okay, and so we get to the main conjecture that I have, which is that for root systems of classical type, meaning A, B, C, or D, well, row evacuation combinatorially demonstrates the symmetry of the Narayana numbers in the sense that the cardinality of A plus the cardinality of the A. sense that the cardinality of A plus the cardinality of the row evacuation of A is always equal to this constant R, the rank of the file group for every anti-chain. In other words, row evacuation is Panushev's desired involution in these classical types. And just to see what's going on here, in this small example, we started out with an anti-chain of cardinality 2, we got one of cardinality 2, and 2 plus 2 is equal to 4. Okay, so for types A and B and C, it's definitely true because as As Mike mentioned in the last talk, we showed together that row evacuation is the same as the Lalan-Krevoras involution. For type D, I verified it for up to rank 8, which I guess is a reasonable amount of data. Unfortunately, so something that really annoys me is that this kind of conjecture does not extend to the exceptional types F4, E6, E7, E8, in the sense that you In the sense that you don't always have this kind of constant sum of the cardinality of A and the row evacuation of A. But even for these types, it seems to work for like the vast majority, 80% plus of the anti-chains. So I feel like something must be going on here and that maybe we can slightly modify the definition for the exceptional types. Or I don't know. It just, it's weird to me that this happens. But anyways, even for type D, it would be great to prove this conjecture because that's beyond what Kenyushev could do, and that would take care of all of the classes. Do, and that would take care of all of the classical types and kind of uniformly describe the map in those classical types. Okay, so in the remaining time, I'm going to talk about some possible ways that we could kind of approach this problem. And the main idea is to build off the work of Armstrong, Stump, and Thomas. So, by the way, when am I supposed to wrap up by? Am I supposed to wrap up by 1203? I think. Is that right? 1203? Oh, oh, okay. Great. So I have probably more time than I need, but we'll see how this goes. Right. So what did Armstrong, Stump, and Thomas do exactly? And I think this was related to Theo's question in the chat about the cyclic sieving phenomenon. So Theo asked about About this conjecture of Panyushev's. And I would say that no, he didn't know about the cyclic sebbing phenomena. He wasn't thinking about that when he made this conjecture. But I'll explain what Armstrong, Stump, and Thomas did. So again, let me use NC of W to denote the lattice of non-crossing partitions for W, which is this interval in absolute order between interval in absolute order between the identity element and some fixed Coxstarter element. And this lattice, it turns out this posit is a lattice and it's a ranked lattice with a complement called the Creveras complement, which is defined as follows. We take creveras of W, we multiply on the left by seeing the Coxster element, and we invert W. And it turns out that this map, well, it's Well, it fixes the set of things between E and C in absolute order, and it is a self-duality of this lattice. Okay, so in type A, it's a familiar thing, the creverest complement of non-crossing partitions. Again, I think Emily Barnard talked about this. Maybe didn't describe it this way using these pictures, but so if we start with some non-crossing set partition of the numbers one up to seven, there's a way of One up to seven, there's a way of, well, you kind of draw some extra numbers in between every number that you have and kind of fill in the shape with the unique maximal non-crossing partition that matches, that won't cross the one you already have, and you spit out a new non-crossing set partition. That's what the Kerras complement is, classically. There's also a simple bijection between non-crossing partition. Bijection between non-crossing partitions and non-crossing matchings. So, non-crossing set partition of one up to seven and non-crossing matchings of 14 things. And under this bijection, the Krevoras complement is actually just rotation of non-crossing matchings. So I think non-crossing matchings are the easiest way to view the Krevoras complement. And that's what it is classically in type A. So one thing to note is, yeah, this is a duality of this lattice. duality of this lattice it's an anti-involution on the poset but it's not uh it's not a uh it's not an involution it has some order which is not two um so it could be interesting to study its dynamics also let me uh let me apologize so the crevorous complement is completely unrelated to the crevorous lelanya crevorous involution but they both are factoring in here because i guess crevorous just did a lot of stuff Just did a lot of stuff. Yeah. Okay, so, anyways, answering a conjecture of Basis and Reiner, and they were the ones who were thinking about CSP, I think, in order to address Theo's question in the chat. So, okay, so what did Armstrong, Stump, and Thomas show? Well, they showed, they showed that there is a bijection between the set of answers. Between the set of anti-chains of the root post at the non-nesting partitions and the non-crossing partitions of W. And in fact, there's a unique bijection which is defined by three properties. Okay, the first, and I'm kind of suppressing things here because I don't want to tell you everything about this theorem, but I'm giving you the highlights, I guess. So the first property is some base case, which is really not so important at all. And you can kind of, actually, the theorem is true even if you remove this bullet point. You remove this bullet point. The second point is the key property of the bijection between the non-nesting and non-crossing worlds. And it's this equivariance property, which says that if we do row motion and then we do the theta bijection of Armstrong's son-Thomas, that should be the same as first doing the theta bijection and then doing the Kreverus complement. In other words, theta transports row motion of anti-chains to Krevorus complement of non-crossing partitions. Of non-crossing partitions. And the third property is something called parabolic induction, which is a little bit complicated, but it says that there's kind of a recursive way of computing this bijection. And they showed what's, I mean, what's really nice about what they showed is that this bijection exists and is unique for every bile group, W. So let me, let me, you know, not to judge other people's work, but let me talk about the good and the bad of the Armstrong Stump Thomas. The bad of the Armstrong-Stump-Thomas bijection. So, the good of it is that it's uniformly stated. It doesn't depend on case by case to list all of these things, even though I sort of suppressed some of the technical details. Another good thing is that it's computationally efficient. I actually coded this bijection. Well, yeah, exactly, Tom. Yeah, so I coded this bijection and it works really quickly in Sage for like, you know, up to n equals 14. I don't even know. It works quite quickly. I don't even know. It works quite quickly because this induction step is fast. Another kind of questionable thing in the good category is, at least from my perspective, is good, that it involves interesting dynamics, namely row motion and Kreveros complement. Those are kind of cool. Okay, what about the bad? So, one thing that's bad about this bijection, and oh, thanks, Hugh, for the support. Okay, I don't mean to say bad, but maybe. Okay, I don't mean to say bad, but maybe what I want to say is that I would consider the problem of understanding the connection between the non-nesting and non-crossing worlds still to be open and not to have been fully resolved by this theorem, even though this theorem, in a sense, provides a connection. Okay, and one thing about the not having fully resolved the connection between non-nesting and non-crossing worlds is this theorem is not uniformly proved. So every instance of this theorem has to be checked in the particular case. Be checked in the particular case. And especially in the classical types, rather than kind of work with Coxeter-type arguments, they use particular models, like for instance, the model of non-crossing matchings in type A, and describe the bijection explicitly in terms of those models. But it's quite complicated when you work at the level of particular models. Another thing that's kind of bad about this bijection is that the parabolic inductions line, which I've suppressed. Line, which I've suppressed, is actually hiding a lot. And maybe sometimes we don't like when our constructions are recursive or inductive. We would prefer that they just be non-recursive, I guess. So anyways, that's the Armstrong-Stump-Thomas bijection. And here, just let me show you an example in type A. So we have the type A root postet. I'm doing two anti-chains that are connected by row motion. I'm looking at their images under theta, which are these non-crossing matches. Which are these non-crossing matchings, and these two non-crossing matchings are related by a, I guess, counterclockwise rotation. Oh, that doesn't, a clockwise rotation. Okay, there we go. Okay, so, but now the question is, how do we connect? So, this is a connection between sort of row motion and the non-crossing partitions. How do we connect row evacuation into this? Well, we want. Well, we want to extend the cyclic action of the Creverest complement to a dihedral action on the set of non-crossing partitions of W. And to do that, we're going to define something called the flip. So I'm calling it the flip because the Krevoros complement is kind of a rotation. So the thing that it should form a dihedral action with should be some kind of flip. Like a, I wanted to call it a reflection. I wanted to call it a reflection, but that's an overloaded word in the Coxeter theory, so I'm not going to call it a reflection. Anyways, what should the flip be? If you think about it, because Crevoras complement is an anti-automorphism of the poset, the flip should be an automorphism of the poset to have the sort of right relationship with the crevorous complement. And it turns out the right thing to do is to invert your element w, your element of your permutation w, and to conjugate it by. And to conjugate it by G, where G is a certain special involution which depends on the choice of Coxeter element C. So for the standard Coxeter element in type A, the right G to choose is the longest element W, not. And for all the sort of standard choices in the classical types, I kind of worked out by hand what this involution G had to be. But then Nathan Williams really set me straight and explained how to define G in general for all vile groups. In general, for all vial groups, the right thing to do is to assume that your Coxeter element is bipartite. So it's a product Cl times C R, where L and R is a bipartition of your Dinkin diagram. And that's sort of something you can always do. And it actually goes into the Armstrong-Stump-Thomas bijection, but I didn't explain that. Anyways, if C is bipartite, then the right thing to do is to just choose the left part of C, C sub L, as your involution. As your involution. Okay, and then it's actually easy to prove once you have the right definitions that the Armstrong stump-Thomas bijection transports the flip at the level of non-crossing partitions to, well, not quite row vacuation, but row motion inverse composed with row evacuation. So in a dihedral group, there's two conjugacy classes of reflections, and you have to be careful to get the right reflection anyways. This is a technical Anyways, this is a technical detail. Obviously, if we wanted to see where row evacuation went instead, because of the equivariance, we could do, you know, Creveras inverse composed with a flip. And again, this theorem is easy to prove. It follows just from these general properties of the Armstrong-Sum-Thomas bijection. So you can, in a sense, automatically lift the cyclic action to a full dihedral action. And it's compatible with their bijection. Okay, so here's an example. Okay, so here's an example. In type A, here's an anti-chain in the type A root close set. Here's what happens when you do row evacuation and then row inverse. You get another anti-chain. And here are their images under the theta bijection of Armstrong, Stump-Thomas. And these two non-crossing matchings are related really by a flip in the sense of like a reflection across a diameter of the Across the diameter of the circle. So that just works in all the types. And okay, but how could this be useful for the conjecture about the symmetry of Narayana numbers? Well, the idea behind that is that if we had a precise enough understanding of this Armstrong-Som-Thomas bijection type B, we could use this to resolve the revacuation conjecture because it's probably easier to think about flips. Easier to think about flips than it is about row evacuation, which is a complicated composition of toggles. And this is how Armstrong, Stump, and Thomas resolved the original Panushev-Homomesy conjecture. So what they did is rather than think about row-motion acting on anti-chains, they thought about rotation of non-crossing matchings and the analogs and other types, and they studied how. And they studied how the cardinality statistic is transported under the theta bijection, and they kind of again argued about rotation rather than row motion. So this is, again, they sort of succeeded in carrying out this idea for Penushev's conjecture. My problem was that the description of the bijection is extremely complicated. Even in type A, the bijection between anti-chains. Anti-chains and non-crossing matchings is complicated. And for type D, it's really horrendous. The model in type D is quite complicated. Actually, this, so originally, Vick Reiner in the 90s came up with a proposed definition of what non-crossing partitions should be in type D, and he sort of got the wrong definition in a sense. It was only after the work of Basis that in a paper of Athanasias. Of Athanasiatis and Reiner, they kind of gave the correct definition of non-crossing partitions in type D. So it's really something that's tricky to get exactly right. But it's why I would invite other people to come work on this with me, because maybe together we can be motivated to stare at some complicated examples and see exactly what's going on. Okay, so with that, I say thank you. That's the end of my talk. Well, that's all. Thank Sam. Well, that's all. Thank Sam. Okay, and maybe before questions and so on, I've never been in this position before, but I think I'm the last speaker of this conference. And so it would be appropriate to give a special round of thanks to the organizers for organizing this really, what has been for me, a really wonderful conference. So I'm sure that we would all, you know, prefer to be in the beauty of the mountains. Be in the beauty of the mountains of Banff. But in some sense, the fact that it's online meant that a lot more people could come potentially, and we could share dynamical algebraic combinatorics to a wider audience. I also think this conference was great at just showing how far DIC has come since the five years ago conference at AIM. A lot of really interesting connections. I'm really interested in the connections to the representation theory of associative algebras. That stuff is really interesting to me. But, anyways, let's thank. But anyways, let's thank Jessica and Nathan and Tom and Jim. Okay, well, thank you for the thanks. Do we have any questions for Sam in the copious amount of spare time he's given us? I have a question, I guess. So, one of the things that came out from That came out from, I guess, the type A story is the difference between row motion and then promotion on the root postet was that you could think of promotion as, and this is something that Hugh told me way back in the day, is that you could think of promotion as actually being a toggle in the order of the C sword word for the long elements. And what that suggests is that maybe if you're trying to prove this theorem, if you're trying to find the right definition. If you're trying to find the right definition of row evacuation that works uniformly, what you should be doing is not using row motion, but using the C sorting word and using the obvious segmentation of the C sorting word into strips and then toggling in that order. So I was just wondering, you know, if, well, suggesting that you try this, I guess. Yeah, that's very reasonable. I have not tried to conjure. Tried to conjugate to promotion, so to speak. Although one thing is that the Armstrong Thomas bijection really works with row motion and not promotion. No, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, actually, it does work with. If you pick the C sorting word, then they actually pick the bipartite. I mean, it's sort of crazy, but it is consistent. Sort of, it's sort of crazy, but it is consistent, at least conjecturally, with if you did the if you did promotion, promotion, if you toggled in the C sorting order for any C, this would give you a Armstrong stump Thomas result for any non-crossing sub-C. Like, you've suppressed the Coxtra element from your NC side. There is a version of Armstrong Stump Thomas. Well, I can't prove it, but there is a version. Improve it, but there is a version for NEC where you do the toggling in the order of coming from the C sorting order. And you can even do better. You could get the rotation of the triangulation, but we could talk about that. Okay, not to belabor this too much, but another kind of question I had about what you're saying, Nathan, is maybe people who are more familiar with the Homo Macy stuff will remember. Are more familiar with the homo Macy stuff will remember. But I think this homo Macy of the anti-chain cardinality does not hold for promotion, right? Or maybe it does. I can't remember. But that would be worth looking at too. But yeah, anyways, that's a really good idea to think about conjugating from romotion to promotion. So I also had a different sort of question. One of the things in the Armstrong-Stum-Thomas paper that I Strong's Thomas paper that is, I guess, not in the good column, is that the bijection doesn't respect type. So, you know, there is this version of type where for the anti-exchange, you take the intersection of the fixed hyperplanes of the roots, and that is a flat in the arrangement, and the orbit of that flat is an analog of the cycle type, and that's like the type of the anti-seneg. So, non-nesting and non-crossing partitions are equidistributed. Partitions are equidistributed with respect to type and are counted by Creveras numbers, which are a refinement of the Narayana numbers. Can you phrase your conjecture, also taking into account type or like just the Creveras polynomials? Yeah, that's a very reasonable question, Theo. There's this unfortunate thing where, yeah, the type of a non-crossing partition is like the set of, it's the partition. Set of it's the partition of block sizes. It has nothing to do with like type A versus type B, but yeah, that's just traditional terminology. Well, the thing is that the type of the non-nesting partition does not tell you the cardinal, is not really related to the cardinality of the anti-chain. So I think it should be because you're taking the intersection of the flats. So it's the rank of the task. The rank of the type is the anti-chain. It's just that it's not respected by the bijection of okay, yeah, you're right. So, maybe another way to prove this another way to get an involution for Penushev that would satisfy Penushev's conjecture is to just take one of those type-preserving bijections in the classical types, apply the Krevor's. Types, apply the Krevor S complement, and then transport it back, I guess. But to me, those kind of type-preserving bijections that are constructed in the classical types are a little bit kind of case-by-case in a sense. I think there's a paper of like, I know Jiang Su Kim has one, and maybe Benjamin Iriarti and Alex Fink, or I can't remember. There's several sort of type-preserving bijections, but yeah, they are different than the Armstrong Thomas. Different than the Armstrong Thomas. I guess, yeah, that's a totally different approach, potentially. But, anyways, I guess I like this stuff because it involves the dynamics, which is, yeah. I guess I have a question. In the piecewise linear realm, I'm curious about the relationship between row evacuation. Relationship between Roe evacuation and Quiveras Lalan. Is this something you've looked at in that realm to see if the 80% thing? Well, that was what Mike talked about, I guess. Right, but I guess that in the exceptional types is, I guess, what I'm asking. I'm wondering if the 80% thing persists in that realm as well in some sense. Like on a sub-polytope, there's, you know, they agree, but on outside of that sub-polytope, they don't. Ah, I see. Some poly. Thing measure sense, yeah. Um, my guess is that it's bad even in type like D. So I would guess that only the um so the so-called coincidental types have good piecewise linear and birational behavior, but I didn't look too much at that. Um, the fact that this map is always an involution is still true for any graded postset at all of the levels of birational, piecewise linear, and combinatorial, but it might not have any other interesting. But it might not have any other interesting properties. So I don't know if there's like an analog of the major index in the other types, but maybe there's an analog of those HI statistics. And maybe like it happens that in the classical types, the anti-chain cardinality would be a linear combination of those. And maybe in the exceptional types, it's not a linear combination. I don't know. Yeah, looking for other symmetries, other homomy. Other symmetries, other homomices could be reasonable. Yeah, definitely. So, Sam, one of the things, it seems like in some ways the Armstrong-Stumpen-Thomas bijection isn't satisfactory and that people would like another one for certain purposes, but they seem to have like the way it's phrased, it sort of cuts off the discussion because it says it's unique. So, which properties would you want to relax in order to allow more space for other sections? More space for other actions that might have some of these other properties that we'd like to see? I don't think it's yet. Well, first of all, this is a point that Nathan mentioned, which is that it still depends on the choice of Coxstarter element, because even the definition of the set of non-crossing partitions does. So there's a little bit of choice there. But I would say that maybe the bijection is good. Maybe it's the right bijection. Is good. Maybe it's the right bijection, but there's just there could be a different way of describing it using some geometry of Coxeter theory and so on, which would make it more clear why this works without having to check individually in every type. So it's possible there's not a better bijection, but a better proof, maybe. I see. And the other question I have is: so you've you once you've lifted this, you now have this dihedral action. Action. So, are you able to get any, you know, dihedral cyclic sieving or a dihedral homomessy that's not implied by homomesses for the subgroups or anything? Or did somebody already ask this too, and I just didn't understand it? Okay, well, first of all, Hugh says that maybe he has a comment. Some people were asking about, so in terms of cyclic setting, you can ask about counting fixed points. I think that was mentioned a couple of times. And if you look at the paper, the If you look at the paper, I link to that note. I can post it in the chat again. It has data on all of the fixed point counts, and it has links to Sage worksheets, like CoCalc worksheets that give you the, so you can recreate the data and play around with it yourself. And for some of the types, we can count fixed points, but sometimes actually there's like big primes that appear in the fixed point counts for row evacuation, like in types. For row evacuation, like in types E and F. And those suggest there can't be a cyclic sibbing. Maybe, I don't know. But did Hugh have something he wanted to say? Well, thanks. Yeah, just I mean, just to say that one thing that you can do, or one thing that, you know, I mean, the thing that Nathan was mentioning about how you can, how there are these alternatives to conjectural alternatives to. Conjectural alternatives to what Christian and Dre and I did, but where you replace and you replace row motion by a sequence of toggles, which is given by the C sorting word for W naught. So you're doing a less natural seeming sequence of toggles, but there's a bunch of, but now there's a bunch of choices. But now there's a bunch of choices for them. And so those are examples. And so then, conjecturally, there would be an Armstrong Thomas type result that would relate those to relate that version or that analog of row motion to rotation or Crefographs complement. Anyway, so that just Anyway, so that just just to so that just to answer Tom's question very directly, that's one thing you can do is to say instead of working with row motion, take some other natural toggle sequence. And you could even do Cambrian rotation is the crazy thing. What do you mean? The cyclic action on like triangulations, rather. On like triangulations rather than on non-crossing partitions, and you can mirror that on the other side too. Oh, okay. And that but that that rotation has a different order, right? So that's yeah, it's h plus two instead of two h. That's right. Yeah, okay. Well, I think I'm going to jump in here and say that other questions can be deferred to the meeting in the breakout room. We are 10 minutes behind, so let's stop questions there and let's thank Sam again. Questions there, and let's thank Sam again before our photo session. So, please turn on your camera.
