Okay, so far. So, yeah, thank you to the organizers for organizing this really nice workshop. I've enjoyed most of the talks via the live stream at a more appropriate time here in Berlin. But yeah, it's been really interesting so far. So, yeah, I'm interested in triply periodic tangling. I'm interested in enumerative processes for building symmetric structures. Symmetric structures. And I'm going to tell you a little bit about this today. So, I guess a nice example that links into this from Koya's talk just then is when he gave this example of three particular networks in space and said that it's not clear how those can be tangled with each other. Okay, so there's multiple different ways in which you can put those three different networks in space and have them kind of interpenetrate with each other in a particular way. Each other in a particular way, and that's a question that I'm interested in. And I explore it through different enumerative techniques or computational geometric techniques. So yeah, I'm going to tell you a little bit about symmetric tangling in a two-periodic box or a three-periodic box of filaments, like in this case. So I just have one-dimensional filaments tangled in my box, or I could have networks. So here I have honeycomb. So here I have honeycomb networks tangled in a two-periodic box, or I have, if you see, there's a few vertices in here, a blue vertex there, a purple vertex here. So these are actually two entangled SRS networks, a lot like the SRS networks that you just saw in Koya's talk. Okay, so I'm tangling together different objects, either filaments or networks, but always looking at symmetric ways to tangle those together. So I'm going to show you an enumeration of structure. Going to show you an enumeration of structure using the base element of an n-stranded helical twist. So, something that I've observed over the years in looking at three periodic structures is that the kind of fundamental element of knot theory, the crossing, is very difficult to define when you have a kind of bulk structure, as many of you would know. And so, I want to kind of try to define a new element. Try to define a new element that I can base my enumerative process on. And that's going to be an n-stranded helical twist and piecing those together in space. Yeah, so I'm going to look at how these twists are connected using results from low-dimensional topology and graph theory, among others. So as a bit of a background, so I've been interested before in the enumeration of three-dimensional structures, so three-dimensional periodic structures using Using symmetric two-dimensional hyperbolic tilings and wrapping those over triply periodic minimal surfaces. So, like the diamond minimal surface or the gyroid minimal surface, which we also just saw in Koya's talk a few minutes ago. So, essentially taking these two periodic tilings, which are enumerable, and making three-dimensional structures, which are not so enumerable. Okay, so using this scaffold of a periodic minimum. Scaffold of a periodic minimal surface in order to make three-dimensional structure. And so, here are just a few examples. And I was always approaching this from the symmetry perspective. So, working with the most symmetric hyperbolic structures and seeing what comes out in three-dimensional space. But what I want to describe today is going a little bit more deeply into this process and trying to explore a broader setting of what's possible. So, as a bit of an attachment. Bit of a attachment to the real world or an idea of where these types of things might be found. Here are two examples that grew out of the hyperbolic tiling work. I guess the first one here is this very nice filamentous weaving that's actually the structure of keratin intermediate filaments inside your skin cells. And it has a very nice mechanical feature where it has this kind of expansion property. It can expand without losing contacts between the filaments. Losing contacts between the filaments, and this is what leads to your corneocyte swelling in the bath and your fingers wrinkling. So, it's kind of a nice particular structure that we've come across in this setting, where you can see the filaments wind in a particular way around each other, and that leads to a mechanical property. The second example that I want to show you here is from a block copolymer self-assembly system, like what Koya just talked about. In this case, these are three armed star-block copolymers. Three armed star block copolymers. And I guess to cut a long story short, we get a very nice phase separation, firstly, into a gyroid minimal surface. And then inside the gyroid, we get this kind of nice striping of domains that build up, and it builds up into a very nice particular hyperbolic tiling or highly symmetric hyperbolic tiling. So that's a kind of nice example of where these type of things might come up. But in particular, when we're looking at symmetry, we're thinking Symmetry, we're thinking in the direction of building designing structures in the lab and things like that. Yeah, so let's get on to the tangling part. Okay, so the basic element of my enumeration is going to be just a basic wind of two or more strands. So in this case, we have a wind. This is going in the left-handed direction. So this is a negative wind. We're going to say wind in the other way. And then we can think about how. And then we can think about how these tangle elements can be joined together in space to make a periodic structure. Okay, so you can think a little bit like this. So I have a small wind here, I've drawn in a cylinder here where it sits on, and then I've just joined them together in a particular way. Okay, and so we can think about this object here on a few different levels. So we can think about the geometry of the twists. Okay, so the geometry of these filaments and the path that they follow in space. They follow in space. We can also think about the topology of a surface that might sit inside here. Okay, and so now our filaments would be non-intersecting lines on a two-dimensional surface. We can think about the topology of that surface. And then we can think of the graph structure that goes along the central axis of that surface. So in this case, our surface would be, I guess, a pair of pants here. And then our graph. Then our graph at the middle would be a vertex with three edges coming out. Okay, so our twists kind of sit on the edges of our graph, and then the filaments join around vertices of the graph. And so using all of these elements when we're describing this particular twist in space can allow us to kind of piece together an enumerative scheme of how we look at this structure. So, I guess in the simplest case, which I'm not going to talk about today, we can look at not. About today, we can look at knots and links ranked by genus. Okay, so the very simplest example would just be a torus knot or a torus link, which just has a single helical twist like this, and then we're simply just joining around the ends of those. But if we kind of add a bit of complexity to that, we can then look at genus two knots or genus three knots and start to rank knots and links by a genus. So in this case, these will be non-intersecting curves. These will be non-intersecting curves sitting on the surface of that genus. And we could also look at tangled graphs. Okay, so rather than joining our twists together to form a knot or a link, we can join our twists together to have a vertex so that we form simple graphs. And you can see this nice knotted icosahedral structure here. But I'm not going to talk about those today because I want to focus on periodicity. So I'm going to start with two periodic structures and try to construct two periodic structures. Structures and trying to construct two periodic structures. And I'm going to start with the lowest genus that I possibly can. So, genus is my kind of underlying ordering of complexity. And that's in a two-periodic case, that would be a genus two structure. Okay, and so the network of my switch boxes here or of my twists in space is now a hexagonal net. Okay, so I have three different switches here, three different twists in space joined together. In space, joined together by these elements here, and then you can see that these are just my period, these are my periodic boundary conditions. I have this twist again here, and this one here again here. Okay, and so if I start to look at all of the different ways that I can twist up in each of these boxes, then I can start to step through some through some structures. So, I'm going to represent that by these three indices here. Okay, so each of these is a different switchbox here. Box here, and in this case, I'm doing. I have two strands going into each of them, and I'm twisting zero. So I'm not twisting at all, I'm just going straight through along my cylinder. And so I would get a structure like this. If we then do that under periodic boundary conditions, we can see that that's just a series of loops and space. So we know that our zero and two to the three structure is like this. Okay, but we can now add in twists to each of those. So I'm going to focus on things where all I'm going to focus on things where all of my twists are the same. This is because I'm interested in symmetry, but you can equivalently do this process with differing indices in here. Okay, so if I go to my one-on-two twist, so now I still have two strands going into my twist here. This time they're doing a pi twist around each other, so half two pi. And I get this nice triaxial weave or Kagome weave, and so on and so forth. And so on and so forth. I can just step through indices here. There's a whole bunch of rules that we can draw out of using the underlying graph structure of the way that we've put our twists together in order to tell us what kind of indices we can have. And then we can just simply step through those and enumerate a whole bunch of structures like this. Okay, so this now has four strands going into a box and it's twisting also a pie twist. So two on four is a half. twist. So 2 on 4 is a half, half of 2 pi is pi. Okay, and so we get this. In this case, it's a double helical Kagome. Okay, so along each of the Kagome directions, we then have a double helix winding around each other. And here is a one on six, so we now have six strands, and this will be a pi on three twist. So and here we get a more woven structure here. Okay, so they're my kind of simplest. Okay, so they're my kind of simplest filamentous structures for genus 2 to periodic. But I can also put in networks instead of filaments. And so how am I going to do this? I'm actually going to do this using a double cover. Okay, so I'm going to take a double cover. So it will be a filamentous structure. And then I kind of insert a network in there. Why do I use the double cover? Because I get both of these structures coming out of the same. Structures coming out of the same scheme, okay, where I have vertices here, and then on my second one here, I could have no vertex, essentially. And these both, if I think of, if I think about everything in the double cover, these fall out nicely out of the same scheme. Essentially, you just have a kind of an odd twist rather than an even twist, you could say. And then we can start to look at some of these structures in exactly the same way. You just turn the crank and they come out. So this is my one-on-one. So here I'm writing a symbol of the double cover. Okay, so. Symbol of the double cover. Okay, so double cover has four strands. This just has two strands then, so two actual strands. And we get the nice Boromeian entanglement of three honeycomb nets. And we can just continue on with this. So this is my two on four structure, gives me two honeycomb nets in a nice interwoven pattern. If I then go to one on six, so this is the double cover, so this has three strands going in, I get this nice four-fold pattern, so four honeycomb nets. So, four honeycomb nets, and I can continue on from there to get more and more and more nets. So, in this case, my two on six will have seven nets. Here's a 13 net structure of two on 10. And a little further, we get a 16 nets as the three on 12. We can just systematically step through all of these, and we get very nice entanglements. So, we can look a little bit at what kind of at how many networks can we get. At how many networks can we get? And we can do a nice calculation using the Goldberg coordinates of our kind of basic structure or our underlying network of twists. And we can read off that we can get all of these, we can get structures with each of these number of components of honeycomb nets. So one, three, four, seven, twelve, thirteen, etc. We can also get double those. Okay, so I guess maybe I don't go back and do it, but essentially. I don't go back and do it, but essentially, you get pairs of vertices kind of up and down, sitting on top of each other for the doubled structures here. But what I really want to get to is three periodic structures, because that's what I'm particularly interested in. And so, what are we looking at here? So, we have our graph structure, then we have our surface structure, and then we're looking at patterns on that surface. So, we can design our tangles. So, we can design our tangles using three periodic graphs. And in this case, we're going to have six different switches, so six different twists to fill when we're looking at genus three structures, which is our minimal genus for a three-periodic structure. So let's start with our genus three regular graphs. That's our kind of starting point. And here we have the SRS network that Poya very kindly introduced in the previous talk. We have a diamond network. We have a diamond network and we have our primitive cubic network. So, a simple cubic network here. Okay, so these are three of the genus three regular graphs. So, this is kind of our starting point. We're putting twists onto the edges of each of these graphs. If we think of it from the perspective of the surfaces, so the surfaces on which these twists sit, what we actually have are the genus 3 trip periodic minimal surfaces. Okay, so we have the gyrode surface. Okay, so we have the gyrode surface here, the diamond surface here, and the primitive cubic minimal surface here. Okay, so if we essentially, if we take our networks from the previous slide and inflate those edges to be a kind of tubefied network, if we minimize that surface area, we'll then get the minimal surfaces. Okay, and so we're putting twists onto each of the edge of those networks, and then those lines, the lines. Those lines, the lines of our twists, or the filaments of our twists will sit on these minimal surfaces here. And so, what do we get? Okay, so we have a whole bunch of twists in space. We have six different ones because we're working in genus three. And we can do a whole bunch of symmetries of our object in space, and we can pull out a whole bunch of equivalences for all of our different indices. For all of our different indices. And kind of using the underlying graph theory and the topology of the surface, we can simplify our enumeration significantly. And what do we get is the question. So what are these three-dimensional weavings in space? And I guess the simplest way that we can think about them is to think about each filament is periodic in its Filament is periodic in itself. And so, what is its invariant axis? So, along what axis does it have a translation in space that maps it from itself back to itself again? And then, if you think about the combination of all of the filaments in my box, how do these axes all align with each other? Okay, and so depending on how I twist up, so this is with two tracks, so two tracks going into each of my twists, and this is on the SRS switch network or the twist network. Network, depending on how I twist around each box, I get four different cases. Okay, and so you can imagine if I do a zero twist, that's kind of the same as doing a two pi twist. And so the entanglement's different, but the axis of my filament doesn't change. Okay, so I can either get parallel filaments, or I can get two directions of filaments, or I can get a packing like this, a rod packing like this with three directions, or I get four directions like this. Directions like this. Okay, so this is essentially along the 111 diagonals of the cube. Okay, so depending on how I do my twists, I get each of these four settings, but they can be far more woven than that as well. So I'm going to show you some examples. So our twists get a bit more complicated because the SRS network is kind of twisted in itself. And so I'm not going to go into that today, but if you want to talk about that, please get in contact. So essentially, I can only do a zero twist one. Essentially, I can only do a zero twist when I have 10 strands. Okay, otherwise, my strands don't meet up with each other. So, there always has to be a twist in there. So, I get these weird fractional twists. But essentially, so I'm doing the same twist on every switch in this case, because I want to look at symmetric structures to start with. But you could do different twists on all of these indices here. And then I can just build it out. Okay, so here is my minus 0.4 on 2 to the C. 0.4 on 2 to the 6 structure, and I get this nice rod packing, just known as the beta-manganese rod packing, or pi plus from structural chemistry. I could do a 0.6 on 2. So you can see that this is now a pi twist from the previous one. I went from minus 0.4 now up to 0.6. And now I get a sigma plus rub packing here. So you can see here that these are, you know, all I'm doing is just changing how much I'm twisting each of. Changing how much I'm twisting each of these little segments by here. And we can weave these up a little bit further. So now we have the beta-manganese rod packing again from the first example, but now we're doing a full two-pie twist from the previous one. So instead of my filaments going straight, I'm now kind of weaving around all of its neighbors. And I get this nice symmetric pattern in space. And yeah, similarly, we can weave. Yeah, similarly, we can weave up the Sigma plus packing from before as well. But now I can also do put networks onto these instead. So instead of connecting up my twists just using line segments, I can kind of connect them up with vertices. And in this case, I'm going to do the double cover again because that gives me a nice way to work with the networks. And so here I have four strands in my double cover, which means that I just have two strands. My double cover, which means that I just have two strands of my actual networks, and what I get is two SRS networks. Okay, so here this is just like in Koya's talk. We have two same-handed SRS networks that are woven with each other in a particular way. If I do another one, sorry, one of my kids is just trying to break into the room and I've locked the door. So if I just do a different twist here with the same Just do a different twist here with the same number of strands. I get another entanglement of two SRS networks, and I can do the process again. And I can weave up these two SRS networks in whatever way I like, which is really nice. And here we go again. That's to another twist. Okay, so essentially for this four-stranded double cover, which with just two strands here, I always get two SRS networks and I can just Get two SRS networks, and I can just, depending on how I want to do each of these indices, I'll weave them up into different ways. And then here's just a more slightly more complicated one to get you thinking. So this is four strands, so a four-stranded twist, which has eight strands in the double cover. So this is also two SRS networks, but in this case, each of the SRS networks is self-entangled. Okay, so it now has not. Okay, so it now has knotted cycles within the individual network, and this is a really super interesting problem to study as to the characterization of a self-entangled network and how to really quantify that and decide when two things are the same, have the same entanglement or not. Yeah, so that brings me to the end of my set of examples for today. I guess I've just shown you a few of the most symmetric structures. A few of the most symmetric structures, and because I think that they're probably the most interesting to start with if you're looking at synthesis in a chemistry lab or something like that. They're interesting because we're really just assembling like-handed helices. So, all of our structures where we have the same twist on each of the strands with the same orientation, so left-handed or right-handed, it's really just an assembly of like-handed helices in space that makes it very attractive. Space that makes it very attractive for some kind of chemical self-assembly process like tangled molecules or metal-organic frameworks or something like this. Yeah, I've shown the most symmetric structures, but the enumerative technique works equally as well for less symmetric structures. You just have to the symmetry of the indices is exactly the symmetry of the structure. So you can always just change the indices to be different from each other to lower the symmetry. Symmetry. So, going slightly more deeper, one might conjecture that a numerative technique like this is a good way to characterize periodic woven structures in general. And that's something that I'm looking into a little bit more deeply. Okay, so what can we actually, we have a technique, and we have each structure now has a set of indices that can describe it. And so, how can we use this to characterize? So, how can we use this to characterize structures? And I guess the question then comes up: invariants, other invariants, can we use this as an invariant? What kind of duplication do we have when we have multiple different indices leading to the same three-dimensional structure? And then also the question of can we create some kind of crossing diagram for a three-thirds structure? And these are all questions that I'm interested in coming out of this enumeration here. And I should also mention that all of the Also, mention that all of these configurations that I've shown I've made using an extension of the Sono algorithm for finding type knots, but extended to periodic boundary conditions. So even just creating a structure and moving it around in space and looking at its configuration is a tricky thing to do. But the Sono algorithm works really nicely for kind of smoothing it out and moving it around in space and finding some nice configurations for these structures. So I'm interested in the kind of computational geometry. Kind of computational geometry problems of configurations in space of periodic structures. Yeah, so I guess I'll finish off by thanking my collaborator, who's Stephen Hyde at the University of Sydney. We've been working on this project, so building up from knots, finite knots and links to tangled graphs and then to periodic structures for a while now. And actually, all of this stuff is about to come out in a book, hopefully next year, called The Structure of Tangling. Called the structure of tangling and this kind of enumerative technique and this building process of using the base idea of a tangle and piecing it together in space as a way of looking at entanglement. So thank you very much. Thank you. That was really fascinating. If people have questions, please use the raise your hand or just unmute and ask. Just on mute and ask your question. Yes, Sabeta? Great talk, Mif. I guess I was curious that the word tangle makes me think of like rational tangles, like the things that the DNA people use. And it looks like you've got a really nice setup for like you've got these little boxes where you've got, you know, oh, you've got. Oh, you got like a certain number of threads coming in. Have you thought about looking at different rational tangles here? I mean, everything was like same-handed twists, but have you thought about doing other types of recombinations? So yes, we have. And Stephen's looked at this a lot more deeply than I have. So yes, essentially building up the idea of Conway tangles and a few other things and matching up our terminology with what's there. And it seems that. What's there, and it seems that everything works out really nicely so far. But what I think we have here is a broad, like a broader set of structures, but a less, I guess, well-defined or less unique. I guess we're pulling out a far broader set of structures where Conway tangles and a few other sets of structures are then a subset of owls. But there's a bit of But there's a bit more duplication in what we're doing. And so, really teasing out exactly how this all fits together is still a work in process, I guess, at the moment. Any other questions? There is plenty of time for questions. Yes, so first of all, very beautiful talk. So, actually, I do the simulations of all these ABC block copolymers and all, and I get this. Block the polymers and all, and I get these networks. But the graphics which you were showing, which were much more prettier than what I get from the simulations. So, what I'm wondering is what are you using? So, just a naive question. So, what are you using for visualizing or creating all these graphs? Yeah, so I guess I work in Houdini most of the time. But I guess the story of the block copolymers is an interesting one. So, the block copolymer self-assembly. So, the block hypolymer self-assembly simulations are done by our colleague Jakob Kirkensgaard. I don't know, maybe you know him. Yeah, he's a collaborator, so I have papers with him. Oh, yeah, okay, super far, super far. And I guess it was a very nice story where, so I was working on hyperbolic tilings on the gyroid minimal surface, and all of a sudden he self-assembled something that I'd been working on for quite a few years. So, it was a very fortuitous intersection of Section of computational geometry and block copolymer self-assembly. And so, yeah, I understand that this type of analysis isn't usual in the block copolymer self-assembly community. But yeah, I find it a wonderful structure and I find it absolutely fantastic that something like that self-assembled. And actually, I should say that structure comes out of this enumeration as well, that particular structure that we found. Well, so that particular structure that we found. And what I've been looking at recently is: okay, so we have a tangled structure on a topological object, but that tangled structure also sits on the complementary space to that topological object. And it is still the same structure. And so what is its twist on the complementary space? I guess the simplest way of thinking about this is on the torus. You have, say, a 2,3-taurus knot will be a 3-2 torus knot on the complementary. Be a 3-2 torus knot on the complementary space. And so on the minimal surfaces, you can do this and you can flip between the channels of the minimal surfaces, and you get two different codes for the same structure. And there's a couple of very particular structures that fall out, which have the same code on both channels of the minimal surface. And actually, the one structure that does that on the gyroid is the one that formed in the block copolymer system, which is quite spectacular. System, which is quite spectacular and indicates some kind of level of balance or something. There's something cool going on with that structure, which is really nice. I see. So do you have a software for generating some of these configurations? Yes, but I guess it's a multi-step process of building and relaxing in 3D space. But yeah, if you're interested, definitely get in contact. We could definitely talk. could we could definitely talk.
