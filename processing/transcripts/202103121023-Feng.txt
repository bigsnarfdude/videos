Uh it works okay okay so hello everyone uh good morning and uh of course afternoon maybe so thanks all the organizers for having this nice workshop so it really my pleasure to present here so I'm gonna talk about hypoelliptic entropy dissipation Talk about hypoelliptic entropy dissipation for Stokesk differential equations, and you will see what I mean exactly just in a moment. And this is a joint work with my collaborator Wu Chen Li. So this is the model that I'm going to look at today. This is over variable under damped electron dynamics. So I'm lucky to present this after the first talk today and also after David's talk. So you know, there's a lot of motivations I don't need to mention so many, so much about. Need to mention so many so much about why this dynamics is important, right? But today I'm going to present a more generalized version in the sense that I'm going to consider where the diffusion matrix is not a constant, but is a variable, where this temperature T depends on the position x, and then you have V as the velocity. So, in general speaking, this is a degenerate SDE with a non-gradient drift. This is a V with a non-gradient drift with a degenerate rectangular matrix. With a degenerate rectangular matrix. Okay, so the environmental measure for this one will be in terms of the Hamiltonian here. The reason we want to consider this one is because the marginal density for the position will be exponential nanq. So this is the same inverse distribution that we will consider for either the over-damped lagron dynamics or the constant temperature case. The good thing for this one is a hope that we are going to get a faster convergence rate to the invergent distribution. Rate to the invergent distribution. Okay, so once you change the parameter, there is a hope that maybe you can get a better conversion rate for this dynamic. So this dynamics really draws a lot of attention in the literature. So here at least some of them, of course, I didn't list all of them. There are so many of them. But if T is constant, where is the product of the friction parameter and the temperature, then there will be lots of work to do the nice. Work to do the nice symptomatic analysis and also the pancreas called the pancreas framework that you'll see from yesterday. So, the blue references here are the theoretical analysis for the convergence, like either in the NGO case or for the semi-group case. The other colors are the algorithms that are recently developed in machine learning, like AIs. So, this is like people really care about the convergence analysis, about these dynamics. So, though, the question is, what about this? So, the question is: what about this variable diffusion coefficient in the case? So, what can we do? This is my goal today. Okay. So, I'm going to talk about the general framework and how we can deal with a large class, including this as a special example. So, the general idea that let me first recall what we can do in the remaining case, or say when the diffusion matrix is non-degenerate, and you have, for example, gradient drift. In this case, we define the KL divergence. Here, I denote as the relative. Here I denote as the relative KL divergence with integration rho logaro over pi. The fission information is in terms of deletion form, where here you have the gradient inner product of the logarithm over p. So the log sub inequality will be just in the form of KL divergence bounded above by one or two kappa the fission information. So I think we have seen this format formation of the log sublime equality from Monday's talk, from my advisor for Chris' talk. Or from my advisor for Bris talk, right? So then the KL logs of log inequality will give us exponential decay of the KL divergence, then we will have the W2 distance convergence and so on. And this kappa is the lower bound of the Richie convergent tensor. How do we do this? And you have seen from the previous talk, we have this gamma calculus, right? So we know for the Laplacian operator, the gamma will be just gamma one will just be the inner product of the great. Inner product of the gradient, and then this will produce this deletory form in formula 1.3. And then we have the gamma 2 operator. This is a second-order operator. Then the curvature dimension condition just tells us if you have a lower bound kappa, which is gamma 2 bigger than kappa, gamma, then if kappa is positive, we have the log sublock inequality. Okay, so this is the standard in the framework in the remaining setting. So how does entropy decay in this case? I give you a brief outline here. So if we have creating the So, if we have a gradient drift for the SDEs, and we have non-degenerate operators, for example, the Laplacian, and then we have a classical logos of love inequality, then you simply directly follow the flow of this rho T, right? This is the Foucault-Blanc equation corresponding to that gradient drift, SDE. You have the derivative of the KL divergence is negative of the fission information. If you take the derivative of the fission information, you'll get a negative two times the gamma two here. If you look at The gamma two here. If you look at the semi-group version from Monday, you'll see something similar happened here. Now, if we have this lower bound which kappa is positive, then this combining with this equality here, we get this bound for the inequality. Then this ground one inequality has the exponential decay for the efficient information. From the lower bound of the kappa, we also have the log sublock inequality. And this one, combining with the first equality, we have the exponential decay. With the first equality, we have the exponential decay of the k of divergence. Okay, so this is a if you just sit down and you do the computation in one hour, and everything will be explicit and you just follow theoretical computation. But the problem is here, you need a gradient shift, which means you somehow need a gradient flow, and you need a non-degenerate operator and the classical logical of inequality. The problem is what if none of this happens? Can we expect? Because in the underlying round dynamical case, the B is a non-gradient term and the B is another gradient term, and the operator is not the direct, it's a derivative operator. You only see the position in the velocity direction, and then you will not expect the standard log sub-lof inequality. So, here is the general framework that I'm going to consider. Let's consider this eto-type SDE, where B is a non-gradient drift, and you have this degenerate matrix A, the diffusion matrix, which is a rectangular matrix. So, you can directly So, you can directly write down the corresponding Foucault-Polan equation, right? The problem is this B here is not a gradient drift. So, the standard techniques that if you want to get a logo of equality will not work. So, the idea for us here is to do a decomposition of this Foucault-Blanc equation. And our assumption is we need to know the explicit analytical formula for the environmental distribution pi associated for this SBE. Of course, we know this. For this SDE. Of course, we know this for the underdog Lagron dynamics. Once we did this one, this equation, Foucault Blanc equation, can be translated to this equation I wrote here. The red term corresponding to the gradient part and the blue part corresponding to the non-gradient part, which we call the non-reversible or irreversible part. Because if gamma is zero, then this SDE will lead to a greater. This SDE will lead to a greater energy of SDE. This is a reversible SDE. Otherwise, gamma is not the zero is irreversible. So then we are going to focus on this Fokker-Blank equation in this format. Of course, they are equivalent, right? By straightforward computation, you will realize they are equivalent. So now I talk about more generally in terms of the operators. I denote L as the generator of the ETO SD I described before. And then I decompose in two parts. And then I decompose in two parts, the L tilde and the gamma gradient F. So L tilde is the gradient part, which is corresponding, I say, is the reversible component. And then the gamma gradient F is the non-irreversible part, right? So now we need really to deal with this L, but in terms of we deal with L tilde and the gamma, then we can separate them individually, and then we can look at the final properties for each of the terms. Similarly, for the L tilde, we have. Similarly, for the L tilde, we have L tilde Z. Because, as I mentioned, this divergence AA transverse gradient F, this is the horizontal Laplacian, and this is the degenerate operator. In order to control the vertical part, we need to select a complementary size, which is the vertical vector field direction Z. And then we just for the notation convenience, I use this altitude at Z. Okay. You will see what I mean. I use it later on. We know that gamma one operator do not see the first orders, so does. not see the first orders so does not matter l or l tilde gamma one gamma one z will always just be the inner product of the horizontal gradient by defined by a and the vertical gradient defined by z okay so here is how we do the angle b decay with the vertical controls so as you've seen before the feature information is a derelict form where is the gradient of the log rho over p pi in that case you indeed have identity matrix involved but we just didn't Matrix involved, but we just didn't see it. Now, since we are in this designer setting, we need to introduce this AA transpose and CZ transverse. Indeed, these are motivated from defining a metric on the Washington metric on the subdividing density manifold. But I skipped those parts. I just simply tell you that we have this feature information, and you can easily find an analog of this one in the PT semi-group setting in the paper by Badon Graf. Okay. But on the graph. Okay. So if we directly follow the idea I show you before, we just make it take a first derivative of the fission information. Surprisingly, you will see that these three terms. Okay. The first two terms, the gamma two and gamma two z corresponding to okay, the generalized coefficient dimension inequality. But you still have this right one and right twos. Okay. So if one is zero and two is zero, then we are done. This has been solved. But if one is not zero and two is not zero, then In particular, we need to deal with non-gradient terms because if two is a zero, this means this is dealing with a gradient flow. And this one is zero means that the Lie algebra corresponding to the SDE or the manifold structure should have a step two condition. So if we do not require this to be zero, then we will like go over beyond the step two condition. Okay. So in this talk, I do not require one and two to be zero. Okay, so one and two. To be zero, okay. So, one and two can both exist in my in my work. So, here are how we deal with this problem. We introduce this called information gamma operators. And in this way, we are able to define a new Bogan's formula to deal with both these two terms, those are now zero. So, the gamma two operator is still the same operator that we have seen before, but it's just defined for this gradient reversible component, L tilde. Gradient reversible component L tilde. The generalized gamma z operator, the first component here is still similar to the work, the same as the work from in the line graph law, but the second term, this one, the divergent operator, is to deal with these three linear forms. If this is not zero, we show that in the weak sense, this is equivalent to these divergence operators, and then this can be bounded in terms of a tensor-reached curvature tensor. The irreversible. Curvature tensor. The irreversible gamma operator corresponding to the small gamma. So if we have gradient flows, gamma is zero, this term will vanish. Otherwise, this gamma will exist if we have non-gradient vector field. So once we have this gamma operator, what do we have? Is the following. We have this algebraic condition, or you can think of a geometric condition that if this vertical gradient acting on this A transpose is belongs. A transpose is belongs to the range of these horizontal distributions, then we have this information Bochenov's formula. That means, in the weak sense, this gamma, information gamma, is equivalent equals to Chi Chin squared plus the Ricci curvature tensors. And the Ricci can be decomposed in terms of the standard Ricci curvature tensor and the information part where it comes from the vertical control and the irreversible non-gradient part. Okay, so this. In the part. Okay. So this reach equivalent, the reach equivalent pencil can be defined explicitly in this framework. So for example, in this recent paper in 2021, one month ago, I posted this preprint. So this courier tensor, so indeed we want to find a lower bound of the Ricci curvature tensor. So in this framework, this lower bound of Ricci current tensor is equivalent to find the smallest eigenvalue of this matrix of. The smallest eigenvalue of this matrix R, and this R can be written down explicitly. Whenever you give me an SDE, I can produce this matrix. And this is the corresponding to the rich code tensor. And this sub-index corresponding to each of the components in SDE, the degenerative diffusion matrix, the vertical control, the inverter distribution, and also the information and the irreversible path. So now you'll see as long as we found out the smallest eigenvalue is positive, we will have. Eigenvalue is a positive, we will have entropy dissipation and lots of inequalities in this framework. Okay, so basically, we are going to have some correlated results. The first one is the KR divergence decay. So, left-hand side is the KR divergence, and right-hand side will be the generalized efficient information. And we have the exponential decay, exponential negative 2 lambda t. We also similarly will have similar results in the remaining setting of how this L1 decays for the density. Decays for the density instead of in the semi-group case, you have L2 or H1 now. And this PT is really the density function of the hyperelliptic diffusion. So this is a hypoellique density somehow, if you call it in this name, right? So this is the corollary is like following the previous curvature lower bound. So in the end, what we need is just the lower bound of this lambda. So here are the comparisons in the literature. are the comparisons in the literature the works in the literature so if it's reversible which gamma is zero and it's non-degenerate m is zero this is the biker emergency calculus the gamma bioameric operator if gamma is zero m is not zero which means we are in a degenerate setting and they assume this is zero then this is the work from a phdvisor fabrication and nickel graph law if this is non-reversible and degenerate and this is not zero this is our first paper in 2000 This is our first paper in 2019. We deal with these terms. And then, if we beta is zero, M is zero, which is a non-designed case. So, there are some earlier works by Arnold, Eric Carlin, and G. They have this geometric formulation of focal-production equation and the corresponding tensors. And then, if A, Z are constant, right? But today I'm talking about over variable diffusions. If they are constant and beta is zero, this is the work by in the density entropy decay science by R. density entropy decay science by Arnold Erb and recently yesterday you see in the semi-group science by Faberez Marshall and David if beta is one m is zero which means we consider non-reversible non-degenerate SDEs and this is our third work from last year so today I present the case where we consider non-reversible and degenerate SDEs okay here is the picture you see that if we Picture, you see that if we pick this t as a constant, then you will see that you have this smallest eigenvalue to be positive globally in space. So in this way, you'll see for constant T, you are going to have a global in-time convergence for this SD convergence to the invariant measure. Once you change a little bit of the parameters, you are going to see an improvement of the smallest eigenvalue in your local regime. That means the convergence rate is improved, even in this. Is improved even in this constant temperature case. Okay, so this is the constant temperature case. If we consider to the variable temperature case where T is this guy, which depends on the position, you'll see that, of course, we have the freedom to choose your Z and your parameters. Once this is done, you'll see there exists the smallest eigenvalue in the domain. So, if you consider, for example, of course, this is only for this potential, right? For this potential, Potential, right? For this potential, you can see that in this local domain, you have this zero flux boundary condition. Then this will have the conversion rate globally in time for the environmental distribution. But for different potential, you may hope you will also have a global use-based result. But just right now, we have not found the example yet. We're still looking for these examples. Okay. So here are the references that we have the series of work to discuss this all type of reversible, non-reversible designer. Reversible designaries and not the rendering SDs. And thanks for your attention. Thank you, Chi. It was an excellent talk. Are there any questions? Yes, I have one. So for your entropy decay estimates, can you go back to that slides? Which one? Uh-huh.
