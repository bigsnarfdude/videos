Always still caused me some trouble about the schedule. And anyway, today I would like to introduce some work about the Hodge theory for social choice and game theory. This contains a series of old research and recent research in the past decade. And so basically, it's a survey. And if you have any questions, please. Any questions, please feel free to interrupt me and we can chat more about that. Okay, so today I would like to cover these two topic. Mostly we focus on the social choice. Basically, many people of different nature would like to look for or learn a single utility function. So we call that a social choice. And the And the second part, if I have time, our little bit extension from single utility learning to multiple utilitarian scenarios like game theory. So that's the main topic for today. So basically, for social trial theory, many of you heard about that. This is a very famous economic topic. Economic topic in political science and economic science. And this kind of theory basically starts from the 1770 in the French Academy of Science. Border actually first proposed the famous Border count. I will explain later what that really means. This kind of algorithm Algorithm try to use that algorithm for the election of a French Academy of member of science. But this rule, although after practicing a decade, another scholar and the condoset actually questioned this rule. He actually pose a condosite winner such. Winner such that the one who wins all pairwise elections must be the final winner. However, bad account cannot follow this condulate rule, say, not necessary to guarantee the condosite winner will be the final winner. So from that moment, it immediately shaped the whole field of the election, seeing that there is some paradox situation. Some paradox situation. People may not select the one who really wins, who really the desired person in the election process. So this is kind of a conflict situation, impose a long history of study, especially economics. There are two Nobel laureates. One is Kenneth Arro in 1963. In 1963, he posed a general form of impossibility theory. And a few 10 years later, Amatia-sen, another Nobel laureate in economics, so he actually gives a more general version of impossibility theorem. So these two persons for this kind of work win the Nobel Prize in Economic Science. And there are also lots of There are also a lot of people from statistics, mathematics, like Kemini from statistics and optimization. And Dong Sari, he is a mathematician who study the human dynamics of spatial science, but later becomes pretty famous in social choice theory. So they all try to solve the intrinsic. They all try to solve the intrinsic conflicts. See that clearly. So, we will introduce some of them to help you understand what's the intrinsic conflict within the voting theory or social choice theory. But nowadays, because recent years, internet provides us lots of new examples with data like recommendation system from Movie Lens, Netflix, and our peer review system. And a peer review system like Google's PageRank and CrowdSouth Ranking. So there are a lot of platforms on there. So all these new examples comes with kind of aggregation of preference from distributed users. So that actually opens some new questions for social choice. So this is the short history. I would try to give you To give you a mathematical point of view on how the situation happened and how the Hodge theory can be embedded in such a historical flow and to see what will happen. So, first about the classical social choice. This is the very simple mathematical problem formulated in this way. So, basically, there are M voters whose preference. Voters whose preferences are just a total order permutation on a candidate set. Say we have an atom in the candidate set. So basically, it's a permutation on SN. Then you pick up a function mapping M different permutation to a single output, which is another permutation in the SN. In the SN. So, this is the kind of social choice map. So, of course, we are looking for some properties that F must satisfy. And we call that the social choice map subject to this kind of property. The question is whether such kind of mapping and what kind of conditions such mapping exists. So, that's the basic question from a mathematical point of view. Mathematical point of view. And one example is: assume nowadays some department, math department, say in UBC, receive three candidates to apply a faculty position, say ABC. And basically, you can have this kind of preference order from different person or the members in the department for both. In the department, vote, which one is better than another. So, for three candidates, basically, we have six possibilities for the total order, and we list all of them. And the right column denotes how many faculty members vote for this particular order. So, we get this particular, say, two faculty members votes for A better than B, B better than C, but three votes. Than C, other three will be better than A, better than C, and so on. So I've assumed we have this kind of data, then the final question is: can you come out with a single order out of this voting profile represent the will, say, best representation of the will of the whole faculty in the maths department? So what we have done in practice. Have done in practice coming from the border in 1770 is a kind of two types of rules, two categories of rules of social mapping. The first type of rules is invented by Boda. We call that the position rules. So basically, we assign a score S from the candidate set as a real numbered scores. Numbered scores such that for each voter's order, so for each permutation, the M permutation, the score represent the leading order. You say if you place sigma ik greater, larger than or preferred than sigma ik plus one, then the score should be higher. It's not necessary to say. Say linear depth score on integral score, but just preserve the order, that's fine. We call that good score, admissible score for the permutation. And the final social order, just take the sum of all the score over the letters, then we count the total final score for each of the kinds. Score for each of the candidate, then use that to order all the faculty as the aggregate preference. So this is called a social order. So in particular, if you take an equal gap score, say integral gap, the highest candidate receives, say, a minus one, their end candidate, then receive a minus one, the second highest, a minus one. One, the second highest, a minus two, and the last one we see a zero. So, this kind of equal gap score will be called border count. So, not necessarily with integer, but you can use integer for convenience. And also, we can use generalize this a little bit. We can take top K voting. See, we pick our top K candidate and then put score one. And then put score one, all the others will be zero. This is kind of also permissible score and vote for top pay. So that data you can set as partial order extension for border count. So these are called position rules invented by border. But another type of rules are called pairwise rules. This is essentially proposed by the condoset after 10 years of border. 10 years of border. And so PyWise rule actually converts the voting profile. Basically, it's a distribution, empirical distribution function on n factorial set of pognutation group for an uncandidate. So we convert this distribution into a pairwise comparison matrix and basically n square element. So we pick up each of xi. pick up each of xij in the matrix just represent the number of voters prefer i over j and so on so this is a kind of impression of the data from n factorial number of real number into a square number of marginal distribution. So this is kind of pairwise through data. So any pairwise Data. So any pairwise rule must try to find a social order from this kind of marginal distribution. And in particular, the Kamini optimization statistician proposed, and this actually tried to minimize the number of pairwise mismatch to IX. So this given the marginal distribution or pairwise comparison. Then we look for a single order. A single order, you know, say a single permutation such that the number of parallelized mismatch is minimized. So, this is uh having optimization. It's combinatorial optimization problem and shown to be NP-hard in the for more than three candidates in the general case. And particularly, another condorcet rule called you know, we nowaday called plurality means uh means condosit winner means the number of wins in pairwise comparison that can be used to vote or rank the orders as the social order for all the all these candidates so that's the condorcet rule somehow and this condorcet rule actually equivalent to border count if you have complete a round-robin tournament if every Robin tournament: if every two candidates has a comparison in the data. So that's these two actually coincide. But in general, these two rules not necessarily meet one to another. That's the scenario. And if you are interested with the three exam ABC example, we can actually convert, follow this kind of rule, we can convert that into the suitable data. Into the suitable data. So, on the right, actually, we use a triangle. So, this triangle actually is invented by Don Sari. So, you can put ABC, this candidate, into a triangle as the vertex of a triangle. Then you can divide, you can summarize all the data using this kind of small sub-triangles within that. So, for all the So, for all the sub-triangles such that the distance A to A, shorter than distance to B, and shorter than distance to A, you see, that's the first top left subtriangle. And there are two votes that we then put two here. And similarly, on the right of this sub-triangle, there are two persons representing a shorter. A shorter preferred than C, then preferred by B. So that's the last row in the left table. Then we can get another two here. So similarly, we can put all the voting profile, the six voting distribution numbers into this subtriangle. There are six of them representing simply the preference order. Preference order. And then we can summarize them into either the position rule or use the pairwise comparison rule. So for position rule, we can simply define the highest one received score one, the second highest receive a score S between zero and one, and the last candidate receives score zero. Then we can add them together. For a, how many prefer A to be the How many prefer A to be the best? There are four of them. Then you can use a full as the receive score one. And how many prefer A as the second best? Then we can count as five of them in the middle. So in this case, five receive a score S and all the remaining will be four receive zero. So the total score in terms of position rule, A received is four plus five. A received is 4 plus 5s. And similarly, you can count the position for B and C. You can get 4 plus 5s for B and C 5 plus 3s. So that's the total score received for position rules. S can be any number between 1 and 0. If S is chosen to be 1/2, that's the border count. Okay, so another one is a So, another one is a pairwise comparison. So, basically, from position rule, you can see C must be the final winner. But if you look at pairwise comparison, given A and B, for example, how many prefer A versus over B? There are six people prefer 222 on the votes closer to A than B. Another one is 3137. three one three seven votes prefer b over a so for powerwise rule you can put a number here a versus b will be six over seven and similarly b versus c will be six versus seven and for a versus c there is an equal number tie here seven versus seven so from from this marginal powerwise Marginal power as comparison, you can also count who is the final winner to select which one received the highest number of power s comparison. So basically, you can see A and C both received the highest number in power s comparisons. So this is actually give you the example for voting chaos. We somehow can see the conflict of interest. Can see the conflict of interest. So everything actually can happen. So for position rule, if S is less than one half, Z will be the final winner, as we said before. However, if S equals to one half, that's the border count, everyone can be the final winner because they are in pi's, no distinction. But if S is larger than half, then AB. Then AB to be the final winner. And for pairwise comparison, actually, you can count how many times AB wins. Actually, AB both wins a 13 time in the power s comparison, but C wins 14 times in power as comparison. Then we can see for power as comparison, the condocent winner should be C. So you can see the So you can see the scenario can be depends on what is the difference, how we choose. Everyone could be the final when there's no universal agreement over the different voters. So that's the kind of voting chaos caused by Dansari. And then how to solve this problem? Solve this problem. Actually, the generic scenario is much very sad story coming from Per Arrows in possibility theory in 1963. So basically, this theorem says if the input domain is not restricted, means you are looking for a mapping from the whole space of M. M permutations from other permutation group. So it means M product space of the permutation group. So if you do not have any restriction on the input domain and there's no map satisfying the three conditions, the first condition called arrival means that if all voters agree that A If all voters agree that A greater than B, then such an odd preference should appear in the final output map or output permutation order. And this is called basically condosit rule idea. And the second is called independence of irrelevant alternative. We simply say that's IA saying the social order of any pair only. Order of any pair only depends on voters' relative ranking of that pair. So, this is also a pairwise rules. And the dictator rules means there's no rule in the output which exactly agree with the certain input, say the output social permutation that's not equal to any of the input permutation. Permutation. So, if you want to satisfy these three rules, then there's no social choice map for all the input satisfying these three conditions simultaneously. So in other words, somehow economics interpret this. There's no dictator rule satisfying these two kinds of optimality in terms of power. So, in terms of power comparison, we want parietal optimality and the IAA. So, except for the dictator rule. Dictator rule means the supermodel. Yes? Maybe I got it wrong because what's stated on the slide I thought was not matching what you now said somehow. So I think. So I think it so there it says the only social choice satisfying the following condition is the dictator rule. There are two conditions, right? And now you said there are three conditions. The dictator will be another condition somehow. Maybe I don't know. Yeah, this is these two actually the same meaning. On the slide says the only social tri-through satisfying these two conditions. Two conditions will be the dictator rule. And oh, sorry, the three conditions means if we want a social choice rule, which is not a dictator rule, means no single person can represent the will of everyone becoming the social choice output. For example, there's no Hitler which represent all the person as the social choice rule. As the social choice rule. If no such dictator, then also Parato and IA, then there's no such social choice rule. Am I clear? Okay, thank you. Yeah, thanks for your question. Okay, so this is the kind of arrows impossibility theorem. But the interesting thing is if we want to relax. If we want to relax the optimality condition somehow, even without the IAA, IAA seems very subtle to you. But if we want to drop these conditions, the first one, Pareto, we all think that's good because that's condosit winner concept. And then the second is we call the minimal liberalism, means there are two distinct. There are two distinct voters who have the ability to decide social order of two distinct pairs, respectively. This is kind of a minimal liberalism in the sense that there's no voter which can decide the social order of order pair. So that somehow excludes the dictator possibility. Possibility. So we call that the minimal liverialism, at least two distinct pairs whose social order should be decided by two different voters. So in this case, actually, we wonder whether the social choice mapping exists from the set of m permutations, say put order, to a partial order. We take the two to the our v means. To the power v means take an element in the power set as the partial order. Even this relaxation, as long as we ask for there's no input restriction, then there's no map which can give for all the possible inputs, give such kind of out gives the output satisfying these two conditions. So, this is the MIT Sense in. This is the MITSN's impossibility theorem. Actually, it's the most general form of impossibility theorem, saying that the social choice map does not exist satisfying these two conditions for all the inputs. Okay, so is that clear? Okay, so hopefully this gives you the very fast introduction about the social choice theory. About the social choice theory. So, from there, actually, people wonder what's wrong with the social choice. Maybe economic people interpret social choice theory from many social meaning, but for mathematicians, their interpretation is different. Actually, the trouble comes from the input because in both of the impossibility theorem, we didn't put any restriction. We didn't put any restriction on the input in the sense that we have to take all the possible input as the products elements in the product space of symmetric group of M voters. So then the one question is how about we decompose the space of input into several components and then look at a social choice map on each of the components to see. Each of the components to see what's the situation, whether in the subspace of input, there might be some okay, the social choice map might be okay, but in some other space they are not okay. So we try to look at the input space such that whether the L post indeed happened in a subspace. So this is the idea by Dong Sari. idea by Dan Sari, he proposed this Dong Sari's profile decomposition. So basically, he can decompose the distribution as a function on the symmetric group as an on any distribution actually on the whole space can be decomposed into the following four components. The first component we say that's called a universal kernel. Universal kernel. So that means all ranking method, no matter its position rule or social tries rule, must induce a complete high on any subset of V. So this is called a universal kernel. There's no distinction of ranking methods. So basically, this subspace is really huge. You can see that the dimension will be n factorial minus 2 to the power n minus 1. power n minus one and multiplied by minus two and minus two. So it's dominated by the n factorial super exponential. And so the second space is called a border profile. The border profile means it's a subspace gave all the all the ranking method, position rule or parallel all give the same result. They all agree. So this space is very small, only dimension minus one. Minus one. So basically, you can give you a basis. So this is the basis represent whatever later we can see what will happen on this subspace. And another is condulcet profile. Condulcate profile means that all position rules give the same result, but pairwise rules may not. So this is called a condulcent profile. So this condulcent profile So, this condulative profile is n factorial minus one factorial divided by two. And so, this is the subspace for interpret for powerwise comparison. And the last one is called the departure profile. Departure profile means just opposite to the condulcent profile in the sense that all powerwise rule gave the same result, lies in the kernel of this powerwise rule. Power S rule, but the position rule might give different. So don't worry about this definition. We can take one example. So come back to this three candidate example. And for border profile, here we take the basis as as long as A appear on the top, we put a score one, as long as A appear on the bottom, we put a negative one. So we use Negative one, so we use this to represent the border profile. So basically, the border profile is when we count how many people prefer A to be the best. There are two here. And B C on the other hand, we see negative one. And another one is how many people prefer B to be the best? To be the best, there are two of them, and otherwise, they are the opposite. AC will be the worst, the opposite. So, if you look at this number, you count position rule, all the power, you will find they always give the same result. So, let's take the first example: like two volt A better than A better than negative two volt B as the less preferred. And if you look at A versus C, also two versus negative two. And so A is the final winner in the powerwise comparison. But if you look at for position rule, you can also count using YS0. You can also see. One as zero, you can also see A has the highest score, received two as the top highest one. So, this is the kind of border profile saying that basically the A is consistent in terms of either position rule or pairwise rule. So, in this, this is the border file subspace. Basically, that's all the different All the different rules in the social tries agree with one each other. So that's the perfect subspace. There's no inconsistency or conflict of interest arise if the data is arising from this subspace. However, if you look at condulcent profile and departure profile, the basis for condulcent profile is like this, ABC, BCA, CAB. BCA, CAB on this cycle, they receive score one. And the BAC, ACB, and CBA receive negative one. So if we put this data onto the triangle, sub-triangles, then we can receive this distribution. And after counting the powerwise comparison, you can see for every pair, you receive one versus negative one in a cyclic way. In a cyclic way. So, in other words, A is preferred by B in powerwise comparison. B is preferred over C, and C is preferred over A. So there is a cycle here. This is essentially condulcent profile really means you have a local cycle here, triangular cycle over suite candidate. But if you look at the position rules, Position rules, all the candidates receive score zero. Counted one as zero. So basically, all of them receive zero. So in this sense, actually, ABC received a tie in final voting in the position rule. But in terms of pairwise comparison, there is a cycle. So this is the key for condosit profile. The does not distinguish They do not distinguish position, but in terms of powerwise comparison, they are perfectly cycle cyclic ranking. And for departure profile, actually, this is the kind of different. So the basis is for simply count for ABC is one. CBA is another one. So basically, if you put this data on that, you can get this subtract. That you can get these sub triangles. And from this basis, you can count for all the position rule: A and C receive score one, and B receive score two as they can distinguish a power position rule. However, for powerwise comparisons, they are all in time. Another basis is ACB, is one BCA is another one. So you can similarly see. Another one. So you can similarly see we have another position rule can distinguish, but the power is comparison, they are all in time. So there are three basis for this departure profile subspace. So basically departure distinguish position rather than powerwise comparison, just opposite to the condulcent profile, orthogonal actually to the condulcent profile. So this is the order you can. All the, you can from this decomposition, you can see if we restrict the data, input the data on the border profile, then all the ranking problem will be no problem. You can always agree with each other. But if you look at the condosite or departure profile, different subspace, actually different voting method will suffer from the inconsistency issue. So here is the summary. So here is the summary for border count. Basically, for border profile, basically all the rankings are consistent. And for condulate subspace, pairwise ranking, pairwise rule are not consistent. For departure subspace, the position rule are not consistent. So if you look at the whole input space, the direct sum of all of them, then the Of them, then there's no social choice rule actually consistent. There must be conflicts depending on the choice. Social choice rule come out. So no agreement. However, if you want to ask for the best possibility from this impossibility, the best possible rule is about account because about account has the Count as the represents the maybe the projection of all the ranking data to the border profile subspace give you the border count. So this is why the border count is the first social choice rule proposed in the literature. Okay, so this is the condos, I mean the Dansari's point of view on the social choice theory in terms of mathematics. And what will happen for And what will happen for Hodge theory? Actually, when we look at modern data, our data actually we can always convert into the powerwise comparison on the graph. The graph represent for each of the nodes represent the candidate to be ranked like ABC before. But here we have a different set of edge. So some edge may not be compared. They're empty. They are empty edge. So we have incomplete possible capital as comparison data, and a different voter actually put a preference on different edge. So in this way, we have imbalanced data. So even with this kind of powerwise comparison data on graph, we can always define border count in terms of least square algorithm. So here is the essentially when we write border count. Essentially, when we write all the count as the simple least square estimation. So for each of the candidate, we want to put a merit score as beta i or beta j, candidate i and candidate j. And then we minus the alpha voter if we vote i versus j as a score one or negative one, depending whether i is preferred over j or not. I is preferred over J or not. And then we minimize this V square weighted by how many volts alpha voter puts on the pair Ij. So this is the sum of square minimizer. So that's essentially the bottom count because if you have a complete graph, say every voter actually vote compare IJ with. ij with an equal number, then the weight will be equal. So we can simply put that equals to one and all the pair appear in the graph. In that case, this least square result, the beta i, just equals to the border count we defined in the previous slide. And also it is equal to the condoset winner. So in that case. So otherwise, in Otherwise, in Kamini optimization, you can see the only difference between this v squared or the count from the Kamini optimization lies in this sign because Kamini optimization actually put a sign on beta i minus beta j, beta j in the sense that we want the sign of beta i minus beta j equals or try to as close as to the voting data as possible. So this is a As possible. So, this is a combinatorial optimization problem for chemical optimization. So, that's why it becomes MP hard because it's a minimal feedback oxide problem in the computer science. So, that's the difference between the border count and the chemical optimization in terms of this optimization point of view. Okay, so if you have incomplete data generalized from the complete Generalize from the complete order, total order, to the incomplete data with just a pairwise comparison. Actually, this least square problem actually carry over to this incomplete data case. We can define y hat ij as the average voting average on each of the pair ij for over all the voters defined this way. And omega ij is just the total sum of the The total sum of the vote on the pair ij over the voters, then this d square actually still can be rewritten in this way. And actually, you can generalize this y-hat ij to many different statistical models. So here, I don't want to say too much, but a uniform model and brilliant are the system must tell you can hear those famous names, the models. Names, the models, we can all project, I mean, summarize into different forms of y-hat ij. But no matter which model, all these models actually give you a skew symmetric function we call the alternating form on the pair on the edge of this graph. So in the sense that y hat ij equals to negative y hat ji. And then we can define a Hilbert space or Euclidean way. Space or Euclidean weighted using this inner product, UV as two functions, a two-skew symmetric function on the edge, such that their inner product equals to Uij Vij multiplied by this omega ij, that's the weight. So this defined Hilbert space. And using that, we can get this Haud decomposition as the orthogonal decomposition of any function in this. function in this skill symmetric function alternating form on this space of edge oriented edge actually. So this decomposition, the first component represent the gradient of certain function defined on the vertex. So this is called a border profile because this subspace actually exactly encodes the voting data such that all the Data such that all the voting rules, social choice rules we introduced before, position rules, a pairwise rule, they all agree with each other. That's the consistent subspace. And the second one, we call the B transpose A. Basically, in linear algebra, we can call that that's triangular cycle or curl in the sense that we take any oriented triangle IJK. Oriented triangle IJK, we just track the total sum along this oriented triangle that gave the triangular code. That's the condosite subspace, condosite profile. And the last one is the orthogonal. W is the orthogonal to the first two components. And in linear algebra, you can write as the kernel A transpose and the intersection with the kernel of B. So basically, that lies in the kernel of B and the co-kernel of A. Of B and the co-current of A. So that we call next harmonic. And both the second and the third, we all call them as condosit profile because once we convert all the data into the file as comparison, the departure profile disappears because we summarize the data in the powerwise comparison. Departure always agrees on powerwise comparison. How is comparison. So that subspace is dropped basically projection. And then we can get this hot decomposition as the power is voting data. Is that clear? Sorry. Oh, yes, that is good. Sorry to just interrupt you with a time check. Do you intend to take the hourly one? Oh, what's the time? Sorry. Well, see, you're over what you suggested because you suggested 40 minutes. You suggested we've suggested 40 minutes, but we have 40 minutes or 15 minutes left to lunch or to dinner. So, if you had intended to take a full hour, you have 10 minutes left. Okay, sorry. Let me faster go through all the rest. I don't want to take too much time. Sorry. And yeah, this is the hodge decomposition for power comparison and accounting for the social twice problem. And actually, I think. Actually, I think the proof is very simple. It's from linear algebra. You can use the most important is composition B after A is the closed operator. It must satisfy zero. So I think I can skip all these parts. It's how to decomposition. It's just runality theorem in this sense. And it's just a general special case for the general. Special case for the general hard decomposition on the simplicity complex, we can define the abstract pform. And I think most of you are very familiar with that. I can skip all these small slides. And so here is just a summary. For half decomposition, the first component we call that the border profile or border count generalization. Basically, this algorithm. Now, this algorithmally just gives rise to the first component, the x, equals to satisfy this graph Laplacian equation. Means delta zero is the graph Laplacian multiplied by x must equals to the divergence of y hat. So defined by A transpose Y hat. So for this kind of question, of course, you can use some recent theoretical study by Daniel Spielman and Deng Shanghua, the They find some nearly linear algorithm to solve this kind of graph-lapping equation. But that's only the theoretical part because they use some Steiner tree precondition. And how to do that in practice is still a hot research problem. But in practice, we can always use online methods using the stochastic approximation developed by Robinson manual and basically the algorithm. The algorithm gives this kind of rate, convergence rate, if you take data one by one. That's the stochastic greening design type algorithm. And you have to pay attention how the complexity is not only decided by the number of the samples, but also depend on the, say, the feedler value of the graph Laplacian. So that's the condition number one over the feeder. Number one over the fiddle value. Okay, so the remaining two part actually is the condulate profile, but the condulcent profile splits into local and global cycles. For local cycle, we mean the triangular cycle. We already introduced that, but for global cycle, we mean that's the harmonic cycle. They are perpendicular to the triangular cycles, but still. Cycles, but still kind of cycle. Whenever these two kinds of cycles happen, you will suffer the voting chaos issue. For three candidates, the triangular cycle, just say everyone can be the final winner. But if you have harmonic cycle, that means almost every candidate in the voting data in the vertex set can be the final winner. So we call that fixed tournament issue. So that's the Tournament issue. So that's the hodge decomposition. Of course, we can analyze where the conflicts of interest come out. We might think about different voters actually have different personalized preference. So this is kind of analysis we try to, for example, in movie lens, we find the majority of people follow the common preference, but some group like But some group, like farmer, tradesmen, and artists, they are very distinct from other types of people who borrow movies and watch online from the company. So that's the, but the self-employed person actually is the most consistent toward the common preference. So that's an interesting thing. That's all about the hodge part. The hodge part for social choice part. And the next little bit question is: social try just look for a single utility. How about multiple utility? And one example comes from game theory. So for game theory, actually, we can map that into a flow, edge flow on the graph in the following way. So we take all the strat, all the All the strategy profile for each of the game players. They have a strategy to take a product form, then we can form that into the vertex set of a graph. And on this graph, we can define the edge.
