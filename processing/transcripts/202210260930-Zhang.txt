Welcome everybody to today's first talk given by Melissa Jans and she's going to speak about La Homodia de Corano and the homologa the ramificanos de 20 give it away thanks to Francis for telling me the action Francis, for telling me the actual standard Spanish description of branch double covers. This was what I got from Google Translate yesterday and is also typical of my Spanish this week, which is a bumbling toddler. This is upcoming joint work with these two fine mathematicians, Akram Ali Shahi, who's at UGA, and Lynn Trung, who's at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. And Arbor. And okay, so this talk is not going to be in Spanish because I'm, as you know, quite bad at it, but I figured it'd be interesting for us to actually see what these are called in another language. So let me start with some motivation that many of you may be familiar with on a lot of different levels, and I guess I don't have to wear this. So, this conference is about quantum invariance, and for me, I think. Quantum invariants, and for me, I think the first example of a quantum invariant that I had studied was actually from Dora's intro paper of covanophomology. And then I sort of went from there and I thought about, okay, what's the relationship between it, yeah. But at least from my point of view, it feels the closest to what I understand about. Fields the closest to what I understand about quantum invariance. And okay, so this the first relationship that I think was a really concrete thing that I saw that was mathematically relating covanophomology and fluorhomologies was this branch double cover spectral sequence by Oshwaten Sabo. And I'm sure you know how to spell their names. But of course, the first problem is: well, this is an invariant of links in S3, and this is an invariant of S3, and this is an invariant of three manifolds. And my hindsight, as my eye doctor tells me, is 20-20. So, like, okay, what's the easiest way to go from links to three manifolds? Well, you could do surgery or you can do a branch double cover. Okay, so the spectral sequence goes from reduced cohomohomology, and then because of some conventions on cohomology versus homology, this is actually a mirror, but let's not worry about that for today. And it collapses to the To the hat version of Hager Flurhomology of the branch double cover. Just so I know who the audience is, can you raise your hand if you're entirely comfortable with this? Okay, thank you. That doesn't mean I'm going to change my slides, of course. So I'd transitioned from board talk to slide talk yesterday so that. A slide talk yesterday so that people on Zoom can see better. Okay, so this is typically how quantum link homologies are related to gauge-theoretic homologies. The spectral sequence you should always think of within this talk is going from Kavanov to Igarfloor, I think. And as many of you have actually worked on, these spectral sequences actually help us transfer detection results. So if you know that something on So, if you know that something on this side detects some not, so it tells you everything about it, then there's sort of a restriction on, like, you know, it gives you information about things on this side. And also, you have restrictions going the other way. It's a relationship that can be exploited. Okay, so for those of you who didn't see my talk at msri/sl math, this is a shortened version of what I did there to a bunch. Of what I did there to a bunch of homotopy theories, which is I really wanted to give you the general idea of how this spectral sequence works so I can raise it to the involutive level. The LUT study, there's a diagram up here, but it's not very important. There's a base component and then there's an unknot, and conveniently it is covered up so I don't have to bottom left to the bottom right. Sorry. Bottom right. Okay. Oh. Okay. Oh, yeah. Okay. Thank you. Because of my conventions working with this, I'm just kind of being very vague about what this is. I'm going to say this is the diagram of the mirror so that my conventions work out. But in any case, if you think, if you see a diagram and it has three circles, you want to relate it to its branch double cover, which is what just popped up. Nope. Ah, I have to click on this, don't I? Ah, okay. Thank you. Okay. Which is two copies of S1 cross S2, which I'm not going to try to draw a diagram from there, but this is probably the simplest diagram that everybody would think of. And the reason I draw this is because I want to point out that there's out that there's um well there are some disks there are two disks from this point here down to here and so that tells you that this thing has a grading that's higher than this this point right so the the marked pair of points in this picture is going to be like the top grading uh generator for the complex okay and then we can compare the complexes on the havana side and the The complexes on the Havana side and the hagiofloor side in this way. I'm working with reduced. Okay, so then this thing is always going to be labeled one or X, depending on your conventions. But the point is that the size of this is going to be four-dimensional over F2. And if you just take this top quantum grading thing, you can act on it by these monomials given by the action of X. You know, the action of x1 on this circle, x2 on this circle, and you kind of get the entire four-dimensional vector space. And the same thing happens here. And the key is to remember that there's an H1 action on this complex. So the double branch cover of this diagram, if you think about these green arcs and you lift them to the branch double cover, then this is going to become a whole circle, and this is going to become a whole circle. And this is going to become a whole circle, and they trace out generators for the H1 of this three-manifold. And if you take this intersection point and you act on it by these H1 elements, you actually get the same picture here. So that's going to be like the vertices of the Kovanov cube on this side. This is a very simple picture, like we understand. Simple picture, like we understand this, the Hayard floor homology of this manifold very well, as well as any number of connect sums of it. Oh, yeah, okay. All right, so then you might say, like, how do I handle the differentials? Well, in this case, let's say we're merging these two circles along an arc called gamma. It turns out that the correct thing to do with the picture I showed you before is to do negative one surgery along the lift of Of this arc gamma, which is again going to be a circle in the branch double cover. And by doing negative one surgery, you get to the resulting picture. So the branch double cover of this guy. And then the algebra behind it is that you have these mapping cones and you take the iterated mapping cones. And it's kind of this a similar picture on both sides, the Khovanov and the Hager-Floor side. So we're going to use. So, we're going to use the surgery map coming from surgery along gamma tilde. So, if I want to model this spectral sequence using a different theory, what I have to do is really focus on figuring out what the differentials mean, because the data is not in these connect sums of S1 cross S2, obviously. The data is within the differentials. Okay, that was part one. Any questions? That was part one. Any questions? Okay. The next three slides, I had spent a lot of time drawing them about a month or two ago. So I just want to show you really quickly. Oops. Sorry. This is me showing people how to do the branched double cover and see this. So, ta-da! Here are the slices. And you could like actually try to take half of it. Try to take half of it and then you know double it, you can hopefully see that you actually do get negative one surgery for these two circles with one of them marked, you get back to S3. So this is kind of like the merging map version. Okay, so now let me tell you about involitive Hagerd floor homology, and I'm denoting this by HFI of the three-manifold. This was introduced by Hendrix and Mel. This was introduced by Hendrix and Malescu about less than 10 years ago. So, suppose I have a Hager diagram for some three-manifold. Algebraically, this is not actually too hard to describe, except for, of course, this iota map. So, it's just the cone of some map. And I'm trying to be very careful here. And I'm thinking of this as a module over F to adjoin Q mod Q. Over F to adjoin Q mod Q squared. So this Q is just letting me interpret between this copy of the original complex and then another copy of the complex. And I just want to keep track of where I am. This iota map is the involution here. So let's briefly describe what it is. There is, you have this Hagar diagram. You have a surface, alpha, beta curves, base point. Alpha beta curves base point. There's this conjugate diagram where you flip the orientation of your surface and then also switch to the roles of beta and alpha curves. And from this, you get the most obvious identification if you actually draw the picture. So this map is on complexes, it's just you just do the identification. The hard part, which I wouldn't be able to reproduce, is the fact that there exists a chain homotopy equivalence that takes you. That takes you back to your original diagram. And this involves, you know, thinking about what happens with your choice of almost context, almost complex structure and things like that. So this is a very difficult thing to show, but there exists one. It's not unique, but it is unique up to homotopy, which will be useful later. And one thing that I haven't really mentioned yet is that if you break up the Hagard floor homology. You break up the Hagard floor homology along the spin-C structures, then this combination does conjugate it. So when you get back here, it's not quite where you started. So it's a homotopy involution in the sense that if you do it twice, then you are homotopic to the identity. And the reason why I say homotopy is because there's this piece here. Okay, so this is IOTA. Are there any questions here? Any questions here? Okay. All right. So, what is the motivation for constructing involutive versions of things? Well, here are some equivalences of homologies. So, over here, what I'm calling cyber-witten, sorry, cyber homology is the S1 equivariant homology of Madeline. Of Matalescu's Zeiberg-Wittenfloor spectrum. And this was originally defined for a more restricted class of manifolds, but it has since been extended. You should think of this S1 equivariant, homologically speaking, as kind of over like F2 adjoined Q without modding out the Q squared. Okay, the homology of this, Lidman and Mel. Lidman and Matalescu showed that this is the same as monocle fluorohomology. And then Kutluhan, Lee, and Taub showed that this is the same as Heger fluorohomology. And an earlier case of this, I think, is for the hat version, is due to these people. And so what you see is that in this theory, there's actually more structure. There's actually a pin two action on. Action on the space. So not only do we have an S1 action, we actually have two copies of S1, and then there's this J action that takes goes from this circle to that circle. And so you would also expect to see it here and here. So now in the monopole world, which remember is up here, right, okay, there are also similar relationships. There are also similar relationships to havanopomology. This special sequence was by Bloom, who is, I believe, not in math, but a lot of you probably knew him. And I wish I could meet. It's just a mysterious figure, always shows up. But then Francesco Lin defined an involutive version of model populo homology and said that, well, I can do the same spectral sequence for the involutive version. And in fact, what I see. And in fact, what I see over here is some version of BN homology. What is BN? Okay, sorry. This is involved fluoro homology defined by Francesco. And this is a version of Barnettan homology. And Dror always puts pictures of other people in his talks. And I figure you deserve to have a picture of yourself here. I hope you don't mind. I took this from Wikipedia, so probably no property rights have been violated, but I'm not sure. But I'm not sure. So, this is going to be over. These are let me know what picture you prefer for future talks. It's an evolving process. I should note here, like if you think about, if you're usually thinking about this over, say, F2, right, you might say, well, this is like, you know, you've just got some towers. Where is all the structure? I want to remind you that this is. remind you that this is F2 adjoint Q mod Q squared modules. So this has some interesting, I can think a more interesting structure we haven't really taken so much time to explore it yet because this is work in progress. So far we only really have the spectral sequence. So the fact that this is interesting maybe should tell you that this is also even more interesting, has more information. There's a spectral sequence. Okay, I think I might have messed up. Okay, I think I might have messed up with my surprise here because the answer is already here. But is there an analog for Hagard fluorhomology, right? So, somehow back in this page, okay, there's involutive here, there's involutive here, there is involutive here, and the first relationship from quivonal homology is actually to Hager-Floor homology. So, you would say, like, well, it's got to exist, it just has to. To um, the answer is yes, but I know that this doesn't mean much until I tell you why you should care. So, I'm going to address this question. Okay, so this is this is the big reveal, right? Ah, yes, but why should you care? Um, I'm going to be honest, why do I care? It's just my main reason is just like, it's just gotta, right? You just like, you need to know if it works. If it doesn't work, you'd be very surprised and you really want to focus on it. If it works, then it's satisfying and then you move on. It works, then it's satisfying, and then you move on, you look for applications. So, in my mind, in cursive in my mind, it's well, it should, why hasn't this been done yet? Like, what technology did we like not have to be able to do this? And also, this sort of gives you a sense of what should quote unquote involutive covanohomology be. Obviously, javanophomology was not on the slide relating with all those gauge theories, but it does have this relationship to gauge theories. This relationship to gauge theories, it doesn't really necessarily have this like conjugation action. But what should the related invariant be on the Kelvana side? Why should you care? Well, here's one application that we've been thinking about. We're trying to see, well, for what class of knots the spectral sequence collapses immediately. So, pending whether this class is interesting or not, well, you get restrictions, right, going both ways. So, suppose you really wanted to do So, suppose you really wanted to do something with involutive fluorhomology, as many of you might. Well, then, here's my application. It's related to a version of Barnetton homology, and then we have powerhouses of computing like Lucas here. My application is that now Lucas can compute in volatility fluoro homology up to some grading funny business. Right, so this is what we're exploring right now. What we're exploring right now, and then as with any spectral sequence that you find relating invariants, well, if it has a lot of interesting pages and you just look at it and you can ask the following questions. Are all the pages invariants? And at what page does it collapse? So how many interesting pages are there? The reason why I put this in parentheses is because I don't know of what has been done with this question for the original one. So it seems like one would start there, but I don't know. This is just still. But I don't know. This is just still questions for you. About the first one, yes. Yeah, sorry. Yes. So Baldwin, maybe other people. Baldwin, head, and lob. Sandra here. First John, okay. That's right. Yeah. Um, right, right. So, uh, John Baldwin wrote a paper. I'm going to repeat what you said because of the Zoom people. Sorry, wrote a paper saying that all the pages are invariants. And I also want to cite Baldwin, Hedden, and Lobb's paper for this, because it clarified a lot of things for me. Yeah, it's like one should also look at the original spectral sequence and that paper to see if what these invariants can be used for. What these invariants can be used for. Okay, any other questions or comments? Okay. So now let me tell you about the construction of said spectral sequence. This is joint work that is in a paper that I should be writing, but instead I'm in Oaxaca. So remember that I wrote this weird notation. The involutive direction is like vertical, just because I want to burn it into your brain that I'm working with. To burn it into your brain that I'm working with these different directions. Okay, so this is the definition of the chain complex. And remember that all of at all the vertices of my covant of cube, I only have just connect sums of S1 cross S2. Now, it turns out that iota, which is this involution, has this decomposition, right? It's a homotopy equivalent to just taking the tensor product action. The tensor product action. So, like the obvious action on each of the components of this iota of my very simple manifold. Now, I can actually immediately say that this is going to be the same as the homology here, because if you think about my original diagram, right, S1 cross S2 had two, there's a torrent. Two, there's a torus and there's two intersection points, and they're in different gradings. IOTA is grading preserving, so there's not much that can happen, especially when working over F2. Nothing should happen. Okay, so that means that there's really no content here, which means that all of the data should be in the surgery maps. So now our goal is to understand the surgery maps. So here's a So here's a schematic of what page one should look like. So page zero, right, the total complex was like a bunch of copies of the original Hager Fleur complex. And then there's Q times one plus iotas. And I've turned the page and now I've computed Hager-Fluor homology for each of the vertices of my cube. Originally, I would have had like some merge or split map in covato homology, and this would correspond to some surgery map, but now I have two copies of them. But now I have two copies of them, and there is this additional map here that I need to understand. And this information is that like describes the surgery map for involutive Hager flow homology or the chain complex. These are going to be the same ones as in the original Oshwat-Sabo spectral sequence, but this needs some help for computing. And the difficulty in computing this is that everything in the involvement world is kind of. In the involuntary world is kind of up to homotopy. So, if you want to really get your hands on something and compute it, you need to pick a representative of each map and make sure things work together and understand the homotopies and stuff. So, this project was mostly us computing parts of this map, which I will now show you. Okay, so I added this slide just to show you where it fits into like the Kvado picture. So, if you wear glasses, you should take your glasses off right now and just kind of not look at what the coefficients or what. Not look at what the coefficients or what the number of components are. But okay, in the top here, this is supposed to represent some sort of like two-crossing diagram. And then if you look at the whole thing, oops, there's this involutive direction down here. And we already said that these dotted maps are not very interesting. There's nothing there. These maps along the faces of this cube are going to be our H maps. Are going to be our H maps, which I'm going to tell you about how to compute. And then you can imagine that things sort of work up to homotopy, but not exactly, not like things don't automatically commute. So then you sort of have more pages of the spectral sequence. You would have induced maps going this way and so on. So if you have a larger cube, you'd have more things to compute. And because we want to be able to potentially compute these longer differentials later, we have to approach this in a very algebraic way. Very algebraic way so that we can just play around with algebra, making sure that we actually get correct homotopies to see what these longer arrows will be. The main tool is this Lipschitz-Oschwatt-Sabo times two because they came up with bordered Hager floor homology and also the bordered version of the branch double cover spectral sequence. So here's the main idea of how you do this. You take so. You take some flat closure, I believe this is what one would call it, of your braided representative of your knot. And then you chop it up so that you only see one crossing at each slice. And then you consider, just like in the usual branch-double cover spectral sequence, you have this resolution and this resolution. You have this resolution and this resolution, and you're taking a branch double cover of each of these slices of the diagram. So you kind of have a you know this thing to branch along and this thing and this thing, but they all have borders. Okay, and then you glue them all together with this derived tensor product. And then, you know, you have to try to understand the map in the middle because nothing's happening on the left or the right, but for each of Happening on the left or the right, but for each of your crossings, you have to understand what's going on. But luckily, they're just some sort of some twist. Okay. So what we're going to do here is take that middle section, right? So the left half and the right half are just staying the same, and we're just focusing on a single slice. We're going to break that up further into a triply border diagram where I'm only going to be doing I'm only going to be doing surgery on this piece. So, the way you should think of this in total is that if I were planning to do surgery on some arc gamma tilde, then this should sort of be the torus that it lives in parametrized correctly. And then this is just the exterior of that arc. And then I'm going to do surgery on just this piece. And basically, I need a map that does that, right? I've changed the notation a bit here. Change the notation a bit here. Hopefully, it's intuitive, but if it makes sense, it makes sense. If it doesn't, then don't worry about it. Yeah, okay, so I need to sort of look for a way to describe this surgery map, but using this border description. Before I go on, are there any questions? Yeah. That's new doing it with the tri-module. Yeah. Yeah. They just explicitly computed the like triangle maps between these two border diagrams. Yeah, yeah. They sort of understand anytime I have a positive or negative crossing, I understand the, I guess, a morphism on the module that's given by the CFDA. Yeah. Yeah. Ah, sorry. The question was: like, basically, Adam was noticing that the difference in this approach is that the original LOT paper for the branch double cover using bordered technology doesn't use this precisely this construction. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure if they actually. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure if they actually use this to prove what they have, but basically they look at each piece and they understand how things change. I'm not going to make that more precise right now because I might say something wrong. Maybe Liam would know. Any other questions? Okay. So, okay, this is what I was saying earlier, right? Let's just ignore this part and just think, okay. Ignore this part and just think: okay, I have some solid torus with some parameterization of the boundary, and then I'm gluing it onto something here, and I want to understand the map over here. This looks complicated, but this is straight from a paper of Hendrix and Lipschitz, which actually give you a surgery exact triangle for Hager involute of Hager flow homology. Of fluorhomology. I should note that this is actually like the first iteration. There's another paper with, I should have written this down with like four authors, including Kristen and Ian Zemke and other people who, if you're in this room, please speak up who do this a different way. But the reason why we did this way is because when we started the project, we sort of like only understood this one. And also algebraically, this sort of just works better. Algebraically, this sort of just works better in our situation. It's very hands-on. So, here is how to describe IOTA in terms of a border diagram. Suppose you have this type A module and this type D module. Well, you can do the usual obvious conjugation, right, where you switch the orientation, so you like reparametrizing the bordered situation, and then you switch the roles of the beta and alpha. You switch the roles of the beta and alpha curves. So now I get these conjugated diagrams. And then I stick in these pieces called Aruzarev pieces, which basically change my, so let's say this is previously alpha bordered. Now this is beta bordered. This turns this box tensor into back into an alpha border diagram. It's sort of a very concrete piece. And in our case, we're only working with the torus. So you just have to understand these two. Taurus, so you just have to understand these two pieces. Now, this map is unique up to homotopy, but in our case, we had to actually compute it. And I think we go up to omega 4, and then it's zero. This is sort of because of the restriction of the size of the Taurus algebra. And then you have to basically then use Hagard moves to move back to your original diagram, right? So, this is these two pieces. Right, so this is these two pieces, and so the composition of all of these maps is IOTA. And hopefully you can see that this is this kind of agrees with the original notion of IOTA. Now, this column was for the infinity, so no surgery, right? And I was saying that for our example of merging two circles, I'm going to do minus one surgery. And you have this diagram. This is what Kristen and Robert. This diagram. This is what Kristen and Robert show. In particular, you can, so you have to compute this homotopy here. So there are reasons why these will just commute, but here we need a homotopy. And for us, the map that was mysterious, the map H that was added to the information of the original Oshwa-Sapo differential is the H. Is the H the dark green H map here, and that is the composition of all of these. Okay, so this is provided by Hendrix and Lipschitz, and then these you need to get concrete representatives for. There's a lot to check, so I actually had to use a computer for a paper for the first time in my life, whereas all other previous attempts just failed for me. Like, I didn't put it into a paper, so that was exciting. Okay, and then. Okay, and then, so here's the conclusion, right? So there is a spectral sequence, and you can actually compute that you get the same thing as in the monopole floor setting. I think it's because maybe as like this kind of ground ring gives you some abilities to do basis changes where you sort of don't have too many choices for what should be here. But in any case, this is like what I would have expected in the beginning as well. Expected in the beginning as well. Okay, so I'm going to leave you with a question. And I'm very early because this was a board talk as of like 9 p.m. last night. So sorry about that. Which is, well, I know that covanophmology doesn't necessarily have an obvious conjugation action, but symplectic covanophmology has an O2 action. So that is also a copy of S1. Of s1 and then a z2. And it also has diagrams with alpha and beta curves. So for example, here is, we have to start with a braid representation. So I have sigma one cubed in the braid group with two strands. And so my closure is the positive trefoil. The idea is that you're in the complex plane, and I have a bunch of points where these are actually shadows. These are actually shadows of, like, you should think of them as spheres with like some poles pinched to a point. And the points are going to be at these P1 through P4. This alpha is going to be standard and the beta kind of traces the braid action and you draw it here, have some picture. This is on the complex plane. So we can do the conjugation, we can switch the alpha and beta curves, we can do And beta curves. We can do versions of Markov moves to relate diagrams, and these are called bridge moves in Seidel and Smith's paper. So the question is, if you were able to compute what potentially involutive symplectic Havana homology were, I want to know how it relates to some version of Barnattan homology. Just because this is my best guess for involutive Hovan. Best guess for involutive hovanophomology at the moment. So I realized that this is, you know, the coefficients are a bit funky here, but you can think about doing this over F2, think, you know, do some coefficient stuff. If anybody could tell you, tell me this information in like two or three years, that would be awesome. I tried thinking about this and I wasn't very good at this part. So that's probably the hard part. That's all I have. So thanks for. That's all I have, so thanks for listening. All right. So I guess for questions, we need to switch the microphone. So, any questions for Melissa from here or from the online audience? Since you have a few minutes, can you say what it looks like on a couple of examples? Okay. The trefoil. The trefoil. I have not worked this out yet as this is work in progress, but let me see if I can. Well, is the trefoil in your work in progress class of examples where things collapse on the YouTube page? We don't know yet. I mean, that probably, but we sort of just gotten to that part. So, yeah. Just gotten to that part. So, yeah, we have to compute some examples and think about this. I don't know yet. Yeah. So, just to understand this more concretely, right? So, you're the way that you're in each of these complexes, since you're doing the involutive thing, you're doubling the rank of the groups. And that's like passing back to the unreduced Kavanaugh groups of the, because it's Off groups of the because it's like two copies of the reduced and you're working over Zima too. And then that extra, and then so the horizontal differentials are just the standard Kavanaugh differential, basically. And then the H is the extra terms that come in in the Varnatan complex. Is that the identification? Compared with H. Right. And so then the proof is that that H is precise, it turns out magically to be precise. Precise turns out magically to be precisely the bonus terms in the yeah. I don't know how much it like relates the comment about going back to unreduced. Those two sort of don't connect for me, right? It's sort of like it really is just it's like taking reduced Barnetton, but two copies of it. I don't know if there's any relationship back to unreduced because the H, you know, can well, actually, based on what Lucas. Well, actually, based on what Lucas has told me earlier, maybe this genus on the dotted component is really what it is. I take that back. Maybe. I don't know. Yeah. So, I mean, sometimes it happens that the spectral sequence comes from like you have a spectral sequence, but in fact, Like you have a spectral sequence, but in fact, you have like further structure in the background, and you know, you don't actually need to look at the spectral sequence, you kind of a module structure or something. Like, for example, this happens in Li, in the case of the Li spectral sequence. So, is there any chance that your theorem can be phrased in other terms than spectral sequences? I only started briefly thinking about this because. I only started briefly thinking about this because of your talk. You said you didn't need spectral sequences, just module structure. I haven't internalized this idea enough, but the only sort of I don't know, I don't know that would the module structure be from what would it, I don't know, we should talk about this later. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, probably a hard question. Be a hard question. I just don't think I've internalized the idea of like trading spectral sequences for some other structure. Yeah. Can I ask a question? Oh, I think Mike Willis is going to answer a question first. No, no, no, no. I'm just going to push the question back and say, like, you know, if to ask for this for the involative case, it feels like you should maybe first ask. Case, it feels like you should maybe first ask: is this already known for the just the original Aja Sabo spectral sequence? And I don't know if anybody knows this or not. True. Thank you. Somebody online was asking a question. I don't know who. Hi, Claudius. Yeah. Hi. Can you go back to one slide to the involutive Bonata Kvanov? This one? Yeah, to this slide, yeah. So where should the extra? Where should the extra? I'm just thinking about, I don't know, like usual, convey sphere decomposition of a knot, like the example that Liam asked about, like the trephoir knot decomposed into two as two-bridge decomposition. So where should the right so one part of the involution comes from switching alpha and beta? comes from switching alpha and beta okay and you can also do that in that example um what should be the second part in in where should the second involution sort of part of the definition of the involution come from um or is that was that the open question maybe i'm misinterpreting i mean yeah so that part is less obvious but what i was saying here is that um there is a guaranteed way to relate any two diagrams Relate any two diagrams for the symplectic monophomology, right? So there exists things like Reidemeister moves, right? These Markov moves that should be able to relate at least some representatives with the same braid index. So I should be able to flip the colors of this picture. And I'm a little bit confused about the orientation, but like, you know, get back to my original picture and have some complex that I can then. Then identify with the original one. So it's half a question. Yeah. Okay, so I guess for two bridge knots, this is uninteresting because you can just because it's just an action of the mapping class group. And so nothing interesting happens. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Okay. I think I want to talk to you more about this later potentially because for like larger uh for like larger braid index why well i have no no clue about more yeah larger braid indexes uh yeah but i'm happy to talk yeah thanks for the talk any further questions yes uh sorry for my ignorance and sorry drawer I mean, for my ignorance, I'm sorry, Drawer, I'm not familiar with Barnattan homology. So, like, why can you not do, like, why can't you not build a spectral sequence from covalent homology of L to involve, but you need to do it with Barnatan homology? Yeah, this has to do with the way that we built the spectral sequence. So, we have this giant complex, and we chose a filtration on it, right? And the filtration looks like. Filtration looks like. I don't know if I want to go back that many slides. The filtration sort of lumps this Barnaton differential as being in the same level as the usual Oschwatt-Sabo differentials between vertices of the complex. So it's basically a function of when I chose the filtration, I can't separate the I can't separate the Barnetton differentials from the Kovanov differentials. And that's why the spectral sequence for the filtration came out this way. That's not to say that there doesn't exist a different one. I'm not sure I can't immediately think of. I mean, I can think of a filtration that might do that, but okay, I will. Just if you get nauseous from this, sorry. I am always. I am always worried about this. Ah, okay. Yeah, okay. So here's a good example, right? My filtration is by the original filtration by Oshwatzabo. So that means that my arrows have a bunch of different directions. There's the ones that go back to the same vertical column. There's the one that go to the next, like after one surgery, after a single surgery, right? Surgery, right? And but after a single surgery, all of these red and these light green arrows are going to be computed when you turn the page of the spectral sequence. So they're combined together for the involutive information, and I don't separate them. And that's kind of why it shows up. Like it turns out that this green thing is non-trivial, so it's there. But I could maybe try to. But I could maybe try to filter it like with this direction in mind, and I don't know what would happen. Yeah. Thank you. It's what, yeah. More questions? All right, then let's thank Melissa again. Thank you.
