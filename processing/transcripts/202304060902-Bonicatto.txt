I'm very pleased to take part in this workshop in this particular amazing location. So today I'd like to tell you something about recent investigations that we have been carrying out with Fred and with Jacqueline, with Jacqueline Lenin, which was with us at work and is now recently left within a fight. So the topic of the troll The topic of the talk should probably be currents, cryptidian currents, and an evolutionary model for these objects. And well, before really starting, let me just give you a quick outline of my talk. I will of course start with an introduction, but I want to tell you where our problem comes from. And I connect it actually to two well-known equations. Through two well-known equations in the dynamics. I'll then have to touch upon very briefly on the supposedly notational issues with currents. I don't think I have to introduce them with this audience, but I'll mention the class of currents we want to work with in. And by relying on the theory developed, I'll be able to write down an equation which we have called each. An equation which we have called the geometric transform equation. And finally, in section three, I want to present with you my findings. And actually, the result I'd like to focus on today is a Wiposen result of this based on existence and uniqueness. And actually, if time allows, I'll give you, I want to give you And I want to give you a few glimpses of the proof, at least in some particular cases, in order to show you which are the main ingredients that proof relevance, of course. Alright, so without further ado, let me start. And let me say that indeed, my talk is really pivot around transport. And I don't want to motivate why we study transport, because I mean, transport phenomena are pretty much ubiquitous in many physical Ubiquitous in many physical models. But I would like to start by saying that a common mathematical framework in which one can study these formulas is usually provided by two PDs, very well known and well-studied. We have on the one hand the so-called continuity equation, which I write down in this form, where rho is say a function of time and space. Time and space, and this is the continuity equation. And we also have the transport, linear transport equation, which are usually valid, where, so rho bar and u bar are two given initial data, and u is also as a scalar field, so it's a function of time and space. And this is the transfer projection. And this is the transportation. And in both models, in both equations, the object P is a given vector field, right? Which usually represents the velocity. So just to give you some concrete picture, you might think of this function. So this equation is satisfied by rho tx, where rho tx is, say, the density of a continuous distribution. Density of a continuous distribution of particles in a flow that are moving, affected, moved by this velocity. Now, for some reasons that hopefully will be clear in 15 but minutes, it turns out that this way, so this equation is well suited to describe the motion of mass distribution or more general, say, of points, of objects which are, say, zero dimension. Say zero-dimensional. And pretty much in the same way, it turns out that these equations are very well suited to describe the notion of scalar fields, or in other words, of top-dimensional objects. And now I believe you will agree with me because it seems a fairly interesting question to understand what's in between, right? What happens if I want to move some geometric object whose dimension is sort of intermediate? Sort of intermediate. If you want concrete examples, think if you want to move, say, curves, loops, dislocation loops, as we saw in Jamet's talk, or membranes, films in a media. So, what if K is safe in between? So, we wanted to understand whether one can formulate a transport equation for these intermediate dimensions and the tool that we Uh tool that we decided to exploit is cards. So this mark the beginning of section two. And so I want to briefly introduce to you this notion of current, but without spending too much time on it. So one very cheap way of understanding currents, in my view, is if you think of them as the Of them as the vector cardio dialogue, as the higher-dimensional analog to distributions. So, when I say higher-dimensional analog, I am referring to the target, to the codomain. I'm well aware that distribution theories as well with domains in mind. But what happens if you want to sort of consider the vector-bodied analog? Well, this is one way of understanding targets. And I hope you will agree with me that, in as much as these being analogous distributions, they are sort of they provide us with. They provide us with the right framework to study weak problems under weak regularity, in a weak regularity region. And so let me start fixing something more regularly. So D is of course now the ambient dimension. It's a network number and k is an integer between zero and e. And so a current, so t, so k current, say, So k tar let's say k car next t. Alright, so the definition is essentially it's a linear curve and continuous functional on the space dk over d, which is the space of the smooth compactly supported Supported differential key forms. Alright? So this is fairly abstract definition. So it's an object, if you want, called T, which if you have omega, which is a K form, a scoop K form, if you feed this K form into T, it outputs a real number. And this law, this function is compatible with the linear structure in the special t forms and continuous with respect to some topology. Now, this is pretty much the abstract definition, but maybe I don't want to give you some more concrete pictures, some more concrete idea of the ideas. And actually, throughout my talk, you might be thinking to car, and actually, without loss of generality, as it does vector by. S first vector value measures. This is somewhat a prototypical example because I would be working within the class of currents with finite masses. So it's really, without loss of generality, you may think of a current T as an object to mu. I'm sticking to Giovanni's notation. So mu is the scalar measure and dou is, say, to begin with, if dou is open, vector, actually. So I can. It's a one-vector, so vector field. This is what we usually call vector valid measure, and this is an example of that. So, if so is a more in general, if so is a k vector, this will be a k current. Alright? And now, of course, let me say that special classes of currents arise whenever the measure Î¼ or any vector have some special structure. So, if your mu is associated with some rectifiable set, Associated with some rectifiable set, with some k manifold saying using electronic tangents and the k vector obtained by the basis of the tangent space, then you have several internal currents or internal currents. But I'm not going into that today. So, currents come, so since they are defined in duality, there's an operator which comes essentially for free by the definition, which is the notion of bound operators. By the definition, which is the notion of boundary. And what is the boundary of a current? Well, it's still a current, but one-dimensionless. So I'll denote by partial t the boundary of a current, and it's defined in such a way that if you feed into it k minus 1 for alpha, this returns t apply to t alpha. So basically the boundary is the So basically, the boundary is the adjoint of the exterior differential, if you have a successor function, right? So you have force if you want this definition in order to have Stokes' theorem, in order to have Stokes theorem. If you have this geometric intuition, you can now I need okay, say throughout my talk I've been working in the class of uh normal currents. This will be Normal currents. This would be the only relevant class of currents I'm considering. And what is a normal current? Well, it's just a current T such that its boundary is also representable as a vector value. So current of the form to mu, whose boundary And I need two more definitions before I'm done to write down the missing part. And I need, well, this is very natural. Very natural. I need to define, I want to define the analog to the multiplication. So we all know that if I have a distribution, and if I have a smooth function, I can multiply the distribution times a smooth function, and I still get a distribution. We can do pretty much the same with currents, and this is the match product. So if I have now a vector, say, or a vector field, and I want to define And I want to define its multiplication times t. So this is a k current. Well, if t is of the form to mu, well, this would simply be b with toe tax. Fairly reasonable definition. And why am I giving to you this definition? Because actually, by means of this watch product, I can now define a direct Directional derivative of a distribution of currentness. So I want to define a way of measuring how current changes in a given direction, sort of derivative of the current in a direction. And one way And one way, one possible way of doing this is by giving the following definition. So the derivative of a current in a direction T will simply be defined as the current obtained in this way. Excuse me, since it's my first lecture on currents. So B wedge T is not defined by duality, where you would wedge it. Where you would wedge it with a differential form. Yeah, I mean, this is, I'm defining a current, a k plus one current, right? Yeah, yeah, but you could also define it by duality, right? By saying B wedge T applied to something with T applied to the B wedge, to the differential form with the exterior products. That's not what you're saying. Not quite, because the joint to the wedge would be the contraction operator. I mean, you I want, so if you notice, I'm starting from a So if you notice, I'm starting from a k current and I'm obtaining a k plus one current. But that would be exactly that, right? But if you, I mean, how can you feed? I mean, if omega is a form, B wedge omega is a T plus one form. You cannot feed into T. It's easily cut. Oh, okay. No, so you'd have to apply it to K minus one. So B wedge T would be applied to K minus one forms. Yeah, but that would be pretty much the same as saying that T is applied onto the contraction. T is applied onto the contraction of only one with B, which is what you're taking. That's a definition. I was just surprised that you wouldn't define B which T would be applied on K minus would be a K minus one current. I don't know, I want it to be a K plus one current. Yeah. Is there a relation between this definition and the one which could be obtained by push forward? Ten by push forward. Push forward of T. By the pitch. Yeah, this is the same or not. This is the end of the talk. The aim of the talk is actually to connect this teacher. And you will see that essentially the equation that I'm writing there is precisely taking into account what is sent. The point is that your definition can be given a priori only if you have a problem, right? Only if you have a flow, right? Only if you have an even vector smooth vector field in which you have the flow, next kind of thing. This is completely general. As soon as B is defined for T and boundary of T almost everywhere, discontinuous, whatever, I mean measurable, but defined almost everywhere expected, we can give it this. This one, yes. As soon as please define T almost T and boundary of T almost everything. But your definition does not. No, the point is that this definition that I'm giving to you is slightly cheating. And I mean, I don't like personally this way of defining things because it's rather abstract, right? I mean, you you can easily hardly say what's what is the meaning of this object? The meaning of this object? The reason behind these, so first, as I said, this is well defined physically, even in our even for low regularity vector fields. But the point is that, maybe let me state this as a remark. So you have a notion of the derivative for smooth forms, right? We all studied it. And the... Right, so if you have a function, the lead derivative of a function in a direction is the direction. Of a function in a direction is the directional derivative. If you have a form, you want to mimic this, you want to obtain a similar definition, and there is this notion of the derivative, which is usually defined in terms of the flow of B. You measure how the form changes along the flow of B, and you sort of take the infinitesimal values. But it turns out that there is a very nice formula by Eddie Cartan that allows you to express this lead derivative, which is pretty much. Express this lead derivative, which is pretty much an analytical object, just as a combination of exterior derivative, exterior differential and contraction operators. And it turns out that if you, so the formula is something like if you have a form omega and you take a lead derivative, you can express it the contraction operator apply the omega and take the differential plus first take the differential and then contract it. And if you And if you take this as the definition of the d-derivative, and if you use just the duality, you end up with this definition. So this is just to say that there is some consistence between the definitions that are there. Good question. Yes. How does this compare with the usual u.red u or rather give u tensor u names? Can I write it down here and I'll play? Because now I think most of the answers. Because now I think the most of the answers are containing the equation that I'm writing right now, because I have all the ingredients, okay? So I have this uh literary of the object. And the geometric transport equation, I can maybe change also. So if I now have a path of k-current, I can write down these areas. Sorry, can I ask for one line? Please hard to see the red on green. Alright. Bad idea of mine. Okay. Okay. Partial derivative of t d plus the d derivative of t is equal to The d-derivative of dt is equal to zero. If you want, we can also couple this with a range of numbers. This is the way, so this is the geometric transport equation, and this is a way of expressing the transport of currents of a k-current along a given direction. And how this connects, let me answer these two questions. So, first. And maybe I can erase the problem to get them wrong. Exactly. So, there is a consistency first with these two. First, with these two models, in the sense that if you write down what this lead derivative, I mean, if you write down the coordinate expression, this lead derivative n dimension 0, so this is from our number 1. And so for k equals 0, you really obtain the continuous equation because t being a zero current. Tt being a zero current, it's a zero vector-valued measure, so it's a scalar measure, so it's the continuity equation for the dynamic pass of measures. For K equals B, you obtain the transport equation, because a K top-dimensional current is basically just a standard field, multiple of the standard for B. And well, what happens if, say, k is equal to one, well, you obtain either the divergence of V tensor B minus V tensor V or B minus B tensor of E, or the equation that Amit was presented to us. So the connection to the equation would be something like V and V T. Say if T is V, yes we expect V times the veg, this would be something like Vt plus the divergence of V tensor V minus V tensor V equal to G. All curve of V tensor V by V tensor V. Of E tensor. So it seems fitting, right? I mean, it's the sort of generalization to intermediate dimensions of these transport models for masses, for mass distributions, and for scalar fields. And you were asking, Adolfo, what's the meaning of this equation? What's the meaning of this derivative? And I think that this is best. And I think that this is best expressed if you have a look at the theorem that I'm stating right now. Because the theorem will give us well positive results. It will say that if P is of certain type, you have existence in uniqueness. But actually, it does provide us also a formula for this. And this formula is fairly explicit and tells you geometrically what's happening. So the operators that you see in Maverick Stokes equation. So the operators that you see in Maverick-Stokes equations, for instance, you'd be able to recover those using this? It is the linear sign. This is the linearization. I'm sort of decoupling. Say the object that is transported, it's decoupled by the velocity that transports. Euler or Lager-Toks is decoupled, so it's non-linear. So I mean, I would be able to see this equation, which would be the linearization. The way of, I mean, the decoupled version of the equation you will have. No, because so the minus sign is different. So if you linearly have your stops, you have a plus. Oh, you mean here? I might have... I think it's the minus note. Take B to be equal to V, that time damages. Then maybe I yeah, then maybe supplus I. No, no, no, no. I think in Lavier Stokes the issue is linear momentum is really a vector value threeform. It's like a wall, like you know, nothing itself. It's like density. Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, of course, yes, I understand k equals to one, so it's just nice. But I mean, if you want, this is okay, yeah, say this is. Okay, yeah, say this is the version of not the distocks but the menu. Kind of. Because this is this would be the vorticity. With the minus sign, think of the vorticity equation. So you Any further questions? So you so the answer was no? No, I mean it's connected to the so it's it's say this is the transport of vortex lines because it's K is equal to one. Okay. Yes. So but then can I ask can you see linear eyes Navier stokes from one of your choices? I think yes for dimension one it's just the d rho by dt would think of rho as vector value. I think of rho as a three form. Of rho as a three-form. It's a volume density, right? So then think of velocity, linear momentum Ïv as a vector-value three-form. This is the thing. I know that's the standard way of thinking of it, but it doesn't fit into the dimension. Why? Divergence of rho B then is the linear momentum at that point. My complaint is that k equals 0 isn't the value to change. Maybe you can discuss that later. What about k equals k? Maybe we can postpone the discussion later. Let's go on with the talk. Okay, I think Jeff Francois makes a good point. Let's keep going. Let's give him the chance to make his point we can think of Poland speaking. Right. The theorem is, so this is say the main result of the theorem. The main result, the theorem, is precisely an existence in which result of this equation of S. So the theorem is: if you give me a linear field, sorry, give me a vector field, which is say uniformly bounded and which is continuous. And of course, when you give me normal k-current power, there exists a unique solution. There exists a unique solution to GTE in the class, so this is just a technical remark, but the uniqueness is really in the class of normal currents. And the solution is, so T T is phi T push forward T bar, where phi T is the R D is the one parameter flow generated by P. What does this mean and how this connects with Adolfo's question? So I'm not giving you the definition of push forward or very common. I mean, it doesn't matter. The idea is just follow me. If by saying, if you're If by saying if your t-bar is given by integration on a curve or superposition of curves here, so just a bunch of loops, then what this equation is saying, what are you seeing? You are seeing exactly the advection, the transport of these curves along the characteristic lines of G. Okay? So you're moving it along the stop line. And notice that this flow is well posed in its Lipschitz map because G is found on the Lipschitz, so standard Cauchy Lipschitz theory of lines. Of course, she's theory of life. And I would like to spend. Yes, I still have kind of 10 minutes, right? More or less? I'll tell you 13 minutes. Yes. Maybe just a bit. Yes, in this case, your integral curves are then K dimension. My integral curves are the curves associated with P, so they are really curves. I'm transporting curves among curves. Yeah, so if you take the initial current, it doesn't. Take the initial current, it doesn't break into lower dimensions. No, it's still, I mean, this is if you start from a heat current to technology current, and I mean. Well, it's not written. That's not. Yeah, but the push forward of a key current. I mean, I know I have not defined this, but this will stay in the same class. We have to smart distinction. Okay. The now, let me say that let me say the following. First. First, the existence side of this theorem, it's not a big deal. So it's not complicated. You can show existence actually in different ways, and it's not really the the the the we want to consider today. Uniqueness is uh a bit more delicate for some reasons that you will see in a moment. Some reasons that you will see in a moment. And also, let me add that: okay, it's very, it's kind of easy to show that this theorem will do in the smooth case, but going pushing into lip sheets, which seems the reasonably natural class to work with currents, well, that has required some time. Actually, let me thank Johan for prompting us, because he was asking the question whether you can or cannot push two lipsticks. And this is basically the answer. And this is basically neurons. I want to spend the remaining time of the talk to presenting to you a proof of this. So, proof of the uniqueness. Okay, so please trust me on this system. I want to show you the proof of the uniqueness in the case k equal to 0. So, I want to give you a proof of the uniqueness to the continuity. Uniqueness to the continuity equation in the class of sine matrix with Adips's vector. And I want to, why am I doing this? Because in this simplified zero-dimensional setting, we don't have to, I mean there is no sort of burden with the notational side of the notational business with French defaults. We'll be dealing with measures and measures without French. With measures, and measures we are very much used to work on. What's the idea behind a movie? Okay, so it is the following. I want to show that if I have a solution, so let me say first. In this case, we consider, so let me write once the equation, because I'm not really considering the absolute. I'm not really considering the absolutely continuous case. So it's a generic path of measures. Alright, so t with a given mu R. This is the continuous equation with a thermodynamic measures. And the goal is to show that mu t, so any solution, if mu t is any solution, actually mu t is the push forward of the initial measure along the flow. If I want to show this. I want to show this. Equivalently, I want so equivalently I want to show that so phi t minus 1 push forward mu t is constant. Right? So I want to show that this holds for every t. So if I push That this holds for every t. So, if I push forward, if I push forward on this side and work in the map, I want to show that this is constant and will be constant, so it was its values to zero, but the flow is zero to the identity, so and how do we achieve this? So, first, suppose V, okay, maybe let me first say before saying this, but right here. Right here. What is the meaning of this equation? What does this equality mean? Of course it's intended in the sense of this. CE is understood in the sense of distributions, which means that the partial derivative of phi in time plus b dot d d d d plus b dot gradient of phi integrated into mean t dt this vanishes for every smooth test phi and say this is phi of tx. So if I take a smooth test on the space of space-time, I have delta. Maybe this is a bit more heuristic comment. But usually in this transport business, a lot of the uniqueness proofs boil down to pick the right test. And what is the right test function here? So the right test function, okay, suppose that B is moving. Give me for a moment, another supposed piece, but consider pi of tx to be a product type test. And more precise, they suppose that it has this form. So I'm taking a particular I'm taking a particular choice, of course, considering a function alpha smooth function on time and beta test functional space. And I am considering this product, and I'm actually evaluating beta at this spot, right? The inverse of the flow phi p by phix. So if p is smooth, so is its flow. So this is a So is its flow, so this is a perfect smooth test function. And why is it the right test? It's the right test because if you do the computations, if you compute dt phi, this is something. If you compute b dot namula phi, this is something else. If you sum them up, so I'm computing the integrand over there, you obtain alpha prime. you obtain alpha prime of t beta of phi t minus 1 and x. Why does this happen? So it happens because there will be some cancellations. And if you compute these two terms, you will see that a term cancels. And why these two terms cancel? Because essentially when you are evaluating the gradient of phi in the directional derivative of phi in the direction of p, you will see by changing You will see by chain rule that you will have, yeah, the Nabla beta term, but then you will have the derivative of the flow, or numbers of the flow, in the direction of the vector. This usually cancels you take into account here in your ending case. And why is this pretty much the end of the story in this case? Well, because if you plug inside the distribution of formulation this test, you obtain that for every alpha and for every for every alpha and for every beta alpha prime of t times beta phi t minus 1 and x t of t dt vanishes, right? Which is the same as so alpha prime of t and then what we have here we have d, sorry, beta applied so we have the push forward So we have the push forward of mu t via this f, phi t minus 1, applied onto beta, and then everything elevated in t. Which is I'm reabsorbing one of these integrals inside this bracket. But this is the distributional definitions of the it's saying that the distributional derivative of these quantities, because this works for every alpha. Because this works for every alpha. So, since this works for every alpha, this is constant. Just the distribution derivative is here is constant, but since it's constant for every beta, the measure itself is constant. So, I noticed so. Phi t minus 1 sha mu t equals mu bar. I noticed. Yes. I can also give a proof which is essentially the same but look like some time by applying the formula for mu t to a test function. Test function. Yeah, you mean changing the variable at the third interval? This is what you're saying. No, no, not at the bottom. Just applying UT to a test function. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Pretty much the same thing. It's a time-localized version of this. The point is that... But it tells you that mu t is this one is a function and that not that it is unique. Well no, I mean it's like taking the difference and showing that the derivative of the difference is zero to its constant. Derivative of the difference is zero, it's constant and zero, they are equal if they are pretty much the same thing. The point is that one would like to understand this point. I mean, it's not clear. I mean, this proof is when B is proof. And can we see, I mean, what's the problem with pushing it to lip sheets? The point is, give it to us per second. So the problem is that when B is lip sheets, the flow is lip sheets. And so this phi is Lebits. And now it's not clear whether I allow to use this integrating and mu t is not necessarily absolutely continuous. So Rademarket theorem is compelling. I can, a priori, can happen that this object is not well-defined mu t almost everyone. So it's not clear how to modify this approach in order to be able to write down. Be able to write down, to have this equality to zero for Lipschitz functions. And here is where GMT, I mean, certain aspects of differentiability of Lisbon functions come into play. And where actually, I mean, you can solve this issue relying on a recent introduced tool by Alberti Marquesa. Because it happens that so The problem if B is leaf sheet then phi is only leaf sheet. Is it admissible? Say the distribution formulation, which is this one. And the answer would be yes. Actually, every function will be missible. And how is it outcome? So the point is, sir, that a star can be equivalently equivalently the written and so this is what it's the let me maybe use this so it's the derivative of phi tx in the direction one comma b of x so I'm now saying this function is a function of the space-time and then taking its derivative in the spacetime direction Derivative in the space-time. Directional derivative in the space-time, time direction one, space direction B. So what I'm saying is that from the distributional definition, actually, the only differential, I mean the only derivative you care, are the ones in the actual 1B. And so the question is: okay, is it true that specific literature, or actually every Specific Lipschitz, or actually every Lipschitz function, is differentiable with the direction of one loop almost everywhere with respect to this measure? And the answer is yes. So, okay, so say, by introducing, so by Alberti Marquesa 2016, it turns out that every Lipschitz function is Is okay, maybe let me give you, let me give a name to this measure. So say that let me call it sigma. So if sigma is the measure nu T dt, every Nipsitz function is the differentiable in the direction 1B I will start. I hope they were questioning it, so okay. Is differential in the direction of 1 V or sigma almost, say sigma almost everything. And actually, this paper, you even have an approximation result that says that basically you obtain these. Basically, if you obtain this differential, this directional derivative is obtained, can be obtained as the limit of sequence of directional derivative of the smooth approximates of so by means of this we conclude, one concludes, so let me just write a pass approximation, not really discussing this, but one concludes that Yeah so star ought also for Leech's maps. And I can actually I'm not entering into details because we don't have time unfortunately. But how do we prove? I mean what does the decomposability bundle enter into the play? It enters into play because It enters into play because if you write down the equation, if you adopt this space-time approach with the value of the conjecture, you see that basically the space-time current associated with the equation is normal. And having a normal current allows you to conclude that every Lipschitz function is differentiable, I mean that the orienting vector of the normal current is in the decomposability bundle of the measure associated with the normal current. So this was So this was very varied and and it's basically the proof that the gist behind the proof that this result by Bertimarchese is holds through in this in this case. And so this concludes the proof because I mean once you have the possibility, once you are allowed to test with Lipschitz functions, this proof goes through and this is capital of the Lipschitz setting. Let me wrap this up by just Let me wrap this up by just saying that this was the proof of the uniqueness in the k for the continuity proof. So k equals zero. The proof for generic k still hinges upon the decomposability bundle and in a slightly different way because it's what we really use in that case that we have explicit formulas for the push forward of currents. That is what we use in the case. And um and this is it. I mean I don't think I I think I'm also slightly running out of time. So uh thank you very much for your attention. Time for one short question. Oh, okay, no, something more important. Uh so in o your class of interval transform equations intermediate transform equations with that intermediate dimension gain. What are all the conserved quantities? This is a conservation law. Quantities should be conserved through the flow. What are all of these in the intermediate dimensional case? Ah, I see w so basically you're saying in the zero dimensional case it's the mass of the master here is the value of the function on what is it I don't know on a straight or not simple. Honestly, you're not simply because the point is that the um the formula for the with the push forward when you have a K when you have a true
