And our first talk is about superconductors. So please, Charlie, I give you the floor. Okay, well, first of all, thank you very much for inviting me. I'm not really a card-carrying member of this community. So I'm going to talk about some work I've done with Manas at the Flatiron. And basically, the Basically, the theme of the talk is that we're going to break the integral equation method. And then we're going to try to find out what you do when you get to a point where you cannot use integral equations anymore. But first, we'll start talking about how you might solve the problem using integral equations. So I'm going to talk about some work that's related to modeling superconductors. So, superconductors, there's a type 1 superconductor, which is what we're going to talk about today, and we're going to talk about it. About today, and we're going to talk about it in the simplest possible case. So it's static, so the fields aren't changing with time, and it's not critical, which means, so superconductivity is a, you know, it's a state of matter, and there's a phase transition to superconductivity, and it requires that the material is at a very low temperature. But less well known is the fact that it also requires that the magnetic field that the material is. That the material is in is not too strong because if the magnetic field is too strong, you also lose the superconductivity. So, of course, these materials are very important in lots of modern applications. They're used in the magnets and MR scanners. They're used in NMR. Oops, NMR. They're used in the trains of the future, which maybe exists somewhere, not in the US. And of course, the power source of the future. And of course, the power source of the future, fusion power, relies very strongly on the possibility of building very, very big, powerful superconducting magnets. But I should say that all of the superconductors that are used in these futuristic and incredible inventions are actually type 2 superconductors, which are much more complicated to model and much more complicated to discuss. And unfortunately, I don't understand type 2 superconductors well enough to say anything intelligent about them. So once again, Intelligent about them. So, once again, so non-critical means that the temperature stays below the superconducting transition and the magnetic field and the current in the material are not too strong. So the problem, of course, of course, this is the problem with superconductors is that you use them because you want to make very strong magnetic fields. And the difficulty is that when the magnetic field gets to be too strong, the thing becomes super non-superconducting, just exactly when you hope it wouldn't become non-superconducting. And this is a process called Quen. Superconducting, and this is a process called quenching, which can actually have catastrophic results. But we won't talk about that either. Okay, so what is a superconductor? So the contrary to the popular belief, a superconductor is not a material with infinite conductivity. So this notion of conductivity is the sort of the notion of ohmic conductivity, and a superconductor is not an ohmic device at all. And of course, infinite conductivity is really not a physically meaningful concept. Is really not a physically meaningful concept. So, to describe superconductors, you require a really serious quantum mechanical discussion, which we're not going to get into. But at least for type 1 superconductors, there's a very adequate macroscopic theory introduced by the London brothers, Fritz and Heinz London. And it was introduced in the 1930s. And it's really basically an empirical theory, but it's quantitatively quite correct. And it didn't have any kind of quantum mechanical justification. Any kind of quantum mechanical justification, they just wrote down equations, and the equations work. And I should point out that this paper was 1935, and the quantum mechanical theory, the so-called Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, did not appear until 1957. So certainly they didn't have a quantum mechanical justification. They just got the answer right. So this paper was very important because it gave a theoretical prediction of what's called the Meissner effect. So the Meissner effect is this amazing thing that's Effect is this amazing thing that superconductors expel magnetic fields. So, you've probably all seen this thing. You can look on YouTube. If you look for Meissner effect, you'll see these videos where you have a little wafer of superconducting material and they sit a permanent magnet on top of it and they pour liquid nitrogen on the thing. And as it cools down to the superconducting transition, what happens is that the little magnet gets pushed up into the air. And what's happened is the field, which was inside of the superconductor, was expelled. Side of the superconductor was expelled. And in the process of expelling the field, it pushes the little permanent magnet up into the air. And it's quite a stable phenomenon. It's quite an amazing thing to see. Okay, so the equations that we're going to talk about today are called the London equations. And we imagine that we have a material in a region omega, which is superconducting. Inside the material, there's an electric current, which we call J-, and a magnetic field, which we call B-. Field, which we call B minus. They're related by a constitutive relationship that replaces what would be the meaningless Ohm's law. So Ohm's law would say that J minus is sigma times E minus, where sigma is the conductivity. We'd want the conductivity to be infinite. It turns out not to be a sensible theory. And so the London equations state instead that you have these relations. That inside of the superconductor, the curl of the magnetic field is the current, which is of course just the standard Maxwell equation. The standard Maxwell equation. The non-standard thing is that the curl of the current is a constant times the magnetic field, minus one over lambda L squared times the magnetic field. And lambda L, this number here, lambda L is called the London length. In real materials, the London length is very, very small. It's on the order of 50 to 500 nanometers. So it's a very small parameter. So, the London equations predict that the current flows without the presence of an electric field. These are the only fields inside of the superconductor. There's no E minus in the static regime. The pair J minus and B minus satisfy the Maxwell equations all by themselves for a vacuum with an imaginary permittivity. So we have this minus one over lambda L squared, which means the permittivity would be basically I over lambda. permittivity would be basically I over lambda L. In the exterior region, there's a magnetic field, B, which is just a static field, and it satisfies the usual Maxwell equations. Nothing fancy there. Okay, so let's talk about the geometry. So the superconducting material lies in a region, which we call omega. We assume that the boundary of omega is either a connected set or it has two components. Now, the two component case is really the Now, the two component case is really the interesting case because it allows for a thin shell of superconducting material. And superconducting material is always used in a thin shell because, as we'll see, the theory predicts that the current will flow in a very thin region near the boundary of the material. So there's no point in having a thick piece of superconducting material because most of it is wasted. No current will flow near the boundary. Okay, so we allow for the boundary of omega. Okay, so we allow for the boundary of omega to have non-zero genus, G. And for simplicity, we're only going to talk about the case where the boundary is connected. So, in the discussion that follows, I'm going to pretend that I'm in this case that isn't that physically interesting where I just have a connected boundary. It's just easier to describe the setup in that case. There's an analogous discussion in the case where you have two boundary components, so you have a thin shell, say. It's just more complicated to describe. Okay, so in this case, there's a basis for the This case, there's a basis for the first homology group of the boundary that consists of closed curves, which we label A1 through Ag and B1 through Bg. And we call them the A cycles and the B cycles. And the difference is the following. For each A cycle, there's a surface, which we call S sub A J, such that the boundary of that surface is the A cycle, and the surface sits inside of the region. And for each B cycle, there's a surface that sits outside of the region with the boundary of that surface. With the boundary of that surface equal to Bj. So here's a simple example where I have a torus, the genus is one, we have one A cycle, we see that there, and it bounds a surface that sits inside of the torus, and we have one B cycle, that one there, and it bounds a surface that sits outside of the torus. Okay, so that's basically the geometry that's important in this problem. Okay. Okay, so to specify a physical problem, we specify the equations we're going to satisfy. So, of course, we need to give boundary conditions. As noted above, the current flows in a volume of thickness proportional to lambda L, which is to say there is no current sheet on the boundary of omega. So, now let me make a point here that when people talk about perfect conductors, which is sort of the situation, the sort of non- The situation, the sort of non-physical ohmic device with infinite conductivity, they usually assume that there is a sheet of current that flows on the surface of the device. And this is where all of the boundary conditions come from. Here's a place where superconductors are quite different from perfect conductors. In superconductors, we have to admit that the current actually flows in a thin region near the boundary, and there is no sheet of current on the boundary. And in this circumstance, And in this circumstance, the correct boundary condition is that the entire magnetic field is continuous across the boundary. So, by this, I mean both the normal and tangential components of the field are continuous across the boundary, and the normal component of the current that flows inside of this thin layer is actually zero. So, the current is going to be tangent to the boundary. And those are the boundary conditions that make sense in this problem. Okay, now. Okay, now if the boundary has positive genus, then these conditions do not specify a solution. And it's a good thing that they don't, because if they did, you couldn't really build interesting superconducting magnets. So to get a unique solution, you actually have to specify the flux of the current through the A surfaces, so the surfaces that sit inside of the region. So back here, the current flows this way, and you have to. And you have to specify how much current flows through that surface to get a unique solution. So it's the integral of J dot ds across the A cycle that has to be specified. So we call those A sub J. That's the flux of the current through the A cycle, through the surface bounding the A cycle, which by the Maxwell equation, if I did it right. If I did it right, I think I did it wrong. Let me just go back here. I did it wrong. Okay. Okay, there should be a minus lambda L squared there, multiplying that integral. I can rewrite that surface current, the current through the flux of the current through the surface as the line integral of the B field around this curve on the boundary. So the amount of circulation of the B field around. Amount of circulation of the B field around the boundary, around that curve. And you have to specify that data for each of the G cycles that define that part of the homology. Now, we can also have an incoming field so that the exterior component, the B plus, is an incoming field plus a scattered field. The scattered field is an outgoing magnetic field, which in the case here means that it behaves like one over mod X. Okay, so this is sort of a summary. We have the London equations, which describe the relationship between the B field and the current inside of the superconductor. Of course, these equations imply that the fields are divergence-free. In the exterior, we just have the magnetostatic Maxwell equations. We have our boundary condition, which says that B minus should be equal to B plus on the boundary. And I should say actually that these equations imply, and those equations imply that J minus dot n is zero. You don't actually have to make an additional assumption that follows from the other equations. And you have to specify the circulations for the B field around the boundary. Okay, so the first thing is you want to know this problem is reasonable physical problem, so it should have a unique solution. A unique solution. So that is the conditions that if all of these fluxes are zero and the incoming field is zero, then the conclusion is the B minus and J minus are zero and the B plus is zero in the exterior. So there's a unique solution. So if I specify the incoming field and the circulations, I get a unique solution. Well, if there is a solution, I have uniqueness. I haven't really discussed existence yet. So on the other hand, it's important to note that if the circular And it's important to note that if the circulations are not zero, even if the incoming field is zero, there's a non-trivial unique solution, which is, of course, not the case for a standard scattering problem. This is the situation, of course, for magnets and MRI machines and particle accelerators, et cetera. There's no incoming field. You just impose currents and they produce static fields. So, an interesting fact that you can prove using a refinement of the uniqueness theorem is. Refinement of the uniqueness theorem is that this weirdo current, J minus, which satisfies the Maxwell equations with B minus, is actually a physical current. And the way you know this is that suppose the incoming field is zero. The exterior field is given by just applying the Biosavar operator to this current, J minus. This is what produces the field in the exterior of the superconductor. So that's just a consequence of a uniqueness theorem. Okay, so what is the nature of these solutions to this equation? So we start out with the equations, we differentiate them, and we end up with these equations, which say that both B minus and J minus satisfy the Yukawa equation. And this tells you that the fields, which of course, the fields are only defined in the interior of the region. And it says that as you move away from the boundary, these fields decay exponentially. These fields decay exponentially at a rate which is determined by one over lambda L. And remember, in the physical problem, lambda l is around 10 to the minus 6, 10 to the minus 7. So these fields decay extremely fast as we move away from the boundary. But still, they're still in a macroscopic slice in which they're not zero. Okay, so here are some examples of solutions. So this is what the field looks like if lambda l is one. like if lambda l is one this is what it looks like if lambda l is 0.1 and you can see how it's very much tightened itself around the boundary of the region okay so your first impulse certainly my first impulse when trying to solve a problem like this is to try to prove that there's a Debye source representation that leads to well-posed Fredholm equations of second kind to solve for these fields. So this is the way we do it. We say, okay, we're going to represent the field. Okay, we're going to represent the field in the outside as a single layer, the gradient of a single layer, plus the curl of the single layer of a harmonic field. You need to have this term here if g is not equal to zero, because you need to get some sort of topologically non-trivial components. You need that term to get those. In the interior, we use our usual sort of somewhat complicated representation. Somewhat complicated representation where we have all these terms. We have a single layer of a vector potential, the gradient of a scalar potential, the curl of a vector potential. Now, in fact, there are only two actual scalar unknowns, R minus and Q minus, and there's a vector unknown, LH minus, which is a harmonic field. So the harmonic field actually belongs to a finite dimensional space of special fields on the boundary. Special fields on the boundary. And the two vector potentials are defined by these equations. You take the Laplacian inverse of Q minus and the gradient of that, that gives you lambda L M minus. Laplacian inverse of R minus and the gradient of that gives you minus lambda L L minus. Okay, so that's the Debye source representation. And then you have to represent the boundary conditions. The boundary conditions. So, once again, these are the general representations. You have to restrict them to the boundary, and you get equations. These are the boundary conditions. And when you work it all out, you see that you have Fredholm equations. These are the zeroth order parts of those equations. You can see minus lambda LQ minus plus Q plus over 4, Lambda L Q minus plus Q plus over 2. L q minus plus q plus over 2 minus r minus over q over 2. So this is certainly an invertible zeroth order operator. All the other terms are compact operators. So we get Fredholm equations of second kind. But here's the problem. And if we look at these equations, we see it very clearly. We see that the conditioning of this equation is going to degrade very badly as lambda L goes to zero. These two terms are just going to go to zero. Are just going to go to zero. And you could say, well, why don't I take the sum and difference of those and then divide ones by lambda l? Well, if I do that, I'm going to end up with equations that diverge as lambda l goes to zero. Now, so that's the first obvious problem, that the conditioning of this problem is going to get worse and worse as lambda l goes to zero. The other problem, of course, is the following. Suppose that my object is of size one, but the relevant physical scale But the relevant physical scale on my object is 10 to the minus 7. Well, it's pretty unlikely that I'm going to be able to actually discretize that equation and solve it in any useful way. So that's what we're going to talk about for the rest of the talk. Here are some examples where this is Monas' heroic solving. So here's where lambda L is one, Lambda L is. Lambda L is one, lambda l is an eighth, lambda l is one over 64. Things don't look all that different if you're looking on the outside. That's the magnetic field. This is the current starting to look a little different. What really is striking is what happens if you look at the cross-section of the torus. So, here is what happens. This is what the current looks like when lambda l is one. This is what the current looks like when lambda l is an eighth. And you can see that there's a little current. And you can see that there's a little current over there when lambda l is 1 over 64th, but it's barely visible. And this is about as far as you can go using, you know, a not very, very special solver. And this computation here took five hours. Okay, so what happens as lambda goes to zero in the PDE? Well, what happens is it's What happens is it's very hard to take the limit in the equation because you have this one over lambda l squared term here. But the best thing you could hope for is that the fields all go to zero in the interior. In the exterior, there's no problem. You just get the standard magnetostatic equations, which we had before. But then you get a different boundary condition. So the boundary condition now becomes this, that the normal component of the B field has to be zero, which is the The B field has to be zero, which is just exactly what you'd expect with a perfect electrical conductor. And you still have these flux conditions, which you wouldn't necessarily expect in a perfect electrical conductor. Okay, so what do we do here? So one possibility is we can take the limit of the integral equations. And actually, we did this. And in fact, you can take the limit of the integral equations. And surprisingly, again, sort of the heroic nature of the Debye source representation. The unknowns that appear in this Debye source representation actually are such that you can take limits. Every operator appearing in the integral equations has a strong limit in the L2 operator sense. You get a limiting system of equations, but the equations are no longer of second kind in the same topology as when lambda L is positive. And that's exactly what you expect. You expect the equations not to be of second kind, because you could see that the conditioning of these equations was getting worse and worse. Was getting worse and worse. Now, this means that it's difficult to show that the solutions to the integral equations converge as lambda L goes to zero and to the solution of a limiting equation. And the large part of the difficulty is that the current actually does converge to a current sheet. So the nature, the physical nature of the current is very different at the limiting value of lambda l equals zero. Okay, but nonetheless, this is the integral equation you get. You get a nice equation for b. You get. You get a nice equation for b plus. And the very interesting thing is that you can actually compute this lh plus without computing anything else using these conditions on the fluxes. Okay, but we're not going to use the integral equation for too much. So let's go on to see what you actually can do. So you can't actually use the integral equation directly as lambda l goes to zero. So what we're going to try to do is we're going to try Going to try to do is we're going to try to replace the integral equations with a system of PDEs satisfied by b minus alone. That is, we're going to get rid of j minus. And we want to get rid of j minus because we know j minus has a very singular limit. Okay, so in this instance, we're going to have to add a little bit of notation. We add a subscript to denote that the field is for the London length lambda l, and we get this equation, obviously. Obviously, which has these equations as consequences. This is just an equation for the exterior field. This is the equation for the exterior field. This is the equation for the interior field. We still have the boundary conditions and the flux conditions. Okay, so what can you do when you have a problem? Again, the PDE doesn't look too promising because it does have this coefficient here that's going to infinity or negative infinity. So, the key to the approach here is that we know what the answer has to be when lambda goes to zero. We know that the interior fields are zero, and we know that the exterior field is now the unique harmonic field in the exterior that has a vanishing normal component and the fluxes that are specified by the integrals above. Okay, so that means we're going to guess the answer, which we call an onsatz. So, to guess the So, to guess the answer, what we do is we have to use the sine distance function. So, this is our boundary. So, we just compute the distance when we make it negative in here and positive out here. So, r of x is the sine distance to the boundary. We have to define a map which takes a point in the to the closest point on the boundary. So, this is a right angle. So, the map pops. A right angle. So the map pi takes that to pi of x. And then what we do is we take our solution, b0 plus, which is the solution to the problem when lambda l is zero. And we define a divergence-free vector field, which we call beta, by just taking the field, which is tangent here and just parallel translating it out here along that straight line. That straight line scaling it by an appropriate factor. So, this is the factor you'd expect if you said, I want the thing to go to zero, like one over e to the one to the distance to the boundary over lambda l. And then you cut it off. You just have to pick some cutoff function. This thing here is not divergence-free. So, you add another term, which you can again write down very explicitly. So, there's this function e lambda l, which we just get by doing an integral. Just get by doing an integral. And again, we get a nice, perfectly explicit divergence-free vector field defined in a neighborhood of the boundary. And the take-home message is that the limiting system of integral equations allows us to solve for this B0 plus. We use the flux conditions to find LH plus here. And then we use this limiting, very standard. Very standard double layer potential to represent the rest of the field. The remainder of the approximate solution is computed explicitly by hand using this formula, using the Anzatz. And it has exactly the expected properties. And it's accurate essentially to order lambda L. That is, the difference between this solution that we've written down here by hand and the exact solution is essentially the error is ordered lambda. The error is ordered lambda L in the L2 norm. So the more remarkable thing is we can take the curl of B lambda L minus, which is approximately the curl of this beta lambda L. And this, if you look at the difference between this and the current, this actually goes to zero in the L2 norm, which is slightly remarkable because the thing is actually converging to a current sheet on the boundary. To a current sheet on the boundary. The limiting object is not L2 at all, but the difference between the two things goes to zero in the L2 norm. So it gives us, so these are sort of some of the estimates that we can prove. So here's an example where the integral equation method sort of works very well, but not in a physically interesting regime. To get to the physically interesting regime, you have to get beyond the integral equation method. You have to get beyond the integral equation method. But of course, the solution in that case is that you can actually write down the answer because this physically interesting situation is so singular that the answer is practically constant in the sense that it's practically the harmonic field on the boundary. So anyway, that's where I'll stop. Thank you. Do you have a question for Charlie? Well, I have two questions, but maybe I'll pick one. So, what are like physical observables that you would want to compute, actually, once you've done the simulation for extremely small lambda l? I think what you really like. I think what you really like to compute is the current. And you can actually write down a very explicit formula for the current. I mean, here's what I would imagine. How would you use this kind of analysis? Well, when you actually build superconducting magnets, they're not built out of sheets of material for the most part. They're built out of wires. And what I, and you kind of have to guess how to put the wires. And I think a real problem that you have is that there's. Real problem that you have is that there's a lot of force that acts between the strands of wire. When you wrap the wire, there's a lot of interactions between the strands. And I could imagine doing the following thing. You say, okay, I know the shape of the magnet that I want. Suppose I have a sheet of superconducting material that's of some thickness. I could solve the limiting problem. I could find the current. Now, of course, the current on the sheet, there's no force between the lines of the current. It's an equilibrium. The lines of the current. It's an equilibrium state. So, what I could then imagine doing is saying, okay, well, now I actually know how to place my wires so that there's a minimal force between the different strands of wire, that it's all balanced out. It's in equilibrium. So, that's what I can imagine as an application of this kind of an analysis. So, there again, I think the thing that you want to be able to do is you want to be able to compute, obviously, the field, and you want to be able to compute the current, and you want to know what the current is. Current, and you want to know what the current is. The current again is mostly localized along the boundary, but you'd like to know exactly what the field lines of the current look like. I see. Very interesting. Thanks. I mean, that's what I would imagine. If there is any application to this kind of analysis, that's what I would imagine would be a good application. So, Antoine also has a question. Yeah, and great talk, Charlie. Thanks. Great talk, Charlie. Thanks. It's a very quick naive question. Yeah, I'm confused about your scattered field. You said it goes like one over X. Well, it could. Okay, isn't the far field of a coil usually like one over X squared? Just because there are no monopoles, magnetic monopoles? Yes, yes. Okay, so the scatter field is different, I guess. No, no, no, no, no, it's probably one over X. I was just being. Okay. I was being. Okay. I was being yeah, one of X is enough, is what you're saying, basically. Okay, thank you. Yes, thank you. Okay. Any other quick question? We are on time, but I guess we can take one more question if there is one. We have one in person. Okay. So, Charlie, you said the L2 difference of these curls is small. Yes. Is the point-wise error small? Point wise error small? I don't think I could prove that. You know, it's very hard to prove. So the estimates that are on the screen, these one, the square root, the difference, actually, I don't have the error estimate there. Do I have an error estimate? Well, right. So what I could prove, here's the error estimate. I could prove that the L2 norm of I could prove that the L2 norm of the difference between the current and the curl of beta L, beta lambda is lambda L to the alpha for an alpha less than one. Okay, that's not enough to prove a pointwise estimate. Okay. Okay, but on the other hand, you know, that's probably a failure of the analysis. It's just a very singular problem, and it has to. Problem, and it has to do with the ensatz. The details of the ensatz make it hard to prove. I think, actually, probably the optimal result is this estimate here with alpha equal to a half. And that's probably as good as you could prove. But I would imagine that the current looks very much like the curl of beta lambda. Okay. Point wise and everything. Okay, because that's still usable as it is. Yes, yes. Oh, absolutely. The concern might be that the current. Absolutely. The concern might be that the curl picks up a factor of one over lambda or something. But that doesn't happen. So that's good. Yeah. Right. Thank you. Sure. Thank you. I think it's now time to move to the next talk. So let's thank Charlie again.
