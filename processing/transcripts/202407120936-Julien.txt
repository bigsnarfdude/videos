Okay. Perfect. Hello everyone. For this blue telepathy. I'm Lorenzo. I'm currently a pub doc on the team of Anime Colonial Design, the University of Aritit√©. And I'm working on the jellyfish. And in particular, I'm working on the transport inside the gas transport network of the jellyfish during the development process of the goal of the jellyfish. The goal of the GPS. So, this project is inside a bigger project about the stability of groups. I didn't put that, but it's an HFS3 project. And this project is about the stability of groups. We can also say the directionality of the flow inside systemic circulation under pulsativity. So, there are two types of animal models, mammalia, introducing uh these drugs in Belgium. Of these drones, Belgium, and jellyfish in the team of Cornell Sen. And the third team working on this project is the team of Elenique Robin. And they do some modelization, reduced order modelization of these two types of circulation. About the jellyfish, so you've already heard two times about the jellyfish, but the gastrovascular network that you can see here. Network that you can see here is here to be able to transport nutrients to do the digestions and to remove waste from the network. Okay, so here you can see the life cycle of a jellyfish. So it's a bit complicated, but at the beginning you have a small polyp. This small polyp creates some bumps, like that, boom, boom, boom, boom. And these bumps, after a bump, These bumps, after a long time, became some plates, and after the tribulation, those plates became a small avi rap that is the larva state of the jellyfish. And I'm looking at the growth between this larva stage to the adult stage. So here you have the larva, the juvenile, and here an adult. And you can see the network here with at the beginning. Network here with at the beginning you have unconnected channel like that, then it connects, and at the end you have this highly reticulated network. Here we look at the flow inside just one channel, unconnected. So there is many things to say about what I think what happened here, but I want to stress out that you have some particle movement out that you have some particles moving, it's food particles, and they are moving in two directions. You can see here like that or here like that. Okay, that is for the small FR, but if you think about the circulation in the big jellyfish, you can understand that it could be a bit complicated to transport the food and a bit inefficient if you still have this two way of securing. Two ways of circulation inside. So that's why everything looks. Okay, so you have a big loop here, and you can see that as a bit like the arterial circulation and then the venous circulation. And so it goes here and then it comes back here. And you have also some loops inside this reticulated network. More precisely, what's happening when the jellyfish is moving or eating? You have a small food is here, it's a small shrimp. Then you have the oral arms who will get the food at the border of the jellyfish. Then it goes through the overarms like that, so in this direction, and dun dun. And you have four o'er arms, two with a four stomach. With a four stomach. So when it goes here, it enters into the stomach, then it goes through a very straight canal like that, to the marginal canal here, and then it comes back into the center and get exposed from the network. Okay, so I talked to you about the loops, but what about the pulsativity? Because we observe some pulsativity inside the canal, and to observe that. Kennel and to observe that we do some in vivo observation. Yes, it works. So here you have some food particles moving inside the network. I will replay the video. Okay. Uh what we basically do is to put the jellyfish lying on the back and to observe it with a bright field microscope and I feel it. Microscope and high-from it camera, and you can see here the full jellyfish, it's a juvenile, and here a zoom on something. You have to squeeze it almost just like that. No, it's a it's stuck. You just remove the water upside down there. Yes. Okay. Okay, okay. He doesn't really like it, but after It but after it's not changed when we when it came back into the aquarium it's it's okay. Yeah, at the beginning it's cool and then so it seems to be okay scanning. Okay, so but as you can you have seen, uh the the canals uh move a bit. So what I do to observe the fruit side I Do to observe the flow inside, I stabilize the image to only have the canal in the middle, and then I am able to do some particle tracking velocimetry where I can follow one particle. It could be a bit tricky because it's an aggregate of particles, and when it goes into the channel, it's digested through a change of shape. Okay, but it works. And so we can have the track. And so we can have the track of one particle here, for example, and we can have the velocity in time of this particle. We clearly see a pulse density. Okay? And what you surprise, this pulse activity is correlated to the contraction of the jellyfish. Okay, here what you see is the deformation applied on the image for the stabilization and it corresponds to where you have to move the image, it corresponds to contraction. So it's perfectly Contraction. So it's perfectly correlated. Okay. So that's the velocity of the food particle, yes. Exactly. And the contraction, do you just visualize them with the camera or do you measure them somehow? No, what I see here is when I do the stabilization of the imager, because I have to make a to change the scale of the major, when I have to change it, that means that there is a movement that corresponds to contraction. Correspond to contraction. So we have a system where the pulsatility inside the vessels come from the outside. We can see because it's not a system with a pump like the vascular systems. The pulsatic comes from the contraction. So when the jellyfish move like that, you can perhaps not really clearly see it, but when there is a contraction, But when there is a contraction, vessels are deformed like that. There is an elongation and a narrowing of the vessels, and at the relaxation, it comes back to its place. It's like a peristaltic movement where you deform the vessel, you okay? And we think that it creates a the circulation. And what is also very specific to the jellyfish is that it's an open system. So really the flow can open Really? The flow can open, it goes out, uh it's not uh it's not what do you mean the the the what it's inside the channels? It was it's not a MOOC, but I mean it can go out and water come in or what? What I mean by that is that you have um it's not yes, it's uh yeah, there is water coming in, you come here, but it ca there is only one entry, one one input and one output, so it comes comes out. It comes out and then it goes out. It comes in and it comes out. I mean, that's the same thing. It's not the same like a moccus, it's like a viscoelastic fluid, so it's not like it's water that can be replaced. Yes, but what I think, but I can't talk to you about that later, is that when the water goes in, it became mucus. It is not the mucus that enters the muscle. Yes, exactly. Yes. When it touches the cells of the juice, we don't know exactly what it's C, it's cannot be just spoon. Yeah? C, yeah. Or C. Ah, yeah, yeah, you're scrolling my finger. Okay, okay. I come to this slide. Yes, yes, yes. What we do also is to anesthetize the jellyfish because it's a bit complicated when they don't start to move. And also because it was interesting to see what is the velocity of the flow inside the cube with and without anesthetic. Yes? No? No? Sorry. Okay, then. Okay. And uh when there is a when there is no contraction, we clearly see that the velocity is decreased. So clearly the contractions have an important impact on the flow created inside. And those contraction comes from the the big movement comes from the contraction of the different muscles. And I just want to stress out I just want to stress out a bit that the the position of the muscle is not uh equal equal on all the areas of the jellyfish, so it's non-homogeneous. Okay, and perhaps, but we don't know, it could explain also why when we look at the deformation of the tissue of the jellyfish when the jellyfish swim, it's not a homogeneous leisure. Here, okay, I will not explain this in detail, but okay, when the jellyfish stream is not homogeneous, and it's important because the deformation applied on the tissue are the deformation applied on the canals, and so it impacts the flow. So, this was preliminary research on the thesis of Solan. And now I'm currently working on a new experiment I set up to be able to Experiment I set up to be able to put different cameras around an aquarium and to be able to visualize in a 3D with a different camera the swimming movement of the jellyfish, this aquarium. So different view, okay. And the idea is to be able to construct the surface of the endodir, where is the where are the canals. And if we do that, we hope that we can be able to measure Be able to measure what deformation is applied on the network and so what is the extension of the different kernels during the movement. Okay. But this project is, I already told you, is in collaboration with the team of Eleni, and they are currently working on a model of periostatics where it's not compared to previous models, it's not only the area who changed it, it's also the lengths and both. It's also the length in both change. And if we combine it with a network model of the network of the jellyfish, we just simplify it because of the radial symmetry we can only take three different channels. And so I will go very quickly, but they do some modalization and when they apply interphase contraction to the different uh canals. So Different canals, so like that, it's completely in phase. They observe that no net flux is transported. So it could be explained by the scalup theorem when you have a low random number. When you apply something like that, it became at the same position without being without movement, but it's a low random number. But okay, so. Okay, so that means that we need to break the symmetry somewhere. And if we do that without a phase contraction, like that, so we consider that the movement is more like that. So it's not just like that. I don't know if it's very clear. But if we do that, we have a small net flux. So that really means that to be able to create flow in this network, we have to break the symmetry somewhere. So we look at Somewhere. So we look a bit at that. When we look at the movement of the jellyfish, we clearly see that it's non-homogeneous. You have some wave of contraction from here that could be different. Okay. And on the border, also, okay. You clearly see the waves. Yeah. I don't know if you see them. Yes. Yes. Season? Yes, okay. Um even when the jellyfish is lying on the back, we clearly see that it's unhomogeneous. So it could explain also this break of symmetry and the origin of the flow inside. But okay. As I said, it's not only that. Inside the cilia there is some inside the vessel there is some cilia. Not so much, it's not a very dense It's not a very dense network of cilia, if we can see that. They are very sparse, but they can clearly, I think we can see them, so they could probably act on the flow. If on a nanostatic jellyfish we look at carefully, we can clearly see some particles moving like that. And we can measure the position of those particles and see that the frequency and The frequency and the beating distance. I don't know if it's the exact word, but the one 20 micrometer, and it could really correspond to what we see here to this length of cilia. So cilia are there, and we know that in the embryo and things like that, the cilia plays an important role to break the symmetry. So it could be the same in So, it could be the same in this system. And still, about the cilia, we also observe a double circulation. Even when loops are created, here you can clearly see in this connect that there is particle moving up and moving down. And we have the impression that the direction is quantified in the height of the canals, like that. And it could be also explained by the presence of the Explained by the presence of the cilia. The first person joined about that was first from, but it's a very old. That's the only paper about the circulation inside the date. It's from, you can see the date. Okay. And it was camera obscura, so okay, we don't have much because I told you that I was looking also at. Told you that I was looking also at what happened during the development. We can see that during the growth, the contractions are changing. If we look at a jellyfish like that, so you can see we can plot it. But it's cool. It's cool to look, but uh Okay, okay, okay. Yes, okay. So I will do the by hand if I find again so we can plot um plot I lost yes we can plot the beating frequency in function of the size of the jellyfish here is the size in centimeter and we can observe at different stages of the development here they are very small and they beat like that okay so the beating for So the beating frequency is increased. Okay. And when they are older, you can clearly see that it's poor. Okay. The frequency is decreasing. Okay. Okay, sorry. Okay. I'll finish quickly. Want to see the cuts? It's the size, yes, in centimeter. Okay, what I think is that the beating frequency can be related to the flow inertia in the system, but because for the very small jellyfish, when you put them laying on the back, very fast you can see the decrease of the flow inside, and all the food is getting hard, but for the whole jellyfish, it takes a lot of time, so the inertia is increased for big jellyfish. For big jellyfish. So, could it explain the relation between the size and the swimming frequency? I don't know, but perhaps. Okay. And okay, so it's really... Okay. What I want to look at though is the trajectory of particles for when we look at a jellyfish without the connection with and uh with a large jellyfish with a a highly reticulated network. Highly reticulated network. And for the very small jellyfish, we can see that there is two different circulations, and the trajectory of the particles are not so much synchronized. But when we look at a big one, we can clearly see that I only look at the relaxation state. So it's not a contraction that you see here, but without contraction, we can clearly see here that the trajectory of the particles. Of the particles seems to be synchronized and very straight. We cannot see anymore the silia beating. Okay, so is there a relation between I'm so sorry, but there. Okay, it will stop at a moment, but you have micro one minute? Yes, okay, okay. Yes, okay, okay. Is there a relation? Okay, and probably between the installation of the loops and the synchronization of the particle inside the big channels. Okay, and as Eugenia said, we don't know any much We don't know any much things about what is uh flowing inside the canals, so it's probably a viscoelastic field. If we look at that, it's not only seawater, okay, but we have no measurements, so we want to do that with also deformation, measurement of the deformation during the screening. And I also want to put some micro bits inside the canal because we only have some particles, and when we are lucky, there particle and when we are lucky there is particle on the left and on the right of the canals but to have some more systematic measurements and have the velocity profile it could be cool to add some micro bits and I'm doing a few very strange things not so good for the jellyfish I pin them out on PDMS to look uh to be able to look the the what happened in the canals. what happened in the cannabis, but with the whole contraction. But okay. Okay, Christine. I have two quick questions. The first thing, so if I properly understand, inside the channel you have a stratified flow. So it's like a bidirectional flow, but it's not like the tide that is high and low, high and low, but it's more like But it's more like an eyeway where things look like that. Yes, but it's hard to see because I changed the focus to be able to see if I can measure the at which high it changed the direction, but it's really not precise to do that. But okay, because I was wondering if it is related to some density differences. Okay, perhaps. Um okay, perhaps. I don't know. I I'm not sure about that because uh I don't have the impression that it's more dense. But perhaps the mucus is different or I don't know. And the second one, very quickly, it is related that this construction and the flow inside the vessels of the swimming of the jellyfish, right? So do you have an idea of the Reynolds number of the Of the Reynolds number of the jellyfish, not inside the vessel, but of the because, for example, from a fluid mechanics perspective, if you have a fish or if you have a very, very, very, very small fish, depending on the Reynolds number that they have, it changes completely the time of it has a chance of also. When you see the bidirectional flow in a normal pages, how wide is that tube? Um so the full uh jellyfish is uh 0.5 centimeters. So the tube itself is what? 50 microns, 100 microns? Yes, uh I I don't remember exactly, but uh yes, it's uh on the order of hundred microns, I think something like that. Microsoft so is it smaller than the old ones is it smaller much smaller than the one with the mature jet yes at this stage yes but after a moment when it grows the the adra del canet seems to don't change so much the of size no not not sorry that's that's that's what They grow like the children. I have the impression, but you should show me that they grow as the children's growth. But maybe as dissecting the same also. We can continue in the COVID break. Thank you.  When you come to the bucket now, right now, when you come to the bucket, it's the same specification. So, what kind of addicts that are good pointing at the screen's like here, and it's like comes up, and then like one of the tons of it. It expands kind of so. So the highest part of the past two. But my plan is to just have one. Oh, yes, that's right. Well, it does the key. So you know, it does that. It does relate to the screen. It doesn't. Yes, very well. So if it's a ball screen, I can just do that point. Yes, if we now make it here, you can just have a, for example, in time one it goes this way, and then in this way, and then time two it goes up here, out here and this is always a diverse. And we were discussing with the minimal loop is like done topologically and not like something simple like is there a fundamental reason why you should wait for two? You see something interesting? It's a more complex model, I remember. Good, real I mean real life is like much more complicated than topologically this is different from from this, right? Logically, this is different from this, right? Well, two engines instead of three. Thank you. I think that's a good question. I guess it's because my template looks like this, where there's really no scale to. There's no two-note flues. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You never see two-node floops. So now, it would be very fine to just make the zero, like, just add more loads. The zero, like just add one float here, and then have that as part of the solution. That's one problem. And we include many, many, many. No, no, no. This is very different. I saw an image of it. Yeah, like, wrong, sorry, sorry. Okay, so let me show you these. So, predicting I think frequently. Oh my god, I'm not. Oh my god. Do you have a charge like this? The problem is your wife is there. At home. I have it in my room. I just got apparently when I switched off the light it was not on close the charger so I was thinking it was charged and now I need it for the chronometer of the you can use my phone if you want to know what it might be it might be that it's the computer itself is not like the Yeah, that's the size that would be power. I think so. It's the only thing. I don't see it. So let me tell you this. So basically, I do have a network, but we compare the 200 mammals. We have the frequency as a function of body weight. Like 10 moment. Type of ST, but this is real data of two hundred mammals, because at two hundred mammals. And then I do my uh these folastic uh vessels. Uh vessels so they can contract and and then I have hotel flow. Can you explain it? What kind of photo? No, no, it's only like a project network. I love you, Elena. Thank you. So thank you very much. So I basically have, but you can put a name at work and then you will have a different resonance for all of them. So I put the blood rheology, like the experimental blood rheology, into the model. And then, of course, I have to define how is my network, right? Like I have to say how the lengths as a function of radius grow, because this is like a vascular system. So I have to put in the geometry of the network. But then I calculate this response of the network. Of the network of two external forcing. So, this is frequency and this is how it responds. Okay? So, basically, it will tell you, this function will tell you whether you have more or less flow, like here, roughly speaking. This is for two different animals, not species. This is a localized pump, right? Model is for a localized part, and then there is one for the network, right? Would it be different? Because the jellyfish is very different. It's very different. Yes, but we can test that anyway because I have a let me just yeah, I know it doesn't have a centralized part, but basically I am seeing how is the response of the whole thing to positivity. So here is the animal frequency, the 2100 animal frequency, as a function of the radius of the organ. This is experimental. Radius of the order. This is experimental data. And this is our model. So, our model in which the frequency that minimizes the resistance to flow as a function of the size of the larger vessel in the system. So it's similar to what you have because you have frequency as a function of body size. But body size will scale with the largest vessel in your system. Vessel in your system. So, I mean, of course, you have three points. It would be ridiculous now a logo of scale to tell them the slow rate. But you need to put more points. But what I am saying is that maybe I can help producing the explanations. That would be cool now. Yeah, but now the external comp anything, so they don't have to be. How would it go? It's just that you know. It's just that, you know, for linear cases, it's almost independent of the boundary conditions. Like I have a relation between flow and pressure radiant, but you can think between flow and external force. And this thing that it's in the middle, in the linear case, it's independent of whether you don't force it for whether the force you each. Yeah, it's independent if you are putting flow, if you are putting pressure, if you are putting on two sides, or if you are putting only on one side, if you are doing shear homogeneous in all directions. So it will tell you just like what is the, it's an elastic system, right? You have viscosity in the vessels and you have viscosity and elasticity in the fluid. So it's like the combined. So it's like the combined response of the two things. So I think it will be independent of how you try. So there's a few try, but the complications is that there in the equations for the pressure, you have P minus the external and then the pressure, let's say, and then you have P, the pressure of the vessel minus the external is equal to the tension of the vessel. To the tension of the vessel war, right? And in our case, the big external is time-dependent.
