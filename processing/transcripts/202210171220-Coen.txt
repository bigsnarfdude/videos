Oh, well, thank you very much for that very kind introduction. And it's great to be here. Thanks for organising this, particularly Anya. It's wonderful to be with a community of like-minded scientists who are interested in the same issues of growth and morphogenesis, which is the so it's wonderful to hear that concentration of interest. The session will finish the discussion sessions later on. The discussion sessions later on, probably too late for me. So, Daniel Cosgrove has kindly agreed to chair discussions that might follow on from this, should people wish to continue discussing. So, thank you, Daniel, for volunteering to do that. What I thought I would do in this session is use it as an opportunity to kind of talk about some basic principles of growth so that really everyone is on the same page. Everyone is on the same page, and we can kind of. I'm hoping that this will be useful for the discussions that follow. I'm just going to get my laser pen going. So what I'm going to do is start with three questions, or rather, I'm going to try and cover three questions. After each question, I'm going to say a little bit and then open it up for discussion and then come back to the next question. So hopefully that will allow people to get engaged in. To get engaged in these different issues. So, the first one is a kind of basic issue: what is the mechanical basis of growth? And a good place to begin with that is in the world of elasticity. So, I'm just trying to move your faces. Yes, all these objects obey the laws of elasticity, and it's the laws of elasticity that allow them to keep their shape. Their shape. But the stiffness of these different objects varies from one to the other. And a good place to begin in terms of understanding the principles of growth is by applying elasticity theory to the fibers or the microfibrils, cellulose microfibrils in a cell wall. So if we consider a microfibril, it's under what I'm going to call fiber tensile stress. So if we imagine a tensile force being applied across the fibril, which is coming from the Turger pressure. Which is coming from the Turger pressure in the cell, then that causes this microfibril to stretch by a certain amount, delta L. And the fiber tensile stress is the force divided by the cross-sectional area of the fiber, and the strain is the proportionate change in length of the fiber. And we have the Hookian law that strain is equal to fiber tensile stress divided by E, where E is the Young's modulus. Now, the great thing about this elasticity equation is. thing about this elasticity equation is that it means that we can measure stress very simply from the strain of the fiber or anything that's associated with the fiber. And that's illustrated with this little movie here. So what I've done is my spring here represents my fiber or microfibril and my elastic bands, which are much weaker, represent the plasma membrane. And if this is the top of the spring and the bottom of the rubber band, and if I now apply weight to that. And if I now apply weight to that spring, okay, then it stretches, and the strain in the plasma membrane, the elastic band, is the same as in the microfibril. So we can use strain, say the stretch of a cell to measure the stress in a microfibril. Okay, so if we now have two of these fibers together, then we end up with twice the cross-sectional area and fibre. Area and fiber, this tensile stress is halved, the strain is halved, but the equation still remains the same. Now, so in other words, the tensile stress in the fiber drops as we increase fiber number. Now, this all assumes we're in the elastic world, which is essentially a reversible world. So, if I remove the force, then everything snaps back, shrinks back to its original length. However, plants clearly do not grow in that way because if I stop watering a plant, Because if I stop watering a plant, it doesn't shrink back to the size of an egg, it wilts. Okay, so almost all the growth of a plant is irreversible. And so the question is, how does irreversible growth happen? So for that, we need to move away from the elastic world into a different world, the world of irreversible creep, which is essentially deformations, irreversible deformations that arise by the consistent application of a force over a longer period of time. So that the shape. Period of time so that the shape of your shoes, for example, changes with wear, the shape of jeans gradually stretched, the leaning tara pisa gradually falls over. And so all of these things are a result of shifts that occur over a longer period of time through the process of creep. Now, how do we explain creep? So in terms of our fibers, if we go back to our fibers and we now have, imagine our fibers are stuck together with an interface showing this. Stuck together with an interface showing the cyan colour. And we apply our force to a leftward force to the top fiber and a rightward force to the bottom fiber. Then we'll end up with the change in length relative to a single fiber, which is roughly as before, the delta L over 2, where delta L is what you would get for a single fiber. The tensile stress is as before, is approximately equal to the force divided by the twice the cross-sectional area of the fiber. We have this extra interface, but let's assume that's. This extra interface, but let's assume that's small, and we again obey Hook's law that strain is equal to tensile stress divided by E. But suppose now that adhesion between our fibers is not complete and that it allows some slippage. What happens then? Well, now we have an interesting situation. Now, the length of this fibre or the length of the overall structure, which we're going to call the wall, which is the entire structure, increases with time as the With time as the fibers slip past each other. So there's no longer a fixed strain for a given tensile force, tensile stress. The strain is increasing with time. So although the fiber tensile stress is roughly the same as before, at least in the middle of our section, strain is increasing with time. So wall strain is no longer equal to fiber stress divided by E. Hooke's law does not apply because we have one varies and one is roughly fixed. And we can illustrate. Roughly fixed. And we can illustrate that with our springs. So here we're going to have the same situation, but now in this situation, we've got two springs stuck together. Now, in this case, not simulation, this demonstration, they're stuck together with double-sided cellotape. So they're firmly stuck together. So it's like this is the situation where you have strong adhesion and the top of the microfibril stretches by the same amount as the plasma membrane or the elastic. The membrane or the elastic band. But if now we instead of using double-sided sellotape, we use honey to stick these two things together. So I'll just let this thing show you what's going to happen. I hope you can anticipate vaguely what's going to happen. We're going to stick another spring on there with now, but now we're just with honey. Now, yep, now we've. Now, yep, now we put the elastic bands. Now we put the weight. And now you see, because of the sliding, the strain in the plasma membrane in the elastic band is no longer equal to the stress or the strain in the individual microfibrils or springs. Okay, so we no longer have that relationship. So we can no longer measure stress using strain in. Stress using strain in the same way as before, we have a different type of relationship. And we have a different type of stress. We talk about the shear stress, which is the force divided by the area of the interface. So that's the longitudinal area of this entire interface, which defines the shear stress. And the strain, instead of a strain, we have a strain rate, which is the rate of change in length over time. And for a simple linear case, we could have that the strain rate is the shear stress minus a slip threshold. Stress minus a slip threshold, which is the threshold at which slippage starts to happen, divided by how strongly these things are stuck to each other, stuck together. So, now if we use this notion and we go to a cell wall, we imagine now we have lots of these microfibrils, fibers overlapping with each other above a plasma membrane. If we now, this wall is under tension. I'm just going to talk about one-dimensional growth here. If the wall is under tension due to Tugger, it stretches, and as a consequence of that, the wall is. Stretches, and as a consequence of that, the wall is going to get thinner. And therefore, you need to have new fibers and new matrix synthesized in order to restore the thickness. So, in this way, through the slippage, the wall gets thinner, but the wool is homeostatically reinforced by fibers on the inside, and therefore you can maintain thickness. So, what does this achieve? It means that we have growth is essentially through creep, which is this slow process which depends on the turbine. Process, which depends on the Turger, the adhesion, the slippage threshold, and the microfibril number that are resisting the force. And then we have mechanical stiffness, which is the fast response of the tissue to deformation, which is dependent on the Turga keeping everything under tension, the stiffness of the individual microfibrils, and the microfibril number. So, on that note, I'm going to finish with my first section to just see. Maybe I stop sharing here. Here and to open up the disc to see: are we all happy with that? Are there issues and so forth? So, questions? Questions for Rico? Maybe I'll start with one. So, Rico, that's a very interesting topic. And I'm wondering if there's any non-linear relationship. Non-linear relationship between the length of the cellulose in your one-dimensional model and the adhesive force between that cellulose. Because cellulose is not always completely flat and straight. And there's some debate in the literature about whether cellulose twists or doesn't twist in the cell wall. So if you model cellulose as something that's twisting versus not twisting, the adhesion force between the cellulose just achieved by hydrogen bonding might actually differ. might actually differ somewhat based on the length and the sort of habit of the cycle. So I'm wondering if you're considering those things. Well, thank you for that question. Who is it that's asking the question? Because I can't see. Who is the questioner? I'm Charlie Anderson from Penn State. I'm a colleague of Dan Cosgrove. Okay. I was going to say you should ask. I was going to turn the question over to Dan Cosgrove because it's not really, I'm not really modelling the cell wall. I'm just trying to. Modeling the cell wall, I'm just trying to convey an oversimplistic view to get a sense of the basic principles. But you're right. I mean, it's a gross oversimplification. And maybe, I don't know whether Daniel wants to comment, but given that you work with him, it's a kind of weird thing to ask. Yeah, so there's a lot of unknowns in the lateral interactions between cellulose microfibrils in the actual cell wall. And even in wall and even even in you know in vitro situations it's it can be complex so short answer is uh it's uh product probably pretty difficult to model that because there's a lot of primary empirical data that it's not yet known. You can do it, people have done it, and you can get ad hoc measurements, for example, sort of high-level measurements by measuring the adhesion. The energy of interaction between cellulose nanocrystals, and from that, getting estimates of the energy. So Yao Zhang will probably be talking a little bit about that tomorrow morning on the coarse grain model. In the real situation, in the complex cell wall, there's probably multiple levels of interaction and Levels of interaction, and probably the key thing is to find out which ones are the most limiting, which ones are the strongest interactions and that are limiting for the creep process. So there could be interactions that are so strong that Creek never happens between cellulose microfibrils. There could be interactions that are so weak that it's never limiting for the Creep process. And then the Goldilocks principle, the ones that's right in the middle there are the ones that are physiologically, developmentally limiting the rate of the Creep process. Limiting the rate of the create process. Thank you. I wonder whether I should move on to the next section. If there are questions, we can come back to them. Is that okay? Yeah, you know the length of the other question of the other part, so I do. I do. Hold on. However, my Hold on, however, my slideshow isn't working, which is bizarre. Oh, I can't see, but that's going to be very difficult for me. Hold on, how am I going to do this? I think I have to escape from my PowerPoint. Oh, I can't escape. Hold on. And I'm going to try and end the show. Okay. Okay. Right. I'm hoping you can still see my slides. Yes. We can see it. It's just not that presentation on. Okay. Now I need to move you out of the way and I'm going to start the slideshow. Okay. All right. So here's my next question. For a 2D wall, how is growth orientation related to stress orientation? Now, let's consider a piece of Let's consider a piece of 2D wall in which we have an equal number of fibers or microfibrils in two directions. So we have the blue direction here and a red direction orthogonal to that. And we have an equal number of microfibrils in each direction. And there's an equal force. It's an isotropic force. Osmotic pressure is isotropic. It's being stretched equally in both directions. And so we have the relationship that the microfibril tensile stress is the full. Is the force divided by the number of microfibrils in a cross-section resisting that force multiplied by their cross-sectional area? Now, that's one type of view. Now, another type of view is what we call a continuum view, where we forget there are individual microfibrils and we just think of the wall as a continuum. And in this case, again, we have in this case, the force, the wall tensile stress is the force divided. The wall tensile stress is the force divided by the cross-sectional area of the wall. And this is going to be equal in both directions. The force is equal in both directions. So, again, we end up with equal stress in both directions. And the net result is that growth is going to happen equally in both directions when these forces exceed the slippage threshold or the stress exceeds the stress, the slippage threshold. But now, let's see what happens. But now let's see what happens when we look with an anisotropic wall. Okay, so now we have twice as many blue microfibrils as red microfibrils. So what happens in this situation? Well, red microfibril tensile stress is force divided by, since we've only gone one layer, NAF, as before, but now blue microfibril tensile stress is halved, all right, because we've got twice as many microfibrils in this direction. So and growth. So, and growth is going to happen in the direction, preferentially in the direction, in the red direction, because there are fewer microfibrils to resist the force in that direction. They're going to be under higher tensile stress, higher shear stress. And so that's where you're going to end up with growth. So growth will occur preferentially in the red direction. Now, let's think about it in terms of a continuum view. Now, actually, Wall's tensile stress is equal in both directions. Unlike the microfibrils, which were where stress was unequal. Which were where stress was unequal in the different directions. Wall tensile stress is exactly the same in both directions because the cross-sectional area is the same in both directions. What's different now is the Young's modulus, all right? So the Young's modulus, when we pull on this wall, we're going to feel more resistance in the blue direction. It's going to feel stiffer in the blue direction because there are more microfibrils than in the red direction. So in this case, what's happening is that growth will go preferentially in the direction of least Young's modulus. Least Young's modulus. All right, whereas from the fiber point of view, growth is happening in the direction of maximal tensile stress, of maximal fiber stress. Okay, so with that notion, now let's go and look in something like a cylindrical cell. Now, in a cylindrical cell, you can show by various arguments that the circumferential wall stress is twice the axial stress. Okay, so if we look at, oops, so if we look at the We look at, oops, sorry. If we look at our piece of wall, which has got twice as many blue fibers, there's also twice as much force in the circumferential direction compared to the axial direction. And that means that in this situation, red microfibril stress is actually the same as blue microfibril stress, because although there are twice as many blue microfibrils, there's also twice as much force, tensile force. And so this cell would grow isotropically. Grow isotropically. Okay, so it would grow equally in all directions because red microfibrill stress and blue microfibril stress are going to be the same. To make a cell like this grow axially, what we need is to have more than twice the number of blue microfibrils. Okay, so if you have more than twice the number of microfibrils, then it will put the red microfibrils under greater stress than the blue microfibrils, and then you'll end up with longitudinal growth. So the key then is it's a Well, you should remember here that even though microfibril stress is going to be stronger in the axial direction, wall stress is still going to be stronger in the circumferential direction. All right, and that's because wall stress is not the same as microfibral stress, and growth occurs preferentially in the orientation of maximal microfibral stress. So, I think, yeah, I think that's where I'm going to stop that part. That part and open that up for questions. See whether that makes sense to everybody or comments, questions. Yeah, so what if you don't have any micropibials in the part that's growing? Sorry? That's growing. Sorry? What if you don't have any microfibrils in the part that's growing? What do you mean? Do you mean that there's. I guess the maximal stress is infinite if it's divided by zero, right? It's not the idea. No, no. For example, you have a pollen tube, right? And then, so you don't have any microtubules going that way. And then, and then so it grows. The matrix grows, but not the not the size. And so then you don't need it. And so you can imagine there's probably some continuum of that from the purely From the purely matrix type growth you see in politics all the way to diffuse growth, whereas, you know, the cells may be reinforced this way. But how do you, you know, there may be some this way, but maybe there isn't any and it doesn't matter, right? Is that possible? Yeah, no, I think you're right. I think that's an interesting point. What I was trying to make, for me, what was helpful in working these things out, and also I should acknowledge Dan Cosgrove helped me come to some clarity here. Come to some clarity here. I was confused a lot between walls, the term stress. Okay, that's that's the point I'm trying to make. People talk about the stress in the wall, and I was trying to marry that with the notion of fiber stress and then gradually realized in my own slow way of thinking that actually they're different things. That's the point I'm trying to make. Not that this is a universe, but just try and get that if we think that microfibrils are bearing the main load, all right, which may not be the case in all cases. In all cases. Assuming that, then we need to think, we certainly need to think about these two types of stress differently because they're not the same. And we need to be clear what we're talking about. And often wall stress does not relate to fibre stress. So that's really the point I was trying to make. I agree with you. It's not, it's again, it's no. I guess what I'm saying is the model of it growing in the direction of maximum stress. Supposes that. Stress supposes that, like you said, that the microfibrils are the fundamental, like the biggest resistance. But you know, since some cells can grow even without them, you know, in certain areas, then you can imagine that, you know, how we would know when the wall, the matrix itself is strong enough that the microtubules or the microfireballs, the cellulose, is not the main factor of the strength in the wall. Yeah, that's a good point. So, is it true there are cell walls that are growing that have no cellulose microfibrils? You mentioned the pollen tube. Yeah, I was thinking the pollen tube tips, right? Because the cellulose appears. There is some cellulose. It's not depending on species, but it's not a lot. The fraction is very small amount. You don't need much. I mean, cellulose is so much different than the matrix that wherever you have. matrix that wherever you have cellulose, it becomes the major limiting factor, depending upon how cellulose is connected to other cellulose. That I think as I'll talk about tomorrow is sort of a crucial feature. Shall I move on to the next question? Yes, let's do that. Okay, and then we know exactly. Okay, and then we know exactly how much time we all have and what people can discuss. So let's see if my slides, yep, they no longer work. I need to end the show. And then I start it again. Okay. So the third question I'd like to ask is: what is the relationship between wall stress, tissue stress, and microtubule orientation? Stress and microtubule orientation. Okay, and okay. Let's imagine we start with a spherical cell with isotropic walls, in other words, equal numbers of red and blue, as it were. And this cell divides and we form a middle lamella with flanked by the new walls. And then as this cell grows, the two cells grow, then you will get this type of dumbbell. Get this type of dumbbell shape. Can everyone see my arrow, by the way? Yeah. You'll end up with this dumbbell shape. But if there's no adhesion, then the cells would come apart. So adhesion is what's preventing the cells from coming apart in this case. But let's assume that we have cells which continue to adhere, continue to grow, until they grow into a sphere. And I've sliced the sphere in half just to see what's going on. Just to see what's going on. Now, assuming that all the cell walls have the same isotropic properties, that the Turga in each of these cells is pretty much the same, then to a first approximation, the stress on each of these walls is going to be roughly the same. And so, yeah, so there's nothing terribly interesting at this point. But suppose that we have the outer walls of our The outer walls of our tissue are thicker. What's going to happen? Well, because they're thicker, and I'm assuming that they're thicker in terms of the material retain the same properties, but it's just become thicker. That means that the cross-sectional area of these walls is increased. That means the stress on the walls has dropped. And so these walls, the outer walls, are going to try and grow at a slower rate under the same Turga than the inner walls. And that creates a growth constraint. Than the inner walls, and that creates a growth constraint, right? So now the outer walls are wanting to grow more slowly than the inner walls, and so load is transferred from the inner walls to the outer walls. So the outer walls then start to come under more tension as a result of the inner walls or the inner cells trying to grow out and with these weaker inner walls. Now, just as we abstract from individual fibers to a continuum of To a continuum of a continuous wall, we can abstract from continuum of individual cells into a continuum of tissue. And this brings us to the notion of tissue stresses. So in this situation, if we now forget there are cells, but just retain the fact that the outer tissue or the outer region is trying to grow more slowly than the inner region, then we have this notion of tissue stress or tissue stresses. So the inner region is under tissue. Stresses. So the inner region is under tissue compression and the outer region is under tissue tension. As a result of this unequal thickness in the walls, the outer region is put under essentially a tissue tension that's arising from its connectivity with the rest of the other cells. But it's important to remember that tissue tension or tissue stress is not the same as wall stress. So even though the inner cell walls are under tissue compression, Are under tissue compression, they're still under tension. They're still under experiencing tension through Turga. It's just that that tension is reduced due to tissue compression. And similarly, although the outer region is under tissue tension, the outer walls actually have reduced tensile stress as we thicken the walls because of the thicker area. In fact, I think that this results in both the inner and the outer walls actually having similar tensile stress because of these compensatory effects. But the important Compensatory effects. But the important thing again is just as we saw with fibers and walls, tissue stress is not the same as wall stress. And we need to be clear when we're thinking about stresses, which type of stress we're referring to. So tissue stress differs from wall stress, and an increase in tissue stress need not lead to an increase in wall stress. Now, one of the most interesting aspects of tissue stresses is that they correlate with microtubule orientations. Microtubule orientations. And this is very nicely shown from a paper, I think, with Henriks and Olivier in 2008, in which tissue stresses were computed, I think, essentially on this pressure compression continuum model that I've just shown you. And more sophisticated versions have been done subsequently, but the basic conclusions, I think, remain the same. Conclusions, I think, remain the same. And you get a pattern of tissue stresses like this. For example, you'll see the circumferential stress here, tissue stress is greater than the axial stress, and that's because of the cylindrical geometry now operating at the tissue scale. And because this, assuming that cell walls are isotropic, then that will translate into wall stress. So, also the wall stress will be greater in the circumferential compared to the axial direction. And this correlates with the orientation of microtubules, leading to the idea. Microtubules leading to the idea that maybe microtubules are being oriented by tissue stresses. Now, this idea gained support from experiments in which the apex was compressed, physically compressed, and to create a sort of more elliptical shape. And it was seen that microtubules reorient to some extent to be parallel to the blades or the direction of maximal stress, confirming the idea that the microtubules are being oriented. The idea that the microtubles are being oriented with regard to stress. And yet, further support from this idea came from these ablation experiments in which cells were ablated and it was seen that microtubules were oriented circumferentially around the ablation site, which again agrees with the prediction, predicted orientation of stresses. And so that's led to this notion that stresses are oriented in microtubules. But actually, if you try But actually, if you try and think about a mechanism by which cells could detect the orientation of stresses, it's problematic. I think it's fair to say it's not obvious, and not least of which, because if cells are growing by creep, as we've seen, the stretch of the membrane or the cell or the cytoplasm is not going to tell you how much, it's not going to tell you about the stress in the wall. So, therefore, there have been solutions proposed or ideas, speculation. Proposed or ideas, speculations about how this would work, but it's certainly not clear how stresses, orientations of stresses in a cell wall would be sensed to orient the microtubules. So is there an alternative mechanism that could account for these observations that doesn't depend on stress sensing? Now, one idea for how microtubules become aligned and oriented is the notion of the survival of the aligned, which was proposed by Bella Mulder, particularly. By Bella Mulder, particularly advocated by Bella Mulder, which is when a microtubule hits another microtubule at certain angles, it could undergo catastrophe. And the result of these catastrophes is that when you take a whole population of microtubules together and they're all doing this, then they tend to form alignments because that minimizes or maximizes survival. That's why it's called survival of the aligned. So that's shown here. Here we have a population of these microtubules undergoing collisions where. Undergoing collisions where they catastrophize or they zipper at times as well. But it's the catastrophes that seem to be causing this alignment, according to Bella Mulder. And they form these spontaneous alignments, but these alignments are going to be in random orientations. Okay, so there's no control over these. They will just randomly align in various orientations. But one way of orienting them is: let's suppose we now have a penalty such that if microtubules hit this blue area, they will. Blue area, they will undergo catastrophe. So you're creating a penalty. If we do that, because there's a penalty to moving upwards, they tend to go horizontally, all right, because that maximizes their survival probability. Because if they go up, they're going to suffer catastrophes. And this works whether you have it just at the top end or at the bottom end or at both ends. If you establish some sort of punishment through some sort of polarity mechanism. Through some sort of polarity mechanism, then you will tend to orient the microtubules perpendicular to the polarity. And we know that cells can become polarized. This is the work of Geordie Chan in our group, where he looked at the localization of basal. This is a protoplast, so it's under symmetrical. There's no obvious asymmetry being imposed on this protoplast, and no obvious mechanical asymmetry, and yet it forms polarized distribution. forms polarized distribution and it that then and that polarity orients such that it's perpetu such that the axis of polarity is aligned with the orientation of growth so in other words the orientation of microfibrils should be perpendicular to that in order to generate axial growth which is what we see so so again that fits with this notion that maybe polarity either at this end or at both ends This end, or at both ends, is somehow gap orienting the microtubules, and that leads to an isotropic growth. So that idea is also supported by the data on these ablation, because the same papers showed that if you look at a pin, for example, pin marker, but you can also look at markers at the other end of the cell, then you see that polarity radiates out from these ablation sites. From these ablation sites. Okay. And this, therefore, you could imagine that if this, if, for example, there's a wound signal being generated by the wound, the signal has some sort of gradient, it's a chemical signal, it then orients the polarity to radiate out from that. And then the microtubules can be oriented perpendicular to that polarity. So that you end up with this perpendicular orientation. And if that's true, then the orient one reason that this might It one reason that this might be happening from an adaptational point of view is that it indeed opposes the stresses that will be likely encountered by damage, by tissue damage. In other words, this is a wound response. The reason that the stresses are aligned, we see this correlation is because actually plants have evolved a system such that when they're wounded, they produce a wound signal that orients the microtubules to kind of mechanically construct to support. Construct to support the wound site. And that's why there is this correlation. It's not that the stresses are causing the microtubules, the microtubules are being organized so as to resist these stresses. Now, but that's, what about this experiment where you compress the apex? How can we explain the result that when you compress an apex, the microtubules tend to go parallel? Tend to go parallel align with the direction of maximal stress. Well, some recent experiments showed that if you take protoplasts and you put them in wells and you force them into an elongated shape, then microtubules will tend to align with the long axis of the cell. And moreover, computational models have shown that you get microtubule alignments parallel to with an elongated cell. In other words, cell geometry can influence microtubule alignments. I think that's become quite Alignments. I think that's become quite clear now. And so when you're compressing an apex, in the direction of maximal stress is also going to be the direction where you elongate the cells most. And so that could be the reason that you're seeing this shift in microtubule patterning. It's reflecting the geometry. It's not reading out the stresses. So what I've tried to say is that we have two hypotheses that are consistent with the data so far. With the data so far. One is that tissue stresses orient the microtubules. Another one is that polarity and cell geometry orient the microtubules. And in my view, these two have yet, it's still an open, open debate as to which of these applies or where maybe there's even a third hypothesis. But I have noticed that papers are being published in which they kind of assume that the first hypothesis has been proven without reasonable doubt because they take microtubule. Out because they take microtubule patterns and they say, Oh, well, they tell us the orientation of stresses. Okay, so I think that we have to be very careful. And I think we have to evaluate in the light of evidence as it comes, you know, which of these hypotheses is gaining more support than the other, rather than assuming that the story is closed. So, on that, I'd like to stop sharing. And open it up for questions. Thanks a lot, Rico. Sure, there would be comments. So, Rico, what about a third hypothesis that is sort of in between? What about if it is a change in geometry that is due to stress, that is the signal? Because I agree that geometry is really important, but it could be a change in geometry. And the whole question of how microfuels can be perceived is. I think that's a really good point. In a sense, change in geometry starts to become very similar to strain. All right, because you're kind of exactly, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So I think that's absolutely, absolutely right. I think strain can play a role, but unfortunately, but it can't be the whole story because you can't explain strain through strain. Do you see what I'm saying? So if you're trying to explain more. Strain, you see what I'm saying? So, if you're trying to explain morphogenesis, you've got to explain patterns of strain. And you can't use the strain patterns to explain the morphogenesis. You've got to have something else. So, that's why I think geometry, even change in geometry can only be part of the story, and which is why you need something else. So, I was advocating the notion of polarity, but you do need something, otherwise, you'll end up with trying to explain strain with strain. Thank you for the inspirational discussion. First question is connected to the previous part. Do you have in mind an example where it would be possible to separate the tension, the stress on the individual fibers, we imagine in the cell wall and the produced strain, like where these two things are not matched, like not. Uh, match like normally they align. Like, I have a higher tension on the individual fibers in a certain direction at the tissue level or sorry, cell continuous approximation level that will produce a higher stretch. Is there any case you can imagine where these two things would not overlap? Because it would be very interesting. I think it depends on what you mean by the stress. So, actually, if you remember the cylindrical system. So, actually, if you remember the cylindrical cell, okay, in terms of wall stress, okay, the strain is opposite to the wall. So, if it's a cylindrical cell that's going longitudinally, wall stress is maximal circumferentially, but strain is actually greater longitudinally. If you're considering fiber stress, then actually okay, in my view, my simplistic, please accept very simplistic. Please accept a very simplistic view. I would imagine fiber stress, in terms of the way I've described it, is going to always align with growth, as long as we're not applying external forces. I don't know what happens when you apply it. So this is assuming Turger. But even if you apply external forces, it's a good question, Gabriel. I haven't thought about it. But I'm assuming, yeah, on the picture I've given you, you would assume that fibre stress. You would assume that fiber stress is going to be correlated with strain. So, that, like, on a modeling scale, we are still fine using a strain-based growth definition, even if maybe the microscopic mechanisms are not. I think that's right. By saying this, I think it's very important. I'm not saying, you know, several people have mentioned today the importance. Several people have mentioned today the importance of different scales of analysis. And it's perfectly fine to operate at tissue stresses in terms of thinking in terms of tissue stresses. It's perfectly fine to think about each level. I'm not saying that one level is correct. I'm just saying you have to be careful when you move between levels that you understand how one stress relates to another stress. Okay, that's all I'm saying. Yes, thank you. Oreski. Yes. Yes, so I would like to get back to the last slide about the two hypotheses being consistent with the data. So, well, I would like to slightly correct hypothesis one. So, maybe there's some confusion in the literature about how it is formulated. My personal view is that my well, possibly, my Possibly, microtubal polymerization or microtubal orientation is guided by stress in the nearest cell wall. In the what, sorry? In the nearest cell wall. And that this biases polymerization and that self-organization of microtubules on the wall, on the cell scale, gives a global orientation to the microtubule network. Orientation to the microtubule network. So I don't think it's as simple as tissue stress or as simple as cell wall stress. It's well, I would think it is biased by cell wall stress plus self-organization of the microtubule network. Sorry, sorry, that sounds very interesting. I didn't quite understand what you meant, though. Can you repeat again what your favoured hypothesis is? It's that. It's that locally orientation of microtubules is biased by stress in the nearest cell wall. What do you mean by the nearest cell wall? Well, if they're cortical, the cell wall to which the microtubal area is close. And so locally. In the cell, microtubules are self-organized. Microtubules are self-organized and the direction, the resulting orientation of microtubules in the cell will be biased by stresses in all the cell walls of that cell. So I would think that it's not as simple as tissue stress nor stress in the Stress in the in the cell. Thank you. There is another intervention in Zoom. I'm sorry, I can't recall your first name. Jing Yi. Yes. Hi, thank you. It's a very fascinating talk. So I just have like one interesting or two main question, I guess. One is following up. Question: I guess one is following up the previous comments. I was thinking, uh, because you were talking about within the wall, there are different fibers and there could be like fiber stress. And we know that cell wall is structured as a cross-laminate structure. And there are like different orientations, but also like for the old cell, old layer cell wall and newly synthesized wall, they are probably also under different stress conditions because newly synthesized might. Condition because new listening exercise might be like more relaxed. And so I just wonder: would that like make the question more complicated in a certain way? Oh, I think you're that's a very good point. I think you're absolutely right. And I think all of this makes it more complicated for the stress sensing model. Okay. I mean, you can, all I'm trying to say is there is an alternative, and it's quite simple in my view. Okay. In my view, okay. Um, so I can't say I'm completely unbiased, that would be uh a misrepresentation. One seems to me from my perspective, but that that need not be correct, I mean, obviously, but um, we have this to me a relatively simple idea, which we use polarity to orient the growth and the microtubules. And this other one, which depends on the stresses, and then we need to worry about creep, we need to. We need to worry about creep, we need to bout local new walls, the complexity of the wall structure, all of this. We don't have a mechanism for it. We know that, by the way, if you loosen the wall with either enzymes or with by mutating genes that affect wall synthesis, that does not affect microtubule orientation. All right, that's been shown in several cases. So, therefore, you can, what I'm trying to say is one hypothesis is getting quite complicated. Is getting quite complicated. The other one doesn't mean it's wrong, it just means it's complicated. The other one, I find much simpler. So, I think you're right. If you go with the stress-sensing model, you have to also deal with these additional issues about what you do and the fact that the wall is highly dynamic and may represent have different stresses, or the microfibrils might have different patterns of stresses as you lay down the wall. I think that's what you were saying, and I completely. I think that's what you were saying, and I completely agree. Yeah, but I do agree that this, in terms of thinking, the fiber structure is definitely provides a lot of like molecular insights into the wall structure and understanding what's going on in the structure. But yeah, that's very cool. And I just have another small question regarding the, I think, last slide of your first talk, you were mentioning that as the wall is creeping and the fiber were sliding, the inner wall is going upwards and are Going upwards, and are you referring to some kind of like reinforcement of the fiber? Because we know that Y is like somehow losing its strength during slippage. And I just wondering, are you referring to some kind of like reinforcement mechanism other than the new wall synthesis? Thank you. Oh, I'm just referring to the new wall synthesis. That is, the cellulose synthase is just adding fibers in from the plasma membrane. From the plasma membrane as the wall thins due to slippage. No, no, I wasn't adding any additional comment other than it's just wall synthesis. Oh, sounds cool. Yeah, because we actually see the like some kind of like reinforcement in the isolated wall, which doesn't go through active synthesis. So that's interesting. Do you want to expand on that? Yeah, we see that as we stretch the wall to like 50% and be. Wall to like 50 and beyond 20, the yield stress of the wall keeps increasing, and meaning that even when it's going slippage, it's getting harder and harder to stretch the wall further. So I think that's something that's an interesting phenomenon. And what's it called? Is it stress hardening? I think there's a term for it. Yeah. Maybe Daniel, again, I'm going to point the finger at Daniel Cosgrove because I know that he thinks about these things. Maybe he'd like to comment. Maybe you'd like to comment. Oh, I'll leave it to June. All right, you're in the same group as Daniel as well, are you? Yeah, I think I'm actually gonna give a like a presentation on this later, so maybe we can have some acts and suggestions within the group. That would be really cool. Thank you. All right. Then mute yourself with that. Hi, thanks for the talk. So, I'm a mechanical engineer. I'm trying to think of a way. I'm trying to think of a way to measure stresses, and I'm wondering how biologically something could measure like a stress signal. Because typically, when we measure things, we measure strains, and then we deduce the stress from it. So is it possible that first hypothesis could be the strain in the microprivial rather than the stress? Because I can't see how stresses could be. see how stresses could be perceived i think i think um i would say that you can measure stress through you always measure stress through strain i'm sure bruno's got some comment on this um so in practice the issue is how you measure that some strains do give you an indication of stress and some don't that's why i was kind of emphasizing the difference between creep and elastic uh stretching so in the case of elastic stretching then um the stretching Then the stretching of the wall, if you can measure that, say on the plasma membrane at the strain, then you would measure the stress in, or you would get a proxy measure for the stress in the fibers through the strain. However, if it's growing by creep, you can't do that by measuring the cytoplasmic extension. What you have to do, and this was proposed, was to somehow measure either the conformational change or something happening in the fibers themselves. Things happening in the fibers themselves. Because if you try and do it by proxy, you can't do that. So I think it's okay to say that you use strain to measure stress. That's the way you measure the stress on the spring that I showed you was through the strain. But I think it's important to know whether the strain you're measuring is a reflection of the stress of the fibers or of the wall. And that's the problem. That is, if something's growing by creep, how do you measure the stress in this heterogeneous? Um, the stress in this heterogeneous wall, uh, the average stress in the fibers. I'm not saying it's impossible, but strain-based measures have to account for that. So I don't know whether Bruno wants to comment on that, because I know he's written about this extensively. Thanks, Deneko. Well, I can comment a little bit. It's true that the stress is not an observable quantity, so you cannot observe it directly. Observe it directly, and you can either observe it through strain, as you explain, you can also use a more advanced definition of stress and look at the variation of strain energy with strain. But still, you have to unit strain. When there is a lot of creep, I mean some viscous, then the strain rate is also important, as you mentioned. But anyhow, you cannot. But anyhow, you cannot escape from a strain or strain rate completely. And this is a problem. People always think mechanics is dual. You have to think that it's not one thing that's active and the other is just passive. You have the stress and strain and you have a balance actually between the forces and the reaction of the material. And that's where it's important to consider both sides and not to consider only that the stress is the active part and the strain is just the Just the output, it's actually more subtle than that. Okay, it was another comment on that. Well, thank you very much for the interesting. And I have just two comments. One to my neighbor. As an engineer, I'm not an engineer, but I'm thinking like this many times. Of course, when you talk about elasticity, you're always saying a stress is straight. So an act mirroring strain. But in that case, we are talking about growth, which is the long-term reaction, let's say. If I want to make a sensor, which would be a good sensor in that case for stress, so in fact, give a response before I get a huge amount of deformation. I could use a molecule or something that is sensitive to very, very small variation in length. So it's still a stress. So, it's still a stress, a strain, sorry, sensor, but at the scale of the overall organism I am looking at, it's still a very small deformation. So, in fact, I can feel small strains, so the stress, before my structure, which is the whole cell, will be definitely or hugely deformed, you know. So, the structure I'm interested in is not deformed yet enough to really feel it, but I have a sensor which is another scale of deformation, you know. So, this is my first comment. So, this is my first comment. So, you may be able to feel stress at the scale of the part we're interested in. Anyway, and the other question is about the fact that you have, and that's very beautiful because I'm always teaching this part with discoelasticity, and your models were very, very beautiful. So, the question is: okay, I have some creep, and in that creep, I won't be able, in fact, to In fact, to link stress and strain because it's a rate of deformation, but still in your model, it's a series. So you have the, I would say, this damping stuff and your structure, in fact, your fibers, which are elastic, are in series. So in that case, the stress is still the same. So if you're still able to look at the deformation of your elastic elements, you still have proportional. Elements, you still have proportionality between it is still the same stress, the overall is deforming, but you are measuring through this small, you say, springs and stress as before. So, and maybe last, not this. Thank you. Okay, go ahead. Sorry. Yeah, no, I think it might be useful to show this picture for this discussion because this was a model proposed by Williamson in 1990, because he absolutely understood that you couldn't measure. Understood that you couldn't measure the strain, the stress in the fibers through the cytoplasmic element. So he imagined that fibers would have these domains, I think, these amorphous domains, and there'd be a receptor that bonds to the microfibrils on the top and the microtubules on the bottom. And that more stressed microfibrils would bind more effectively, say, to these components. And so that they. Components and so that they would somehow align the microtubules beneath them to align with these stresses. So, in this sense, the strain or the conformation change in the microfibril directly is being sensed. So, in that sense, you can detect the stress in the wall. I think there are two issues here. One is you have to be very careful to do this stoichiometrically, because as I showed you in a wall that's transversely where the stress is greater in the circumferential direction. In the circumferential direction. Actually, the microfibril stress is greater than the other direction. Now, there is a way you so you have to sum up the stresses. It's not that it this isn't this can't work if you're aligning with the direction of maximal microfibril stress, but it could work if you're aligning with the direction of average stress. However, there's two papers that argue against this model that have come out. One was in this paper. I can't read the date because it's covered. Paper. I can't read the date because it's covered. Let me just find it. This paper showed that basically if you weaken if you treat with drugs that cause, okay, so cellulosynthase is the microtubules are attached through, tethered to cellulosynthase. And that's how the cellulosynthase follows the microtubules. And if you interfere. Microtubules. And if you interfere with the binding of the microtubules to the cellulosynthase or that aspect of things, the tethering, then you will influence microtubules. However, if you weaken the wall without affecting that tethering, for example, you treat with cellulase, which doesn't degrade the tethering bit, it just degrades the wall, you don't see a change in microtubular orientation. So this was done in 2008. And most recently, it's been confirmed. Most recently, it's been confirmed through this paper that if you affect enzymes that do not weaken the wall, but that do not affect the tethering, then you do not affect microtubule orientations. And so that kind of undermines experimentally this notion that you're detecting microfibrill stresses. Now, this paper concludes actually that the stress thing is still correct, but it's The stress thing is still correct, but it's somehow detecting stress through the tethered region through the cellulose synthase. How that would work, I don't know. But I'm just saying that this model actually isn't supported now experimentally by the data that if you weaken the wall without affecting the tethering of the microtubules, which are tethered, which is at the end where the cellulose is being synthesized, then actually you don't affect. Then actually, you don't affect microtubule orientation. So, I'm going to stop sharing. I don't know if that helps answer your question, but at least there has been a model that's explicit there as how it would work. But I don't think the data is supporting it. Miltos. Yes, thank you, Rico. This was very illuminating. I had sort of detailed question on your last slide. The question on your last slide there on the interpretation of the ablation. So, the fact that the pin shows that particular behavior towards the ablation, you would also interpret as a chemical response to a wound signal, basically? Is that sorry? What are you asking, Miltos? Would you interpret the pin reorientation as a response to a wound signal? Yeah, there's a chemical signal. Yeah, there's a chemical signal, which was originally proposed when these when these it was shown, I think, in 1990 already that microtubules align by, I think, hush, a paper by the microtubules align with cuts, parallel to cuts. And it was proposed there was a wound signal that was orienting these microtubules. I think it's very unlikely to be auxin because I think the experiments from Marcus Heiser's that paper that I showed you nicely. That paper that I showed you nicely showed that if you interfere with auxin dynamics, it doesn't affect these polarity orientations or the microtubule orientations. So, whatever this wound signal is, it's not likely to be auxin. But, you know, there are plenty of chemicals. Auxin, though we love it, is not the only chemical that exists. The essence of it, though, is that you consider the microtubules and the things independently affected. Independently affected by whatever chemical signal? No, no. I'm saying that the chemical signal orients the pin, the polarity of the cells. PIN is a micro polarity, as is basil and bricks and so forth. So the signal orients the polarity. The polarity then orients the microtubules by destabilizing on the faces, the wall faces that are closer to. Faces, the wall faces that are closer to the wound and distant from the wound, they will be destabilized with regard to microtubules, and therefore the microtubules will tend to go perpendicular to the axis of polarity. Yeah, yeah, I see that, right? But ultimately, both respond to a chemical change caused by the wound. Yes. Great, yeah, the same answer. Daniel, uh two. I think we're just about done, yes. Yeah, absolutely. This topic seems to be, uh, have a lot of interest. And on the one hand, it might be something to do for the discussion for this session B. And I was going to suggest maybe putting our heads together to identify ways of distinguishing between these two. Of distinguishing between these two alternative hypotheses as put forward today on how one measures how the microtubules are responding. Is it stress or is it chemical and geometry? The only problem with that is Enrico is not going to be here for the afternoon session. So I'm not sure that's optimal, right? So let me take over. So there's a few things that will happen. We will meet again. Will happen. We will meet again at 2:30 here and we'll do a little debrief on how things have been going, okay, hybrid-wise. And directly after, I would like to open indeed breakout sessions. And since there was interest for both, I suggest that yours, Christophe, operates on this Zoom link. Okay. Whereas the one that Rico and you could do, or you mostly, operates on the breakout Zoom link. On the breakout Zoom link that is also provided. And I'm going to put these Zoom links in the respective flag channels. All right. In terms of physical space for the ones who are here, I suggest that Christophe, you stay here in this room with whoever wants to join. And that Daniel, you go to our working room, which is, I think, 103, right? Room 103, where we have another room where we can run a session. So anybody who's physically So, anybody who's physically interested in continuing the discussion after our debrief, which happens at 2:30, or after, we can split up in that. Before we do all that and before we break, the most important thing has to happen, and that's the conference photo. We will gather, before we get up, we will gather outside, but we want the people on the screen to have a screenshot as well. So, if everybody who is online right now could please put your camera on, show us your night. Camera on, show us your nicest smile, center your camera so that we can actually see you. Then I'm going to take a few screenshots and I'm going to photoshop the whole thing so that I'll get everybody, hopefully also in the coming days. So in the coming 60 seconds or so, give me your nicest smile. Yeah. It's a trick to check who's really online. Oh, Aratsky, you know me so well. You know me so well. Okay, that's great. And after that, we'll go not offline, but we'll switch off our camera and video here. And those of you who are willing and available to come back, please do come back around an hour and six minutes from now, so to say. If we're not there totally on time, please indulge us and be patient. We will still be. Us and be patient, we will still be eating lunch, so to say, just hang around. Okay, so see you guys later.
