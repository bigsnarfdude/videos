To be here with you and share with you our recent work on studying the confinement of liquid crystalls at curved geometries. Today, in my talk, I will focus on semantic liquid crystal and the new technique that we use to create these curved geometries, which is 3D nanoprinting. We'll show you how, by using this system, in addition to the good control of anchoring conditions, together we can have like very nice assembled top. Like very nice assembled topological defects that can be used for many applications. So, hopefully, I can go through at least show you one application of that. So, before that, let me introduce my group. So, we are a soft matter group at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, interested in developing new technique, experimental technique to direct the assembly of different classes of soft materials. Of soft materials. We are particularly interested in liquid crystals, colluids, and some biological systems. And for that, we use the technique of self-assembly. So we develop a process to have materials that they self-assemble in a spontaneous way and for structures that can be interesting for both fundamental research as well as technological applications. And for this, the goal, I mean, to achieve this goal, we are using I mean, to achieve this goal, we are using different techniques for direct assembly. Some of them we use external fields, we apply like electrical and magnetic fields to control alignment of liquid crystals and directly assembly of colloidal particles, flow fields, capillary interactions at flow interfaces, and also elastic phase and topological defects in liquid crystals, which is the flow of prototype. So, today we show you how, again, by control. How, again, by controlling the geometry of confinement as well as anchoring conditions, we can create very interesting structures that can be used also to direct the assembly of nanomaterials, function nanomaterials, as well as biomaterials. To present the work today, so I will start with a brief introduction about liquid crystals and then the techniques we use to direct the assembly of defects in this material in previous studies. In this material in previous studies. Then I will present our recent work with curved geometries, undulated surfaces, as well as double undulated surfaces. And then, if I have time, I will show you how these defects that we create at these geometries can be used to directly assemble nanoparticles, nanomaterials, as well as some active matter systems. So, liquid crystal, very briefly, Liquid crystal, very briefly, you know that liquid castle is a state of matter with a property between those of a liquid and those of a solid. And depending on how molecules are organized in this mesophase or intermediate phase, we can distinguish different types or different types of liquid crystals, matic, smectic, cholesteric, and many other phases. And in addition to their importance in fundamental research and from a theoretical standpoint, these materials are very important. Standpoint, these materials are very useful in a lot of applications and the earth surrounded. We face these materials every day, mostly in liquid crystal displays, the technology of displays. Now, you know, Samsung they are developing these displays that they can band based on liquid crystals, or more advanced technologies like smart windows. When you apply electric field, you change the orientation of molecules and the color of the window. The color of the window will change, and that's a very nice application. Even in biomedical applications like liquid crystal thermometers or sensors, as well as in nature, for example, if you have a high concentration of DNAs, they self-assemble and they can form a liquid crystal phase. Some beetles, their shell, they have a liquid crystal phase, and even the food that we are eating, the chips that we are eating, they are colored by material called the sunset yellow. If you add water, Santa yellow. If you add water to that material, they can form a liquid crystal phase called light optic liquid crystal. And these materials, I believe, have three properties that make them different compared to simple fluids. The first one is anchoring, which is the ability to control molecules in contact with a surface. It could be a solid surface, it could be a fluid surface, it could be air. The second property is elasticity. So if you deform these materials, they have like some elastic. These materials they have like some elastic effects, and the third one is topological defects, which are region. The director is ill-defined, and we develop the scientific community developed nice ways to control these defects and use them in a lot of applications. And the interplay between these three properties makes liquid crystal interesting. And a good example to illustrate this effect is the effect, I mean, the case of a spherical colour. I mean, the case of a spherical color with homotropic anchoring dispersing oriented pneumatically for crystals. So, when you disperse this particle inside this uniform director field, to satisfy the anchoring conditions at the surface of this colourway, so the pneumatic will create topological defects, and at large distance it will create. And at large distance, it will create elastic forces that are capable to arrange the particle in very nice structures. Here 1D chance parallel to the director when you have a dichoroid deformation or chance that they are tilted with respect to the director when you have the line defect with saturating and quadruple deformation. So, this example illustrates the capability, I mean the property of the liquid crystal. One, they are combined. With crystal, one they are combined anchoring elasticity and defects that can give rise to interesting behaviors. So, in this talk, I will focus on a more complex phase, which is called the semi-ticket A phase, characterized by molecules assembled in parallel layers. And these materials have specific topological defects known as the focal conic domains that they can form, especially when we have. Full, especially when we have the hybrid tixture, which means that we impose one side, we can find the liquid crystal between two surfaces. On one side, we impose planar anchoring, on the other side, we impose the perpendicular anchoring. And to satisfy these boundary conditions, the layers will be bent, and in between, you have a mismatch in orientation and the formation of topological defects, known as the focal conic domains. And it has been shown that these defects. And it has been shown that these defects are very interesting because they self-assemble and they are high-trapping size for colloidal particles. We can use them to direct the assembly of different types of nanomaterials. We can use them to assemble proteins, for example. They are also useful for many optical applications, as it has been shown also that every focal tunic domain can act as a microlens. So by controlling the assembly, they can behave. Assembly, they can behave as micronass arrays. Different techniques can be used to directly assemble of these focal conic domains. So let's start with the simple case where you have a uniform layer, I mean a layer of asthmatic with the same thickness, uniform thickness, and under hybrid configuration. And in this configuration, you can see this is an experimental picture of focal conic domains. Picture of focal conic domains, these defects are assembled into crystal structure. So they have like hexagonal symmetry into D. However, if you create some distortion of this flat surface, for example by adding a small sphere, colloidal particle, you put it at the surface of the steam field. To satisfy the wetting and the contact angle, you create some deformation. And due to this deformation of the interface, we observe the formation of Observe the formation of new types of defects assembly that we call flower textures. And these flower textures, I mean, then Biller developed a nice model based on the law of corresponding cones where he explained that in order to have these focal conic domains to assemble into this nice structure, it's very important to have the hyperbola of all these focal conic domains to meet with one point in order to have a smooth transition from one layer to another layer. One layer to another layer. And by doing that, he was able to create a nice geometric model to describe how these defects are assembled. And I have a question. Yes, go ahead. How much control do you have on the contact angle? So by anchoring, so we do chemistry, as Randy said. So we treat the surface with some selene. And by doing that, we fix the angle at 30 degrees, the contact angle. And when you put it on a flat surface, And when you put it on a flat surface, the contact angle, I mean, the contact line is fixed. So in order to satisfy that, so you have one region peak and the other region. So you create some curvature on the difference just by adding it. Right, because you make it like a really. It's like capillary deformation. I mean, when you have like surface water, I mean flat surface, you put capillary, you create a deformation. The same thing here. I don't think it's due to the capillary because capillary is stronger than. Capillary because capillary is stronger than elasticity, but because of the thinning of the smectic on the surface of the collowy, then that creates some deformations. So this is a very simple technique to create this curvature. We can also use different experimental techniques to create more heretical structure of the stochastic domains and control the size, control the shape. For example, we can use bigger micropods to create curvature. Micropose to create curvature and decurve topological defects. We can also create these defects on negative Gaussian curvature or positive Gaussian curvatures. We can use different shapes. We can even create flowers. I mean, we call this paper garden of symmetric flowers because we can create like flowers, isolated flowers or connected flowers just in a self-assembly process by just controlling the anchoring of the liquid crystal and the geometry. Of the liquid crystal and the geometry of the file. So, by combining these two important parameters, we were able to do very nice, I mean, beautiful assemblies of focal conic domains. So, the question why is important to create focal conic domains at curved geometries. It has been shown, as I mentioned in the introduction, that focal conic domains are also can behave as microlenses to their layered structure. So, if you have a light coming from here, the light can be focused on the The light can be focused on the center of this defense. And for example, here, if you take the letter F and you observe it under the microscope, you will see the letter F in all focal conic domains, in all center of these focal conic domains. So by creating this microlens array on curved geometry, in other words, we are like, I mean, we are creating artificial compound I of a lensing where you have small lenses at these curved geometries. So this is one application. Another possible Application. Another possible application that we can, I mean, important for arranging topological defects is, for example, since the defects are microlenses. So if we add, for example, or if we assemble metallic particle or objects that they like to attract light in the course, we can increase, for example, the efficiency of photovoltaic devices by just adding like quantum dots on the surface of this defect or organizing quantum dots. Of organizing quantum dots on the surface of the defects of the spectrum case false. So, recently, my group started to think about another way, different ways to create these curved geometries. Because the way how we use it to create this curvature were very limited. So, we have like options to add like colloids or just micropose. We were not able to create, I mean, an addition to droplets, maybe with the bead. Maybe with the bead. I mean, the creation of smectic with curvature, it was very limited. And we came up with this new method, which is to use 3D printed surfaces. So here we use the technique of 3D printing is developing, and nowadays they have like nice 3D nanoprinter where you can create, where you can design your geometry, and then you can print the surface and use that surface to confine. To confine your liquid crystal. And for this study, for example, we started by designing the simple geometry where we have angulation on the surface of the 3D printed surfaces with a wavelength around 300 micrometers and an amplitude around 25 micrometers. And we use this to replicate that on PDMS. And you can see the surface is nicely smooth. It's not perfect, but it's smooth. And it has, I mean, we found. And it has, I mean, we found that they don't, I mean, even if it is not really very, very small at the nano scale, this problem doesn't affect the assembly of focal connect domias under which, but I will show you in a few minutes. So we created this surface, this is PDMS, and again, in order to create focal connectomies, it is important to have a hybrid tixture, which means one surface that imposes omeotropic anchoring and one surface that imposes planar anchoring. planar anchoring. So for that we use a material called PDMS which is a polymer that you can use, I mean that imposes for particular anchoring and then you can also use it to create these undulations and we confined at the smectic and the top of the azmectic we had a layer, a glass slide treated with PVA that imposes membrane. So in other words we created a frame of a smectic which is the blue color with undulation Color with undulation where you have homeotropic anchoring. On the top, you have a flat surface with planar anchoring. So you have the hypertixture scale. And when confined the seismictic, this is what we found when heating the seismictic between the pneumatic and the seismictic phase. So first we observed the formation of these nicely lined defects at very precise locations and then Locations and the pneumatic phase, and when you go to the smectic, you create focal conic domains between these disclinations that they have very specific orientation. And this process is reversible, which means I can go many times to the pneumatic and smectic, go back and forth, and obtain the same pattern. We also use a different technique called the fluorescent microscopy. So here we So here we just add dime molecules to the smectic, very small concentration of dime molecules, and we observe the same thing what happens, I mean, when we have the phase transition between the magnetic and spectrum. And this experiment, they show the formation of discriminations again at very precise locations. If we increase the intensity, we will see where this topological effects. So, to summarize the experiment, we found that using the Brightfeed microscopy and forest microscopy, we found that there are formation of disclinations, and you can see these disclinations are at both the top of the surface as well as the bottom. But in between these disclinations, we had focal conic domains that we have opposite orientation, and where also they switch their orientation when we have. Switch their orientation when we have like the small discriminations, and then they change, and we have a periodic structure that is correlated with the geometry of the confinement. Yes, go ahead. Which is the top of the trough, and which is the bottom of the trough? Sorry. Okay, so this one is, okay, so this one is the top, and this one is the, but I will show you a model. It's very hard to see from here, but I will. So, this big defects that is more. This big defect that is more clear, it's where we have more liquid crystal. Okay? The small one when we have a very thin liquid crystal. Because also the size of fuker-conic domains is correlated with the thickness of a smect. So if you have a big defect, it means that you have more liquid crystal than it is the bottom. I mean, I have a model and we have some simulations for that. Can I ask another question? Yes, go ahead. Do you see the screen? Oh, yeah, I'm fine. So when I think about simulating. So, when I think about simulating this mechanic and I think having a density variation or something like this, what am I looking at in these pictures? What is the quantity that's being visualized here? I mean, in these pictures, you see the focal conic domains, the structure of the focal conic domains. You see also the defects. That's the information that we get from it. I mean, that's what we can observe using optical microscopy models. On people microscopic. Okay, but then I guess my question is: is I have a three-dimensional simulation here, right? I've got stuff happening in depth. Am I looking just at stuff that's happening against that slide that you have at the top, or am I doing? No, it's 3D. I mean, these are 3D features. And we did also, yeah, I will show you. I mean, we do also Z-scan. So, why we use this first molecule? Because it helps to see what happens in 3D. And in 3D, we observe the structure. In 3D, we observe the structure of coconut known as experimental. So it's 3D. It's not to this structure, is it 3D? Okay? And to understand that, so we started, okay, so we have undulated surface, hybrid texture, you go to the SMEC, Pneumatic, you observe these beautiful defects. So the question now, why they fall? In order to answer this question, we started with a simple case where we took a flat surface. We took a flat surface with the same boundaries, PDMS, planar anchoring, and we did the same experiment by hitting and cooling the system between isotropic, pneumatic, and spectral. And we found that by cooling the system from the isotropic phase, you create some discriminations in the system. And this is because of the hybrid texture. So one surface is a planar, the other one is perpendicular. So you create loops in the new. So, you create loops in the pneumatic phase. And these loops have generally random shape and they tend to shrink over time because they cost a lot of plastic energy. However, if we go from the pneumatic to the smectot, we were able to freeze these loops that receive oops what I did. I think it's my, yeah. So when we go from the pneumatic to the symmetric, we were able to freeze these discriminations. And you can see the shape of these discriminations is random, is not very well controlled. And you can see that half Oker coding domains are oriented in this direction, and the other ones are oriented. Direction and the other ones are oriented in the opposite direction. This is because of the formation of these loops in the pneumatic phase. So now, what happens when we add undulations at the bottom of these films? So this is what happens in the pneumatic phase. We found that, before I start the video, we found that there are very clear discriminations that they are located at, again, the top and the bottom of this. Again, the top and the bottom of these angulations, and they are stable. Why are they stable? Because of the topography of the surface, where we can find a liquid crystal, as well as the good control of the energy conditions. And when we go to the smectic phase, we call the system to the smectic, we freeze the discrimination at a very precise location, and in between, you have these nicely focal conic domains that they have nice arrangement. So we did the 3D scan of that. So we used the fluorescent, I mean, and you can see it's a 3D system where you have the lines are very clearly. These are not simulations, these are experiments. So what we do is we scan the sample along the z-axis. Due to the fluorescence, you can do some reconstruction of these topological defects in 3D. However, this technique has a limitation, especially in the thin regions where the semi-tick is very thin, so we are not able to see. Thin, so we are not able to see what happens. But at least when we have a thick layer of the smectic, we were able very, I mean, we were able to see very nicely the focal conic domains as well as the distinctions. Now, the question, okay, in optical microscopy images we can see these lines, so what happens here? We believe that there are some discriminations there also, and to do that, we use different techniques. For example, we use Different techniques. For example, we use it, we continue to use the Forest microscopy. You can see there are some lines there. But mostly, we also tried a new technique called the dark field microscopy. We didn't invent the technique, but it exists, but we tried to see if we can use it with a symptomic liquid crystal. And very nicely, we were able to see these discriminations that are located everywhere when we have the ambulation on the top and the bottom. And the bottom. So we were able to explain the difference between flight layer and the undulation, where you have to satisfy boundary conditions, you form these propertonic domains. They are bigger when we have a thicker liquid crystal, smaller when we have like thinner liquid crystal, and they need to switch. So in this case, all I mean, the hyperbola of all focal connect domains going in this direction, then they switch. Direction, then they switch, and here we have a mismatch, you literate another discrimination, and for this reason we see the slice. And then we characterized these defects. We found that the size of H focal conic domains is correlated with the geometry. I mean, they have the same wavelength as the shape of the PDMS. We also measured the effect of the eccentricity as a function of the angulation, and we found that it's proportional to Proportional to the thickness of the smectic. And lastly, the advantage of this technique is that you can design any shape and you can control the defect that you are forming in this. For example, here we tried a set of colour lines. We said maybe can we create loops of discriminations by designing these circular waves? And we found that it's possible. You can see here the same patterns instead of. Can see here the same patterns instead of having parallel lines, we have circles with defects, and both circles are decorated with focal coin dots. So, this is the advantage of using this work. I mean using these 3D printing techniques. This work was published in SoftMatter, and it was done by my master's students. Most of the work was done by undergraduate students. She is now doing a PhD at Music Board now. And after we tried to understand, had like a good understanding of the parameters we control, we tried to collaborate with the group of Dan Biller. So I think he will give a talk about that later in this week. So the problem with the simulation that they are developing is they can do the simulation near the phase transition in the pneumatic phase, not in the semantic phase. And it's very hard to see what happens. Very hard to see what happens. I mean, we go from one phase to another phase. And for that, they developed a nice approach. They call the three-step Lando-Deugen free energy minimization approach, for which they fix the position of focal conic domains and the smectic. And then they remove the focal conic domains but they they keep the orientation of the molecules and then they do the they set the elastic constant K3 to equal to K1. And k3 to equal to k1 to make it in the numerator phase. And this is the video that shows their simulation with these angulations, the observable formation of straight lines. And when the sample is relaxing, they were able also to see what happens on the other regions, I mean on the thin region of the spectrum cystons. And if we take the side of view of these simulations, we found that similar thing as we observe in a Similar thing as we observe in experiments, like discrimination that have less half discrimination when you have like a thick region of liquid crystal, and then another discrimination with the opposite charge minus half discrimination. The only thing that the simulation, I mean, there is another thing that the simulation is indicating, the position of these topological defects or the disclination, they are not in the same plane, so they are always close to the surface where the perpendicular anchor is composed. Please, I post it. Good. The next step of this project, so we decided to go further and do more geometry, I mean more complex geometries. In particular, our motivation, we try to see how the Gaussian curvature will affect this topological process. And for that, we designed this system where we have undulation, but in both directions, x and y. So we have a sine wave function, but So we have a sine wave function, the same sine wave function, but in two directions. Along the x-axis and the y-axis, we did the same thing, we use PDMS, planar anchoring, using PVA, and then we confined the record custom. So what do you think will happen? What type of discrimination do you see here? If we have undulation, we have lines. Loops. Some of you. Some of you saw the presentation. Okay, let's see. It's not, I mean, okay, let's see what happens. So, this is an ematic. We observe some lines. This is what happens in spectrum. We observe lines, very well-defined line. They are perpendicular. They meet in some points, and in between you have flower textures. You go to the nematic, they disappear. You go back to the semantic, they reappear, and you can do this like. And you can do this like 10 times, they form at the same position and very well organize it. So, we started by characterizing the position of these disclamations. We found that they are always located on the thin region of the semi-trick on the top of the hill. And the 3D reconstruction confirmed our observation. You have here the intersection of these disclinations. Again, this is we disperse dimoles. Again, this is we disperse dimolecules, we do a zcanac, and we do reconstruction of the 3D layers. We also did some statistics. We tried to see on the intersection what type of flowers do we observe. And we found that there is like different states. In some cases, we have four petals around the intersection of flowers. Most of the cases, we had five, other cases, we had six petals. Other cases, we had six petals around the intersection of these explanations. We believe that this is due to the thickness of the semic. Maybe there is like a small change in the thickness when we prepare the sample, but we need more experiments to investigate this. Also, we are collaborating with Dan Biller. I will let him talk about the simulations, but again, we can catch the simulation before, I mean, on the smectic, and the pneumatic phase before. And the smectic and the pneumatic phase before the phase transition, but unfortunately, we cannot do the simulation during the phase transition from smectic to pneumatic or from smectic. So now we created these beautiful defects and very nice YR user. What can we do with this topological defects? And very quickly, I don't have time. We tried the first thing to see how can we use these defects to arrange learning particles. And the first thing we started And the first thing we started to do is to use these gold nanoporticles, 20 nanometers gold nanoparticles, they have ligands, and then we dispersed them in the semantic. So we started with a flat surface, and you can see these bright spots are focal conic domains just after the phase transition to the pneumatic. All the goal they wanted to go to the core of these topological effects. Then we said, let's see, can we? Then we said, let's see, can we do the same thing with the flower? I mean, the undulations and the double field. So we did the same experiment. We did it with different concentration. We started with 0.02 weight percent. We still observed the formation of the nice patterns. We increased the concentration. We also did it with the undulation. So we have like this one double undulated, this one is undulated. But we observe it as soon as we start. Observe it as soon as we start from 0.05 weight percent, we cannot form anymore these nice patterns or the defects are changing the orientation of and the assembly of photocopy. And this is what happens. So when we add more colloids, we observe that when we go, for example, to 0.28%, most of the colloids, I mean, they change the texture, the pattern of The texture, the pattern on the bottom is not important anymore. And we believe that this is because the colours they go to the flat surface as well as to the bottom surface. And by doing that, they change the anchoring of the sleeve. So by changing the anchoring, then the pattern and the topology of the surface is not important anymore. This also work done shown by Randy this morning. This work also, I mean, in this work, they showed the same thing. So they observed that when they have nanoparticles, That when they have nanoparticles, high concentration of nanoparticles, the nanoparticles they go to the boundary and they form a layer on the surface, and then that changes the anchor. So this is one of the challenges of experiments. So we always claim, I mean people doing experiments with liquid crystal, yeah, we can use liquid defects to assemble, but there is a limitation with this approach, especially the concentration. And maybe, since we have theorists here, I don't understand this topology. This topology. So, this is, for example, the image, I think it's in VIC. You see here, we have like circle, we have plus one defect of osmectic with this high concentration of colloids. You see plus half here. You have minus half here, minus half here. And the nude, I mean, this one is plus one, plus half, minus half, this one is minus half. Also, you see it in layers. I don't. The layers. I don't understand that. And hopefully, someone can help me. So, by just changing the anchoring at the boundary, you go, you form these layers with like plus one and different topographies. And we did simulations with 10. These simulations are in good agreement with our experiments. We found that for low concentration, we can declare the topological defect of a smectic. Topological defect of asthmictic, but as soon as we increase the concentration, the colours they like to go to the flat surface and the undulated surface, and then by doing that, due to the ligands and due to the nanoparticles, you change the anchoring, which shows also the importance of the anchoring conditions when we are dealing with protein cells. And again, doing the simulation. So, this is this work, recent work by Emmanuel Aka. This work, recent work by Emmanuel Akas, where I mean, they showed that how the nanoparticles go to the defects, they decorate the defects. You see that without nanoparticles, you have nicely topological defects, but as soon as you add more nanoparticles, they go to the surfaces, they change all nice defects that we are organics. So, hopefully, today I showed you how by playing with the morphology. By playing with the morphology, having good control of anchoring conditions, you can create topological defects, you can assemble these defects, you can engineer their structures. I also hopefully showed you that they are useful. You can use them to direct assembly of nanomaterials, functional nanomaterials. But also, I showed you the experimental challenge when we're doing that, which is the concentration of nanoparticles. So, our approach is very limited in terms of. Is very limited in terms of the concentration. So, why also the next step of this, my group also is trying to use these defects to control the assembly of more complex systems, in particular we are interested in active material. Maybe next time I will talk about that. And thank you for your attention. We have five minutes for questions. I have um one is uh let's say uh uh basic question, uh very simple. So um with these three different technique, how small can you go? I think we were able to go to 300 micrometers on the wavelength and 20 micrometers. That's the limitation for the technique. But there are fancy, I mean, there are new 3D printers that think you can go below like I think you can go below, like they are saying is nanoprinters. I think we should go. But I think we tried to go below 20 micrometers in terms of the thickness. And we tried also to do holes. And it's not working. It's nanoprinter, but they can do only in the range of microns. I don't think it's... And even the surface is not very smooth because they do it in layers. So there is a limitation. But there are also some experimental techniques you can hit. There are also some experimental techniques you can hit your sample and this will smooth like a window. Yeah. And we were lucky the smectic lux, I mean, I mean, didn't affect the smectic. We were able to see that there are some features on the service, but didn't affect too much our effects. Actually, my main question was also another one, which is: I noticed that in your pneumatic phase, you have very often the lines maybe pinned, error, they might be a little bit more. Go somewhere else, yeah. Yes, exactly. Somewhere else, yeah. Yes, exactly that's the problem. That's true. Yeah, they will be straight. Yes, I think in the first video, what I can say is that you are right. If you are in the pneumatic if you are in the pneumatic and you wait, you don't go to The pneumatic and you wait, you don't go to the smectic, the defects will disappear, even with this geometry. So, in other words, these discriminations, what we do is we they want, I mean, the geometry is imposing them to form a precise location, but they don't want it to stay there. So, if we sit in the pneumatic, they will disappear, they will change, they cost a lot of elastic energy. Okay, you see here, if we wait, but what we do is we freeze them. We do is we freeze them by going to the semic. The smectic, I mean, you see this line is going away, but when we go to the semi-tik, it goes back. And then you can do this many times. But you need to be very careful and you need to work very closely near the pneumatic semicondition in order to form these nice patterns. One thing I didn't mention, also you need in order to form these regular patterns, you need to Regular patterns, you need to work very closely near the nematic semantic phase transition. So, and you need also to do the change of temperature very slowly. If you do it very quickly, nothing will happen. But you need to do it very you need to give time to the semectic and the pneumatic to form the equivalence. Yeah. This is not real time, I'm sorry. No, no, this is not real time, no. Oh, so it's much slower. Actually, the other one. The other one is real time. This one is real time. This one is, I'm heating, just hitting it. And you see the fluctuation of the molecules due to the curvature? Yep. Manuel, do you have a question? It was for the the end of the talk wh when you were sh showing You were sh showing some defect that you call first half and so on. It was not the those magnetic layers, it was that you were yes, of course, because layers are very small. So, this is so this I mean these lines are nanoparticles assembled between layers of semantic. Yes, okay. So, this is concerned the assemblies of by the between layers, and these more complex structures. Layers and these more complex structures, I believe. I really like that. But did you see before? I mean, did you see this before? It's also that it is not only a number of particles together. Yeah, I mean these lines, do you see these lines? They have also some aggregates. Yes, it's plenty of aggregates there. So they are changing the how the how the the this matrix work. This matrix. But you see, for example, this is clear is minus one, this one, plus minus half, plus one, plus one, and then yeah, plus half. A lot of intensity between possible? So this one is a bright field, and this one is DIC. So I use a DIC just to see the difference between. So these techniques, they are nice to see like transparent. To see like transparent objects. So, this one is DIC and this one is normal regular optical microscopy image. But it means that it is difficult to distinguish between the S texture and the nanoparticle. And the nanoparticle texture. Both are mixed, so we don't know. Do you see both or do you just see the line that the I mean, I can see these lines, I don't think are semantic layers. I don't think they are semantic layers, but there are linear chances of nanoparticles between the semantic layers because we are using high concentration. But not be you but the only thing I want to say is that the period you see is a very large period because you see it by optical microscope. It has no relationship with the spectral. No, the period here is like in the range of one micron I mean and the layer of spectrum is in the range of ten nanometers. Is in the range of 10 nanometers. And the colours by themselves are 20 nanometers, so they don't fit in one layer. Yes. Do you know if there was a, you have ever had a temperature gradient across your sample that affected it when you cooled or heated? I mean, usually, yes, because I mean, the way how we do the phase transition, you see that you go from one phase to another, and then by One phase to another, and then by this is very common. I think we usually cannot have a chamber that gives you the same temperature. Always, you have like phase transition. This means that you have some gradient. The thickness may change also. Alright, well let's hang on again.
