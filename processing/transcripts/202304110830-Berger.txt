I should like to welcome our first speaker for today, who is going to tell us, who is going to give a survey on Real Command Maps. Okay, so hello, thank you for the invitation. I wish I would be with you at Donf, but I'm somehow here via the web anyway. So thank you for the invitation to do a survey on real NOMAPS. To do a survey on real NOMAPS, so it's difficult, of course, to quote every subject, like every work, every contribution on these topics, which is extremely vast and tech with many, if many fields. I will just quote a few, which also, of course, have been interacted with me along my way in mathematics, which began with the differentiable dynamical systems and then like anti- And then like I interacted with people doing one dimensional dynamics. And more presently, I'm working more with conservative dynamics. Only I think there are also interaction to build in that direction. And I will finish by these topics. So let's begin with the differentiable dynamical systems. So one of the first work done in differentiable dynamical systems in the sense was MER. And SMER is called. Of smell and smell is cool and the notion of castmail property, which is very simple to tell. It says only that whenever you got a periodic point, it must be hyperbolic. This means that you don't have eigenvalues of modus one, and that any pairs of a stable and unstable manifold must intersect if they intersect transversally. Okay, so they are both transverse. So, this is a result which is true. Which is valid in any smooth category, like C1, C2, C infinity, but also it is valid in the analytic category. It's possible to show that it's also valid there. And it's appearing much more complicated to prove this for NOMAPS because all the proofs that exist to prove this property use a local surgery. And like for NOMAPS, so you don't define. Like for NOMAPS, so you don't define what is NOMAPS, but I think everybody in the room knows what it is. You got just a finite number of parameters, and so apparently it's not easy to do this, but it's a result done by Buzard, Uskras, and Ilyashenko in 2005, who proved that a raised dual subset of full measure of all the parameters of a real prinomial automorphism of fixed degree has a cup as Melee property, which means that none of the, like for every The uh, like for every periodic point, you got eigenvalues which are not unitary, and whenever you take a pair of stabilized half-manifolds, they transverse. So, the proof of this result, I will not give all the proof, but just the flavor of this is that you look at like when you have the NO family, you know that you can change the parameter to go to a horseshoe, okay, to have a uniformly republic horseshoe, and this corresponds to what we call the parameter. correspond to what we call the parameter A equal to very large and B, which is small, for instance. And what you do is that you look at the manifold, like you look at the continuation of all the parallelic points in the complex space. And this gives you a branch covering of the parameter. And then you show that those equations satisfy like this equation when you look at the eigenvalue, like you have a You have an application between projective varieties, and so they must be subjective. And so, like having something like they cannot be constant for the eigenvalue that you have, and like this, you obtain that it's not possible to have more than a contable, like a finite dimensional union sub-variety for which you have a different with a unitary eigenvalue. For the transverse IT is more tricky, and it's a it's a for. Tricky, and it's a full article, which is not so small, but they manage also to do this. And what is interesting is this result is that you get a result which works as well for the real NOMAPS, but also for the complex NOMAPS. Like this, all the results are valid also for complex automorphism. Okay, so that's a first result that we can mention and this spirit of differentiable dynamical systems. Another one. Another one that I classify here because there is a theme in differentiable dynamics, but also in other, like in complex dynamics as well, of course, but in differential dynamics, I trust like the question of the density of periodic points was very important. And what we have as a result is that if we ask, like if we have some assumption on the dynamic, which is Which is called malady dissipative. So it's a terminology I think introduced first by Jujardin Jubich, which means the following: so you get a dynamic of the disk, and that dynamic is sent into the disk, okay, by this, and you get the Jacobian, which is smaller than one, and you ask that for every ergodic measure, which is not a thing, then you know that for almost every point, you are going to have a stable Pacin manifold, and you ask that this stable manifold. And you ask that this stellar manifold has both of its branches which intersect the boundary of the disk. So this condition actually is possible to show using a Billy Carson technique that this condition is valid for any mapping with a small Jacobian. If you have a small Jacobian compared to the norm of the differential. And from the work of Lujardin Lubich, it's also valid to be, it turns out also to be true for any Also, also to be true for any polynomial to morphism which extends that the determinant is smaller than one over the square of the degree. Okay, and using this partition of your disk that you have, you have like a Crovisi and Pujal to go back to a case like a situation, like minutes situation, which is close to the arguments that you can do in a dimension one, and so show that the super. And so shows that the support that any algorithmic probability measure of F is contained in the closure of the set of paradigm points. So, like this, this result, like it's somehow a closing lemma, it is more than a closing lemma because it's more and less, is more than a closed enema because you actually don't need to perturb to get that you have a paid point like in any support of the things of the ergodic measure, but it's less than a cross-numer because you don't have like all the one non-wandering. Like all the one non-wandering set. So, like, it's not known for now if the non-wandering set is included in the closure of the set of periodic points. So, like, this result also has its counterpart in the complex done by Romain Dujardin. But as I'm supposed only to talk about Riol, I will not say more. It's with together with an argument which is completely different than this one. Okay, so that's a second result. Of course, like which lead to this question whether it is true for a non-wandering asset. It's related, of course, to the problem of J equal to J star problem. And also, like this condition can be wondered whether it is necessary or not. Okay, so another important feature in differentiable dynamic colour systems is one of uniform hyperlinks. Of uniform hyperbolicity. So let me recall what does mean uniform hyperbolicity. It means that if you like, you ask that the non-wandering set, so that the set of the point whose neighborhood have an iterate which, like from for which any neighborhood of the point have an iterate which intersects itself. And you add this set to be uniformly hyperbolic and to be equal to the closure of the pallid points. And moreover, that the stable and stable manifold of the point Stable unstable manifold of the point in the non-boundary set asked at transverse. Okay, so you got this kind of cook-casm property, but you asked moreover that you have uniform hyperbolicity over all the non-boundary sets, and moreover, it's kind of causing a Lehman property to be valid. So, what are the examples of axiom A, like excuse me, a uniform hyperbolic dynamics, which is also called axiom A, which satisfies a strong thermostatic condition. Satisfy the strong thermostatic condition. It is this one: like you can take a gradient flow of a surface, for instance, and you follow the dynamics, okay? And you will have generically, you will have just a finite number of fixed points for this flow, okay, that you can see here. And then you perturb them so that the stable manifold and the unstable manifold are not coincide. Okay, so you just do a little perturbation and they will not coincide. Like this, you got. And, like this, you got a dynamic which is called a Morse May, okay, which is a particular case of uniformly anabolic dynamic. Like, what you can do also in this situation, if you don't want to deal only with the flow, is to, for instance, conjugate your dynamic, like a composed dynamic with a symmetry, like this, and then you will not have a flow. You will have a diffomorphism. And then, what you can do also is you can bring a new pieces, okay? Like here, you get a saddle, so it's a half a. Okay, like here you get a saddle, so it's a hyperbolic point, and you can replace this with this hyperbolic point by a horseshoe, for instance, or horseshoe. I think everybody knows what it is. It is a dynamic which sends this rectangle to that rectangle, this rectangle to this rectangle, and then you get a uniform hyperbolicity. You got the horizontal direction which is uniformly expanded, and the vertical direction, which is uniformly contracted. Okay, so you can plug like these kind of pieces at those taddles here. Those taddles here, and what you can do also is to replace your sink here, like your attracting fixed point, by a plug-in attractor. Okay, this is one of the like this is the only known attractor over a surface, okay. So it's an attractor, it's uniform hyperbolic, like the horizontal direction, like this, the black direction is an expanded direction. Actually, it's all the L-S-A-Monifo which are drawn in this picture. In this picture, and you can plug this here, you will obtain a typical uniform probability in equal systems as we know. Okay. So, like uniform policy, I think like one of the most important results about uniform probability is the characterization of structural stability. So, what is a dynamic which is structurally stable? It's a dynamic which display a neighborhood of dynamics which are conjugated. Dynamics which are conjugated to it via a homomorphism. And what has been proved, Robinson, is that any dynamic which is uniformly arbitric is then structurally stable. So what we know is true is that when you have a C1 structurally stable, so for every C1 perturbation of the dynamic, the dynamic is still conjugated to your initial dynamics. We know that. To your initial dynamics, we know that this is necessarily implies that we have a uniform across dynamic at the beginning. What is not known, and I think it's like one of the hardest questions of the topic, is that whether ultra-stability in higher classes imply a uniform probability on this problem is more universal. I mean in higher regularity, even in C two or C one plus alpha, it's not known. C1 plus alpha is not known in sinfinity, it's not known in conservative dynamic, it's not known, and in allomorphic dynamic, as everybody knows, I think it's a fatal conjecture, it's not known as well. So, like this is one of the main changing question in all the dynamical system. Okay, so yet we can like, so like there are some assimilation, okay, by a Zenai. Where you can actually show that your dynamics is uniformly hyperbolic. Okay, so this is a computation like I think the picture first was done by Zina Rai, and then From Bliot computed a lower bound for the topological entropy, and that's a little numbers that you can see inside each of the components shown to be uniformly hyperbolic. And so here you got the NOMAP, okay, so x squared minus a plus b x. So x square minus a plus b x, y. So sometimes I will change the parametrization depending on the picture of the author I will code. And so you get B, which is minus the Jacobian. Okay. So here minus one is a conservative like a symplectic inno maps. B equal to zero here is a quarter one. Okay. So you can see that for b equal to two, like here we have the reverse somehow model both set where reverse somehow model was set where here it's a airplane and here it's a parabolic point zero minus zero five 25 and here you got an attacking fixed point for the quadratic pop and you can see that he shows that it persists for all that huge region actually and then you got two attractive points like about two and then mutual region and then you get other regions that are don't are not seemingly not a pure continuation of what happened. A pure continuation of what happened here. And then here we got a Roshu, like that's the Roshu I was mentioning before, after the work of about the Cucas-Mel dithomorphism. So here is a region where you have a Roshu, while here is a region where you don't have anything in the normal range set. Okay, everything escapes to the infinity. Okay, so that's interesting to see how many components you have. On that, actually, we like. Have and that actually we like we were very surprised. It was two weeks ago in Kyoto where we saw this picture and we realized that actually for many parameters the NOMAP is actually understood, yet we mostly focus on this region as we will see in the second. So what you can also, like what I should mention also, there are some work by Yuta Keishi on Zinai who characterize this region. Who characterize this region as a place where you get a homoclinic tangency and show that you indeed have a quality homoclinic tangency which will fall non-egenitally at these places. Okay, so that's a nice picture and you got, so there are of course many open questions and I will during this survey give many actually many open questions, one of which is one I think. One of which is one I think it goes back at least from the work of Sebastian von Strina. But I think maybe Milner also asked this question before, which has the following thing, is whether when you fix, like when you look at the level of entropy, it is connected. So here, like in this picture, for instance, we see two regions with 0.5.2. Okay, so it's a lower bound, it's not an exact number, but like what. but like like uh like what ask this question is whether they are connected whether there is a path in orange with the same entropy here so this is unknown what is known is that if you if you take a horizontal strip like a horizontal line then you can have a two different components of the horizontal line with the symmetropi which are not connected so that's a possibility but you got a disopen problem for the anomal map okay so let's continue Okay, so let's continue. Another piece is from differential numerical systems which have interacted with NOMAP is Ronormization nearby homocliny. So let me recall that homoclincy, you got a saddle point, okay? And for a saddle point, you got like so hyperbolic point. You got a stable manifold, an unstable manifold, and you assume that this homoclin tangency is tangent at some point. Moving tangency is tangent at some point, okay? So it's not transverse, but it has a tangency point that you can assume to be quadratic. Okay, so like if you look at in a chart, you will have a quadratic like a S square here. Okay, and what you are going to look at now is that you are going to unfold the Samopian tangency. So you are going to suppose that when you look at the tip of this parabola and you are going to change your dynamic in a To change your dynamic in a family, one parameter family, the tip of the parabola is going to move with positive speed on the parameter A very. Okay, so it's not it not remains sticky on the tangency. So if you do so, like after a small parameter, near by zero, you will have this picture here. And then if you take a little square at the tip of the power. At the tip of the parabola, this tip is going to be sent, like this rectangle, is going to be compressed vertically and stretched horizontally, so that this rectangle is going to be sent to that rectangle. Okay, so what you're going to have. And then what's going to happen is that your rectangle is going to follow your install manifold. And if you choose the rectangle, the initial rectangle well, it will go back exactly inside this rectangle for a knit value of the info. a knit value of the unfolding okay so we'll have this uh this picture and uh so after a few iterations what we somehow like uh try to give evidence like an idea of proof of why for a certain parameter of the unfolding you will have this rectangle which will be sent in that position that relative position so then you got this uh which actually go back uh to the work of uh Work of Teddy Skinali Lally and York in the article Hofton Map Display in Thinking Things, and which have been also written in better detail. So this was for the linear case and for the non-linear case and immunising the proof, like the proof also normalization, like the following result for normalization of this in the 90s and also like the present form. And also, like the present form that I'm setting here is a work in progress, which has the following thing. Okay, so if you have an unfolding or diffomorphism, which in that situation, so you are unfolding non-degenerately your quadratic commercial tendency. Then you know that you can find an affine map, Q, which goes from minus 3 to 3, which is arbitrarily close to zero, which means that you can. To zero, which means that you can make this half-n map with a range of very close to zero in any neighborhood that you want, and an iterate n, so that the first return map to a neighborhood of this, which will be the nth iterate, will be contributed to that inner map, okay, s square plus s plus minus b s dot y times that stuff, okay, like one plus perturbation, okay, comma x. Okay, comma X. So you can have this form. So what is the S? Like I renormize the parameter. So I'm not looking at F A, but I'm looking at F of Q of S. Okay. And the S is the same that I got here. Okay. And here, what is like if I take eta equal to zero, I will have a NO family, like a kind of NO family. But I don't have eta equal to zero, but I got a family which is infinitely small. On the other hand, you got a B. hand you got a b like this this family of numbers which is super close to be a constant okay so what you what you can deduce from this like from what we we have okay so first we you see that somehow like a NOMAPS does appear in any unfolding of homogeneity tangency and this is a situation which is very common in dynamics so it somehow legitimates the study of So it somehow legitimates the study of real dynamics in maps, okay, because it's like the actual model for this kind of families. Another thing that you can observe is that when you take a long iterate, okay, and assume that here you got a Jacobian which is smaller than one, like the determinant of the saddle point is smaller than one, then what you are going to obtain is that your rectangle here is going to be... Your rectangle here is going to stay a very, very, very long time nearby the saddle. And so it's going to be compressed, like the determinants, like the area is going to be compressed a long time. And then it's going to run a finite number of iterations here and go back. Okay, so the BS will be very small. Okay, this BS will be very small. And when you have a BS very small and you can have any S, in particular, you can have S equal to zero because it belongs to this value, then this gives you. Then this gives you the existence of attacking fixed points nearby mocking tangency. So, this implies a result attributed to New House. We tell you that when you unfold our mock intangency, you have a sink for a small paradigm, which is small parameters and for him. Okay, so that's one of the results that I really like, which are very old now. Down now, and another result that I are among my favorite is the one of Anioros, which goes back to 1979. And he shows the following thing, like the first result is that say that when you have a quadratic original unfolding, so the situation that I have above, then there is a horseshoe, so like this horseshoe, the same as before, which is very robust mutual tendency. So what does that mean? That means that you are going to have the same. To have the set of stellar manifold of your horseshoe, which I depicted vertically, which are going to be tangent and robust way to the set of unstable manifold of your hosho. Okay, so like this. So you get here very much a counter set time interval. You can follow it, and he shows that you can have this situation where these two counter sets are going to intersect each other robustly. Okay. So from this, as a So, from this, as the pair digit points are dense in your horseshoe, it's very easy to have a perturbation of this, which you're going to have a homocontinuity of a pair of point. And so you're going to be like whether your detail is smaller than one, then you will have infinitely many things which will appear in a like a generically. So, in this paper of neurons, he actually shows that this does appear for the This does appear for the normal map. Actually, it's not hard to see that it appears for the new map. You take the, I mean, I could have begun with this, but when we start with the TV check parameter, so x squared minus two and b equal to zero, then we have some homookine tangency between the orientation radiusing saddle point, orientation preserving a saddle point is going to be tangent. Okay, so that's a to as also mentioned, I'm mentioning also this. As also mentioned, I mentioned also this with the work of Ichion Aral. At this parameter, here you get homo contingency, and this is unfolding. We have an unfolding of this. And it's very easy to show that for small parameter, you do have a Mo Kintens unfolding for the map. You can show also that you have a mini everywhere here. In the place, like all the males of each parameter for the real mapping, like a cochlear mapping, those follow. cochoatic mapping does follow and give you leads to homoclinton fleeing okay so that's the that's it for the differentiable dynamics and i might uh continue now with uh some routes on the uh on one dimensional dynamics okay so that's another topic with the different people and so here is a very famous And so here is a very famous before Cauchy diagram that you have for the quadic maps. So it's another parametrization. So this is with this parametrization of the quadic family, which as I think everybody knows is equivalent to S square plus A, but with a different value. And what does depict this diagram of verification? It says that when you take a R here, almost all of non-escaping points is going to converge to attracting fixed point, which is here. Fixed point, which is here, and at this parameter of R, these points became parabolic and follow then to be recursive and give birth to two pyodic points. Okay, so like one attracting cycle of two, which are going to attract almost every point, which are not going to escape to the infinity, okay. Actually, all the points are going to land here to a pair of orbits. A pair decorbit, and almost all of them will be attracted by attacking the decorbit, which is this one. And you continue again, and you get again this beautification diagram, like where you got the beautification of this point, this saddle point, this attacking point is going to flip and give us to four points and one and one. And this button appears again like this, and you can see a self-similarity of this figure arriving to that parameter. Okay. And what you have at this parameter, which is called the Fagan Bone parameter, is that after this, you start to have positive topological entropy. And before this, you get zero topological entropy. Okay, so that's the bifurcation rhythm that I think everybody saw once in their In their life, at least. And here is a theorem contributed to Fagenbone, Coulet Resser, which says the following thing, is that if you start with this parameterization of your quality family, it says that there exists a sequence of numbers A n which is increasing and which converge to a certain parameter A infinity and so that for every infinity and so that for every interval a n a n plus one all the non-escaping orbits are attracted by a periodic cycle so which might be uh repulsive or attractive but there is a unique one which is uh attracting and its period is two to the n okay so you get this discussion so the one i just mentioned you in this picture and at the at the limit parameter so at a n equal to a infinity actually it's not there is no attracting cycle but That there is no attracting cycle, but there is an odometer. So, what is an odometer? It's the dynamic which is conjugated to the addition by one on the projective limit of Z over two and Z. So, you get this projective limit. So, it's a dynamic which is zero entropy again, and which will attract almost all orbits. And another point that they prove is that this that this ratio, okay, n plus one minus a n, or the a n minus n minus one, exists and with some universality. So what does mean universality is that if you perturb the family, you will have the same limit. So that's like an important select of them. And what we what Cavalier Beach Martins did and Artoliubich Martin Abaidense did. Yubich and Martina-Bayden Sadil, that they show that this scenario does occur also for NO mapping with small Jacobian. So more precisely, they prove that there exists a very small epsilon on a function B, like functions B, which are going to continue all the A n, but in the plan. Okay, so you're going to have a curve and you can follow the A n, like here it's n of zero, and the n of zero can be. n of zero and the n of zero can be followed for b small and such that for every b smaller than epsilon you will have that this sequence a n of b satisfies the three like these four properties for the family where you freezed the jacobian b okay so you freeze this jacobian b and then you will have that this normal mapping uh will satisfy those three like those four conditions meaning that you will have for every You will have for every B small, like for all this travel, you will have all the non-skipping orbits will be attracted by the stable manifold of a pi dig cycle, one of which will be attracting n of pi 2 to the n. Another thing would be that as the parameter b equal to a equal to infinity, you will have that will be attracted by this other meta. Okay. And you will have the same limit here, we will be working as well. Okay, so that's. Okay, so that's the result they prove. Like how to prove it? Okay, so I'm going to be a very to give a very sketchy proof. I mean, it's a deep work. It shows a field, actually, like this kind of work. But I'm going to try just to give you the idea of how it is working. So you start with the individual maps. And this is a graph of the animal maps, which is like this. Okay. And you Okay, and you assume that you got a three interval which is this property. So you got like the interval blue and green, which are sent into the interval red. So this one, okay. So this one and this one are sent here and here. And the red one is sent to the blue one. Okay. So that when you look at the second iterator of your mapping, okay, you got your red one, which go back to the red. Your red one, which goes back to the red one in that way, okay. And so then you define actually a mapping from uninterrupted maps to uninval maps if you rescale this interval to the original size. Okay, this is called randomization operator. To do this kind of thing, you are going to start with a kind of mapping with a certain shape and go back to mapping with the same shape. Okay, you just reverse x by minus x, you rescale these two. scale these two be of the same range and you get an operator from the set of enormal maps into the set of enormous maps and what they prove is that this operator is well defined in the in the on the complexity and also it has some hyperbolic feature and uh and this is what is proven actually what you have here this this uh ratio here is an eigenvalue and this is eigenvalue of of a hyperbolic point or acclusive point which will be Hyperbolic point, a reclusive point, which will be the fixed point of this operator here. For the NOMAP, you actually prove that for B-smold, you have the same feature which appears. So I'll just draw a model for the ornamentation. You got the green and the blue, which are sent into the red, and the red, which is sent into the blue. And again, if you do a second iteration, you got the red, which is sent into the red. So you have the red, which is sent by two iterates in the red. There's a red which is sent by two iterates inside this one, and so you end up with a mapping up to a symmetry which has the same shape as the first one, and you define like this an operator that they show to be hyperbolic. Okay, so that's the rules ID of all they show. And like using this, you have your Jacobian using this operator, which is semantilate, which go exponentially fast, like super exponentially fast to zero, and you're able to catch up all the property of probabilities that you know for the for the That you know for the unival map, so that's like the rules idea of the argument, and how they prove that you have the same feature. That appear, okay. So, another work, so like we using completely different technique, more from topology, the one of Crovisier Pujal Tresa, which is much more recent. And so, what they start, they start with the same assumption as before. Same assumption as before, so you start with an NO map which is merely dispatchive. So here I could put any mapping of any degree provided that the discriminant is smaller than one of the d square. And they assume that you have an entropy equal to zero. And then they proceed somehow, like they try to imitate somehow the argument of Sharkovsky, but using again the hierarchy, like the dimensional. Like the emotional addiction they got using the branches that they got. Okay. And they are they obtain using this topological argument the following alternative is that either the limit set of any forward orbit is a periodic orbit and the set of paradigm points is finite or the map is what they say they call infinitely ornamentable so following the termology which is inherited from the the field I just mentioned before. The field I just mentioned before. So they say that the limit set of any forward orbit is a periodic orbit or anodometer. So anodometer, it is like a projective limit of some finite group, as I just mentioned you before. So before I was mentioning the projective limit of Z over 2nZ, but I could put more involved products, okay, say 2n, 3n, etc. And so And so as they show, sorry, like what's happened also, what they prove is that the path of the sensitive formation at the limit is two. Okay. So here is one of the examples. So like they managed to cut our disk. So this is their image. They cut the disk using several branches. Okay. And inside each of the branches, you got the Each of the branches, you got they show that you got some ornamentation domains, so here, like those red, which are sent to each other, and each of them again is sent is cut by some branches, and you get again a smaller ball here, which are sent to each other. What they prove is that the number, like the multiplication of the orbit, of the part of the orbit that you obtain is eventually equal to two. Okay, and so like a colony of Like a colliery of their results is that for the normal map, when you look at the limit, like at the boundary of the entropy equal to zero locus, okay, like so that's above the seigen parameter, there exists a sequence C so that all the paddock points have the pad which is a multiplicator of C. Okay, that's a consequence of their result. Okay, so so you got a very nice uh description of the dynamic. I mean, I think there are Description of the dynamic. I mean, I think there are still many questions open in that direction. But you got these two kinds of results now on the topic of randomization. Okay, so there are many other results on randomization. I could mention Peter Azard and many others. But I think it will make the talk too long to mention everybody again, so I apologize. Yes. Yeah, you have to ask a question si Roma speaking. Uh in in the the corollary, isn't the conclusion stronger than for every large enough period it must be a power of two or something like this? What is the quantifier for all the periodic points? Okay, so maybe I confirm you at the end of the talk whether it is this or not. Okay, so like for sure at the Okay, so like for sure at the end is something like this, okay? But uh, but I think it's something like that. I mean, I just copy-past the slide of Silver, so but I didn't read his article, so I cannot I cannot tell you like this whether the proof tells you this or not. Hello, Pierre. Hello, everybody. Yeah, I simplified a bit the statement. So we have an exact description of the set of periods. So it is the set of periods is a finite set. The set of pairs is a finite set and a union of sequences of that form, a finite union of sequences of that form, C times all the powers of two. So does it answer? Yes. Okay. There is a question about what is C? Can you characterize what is C? Well, in principle, you can get any C, but then inside the Henon family, we didn't we We didn't scan the parameter set to see what you get. No, I know, I know, but the question it will be an interesting question maybe to figure out even this C is possible different than one in the Non family for this Jacobian smaller than one quarter. Okay, so thank you for the comments. It's good uh to don't be alone to talk at a distance. Don't be alone to talk a distance. So that's nice. Okay, so let me continue. So, another theorem that I really like in one denotional dynamics is the one of Obo Wakeler. Okay, so this is one of my favorite theorems. And it says the following thing. It says that you got incountably many aquatic maps for which Lubeck almost every non-escaping. non-escaping orbits have the sequence of empirical measures which diverge. So like here is a sequence of empirical measures. So it defines a probability measure which is which is defined on the n-first iterate of your orbit, which start by X node. And so like this sequence of unprecedented measure enable to visualize to Visualize to see what is the statistical behavior of a point. And so, for like all the examples that were mentioned above, like axiom A and so on, like odometer and so on, what you have is that Lebesgue almost every point is going to have this sequence which converge. So you cannot necessarily define precisely where your dynamic is going to land, okay, but you can define in statistics what is In statistics, what is this behavior? And what our killer shows is that within the aquatic family, there are many parameters for which we cannot describe their statistical behavior. So it's a nice proof. And this actually, like one of the questions is, do we have a counterpart of this result in dimension two? And for now, no, we don't have. And for now, no, we don't have like we will see, but we have another thing, which is the notion of wandering stable components. So wandering stable component is sometimes called a wandering domain, but I think the terminology is not the best for some reason that I will. So I prefer to call it a stable component like this. Okay, so a stable domain for F is. The stalled domain for F is an open set for which you have asymptotic points. So if you take any two points in this domain, U, then you will have the distance between these two points, we will converge to zero. And then you can consider what is called a stable component, which is a maximal stable domain, okay, which is connected. Okay, so you so I should have put it's a connected. I should have put it's a connected open domain, and you consider a maximal stable domain. And so, stable domains are mapped into each other. And so you have two kind of stable components. You get either stable components which are prepiodic, which are eventually periodic and so need to held itself by a finite number of iteration. Or they can be wandering, okay, they are going to never go back to the same to. To the same tool to themselves. They're going to have an orbit which should be disjoint forever. Okay, so why I prefer to consider stable components rather than wandering domain is because when people ask questions whether wandering domain exists in differentiable dynamics, you got a statement of this kind of thing. So, is it possible to have a wandering domain which is not within the basin of a simple or within the basin of an attractor? So, you have to animate all the Attractor. So you have to animate all the list of the behaviors that you would like to have. Rather, here you got a formulation of stable components, which is, I think, more implicit and defined pretty well what you want, and which is very close to what we know in the complex dynamics about factor components, very nearby this term. Okay, so that's why I would like to promote this terminology instead of wandering domain. Terminology instead of wandering domain for those kinds of things. Okay, so what we prove with the Sebastian Bieber is that we can have a located set of mapping, of enumapping of the V Atmos V for which we have a wandering stable component. So, and moreover, inside this component, we have the sequence of ampere measure is going to diverge and accumulate in a huge set of measures. Set of measure. We also compute the order, like the number of covering number, the covering number of all the possible, like the number of covering that we have to do for the vastest time distance of all the possible measurements was huge, not maximal, but almost, I mean, super exponential, like a super polynomial of dimension infinite. B is anything. It's not anything, okay. Uh, it's not anything, okay. Of course, if you take b equal to one, it does not work. So we show that they exist b there exists b, and they exist an interval. Actually, this theorem is uh so we now we need five parameters, okay, and then it's open, okay. So, like for the family, you can pair to the family, it's c to open, okay. The argument is c to open, okay, but in principle, the chacovian half is by the proof necessary enough to be small or could be. To be small, or could it be also close to one? We need to have a jacobin which is small, but it's not that small. Okay, so I think we also use the term maldeceptive or something like this, but it's not one quarter, but it's not 10 to the minus 10. Okay, something like 0.1. It's something like this. Okay, so we have this kind of feature, and this proof actually passes to the complex. I mean, we prove like this that you can have a wandering factor component. That you can have a wandering fatu component, mean like those wandering stable components actually the real case of a wandering fatu component. Okay, so that proof here, I'm not going to explain it one more time, but somehow is a mixture between different techniques. One is of quantumization nearby channel from a contingency, another one is from the work of Uh the work of uh uh Soma and uh I don't remember the name. Okay, so like a mini work uh uh collivagas I think first from the Basilian with the Linuarch and then Japanese people which are Soma and somebody else I don't remember the name. So well there was this kind of technique where we mixed uh both uh study of bifurcation using sharp distortion tools, some trick about uh the bifurcation. Some tricks about the bifurcation and also some combinatorial scenarios that was previously observed by the Thornch Abalademic System Community. Okay, so let's continue. So as I told you, one of the questions, like those two phenomena are completely different. I mean, we have somehow the same conclusion, but not exactly the same. So what we have is that we have a So, what we have is that we have a set of positive measures which diverge statistically, but here the set of points which have this sequence to diverge has empty entire, okay? But full Lebesgue measure. Here, we have not full Lebesgue measure, but we have non-empty entire. So, that's two mechanisms which are different, completely different. And we know that this scenario cannot appear here because in dimension one, we cannot have one. Here, because in dimension one, we cannot have wandering fat two components or wandering several components. But here it's not known whether we can import in the enon this scenario. And this will be interesting to have this phenomena which appear in the enon family, really. Another question is whether we could lower bound from below the set of mapping for which we got a historical behavior. A historical behavior, okay. It's a non-statistical behavior. Sometimes, like this kind of behavior is sometimes called historical, okay. So, having this measure which diverge, like this sequence will diverge for a set of Lebesgue positive set of points, of initial points. So, whether this we can bound from below the set for which we have this with a uniform constant in a dense set. So, if we manage to do this, like from the thesis of time amino acid Liby. This will imply the existence of a generic set of mapping for which we have non-statistical behaviors. It will be very interesting. Okay, so I think like those questions are kind of hard, but maybe this one is not that hard, but this one I think is very hard. But well, it will be interesting. So, Rebecca, so can you say again what is why the phenomenon of HK or Hofwower is quite different than what you found in Okay, so what you have here is a wandering stable component. Yes. Okay, so you have an open set where everybody is going to converge to each other. So it's asymptotic. And all of the points will have the same statistical behavior, will not converge in user. Here you don't have components. It's not possible. You don't have this. Okay? So like from the top. So, like from the topological viewpoints, this is completely different. Okay, here, the set of points which satisfies this has is nowhere dense, while here, no, sorry, it's as anti-entire, while here you do have an entire. So, it's different from the topological point of view, but the same statistically. Like, from the look, the conclusion is not the same, but the set of points which satisfy this conclusion is completely different. Okay, here you get a small open set, here you got a U. Open set here, you got a huge set of total measure, but with a zero anterior. Thank you. So that's a dual. So it's the different. So like what we would like, for instance, to have is an ener maps for which you get all the points which are not escaping, which have historical behavior. It would be nice to have this. Okay. And if you can make it for a set of like a for a set of for a local For a set for a locally dense set of parameters will be amazing. Okay, you will have something very interesting. Okay. Hello? Can you hear me? Yeah, slowly, like the connection is poor. Pierre, can you I have a question. Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Okay. Uh so just I was wondering why um the requirement of locally dense set of HNOM maps is natural. Is natural here? Okay, so the more is better, okay. And so if you have a local dense set, it's kind of cool because you got an open set that you that has that kind of like okay. So if you have something which is locally dense, it's cool because you have more example. And the second thing is that here from this thesis, what you know when it's locally dense. What you know when it's locally dense, then you got a locally generic set of mapping. So it's not a very long term to be proved, but it's not a trivial term as well. And what you know is that then you've got a generic subset of, like a locally generic set of mapping, which are non-statistical behavior. And so this actually contradicts many conjectures from the 90s. Okay, so like or questions or like if you look at all those people from If you look at all those people from Smith School, okay, such as Shube and so on, like they all wonder whether it is possible that the generic systems as all like as all the begin of these points which have a statistical behavior. And it's a very important question in a differentiable dynamics, this equation. And so what does that say? But it's too fast to show that you have a local data set which satisfies this. At the moment, do we have an example of a quadratic camera? Do we have an example that could draw a canom map? Just one where the positive set is not. You get this example, okay? So you get this example of a nomap satisfies this, okay? But you don't like this example of a nomap satisfies this. It's not a quadratic enumerab, but it's degree five. And it is a locally dense set of maps which satisfy that you have divergence. But what's happening is that the Lebesgue measure of the wandering stable. The Lebanese measure of the wandering stable component is not bound from below. Okay, like in the proof, when you vary the parameter in this located set, the component can be very small. Okay. And the degree phi is the lowest degree where you found this phenomenon? So you can, like, what is important is to have five parameters. Okay, so you can be playing with a B if you want. But it's important in our proof to have five parameters. In our proof to have five parameters, okay. I don't know why I got one, two, three, four, five. Yes, so we don't manage to do better. Okay, so it's an open question also. Is this happening the party family, for instance? Okay, so our argument do not work appear and it means something, okay? And we try. So I think it's not completely, we try to be optimal. So it's not known. not known okay so should i continue uh so like the the really uh so the origin of enon of course go back to henon which is uh the conjecture of henon the very famous conjecture of henon in the 1976 and what he did at this at this stage there was this work of uh of lawrence uh which uh A climatologist, which was publishing an article in the Journal of Atmosphere Feed or something like this, and where he proved using simulation of the climate, like of the metal, but at the worldwide scale, that you can have an attractor that everybody knows, like the Lorentz attractor. And you show evidence that you got a sensitivity to the initial condition and even a strange attractor. And even a strange attractor. And what Enon was wishing to do is to simplify this attractor. So you can see the date is very much at the beginning of the informatic. And so he changed the equation of Lorentz to like what he was wishing to do is to model a Poincaré section, what is called in France Poincaré section, that is a section which is transverse to the flow. And he tried to model the behavior of the system. Okay, so that's very different. Of the system, okay, so that's very different to what people nowadays study as a transverse section of the flow of Lorentz flow. But for him, it was easier to study this and say, well, basically, Lorentz attractor do something like this. There is a part which is extended, another part which is folded. And this gives this kind of attractor. And then he choose this Jacobian and he said it, he write it. I choose the Jacobian equal to 0.3 so that we can see something on my figure. we can see something on my figure okay so like uh of course like for for uh for uh for numerical viewpoint it's very much much easier to to to plot iterate of uh the two variable mappings than plotting the iterative of the flow of a three-dimensional flow and so that's uh that's nice okay what is not nice is that if you put a value that we cannot reach in any cylinder in machine above okay 0.3 is another thing Okay, 0.3 is another thing. And this conjecture is completely open. I think nobody has any even any way to like a strategy or reasonable strategy to reach it in short term. By short term, I mean less than 10 years. Okay, so like, nevertheless, there are some work which are and some maybe long-term strategy. Which go back to the work of Jacobson. Okay, so Jacobson in 1981 shows the existence of a set of positive abbey measures of a real parameter A for which the quadratic map P of X has an SRB measure. So it's a measure which is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure of the real line. Lebesgue of the real line, and which has a negative Lyapunov exponent. So, that proof of Jacobson, uh, you got other versions, uh, version of many Carson that I'm going to explain in a second, but also of Rich Lee, Kyoko, Suji, Wong Yung, and many other that I cannot quote here. Okay, and another uh CRM, which I mean, a breakthrough for this uh domain is the one of Benny Carson and. And, like, one of the consequences of this breakthrough is the following statement. So, they say that for a small b, okay, like very small for like for this context is not b equal to 0.1, not even 0.0.0.1, but it's like some big power of minus 10. Okay. And they show that there is a set of positive open measure of measure of parameter for which Zoheno map. Parameter A for which the inner map displays an SLB measure. Okay, so in that context, SLB measure means a measure which is hyperbolic. So the Lyapunov of this exponent of this measure are non-zero. And also, if you can split this measure into a union of measure, like a mean of measure, which are absolutely continuous with respect to what is called the Pacine-Unsher manifold. So if you are not familiar with Pacine-Unsurmaniform, just think about Answer. Just think about unstable manifold, which is pretty much the same. Okay, which are in one-dimensional in this case. So, again, like there are many people who contribute to the topics. And I will discuss in more detail about this in a second. So, let me give you like a crash view of what is the proof of Bindi Carson. Of Bindi Carson and of your cost about this. Okay, so I will be very vague, but I just want to give you the flavor of the argument of what it is. So you start with the unimodal maps, okay? And you get here a critical point. You get a critical point, which is folded and sent like this. And like if you start with the x squared plus a with a close to minus two, this critical value is sent to that point, which is here replacing. That point, which is here recursive, okay. This is orientation preserving a fixed point, which is hyperbolic, and then you get a lot of expansion and you're going to continue like this. So, like the first attempt, you're going to have a lot of expansion for your post-critical orbit. And then you suppose that your orbit is free, okay? The post-critical orbit is free. So, you are in a free time. So, you never go back to the red region. Okay, so you arrive here and then you jump, you are here, and you rejump, you are here, you jump, and you jump, and you don't talk. But these games, you cannot. But these games you cannot continue it forever because otherwise you are going to avoid an interval of your space, and this corresponds to a pointer set in the parameter space. So you have to enter in this critical region, which is depicted in red. But when you enter in this one, okay, you're not going to fold on exactly on the critical point. If your point goes back exactly on it, you just create a super attractive periodic point. Okay, so you do this. You don't want this. Okay, so you do this. You don't want this is the scenario you don't want. So you are going to allow your critical value to fall down at some point here nearby, but not too close. Okay. And then what's going to happen is that your critical point is going to follow the critical orbit because it's close, going to have the same trajectory as the critical point had at the previous step of the induction. Okay, so you know it's going to stay a very long time outside of it. Outside of it, and at some point it's going to take expansion on this region which has been folded. So you arrive here at distance D, at the next iteration, the distance D square, but then it is expanded a very long time. And at some point, it's free again. It's not anymore in a binding position. And you continue to travel, escaping the red region. And again, at some point, you're going to be allowed to go back to this critical region. And so, what they ask is that the Is that the banning time, okay, that the banning time is in proportion small compared to the free time? This is the condition. Okay, so that's the idea of this. And what they prove is that if you have this, then you will have this correlation condition which is satisfied. You will have that the limit half of one of the n's of the log of the derivative of p A to the n is going to be positive. And this is what they prove also is that this condition is satisfied for. Also, that this condition is satisfied for a set of positive measures of parameters. Okay, so that's the Benedict Carlson proof of Jacobson's theorem and the backthrough of Benedict Carlson that this scenario can be produced again in dimension two. And this was not at all obvious to see because I mean we passed from dimension one to dimension two. So what they do? They start with a saddle point and you've got a hand. A saddle point, and you've got an answer manifold. And this Anssel manifold is going to play the same role as the real line, but now you will have to consider several segments. So they add several observations which work well like this. So if you take a segment, okay, like a blue segment, which is sent by an iterate of M, of F with some publicity, okay, which is called a public time. So don't give. Which is called Appalach Times. I don't give you the detail, but this terminology was introduced afterward by Marcelo Diana, Apabric Times, but appears already in the work of William Dickerson. So this segment, if this segment is sent after a certain number of iterates with some reprobability, then we know that the image of this segment is going to be a flat curve. Like this curve is going to be C2 close to the horizontal. So I take a parameterization of the image. Okay, so I take a parameterization of the NO map for which the uncertain manifold of B of beta, like the point, is close to B horizontal. So you got that this segment is going to be close to B horizontal. Okay. And likewise, if you take another segment, this one also is going to be close to horizontal. And this is the first thing. So you're going to be able to construct many horizontal segments in this way. And another And another thing that they notice is that if now you take one point here which is folded, so this point is folded like this, okay, and you assume that along its orbit it still have an expansion, like in the same favor as the collective man conditions that we saw above, which means that the norm of the derivative of the iteration of your mapping is increasing. I have a logarithm which is bounded from below by a positive constant. Okay, so it's on there. Then you got a So it's on there, then you got a very nice control of the tip, like the tip is pinched more and more. Okay, so you will have a geometry of this kind, okay. And so you're in this situation and now you can play the same game as in dimension one. You got the tip of the parabola, which are going to you are going to ask the tip of the parabola to be first free for a long time. So you got this tip which cannot enter in the critical region. Cannot enter in the critical region, which is around here, okay, for a very long time. Unless some point you go back to the critical region. And when you go back to the critical region, you are going to look at where it is close to. Okay, so maybe it's going to be close, like it spent a very long time nearby, like going to follow the same trajectory as this box. And so it's going to be close to this segment. And you start the session of a parameter. You start the session of a parameter, like what they first claim is that they assume that this fall is not close to the critical point and so can continue like this. So that's the idea of them. So what is kind of difficult to understand in the scenario, at least to write, is that you Uh, that uh, that you are going to have a structure given by many curves, and you see the curve do not have the same length all of the time, okay? So, it's uh like you have many, many curves, like the number of curves that you're going to construct and the number of critical points you're going to construct grows exponentially fast. And uh, and uh, then when you are going to move the parameter and do proceed to the parameterization, you have to follow all this structure and this is. Follow all the structure. And this is the tricky part of the proof. Okay, how to follow, how to move this parameter, how to follow all this structure. Okay, so let's go back. So like Yokos, okay, so like it was his inaugural lecture at the College of France was on the NOMAP and the Standard Map. Okay, so it was his initial program was to study this. You can find this video actually on the web now. And first, I don't know, it was in the same year or a little bit after, he defined the notion of some regularity as an alternative way to prove Jacobson's theorem contributionalizable in a higher dimension. So it was at the stage where he played a lot with puzzle pieces that I think in the audience many people are familiar to. And he was looking at interval. He was looking at the interval which are bounded by the orientation radar seam fixed point on his preimage. Okay, so when you take a equal to minus two, alpha is equal to minus one. Okay, and so you get this interval. So here it's alpha and here is minus alpha. And you consider interval like this, some interval which are sent onto this big interval with some distortion bond. So I'm not going to detail what does that mean by distortion bond, just because it's not important like this. Not important like this. I think like the main thing is more about the structure of the proof and the spirit than this kind of detail. So you get this interval which is sent with some uniform bound and then you can have an operation. But this regular interval, you can consider another regular interval here. And when you have another interval in this interval, Another interval in this interval, you can pull it back. Okay, you can pull back this little interval to spread image, which is here, and I denote this same interval like this. And this little interval is sent by this iterate and then this iterate to the full interval. Okay, so I construct like this, a new regular interval, this interval. Okay, so like for complex people, this interval actually is the real trace of your cost puzzle pieces. Okay, but you don't write this, of course. Nanto right this, of course. We call about he talked about regular interval, and so here was the concept he proposed. The concept was the concept of strong regularity. And he says that a quadratic map is strongly regular if when we take M, the first iterate for which the critical point go back into this interval, okay, this interval in black, minus alpha, alpha. Okay, then there exists a sequence of regular interval. A sequence of regular intervals, okay, so that you got that the first return maps belongs to the intersection of this sub-interval. So this means that the critical value, the first return map, is going to belong to a regular interval. And then you look at the return time of this regular interval, which is not the first return time. It's like the time for which this interval. The time for which this interval is going to be sent to this full interval with some distortion bond, and then you can you're going to assume that it belongs to another regular interval, and so on forever. So, that's the first condition. And the second condition that he has is that the proportion of the interval which are of order greater than m, so n of i k is the number, the iterate you need to go from e to. The iterate you need to go from E to this free interval. So, for which you get a large number is small compared to those for which you got a smaller order than M. Okay, so when you get an interval which is smaller than M in its proof, what does that mean? That means that you have an interval with a very nice hyperbolicity. So, those are somehow the regular intervals for which you don't have control on the hyperbolicity of them. While when you have an While when you have an order which is smaller than m, you will have uniform hypericity with nice uniform bounds. Okay, so this what he proves, that he proves that those strong variabular mapping are actually abundant. Okay, you get a set of positive measures for which you have this property. It's very easy to see that this property, a stronger regularity, implies correct men condition. Okay, so initially it's Okay, so initially he doesn't wrote it, but in the online version, it is written. Okay, so then the so as I mentioned, his aim was to go into the two-dimensional case, and so he adapted with the Pallis this formalism for the higher dimension. Okay, so they start, they replace now this segment by a square and they consider now vertical. Vertical script now, like the regular interval are replaced by vertical script, which are sent in this way. Okay, so like these are not expanded horizontally and compressed vertically. Okay, and like this, they define operations. Okay, so if you have two rectangles like this, those regular boxes, okay, if you have two regular boxes, what you can do is that you can look at the further image. Look at the further image, and then looking at the intersection of the first image with this strip, and then looking at the image again. Okay, and like this, you can extend very simply the star product. I mean, this is like the straightforward application of like generalization of the star product for the one-dimensional case to the three-dimensional case. So, you can have an operation between a rectangle in that way. In that way. Okay, what they define also is the notion of parabolic product, which is as follows. So you get a rectangle which is folded this way, and you assume that it intersects another rectangle this way. And so if you have this, but the same way you can construct two sub-interval, okay, two sub-rectangles, which are this way, and they find like this, two new rectangles. So they get some condition. So they get some condition. If this is not too narrow, if you have sufficiently spaced compared to this order, then this is still a regular box and will have a con condition. The horizontal will be still conded and so on. I mean, there are some details, but like the topological picture is exactly this one. Okay. So what they do then is that they start to study these two operations and show that some maximum Unsures that some maximal invariant set which contains a horseshoe of a certain order dimension together with a folding tangent like a hoping tangency will have a zero-label measure. This is our main statement and this is a set of parameters of dimension for the Roshus that they can obtain. Okay, so like on the other hand they face a few difficulties. So it's a very long paper I think it's somehow 200 pages or something like this. Pages or something like this, and they face some difficulties for the parameter selection. So, the first difficulties is that I told you, like, there were very much concern about how move the structure. So, you construct a new rectangle and you have new folding conditions as well, new parameter. And, like the way they got the MMA manage to explain the whole structure vary is to keep an interval of parameter and to say, okay, I. An interval of parameter, and to say, okay, I got a parameter interval. I got a family depending on a parameter of mapping, which will be strong regular to some order. And they say it's this, okay. And the way they will define at the end of the day strangular dynamics will depend on the family, okay? So which somehow affects the proof or the readability of the proof. And another thing they did not manage to do is to include the Net manager to do is to include the NOMAP. The NOMAP is somewhere here. Is a DU with one which is very close to here. The DS is very small, but the U to be one. Here is the entire region. So here is a program from Yokos. His program was to actually take all the square. So this rectangle here is kind of easy because it's a word which is where you don't have any. Which is where you don't have any robust local intendency, and here it's much more complicated. Okay, here, this is a standard map, and maybe the NO conjecture is about here. Okay, and Benny Carson Selem is here. Okay, so what I did in this work is that, ah, yeah, so why they didn't manage to get the NOMAPS is because in this definition of parabolic product that you have here. Harbolic product that you have here, they all the time, I mean, on all these operations they have, they work with a full strip of full length. Okay, where in the NO, what's happening is that you are allowed to work with intervals in row, which are not of full length. So, what I did in that work, which is published in this joint book, but in a separate article, that I extended the parable product to consider horizontal strips which are not of full length. Not of full length. Okay. And what also I did is that I consider the stool operations ago, in the same spirit as them, and I consider them in a symbolic way in order to have a definition of strong regular mapping, which is independent of the families you consider, which is intrinsic, which is completely topological or combinatorial. So that was my aim, that you don't have any like once you're Like once you're in a C2, an open set of C2 family of NO-like maps, you just have combinatorial ontopological characterization of the map, which are singular regular or single regular to some order. So that's what this enable to include the N-word factor following the same scheme like this. So like this definition that I put here is very close to the proof of Jacobson's theorem, which is published in the same book by Yokos. Okay. Okay, sorry, but uh, this type of operation, do you need to be in on light or could be any map in the disk? Okay, so kind of an infinite markup partition. I don't know, something that does not depend necessarily on being in light. Which work only because you got small Jacobian. Okay, okay. So then you can you can have a multi-critical maps, it's not changing. A multi-critical map, so it will not change anything. Also, like what, like in this uh proof, I implement the case of endomorphism. Okay, so it's it's actually any population of x squared plus a comma zero. Okay, so you got a but like yeah, I use the fact that you got a small Jacobian and actually you can already see the fact that the ds okay cannot be too large. Okay, cannot be too large in the argument. So it's not incredibly small. Like you got somehow a problem in the parameter section at some point that you can see that you cannot have too much the DS2 too large. Okay, besides the analysis. I mean, like the fact that I use Jacobian small for the analysis, I don't think it's a very big issue. I mean, I think if we are just the only problem to go to the store map, I would have killed. But the really But the really problem is DS, which cannot be too small because basically what you okay, so I don't have the slide to show this, but like what basically what the system is, is that you would like to have a net shape counter set, okay? So you got the Paysin-Sarr manifold of your mapping, which is a counterset of positive measure, but you've got many gaps, okay? And you would like to put a small counter set, which is quite. Like to put a small counter set which is correspond to the transverse direction of the Ensign manifold of the Ensign elimination, and you would like to make all of them tangent inside this. You would like all the critical points to be connected map. So you would like all the folds to be tangent to one of the pacing stable manifolds. And if you want this condition, actually, the gaps between the long stable leaf cannot be too large. And you get a condition. And you get a condition. I mean, we attempt with Morea to give a characterization of this, and it's somehow an LP condition. So, if you look at the size of the gap, you have that the sum of the gap to a certain power close to one should be finite. And this is a condition, and this exponent will bounce the other dimension of what you can do for the transverse for the DS. Okay, so you need a. So you need the V to be small for the parameter selection and also to show that there is some kind of distortion bounce when you iterate. Both, but like the big issue is the parameter selection. But if you make as an a priori assumption that every time you do your operation, you will have bounded distortion, this type of operation can be set in any so like what I thought, okay, to be uh to be uh clear what I what I at some point. Here, what I what I at some point I did some computation, and I think like following this kind of uh okay, I don't want to engage myself, maybe I'm recorded as well, but there are some hope if you eliminate uh the analytical part of this term or distortion that this uh this kind of strategy uh got the same other dimensions than uh what we have for the annual experience okay so like it's like the constraints that you have for the ds is not terrible You have for the ds is not terrible as well, okay. So, while the constraints that you have here for this metal, I think there are some hope to get the one of enome, okay? But there are some work still to do, but I think it's possible. And of course, it will not be exactly the same parameter as enum because you have a numerical like you can maybe show that there is one model with that other dimension, with with the same other dimension as computed by Eno. As computed by Enon, or like a successor for the Jacobian 0.3, which will be valid. But you have this problem. For the conservative setting, it doesn't work. Okay, this I'm sure. I don't know if I'm saying. Okay, so let me finish quickly. So, yeah, like one of the main question is whether you could do this with a smaller proof. Okay, of course, like all of Smaller proof, okay. Of course, like all of this proof are more than 100 pages, and you are like, uh, uh, like when you read this, and you would like to know, okay, so is there a way to simplify a little bit the story because it starts to be kind of too long, okay? Like if somebody like following those methods get to get the standard map, we cannot expect a proof which is smaller than 1000 pages. And I don't know if the 20 is ready to rephrase this kind of proof. So, either a short So, is there a shortcut to do with this setting? Or maybe they are using some organization tool and was thinking about like wallet factors or this kind of thing, like a different kind of combinatorics, maybe give you one example of strange attractors, which are not necessarily abundant, but just one example. Okay, so for instance, in the one-dimensional case, you can define very easily what is the meso-levitch parameter. On the meso-evitch parameter, you will have immediately that you get an SM measure and so on. You get any measure and so on, and it's very easy to show the existence of this. You don't need 40 pages of proof. So, can we do this for the NOMAP as well? Like, you got one example of strange factor for the NOMAP with a short proof, like less than 20 pages. Okay, so that's a question. And you can involve more. So, there is a nice survey by Sebastian van Strin that you can read about interaction. Okay, it's one-dimensional dynamics in the new millennium. Also, for the kind of stuff. The kind of stuff about normalization and normalization operators, you get many surveys of Jubich and Marco Martin that you can read on it. Okay. Okay, so let me just finish with some perspective. Okay, so there are no any results on the normal what I'm going to talk, but it's a topic that I'm liking to speed in now. And so I would like just to mention some possibilities. Okay, so that's about conservative dynamics. Conservative dynamics and like one of the things which kind of really hurt as a topic nowadays is the topic of the closing lemma. You got this work of EREA and then Azure K, EREA, and then all of this gas, which leads to the following result. That if you take a sampletic surface and then you have the following result that any sampletomorphism in a biogenic set of mapping, which are homotopy to the identity, will satisfy that the closure of the. Identity, we satisfy that the closure of the set of the palliative point is dense, okay, is equal to the full surface. So you got this result, okay, for genetic mapping in the C infinity. It could be a C1 actually here, I think. It's possible it works also for analytic. Maybe like one, what we don't know is whether it's true for a conservative energy. Okay, so this is not known. Like is it possible to have this? Would it be possible also to have this for entire Have this for entire or a visible perturbation of tonomap or inomaps. Okay, so this would be very nice to obtain a result of this kind to have plusigma also in this kind of category. Okay, so like the technique of this, the bad thing is that the technology that nobody understands, not even the people who write CRM on it. I would say maybe not, but like I'm not sure that not all of them are completely understand all of the detail of this. And for us, Understand all of the detail of this, and for us, from people from dynamical systems, we don't understand at all what's going on on this. And it's very frustrating for us. Okay, another thing which is nice is the work initiated by Franks and Le Calves and then Corope Kinacilli, and also there are some input by a contraversional leader. We give you a sufficient condition for some. Sufficient condition for some pectomorphism. So, some pectomorphism is just to say that you have a mapping which results the area. Okay. And which say that if you have two paradigm points, like if you have a new paradigm point with a resonant eigenvalue, okay, so you are so in the concerticity, you cannot generically forbid a point to be in the unit circle, but you can generically avoid him to be resonant, okay, to be. Be resonant, okay. To be uh rational, having a rational number like this, and you have also like this Kuka's fail condition, okay, that whenever you get uh perdic points which are hyperbolic, then you will have that the stellar manifold of the one, it will be transferred to the anti-manifold of the other. And the other condition they ask is that you don't have any annular rotation domain. Okay, so what is an a rotation domain? It is an invariant annulus, so you get an annulus. unvariant annulus so you get an alus in which uh in which uh there is no periodic point okay so without periodic points that's it okay so in this analysis one can show that all the points will turn within the same speed of rotation okay so those uh conditions which are explicit okay imply that you have your stabilizer Okay, implies that you have your stellar manifold of all your polypony will be dense in your surface. Okay, and so the same was true, of course, for answer manifold. And so, of course, we would like to know like a natural question whether it's true for conservative energy. Okay, so you got actually two problems to do that. First, you have to change your surface by the domain, like the non-escaping domain of the anonym, which is not as smooth as before, but all of these. Said before, but all of this proof is mostly topological, so maybe it's not the hardest point. Really, the hardest point is this one: okay, like how to escape, or with one parameter or two parameter or finite number of parameters, you got to kill, to blow up all the annular rotation domain which can appear. Okay. And another result, also, which is more recent by Le Carves and Sambarino, is that if you are in this sitting, that if you are in the in this setting and you have moreover uh you know moreover that your mapping display more than two j minus two per disk point so before you have a disk this condition is a is empty okay then you know that the the mapping f has positive topographic okay so that's the the other thing so like well you have uh the following question is uh is that true like is it possible to find a no map with an annular rotation NOMAP with an inner rotation domain. Okay, is it possible to add this? So, this is an inner rotation domain. So, you got a topological circle here, another topological circuit here, and you got an orbit here which turns with the same speed that the boundary of the two boundary. Do we know that actually the set of NOMAP with an inner rotation domain is with anti-intire? And can we find actually an untire symptomorphisms of R2 with an inner rotation domain? Reasoning our dislike, even know this, and uh and so, like, when you see this, you say, Well, I look like very antypical for an anti-R mapping, which is conservative to have an analog rotation domain. Look like very unusual. Okay, and actually, it was a conjecture of Byrkov, which conjecture which was impossible even for the scene. Even for the cylinder, it is wrong. Actually, it's possible to have it entire. So, like those, those entire annular domain does exist actually for entire mapping, but like those that construct was for mapping, entire mapping of R times R over Z. It's not anti-mapping of R2. So, like this also had some connection. Also, had some connection with complex dynamics because this kind of result, this counter-example of Birkov conjecture, gives you the existence of an automorphism of C over Z times C for which you have J which is not equal to J star. Okay, so I think I finish here this time. Thank you very much for your attention.
