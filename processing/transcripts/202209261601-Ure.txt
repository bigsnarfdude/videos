Jason Paul's talking to last Jason's talk about remote fair. Okay, thank you very much for the introduction and thank you for organizing this wonderful workshop. I'm very glad to be here. So yeah, I'm going to talk about twisting cool module, of course, in three regular forms and hurt. Course in pre-regular forms, and parts of this is going to look familiar from Pafini's talk, but I will remind you just because I know how easy it is to forget things after the talk. This is, oh, there we go. Okay, so first of twisting of an algebra by a graded automorphism, how does that work? So we start off with an algebra, just to make your life easier, let's make it Z-graded. Twisting outomorphism, and then the twist of that algebra is going to Of that algebra is going to agree with the algebra that I started with, and I just deformed my multiplication by adding in this sign there, which is my automorphism. This A here, the bars just mean that's the degree of A for A homogeneous. Okay, so just a simple example that's going to come up again later. So, for the Jordan plane, you can construct that very easily as twists. Construct that very easily as twist of the polynomial ring. So if you look at just Kxy is polynomial ring, phi is this map down there. And then it turns out that when you twist A, you get these relations. And you look at the relation that you get, it's like five minutes to compute, you get that the algebra that you would get is Kxyxy, with the relation xy minus yx plus ay squared. So that's the story for twisting by graded automorphisms. Twisting by a graded automorphism. This is kind of, we like what we do just because it's so easy to compute given a graded automorphism. Go in the wrong direction again. There we go. So one of the very nice things about this is that we know that so many properties that we want for algebras to have are going to be invariant on the list firstly. So for example, graded module categories are going to be invariant. The areas of regularity just stays the same on any. Just stays the same on, and you can look at the non-commutative projector schemes, schemes associated to the algebra that stays the same. The Alfonsoff dimension stays the same. And in fact, Jiang in 1996 proved that if you kind of generalize this twisting to so-called twisting systems, then in fact this fact that the graded module categories are equivalent actually is an if and only if. Actually, it is an if and only if. So if an algebra is, well, if two algebras have equivalent grading magic categories, then they're also going to be twists of each other by those simple twisting systems. And that works not just for Z gradings, but for more general gradings, but I won't go into that here. Okay, so that's twisting an algebra by graded automorphism. Now, what I want to do is other way. So there's another way that we can also So there's another way that we can also twist that kind of shows up naturally if we in fact have a Hop algebra acting on the algebra to start with. So if I have a Hop algebra H that acts on A, infinite or finite dimensional, it doesn't really matter, what we can do is we can cosycle twist. So for that, I'm going to need a two co-cycle on my Hop algebra, which is just a linear map from H into H to K that satisfies this. To H to K, that satisfies this formal co-cycle condition. And that this later part on the right, that that's really just normalizing the way the computations work out nicely. Charlotte, you can use the pointer instead of point to the screen. Oh, yeah, I can. Oh, it makes the zoom go crazy. Okay, I'll do that. Okay, so we can, now this is what Padmini mentioned earlier. When we have our Hopalgebra, we can tweak. Our Hopf algebra, we can twist the Hopf algebra by the two-po cycle, which is just the Hopf algebra stays the same as the co-algebra, but we deform the product by our two-po cycle. Which I know it looks complicated, but in the end it is computable in this sense that we can write down the relations for the new algebra that we give. And so earlier in Python's talk, we saw how given a gradient to a gradient automorphism, in fact, a Great at a warfare, in fact, a twisting pair is what we called it. We can actually construct the two co-cycle given by that, oh, given explicitly by that, I said this does not quite make sense that I wrote there. But we can, like starting with a pair of automorphisms of H, we can actually construct this two-post psychomosplicity. So, what I actually want to talk about, though, in this talk is given Is given all of this, I can't just twist my algebra H, my Hop algebra, but I can actually twist by that cosine the underlying or the algebra A that I'm acting on. So because the cosycle twisting gives me an equivalence, a tensor equivalence of the co-module categories, so co-modules of H mapping to co-modules of H sigma, where H. Comodules of H sigma, where H sigma is the twist, I can define this twist of A, which is a commodule algebra of H. And in fact, writing this down, we can just we can define what actually is happening. So the twist of A by, I write it as sigma inverse, but it's really like it happens under this equivalent, this tensor equivalence of category there, is that it still stays the same as p vector space. It still stays the same as k vector spaces, then I'm going to deform my multiplication again. And I'm going to deform it in this way by the two co-cycle. And I use sigma inverse there, which is just the convolution inverse of the two co-cycle sigma. And so the goal is, well, one of the goals is to see, okay, how does this, this twisting now of A as a co-module algebra, how does this interact with the January? Other systems interact with the Yang toys thing that we know and that we like, because again, it's very computable, we know how to do it. So, one of the things I want to go into there is we can actually realize every, so that's going to be the result here in a bit, we can actually realize every Zhang twist as this particular toko cycle twist using a toko cycle on Manning's Universal Point. So, let me get a little. So let me get a little bit into the definitions here. And this is being slightly vague here. But so if I start with the z-graded algebra, I'm going to give you what the universal quantum group is in this sense of Madden. So we say that a Hoppe algebra H right coax on A, preserving the grading if each homogeneous component is actually right H coacts. Is actually read HCO module via my co-module map. And so then the universal quantum group is just going to be the hop algebra that does this universally. So it satisfies the universal property that does the, you draw the right triangle that does this and then you do test against everything else. And so just a remark that this thing does always exist as long as A is local finite. local finite, which just means that we need every, if you write A as a Z grade algebra, every A sub n should be finite that location. And so our first statement there is this kind of twisting works well with the construction of this Man's universe quadruped. So what do I mean by that? So if I start with the degraded locally finite algebra. The de-graded locally finite algebra. Yeah, locally finite, I need there so that the universal quantum group exists. Then, for any left two co-cycle, I get that the twist, so this first thing here, this is Manus universal quantum group of the two co-cycle twist of the algebra. So I just deform the multiplication of A. And then this part here on the right, this is the two co-cycle twist at the Hop algebra side. So this is, I deform the Hop. So this is I deform the Hop the algebra structure now of the Hop algebra by the tuple cycle. And so as a consequence, because we know that on the right, we know that algebras, or HAP algebras, if they are two cosycles twisted up each other, then they're going to be Morita-Takuchi equivalent, meaning their graded co-module categories are actually equivalent. Equivalent. And so that means that because I get this C on the right, I actually get that out R, so the minus universal coin group of the twist is actually Moriji to QG equivalent to the original minus universal coin group. And so I should mention here that this is actually a special case again, of a result of Of a result of Rachel's and Wandenberg from 2017 to prove that as long as we have two Kuzul-Aries regular algebras of the same dimension, their minus universal quantum are going to be huge equal. And so we just proved a special case of this statement on the previous slide just for twisting. Wrong direction again. All right. So let me. So let me step back a minute now for what I remember what I mentioned, what was one of the main goals was to start with an algebra. So we start with our Z-grade algebra and a grade allomorphism. And I want to describe this twist here, this A phi, this right twist of my algebra. I want to describe this as some two co-cycle twist given a two-co-cycle onto A two-co-cycle on some Hopf algebra. So, how am I going to do that? So, the first step is using this pi, we're going to construct a twisting pair, which that's what Papini talked about earlier, on Manus Universal Pronunciation. And then as a second step, well, not quite Manus Universal Pronoun, on the, not sure what the name for this is. This is the end version instead of the out version. Ent version instead of the out version. It's not the hop envelope, but the underlying bioalgebra. I'm not sure if it's called universal bioalgebra, yes. And then from there, we extended the hop envelope, which is minus universal proton group. And as a last step, from that pair, from that twisting pair, we actually get an explicit 2% group. And so, in fact, what's the statement now? So, if I have any, well, Any, well, not any, but if I have a locally finite connected gradient algebra with M honing simulations and a gradient automorphism, then I can explicitly write it as a two co-cycle twist with a two-cocycle on the monitoring versus quantum. And so in fact, in this way, we can really realize every twist by a great homomorphism as a as this kind of two postycle twist law. All right, any questions at this point? So one of the big things that I mentioned of why do we really like John twist, why do we really like twisting by great automorphism, we really like this because there are so many invariant properties. And so one of the questions we ask, okay, now looking at this kind of what general construction. Now, looking at this kind of more general construction, what properties do we still keep? And so, there were a couple kind of hopeful results that maybe this would still work. And so the first one is, as I mentioned, for a twist upgraded algebra by grade algebra, we know this works. We know Art and Schultz regularity is preserved. In fact, the kind of dual version, so for Drinfield twists, this was proved by John. This was proved by Chan Kirk and Wolf Yin Zhang in 2018. And then, actually, for co-cycle twists of an H commodule algebra under the assumption that H is finite dimensional, this was proved by J. Rosito and Smith in 2019. And so we extended this now to our standing, which in particular works for H infinite dimensional. So for H any algebra in sigma two cycle and H and A is just connected A is just a connected gradient commodule algebra, then we get that if A is n-cause, then its twist is as well. And in this case, meaning we do have the assumption that our underlying algebra, our co-module algebra A, does have to be encouraged here because that's just how our proof works. Then we get that A is actually A is regular if and only if it's twisted A is regular. Now there are of course many other properties that would be very interesting to explore here. Would be very interesting to explore here, which we would probably do in the future. So, at this point, for the last five minutes, I'm going to switch gears a little bit because I'm going to talk about superpotential algebras and pre-regular forms, which we're going to apply all of this to that kind of big class of examples. Let me get into that a bit first. So, first off, First. So first off, let me tell you what a preregular form is. So a preregular form is just, it's a linear form on a vector space. So it's an emulated form on a vector space V. So that I want it to be non-degenerate in some sense. So that first condition is a non-degeneracy condition. And the second is some sort of like rotation condition. So for the second, I want f of v1 to vm. I want f of v1 to vm to be equal to f of psi of vm, and then becomes v1 up to vm minus 1, where I just rotate all of them through, where psi is just any element in gl. And then we can define the algebra associated to our pre-regular formula, oops I'm not supposed to point, we can define this algebra here as an algebra with just n general numerators x1 through xn, and then we write out our relation there. out our relation there. So those are relations for every I1 through m minus n. So this looks very complicated and in fact we can add that this is it's not just a big class of examples but in fact really a lot and a lot of algebras can be written in this way and so Dubrois Guillet in 2007 proved that any n cuzur as regular algebra Kuzul as regular algebra that is generated by n elements in degree one can in fact be written in this way. Now, the way that I prefer to think about it is not quite with these pre-regular form, but I rather think about it in terms of so-called superpotentials. So let me tell you what those are. So those are going to be the dual version of this here. So a twisted superpotential is just some element in the tensor product. element in the tensor product v to the tens n, where v is my vector space again. And I just needed to satisfy this condition that up here that when I rotate through my different, how do I say, like this is some kind of like, this is really equivalent to that second kind of symmetry condition that I had for the pre-regular form, which is really the dual version of like. It's just really the dual version of writing it down. And so, just as a remark, so in this case, an explicit representation of a minus universal quantum group is actually given by Kirusito, Waltham Wong. And tomorrow, Ken Basha will actually talk about how we've used this presentation to actually construct explicit Morita technique equivalents for Morita, for monetary. For Males Universal Fund. That's going to come tomorrow, but let me give you a couple examples just to give this a little bit of mean. And I have to say that I shamelessly stole these examples from the Georgie DeWalton Warm paper, so credit belongs there. And just to tell you a little bit about these superpotentials. So first off, as I said, a lot of algebras can be written with superpotentials, but they're sometimes a little bit harder to find. Find, but there are algorithms that you can use to actually construct these. So, for example, if you want to write polynomial ring in x, y, and z, so in three variables, this element up here, this here would be the superpotential associated to that. And as I said, like you can you can kind of see the symmetry already going on in the way that it's written down there. And for that superpotential, the associated pre-regular form, you get that just by. Associated pre-regular form, you get that just by looking kind of at the coefficients. So, for example, the pre-regular form x tends to y tends to z, that gives you the coefficients here of x, y, z for the superpotential. And so in this case, we can just compute the resulting relations that you would get, and then you get your pre-regular formula. Sorry, not your superpotential algebra there. Similarly, you can also write down this Kleanen algebra. This Glianen algebra, also with the superpotential. In this case, the superpotential is this here. And again, you could kind of see where the symmetry is showing up there. And you can just really associate this one element to the algebra and describe it very explicitly. Now, what we've actually worked with is not quite the superpotential algebra, but we've worked with a kind of more general version of it, which is a so-called direct. Which is a so-called derivation quotient algebra. So, again, I want you to remember how explicit the superpotential algebra was, and this is just really a version of that for higher-dimensional things. So, let's say n and m are two integers. V is a finite dimensional right co-module over the half-algebra H. We have a sub-comodule in there, W. And then we define the derivation as the. As the image of this composition. And then we inductively define, just we take derivations again and again and again, and then the derivation quotient algebra is this thing. And now, again, remember how explicit it was before for the superpotential algebra, and that's just the case when W is one-dimensional, it's just KS, where S is the superpotential. Alright, so. Alright, so one of the nice things is that for these derivation quotient algebra, it's possible to very explicitly compute twistings. So this is a result of Morgan Swiss from 2016 that they described very explicitly what happens if you twist by a greater automorphism, if you twist the superpotential algebra or derivation quotient algebra associated. But if you twist the derivation quotient algebra by a graded automorphism, then you can very explicitly describe the new superpotential or the new subspace that defines the derivation function of the problem. Let me give you an example for this coming back to the very beginning of the talk, to that Jordan plane, if you remember from my very first slide. So there we had, so my vector space V is just Kx plus P1. just kx plus ky. The superpotential there is xy minus yx. And I'm going to just say that the associated superpotential algebra is just the polynomial rating two variables. So there's no derivation really going on there because I'm too low-dimensional. And so we said when we twist this, we get the Jordan plate. And in this case, how do I get, so the new superpotential is just this relation here, how do I get that new superpotential? I just compute phi inverse tensor the identity of the old superpotential. Inverse tends to have the identity of the old superpotential. Okay, so it's very, very explicit on how you get from one superpotential to another. And now we generalize this, so in our sense of generalizing to twisting by two co-cycle. So if we have a Hop algebra, H, and B is a finite-dimensional right H co-module, and J is an embedding from the sub-comodule W. From the sub-comodule W, and then we have our tucco cycle, just setting up all the notation. And then we explicitly, so I'm gonna go through the construction in a minute, but we can explicitly construct what happens under the twisting here. So how does this, well first off, okay, first off, using this, remember from the very beginning, so we get this identification of minus universal one rule. But actually, what I want to finish with. But actually, what I want to finish with is how we actually compute the W sub sigma. So, how do we compute this kind of new subspace of the new superpotential that we get when twisting by 2 cosine? So, the way we get this is really, it comes very kind of from the categorical equivalence. So, it comes from the tensor equivalence here. So, if we have, remember, we have a tensor equivalence from H. equivalence from H to H sigma. And so this one takes AWN. So H, remember H is the algebra, the Huff algebra that acts on AWN, that acts on my superpotential algebra, derivation quotient algebra. And so I get, because it's a tensor equivalence, I get these maps here to my kind of new tensor product in this co-module category here. In this co-module category here. And then now, what's my new superpotential going to be? My new superpotential is just when I look at what happens to my new tensor product when I just look at F at what happens to my tensor product from V tensor M to when I look at this not as a co-module here, but as a co-module on the front side. All right. Thank you very much for listening. Questions for Cheryl? Let's see how I got oh they were emoji claps. Chris Kirbel and Girl and Daniel Chan and OG Pat. Yeah, well, we're just to compute superprotection.
