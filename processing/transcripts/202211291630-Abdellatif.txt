It is a pleasure to introduce Roma Lupelati, I think, from Université de Pa Picardi, Yuba. Yes. I think. That will talk about the P modular representation of the Langans problem. Yes. P-modular representation of P-iadic groups. Yes. So thank you for the introduction and for the invitation to be here. To be here. It's really a pleasure. I mean, the place is wonderful. And so my talk is, I think, the only one in which we will look at what happens when L equals P in some sense. So far, we've avoided as much as possible to look at representation of our fields of characteristic P. So here we just go and do this. So if you need a motivation of why we do this instead of, oh, but what happened when L equal P? Oh, but what happened when L equals P? Maybe I can just give some motivation. Well, it's we would like to have a mod P language program also. So the thing is that, for instance, let me start from a nice example coming from number theory. If you look at an elliptic curve over Q and you look at its p-torsion point, And you look at its p-torsion point, then you get a p-modular, so with coefficients in a field of characteristic p. So p-modular representation of the Galois group. So of the full Galois group. So it's the absolute Galois group of Q but inside the Galois But inside the Galra group, if you look at the decomposition group at P, then you have a group which is isomorphic to the Galois absolute Galra group of Qp. Okay, so P-adic group. So it's a P-adic Galois group. So here it's the Galois side in some sense. Okay. So again, just for the record, P-modulo is with coefficient. With coefficient in a field of characteristic P, P being a prime fixed once we move. Okay. And if you go on the, let's say, PRI group side, automorphic side in some sense, if you're interested in congruences between modular form or automorphic form, Form or automorphic form. Then you get modular representation. So appro, it's not just P, it's for any prime L. You get an L modular representation, but there is no reason to exclude L equal to P in this setting. So you will get P modular representation. Of this periodic group we've seen in Sean's talk. So here G will be any connected reductive group defined over F. And F is the same F as usual in some sense. So it's a local non-Achimedian field. So it's either a finite extension of Qp or Of Qp or a Laurent series field, a Laurent series field with coefficient in a finite extension of Fp. Okay. And well, if we believe and we believe the Langlands philosophy in some sense, then what we should get, the question, let's say, broad question. Broad question, mostly unanswered so far. Can we connect? So in a natural way? P-modular representations. So here I will write off GF, so the absolute Galois group of F, but okay, if you But, okay, if you were a little bit familiar with classical Langlands correspondences, you know that it's not a representation of the full Galva group that we usually look at. But let's say that in the P-modular setting, as we basically don't really know what we should look for, then we first start by looking at representation of this big Galois group and then try to refine a little bit what happens. Okay, and maybe spoiler, in the few cases that are known so far, it's really representations of this food group. Really, representations of this food group that are in the game. Okay, so can we connect these representations to, let me say, some p-modular representations of this P-addi group here. Okay, so what do I hide in this sum? Nothing very mysterious. Mysterious, so it's of course smooth representations, admissible ones. So why admissible ones? Well, because like the representation that naturally exists, let's say in some sense, are usually admissible. Like if they are kind of connected to number theory or arithmetic geometry, they are admissible. And we would already be really happy if we can understand what happened for the irreducible representations. Okay, so this is really the first step because as we already saw in the complex case, knowing irreducible representation of G is not enough to know all representation of G. The category is not semi-simple. But in the complex setting, at least we have tools that allows us to understand what happens. Here, I'm Happens. Here I must warn you. So now comes a series of warnings. So the first warning is that even for so the group K that we saw earlier, so let me write this a bit sloppy as the integral point of G. Okay, so it's this maximal open compact subgroup that we have. So even for K, So, even for k, representations are not semi-simple, p modular. Well, I mean, all representations here are p modular, okay? So, representations are not semi-simple. So, we don't have Mashka theorem of that kind of thing, okay? So, even when we look at this point as this group, we cannot hope to understand like even finite length representation of this group K only from the irreducible. Only from the irreducible ones. So I can give you a very concrete example, I mean, very concrete references. No, because giving example would be really technical and not very fun, but just let me say that even for GL2QP or SL2QP, so inside you look at GL2ZP, the integral points, or SL2ZP. So even for this like baby case in some sense, Like baby case, in some sense, it's not true. Okay, so for this one, it's Stéphane Numora's work. I think it's 10, 2010. And for this SL2 case, it's joint work with Mora and it's 14. And maybe I can say something here if there are people interested in representation of five. interested in representation of finite groups, p modular ones, is that there are some questions in p modular representation of finite groups that are kind of, how can I say that? That are not very well understood. So for instance, if you look at GL2 of FP, there is something called the Brower tree of this group that allows you to understand irreducible representation of this group. But if you go to GL2 of a finite extension of Fp, so another finite extension Finite extension of FP, so another finite field, there is no such analog of Brower tree. And it's a question to ask. I mean, one of the questions is what can replace this Brower tree? So there are some things like tilings or things like that by Sean, but really it's something open. And the very fun thing is that when we look at the restriction to one of these, to this K of an irreducible smooth representation of GL2QP or of SL2QP, then we To QP, then we, in some sense, realize this boreal tree via this extension, this k extension. So maybe if we understand the irreducible smooth representation of this group, when not QP now, but let's say an unramified extension of Qp having residual field, let's say FQ, then maybe in the restriction to GL2 of OF or SL2 of OF, we would find what should replace this bar. What should replace this bower tree? But as you will see in a moment, when F is not QP, we barely know anything. So it's kind of two equivalently difficult problems. And okay, which one will have to solve which one? It's not so clear. Okay, so back to p-adic representation, to what P representations. Okay, just a little parenthesis. I just said p-iadic representations. Okay, you can also wonder what happened if you look at representation. Happen if you look at representation over, let's say, QP bar, for instance, here. Okay, so it's a problem which is very closely related to that one, and it's not easier. Okay, so what I will say in let's say as negative results in this setting, mostly transfer to the PRI case too. Okay, okay, so that's the first warning here that you have to be careful. You don't have any mash Ethereum or that kind of thing. Another thing also, like. Another thing, also, like we've seen this Haar measure appearing very early in this representation theory for complex numbers, for complex representation or L-modular representation for reasonable L. Well, here there is no Haw measure with coefficients in a field of characteristic P. Or a group G. So when in the complex or in the P modulo in or in the L modular case, we use the fact that P is invertible in the field. And so what you can prove here is that actually if you had, would you have one HAL measure, then they would have subgroups that are of measure one and of measure zero at the same time, which is, well, not very nice. So that's two things. That's two things. Maybe what, yeah, another result we saw, and maybe it's even trickier. So we saw in the complex setting that if you have an irreducible smooth, yeah, just irreducible smooth representations of a periodic group of a C, they are admissible. Okay, we saw this in the Okay, we saw this in the first lecture. Here it's not true. And so we have a concrete counterexample given by Daniel Le for not such a mysterious group, just take GL2 of F, when F is an extension of degree 3 of Qp. Of QP. So it's not something very mysterious, okay? This group is supposed to be a nice group. Well, we have like concrete counter examples. Actually, he convinced a lot of them. Okay. So this means that, well, if someone was interested in just irreducible smooth representation, then this admissibility assumption is like an actual assumption. Okay. So there will still be work to do there. But this admissibility assumption will come back later. Come back later via different road, and we'll see why it really does matter. Okay, so a last warning, and then I promise I start to give you some positive things. So we've seen this morning that for complex representations, there is this theory of types, which allows you to give a to have like a nice way to describe. To have like a nice way to describe representations in some sense. Here, there's just no way of having type theory. So, and for a good reason, actually. So, when I say no type no type series, So when I say no type no type theory, it's really like in the in this in an analog way as what happens in the complex case, okay? No analog. And the reason is that we have this, okay, very nice lemma actually. Let me call this a key lemma, which you actually know if you ever read Searle's book on linear representation of finite group. You just don't know that you know it. Okay? So let me refer to Bartel and Lee. So let me refer to Bartel and Livni, because that's this paper when this statement like shows up as such for the first time, but also to serve because really the proof of the statement is come back to the finite group case and you say the result. And the result is the following one. So if you take P pro P group, You let C be a field of characteristic P, so the same P, that's really the crucial thing. And you let V be a non-zero smooth representation Of P, of this curly P, okay? Then it always has non-zero fixed vectors. So, for instance, if you think about one-dimensional representation, what this tells you is that the only one-dimensional smooth representation of a propy group is a trivial representation. Okay. If you think about more general groups, If you think about more general groups, okay, and you have this notion of depth that we see in Sean's yesterday lecture, then what this tells you is that just by looking at the propyradical in this group. So the propyradical is a propy group. So when you restrict the character to this propy group, it is trivial. Okay, so this character is of depth zero. Okay, so there's just no way of doing. So, there's just no way of doing things like in type theory in this setting. But actually, what is at first sight an obstacle is actually a key lemma because that's from this statement that we can build like new ways of using the sum of the classical tools. Okay, so okay, let's go to the first part. So, let me call this state of art. Let me call this state of art about classification of p-modular representation. So, maybe I can sketch a roadmap of this talk before going further. So, I will first give you an overview of what is known and what is. Overview of what is known and what is like what is known, yes, to be quite quick. What is known about classification result of irreducible, smooth, admissible representation of pleiadic groups. Okay, then I will explain what is not known and like what is open and give a little bit of the ideas that underlie this classification results. And doing so. And doing so, I will come to the last part when I will explain a result we proved with Julian-Ozer, which is one of the few positive results existing in this world of p-modular representation. So what I mean here is that something that gives us the hope of being able to get through a classification, through a construction of such representations and that kind of thing. So maybe the first thing is that as in the complex world or as in the modular world, World, or as in the modular world, there is a dichotomy between supercospedal representations and non-supercospedal representations. Okay, so here we really look at this supercospedal thing, like sub-quotient or not subquotient of parabolically induced representations. And the thing is that. And the thing is that, well, these supercaspudal representations, they are the ones we are like the most interested in, because if you want a kind of Langeland correspondences, that's the interesting one, that the one that should match with irreducible representation on the Galois side. So that's the one we are interested in. We are mostly interested in. Interested in. Maybe to make a comparison, like it says as if you were starting the study of modular forms. Then the first example you see is Eisenstein series. So you're happy because you have some modular forms. But okay, at some point you understand them very well. And then you say, okay, what's next? Here's the same thing. This non-supercospedal representation, they are sub-quotient of parabolically induced representations. So we know where to look for them. So it's not easy, but at least we know. It's not easy, but at least we know that we can have them. So, now the question is: is there something else? And if so, what it is. Okay, so maybe let me just say that they exist. So, this is a result of Patisch Coziol engineeras from not so long ago. So, the thing is that beforehand, we know that for some specific groups they exist, but we didn't know that in general supercuspital representation would exist. So, now it's known that for any connected reductive group G, then there are some supercuspidal representations. So, what I will tell in the sequel is not empty. Okay. And the thing that the non-supercus pedal one, we like them because, well, we can compute them. Can compute them. So we can understand, can be, let me say, easily, but with quote, I will come back on this in a few moments, understood. Okay, so let me start with what is known in some sense. So so. So, so far, what do we know? It just stands on this board, okay? So when G is either GL2, SL2, or the unitary group in two variables. Yes, unramified and F, maybe I should say F before F is QP and G is one of these three groups. So GL2QP, SL2QP, or U11 of QP square over QP. Then we have a classification. So we have a full classification of Of irreducible smooth admissible, and I put admissible in parentheses in this case because for SF2QP actually we can drop the admissibility condition. So like we have a full classification of irreducible smooth representations. And as they all appear to be admissible, then this proves that in this very specific case, irreducible smooth implies admissible. Reducible, smooth implies immissible. But that's very specific to the F equal QP case, okay? And S representations. And what comes with that? So over, so now I have to put an assumption on the base field C. So C will be algebraically closed. Okay. And you assume that it contains the residue field. Of F. It's not two big assumptions. But I make these assumptions for now. Okay, so from now on, C will always be algebraically closed of chochristic P, and we can embed the residue field of F inside C. Okay, so we have this classification, and this classification comes with local Langdance correspondence, so semi-sipple local Langdance correspondence. Local language correspondence. So, what do I mean here is that we can define like a matching between irreducible smooth representation, admissible smooth representation of these groups and Galois representations. Okay, so here, for instance, in the GLQQP case, it will really be like genuine representations of a Galois of dimension two. Dimension two. In the SL2 case, well, you have the L group coming into the game, so it's projective representation and we have packets. And the U11 case is interesting because it's the first non-split case we have. Okay. And just to give you like an idea of how things are, let's say, not so old and evolve not so fast. So this case is due to Buruille, beginning of the century, let's say. Beginning of the century, let's say this case is due to myself, it's in my PhD thesis, so it's 10 years later. And this case is due to Koziol in his PhD thesis. And actually, it's very, I like this case very much because it's really built on these two cases. So like the idea here is that the derived group of U11 is isomorphic to SL2. So you just use like a kind of induction restriction process. Use like a kind of induction restriction process, like you restrict this representation to SL2, then you know them because of this work, and then you go back to U11 just by showing that you have to tensor by a suitable character, so coming from the determinant. Okay, so it's kind of a nice mix between the GL2 and the SL2 case because you have non-trivial twist by characters, but you have packets, okay? So it's very fast. And so since then, And so, since then, no full classification. So, we have, let me say, the more general statement that is known so far is due to Abbey, Enyar, Hertis, and Guineras. So, it took all that, all these people. So, five years ago, roughly. And they kind of, well, it's kind of a Of well, it's kind of a classification a la Bernstein-Zelevinsky. So, what I mean here is that we have a classification up to, so I will use a weird word here, but I will explain what it means later, super singular representations of Levy factors. So, the first approximation. First approximation: when the representation is admissible, super singular is the same as supercuspidal. So, this is why I say it's a kind of Bernstein-Delewisky-like classification. It's like if you know the supercuspital representation of the Levy factors, then you can build all the representations. But as I said, even for GL2F, when F is not QP, we don't know this supercospital representation. We don't know these supercuspital representations, so it's a progress telling you, okay, focus on supercuspital things, but it doesn't tell you what to do. Okay, so let's focus on this supercuspital thing, or should I say on this super singular thing? So, to explain to you what is this super singularity thing, I will go back to Bartel and Livni's original work. Work so the geometry case Okay, to show how this super singularity comes into the game. So let's just go for 30 seconds in the complex world. So for supercuspital representation, what is really useful is compact. What is really useful is compactly induced representations. Okay, that's how you build them. Okay, you use compactly induced representations. So the idea is: okay, can we, in the MODP setting, say something about these compactly induced representations? Okay. And so let me just for a minute say that G is GL2 of F and that K is GL2 of OF. So what we So, what we saw in Schotten's talk yesterday is that if you look at the endomorphism algebra of the compactly reduced representation of some irreducible, admissible, smooth representation of K, then this is a Hecke algebra. This is still true. And actually, what Barton and Yuni proved is that this is a very nice ECU algebra. Echo algebra. So, why is it so? Because of this kilema here. What this kilema tells you is that sigma actually is a representation of the quotient. So it should be a representation of k, okay, irreducible, admissible, smooth, of course, representation of k. But actually, because of this k lemma, it should be trivial on the propie radical, because it's a normal subgroup, okay, and it's a propy subgroup. Subgroup, okay, and the propiece of group. So actually, it's a representation of K mod K1. And this is just GL2 of the residue field. So it's a representation of a finite group that we know, so we can make them explicit. And so this can be really computed-like, calculated. And this is just a polynomial algebra in one hec-operator T sigma. So something very. T sigma. So something very nice, okay? Because if you need to understand the action of this Hec algebra, you just need to understand the action of one operator. And the thing is that from this, what they've proven is that any irreducible smooth representation of G is a quotient of some coconut representation. So, what is this cocaine representation? So, what is this cocaine representation? It's a coconut of T sigma minus lambda identity for some lambda. Okay, so this really means that if you understand all this co-kernel, then you're done. Of course, these co-kernels are very hard to understand, unless f is qp. Because when f is qp, actually, we can explicitly compute them. We can explicitly compute them. But before going to this case, let me just say that when lambda is non-zero, then actually these coconuts are not too bad, but they are not interesting. So when lambda is non-zero, so that's something also they proved, then this co-kernel, Jordan-Folder factors, are all Are all non-supercospedal. Okay, so what happens is that generically this is a parabolic induction. Okay, and you can make explicit which character of the borel you induce. And sometimes it's not a parabolic induction. It's an extension either between a character and the twist of the Steinberg that corresponds. In one way, That corresponds in one way or the other way. Okay, so we have a non-trivial extension between Steinberg, so meaning Steinberg as a sub-object and trivial character as a quotient. Okay, so this is not very interesting, what we want to do. And that's where the super singularity notion comes from. So the definition of super singular is super singular is for an irreducible, admissible. Admissible representations that appeared as a quotient of some co-kernel of just T sigma. So it just means basically that it's a representation on which T sigma acts by zero. Okay, so that's why they call this super singular. Okay, it's kind of the head. This is super singular, okay? It's kind of the Heke algebra act as null as possible on them, and that's really the idea you have to keep in mind. So, this let me give it a name. So, I will write H G K sigma for the Hecke algebra here. So, this just means that H G K sigma acts as As new as possible. Okay. And this is kind of the idea behind the definition of super singularity in the general case. Okay. So you can define a notion of super singularity for like G being any connected reductive group. And so this is due to Abbe Inear Herscheschen Bigneras. And so you can, in general, should I see? So that's really the idea, okay, of having as much euro as possible for this action. And I should say that even for, let's say, small groups, like if you look, for instance, at the inner form of GL2, like GL2D with D being a division algebra, then there is no such description. Description of this algebra, so you don't have a nice definition of supersingularity even for such a group. Okay, so that's why you need really this big machinery in Abenier, Artisian Veneras. But here, for GL2F, then we have this. And thanks to this description of the co-kernel attached to non-zero eigenvalues of T sigma, then we get that supersymmetric. We get that supersingular representation is the same as supercuspedal representation. Okay, so that's another way, another road to reach supercuspedal representation. And when F equals QP, the upshot, which is due to Bury, is really the key thing here, not the shot, the upshot, is that these coconut representations, they are irreducible. This is obviously false when F is not QP. Obviously, false when f is not qp. Actually, when f is not qp, this is infinite length. So there is really a big gap between f equals qp and f is not qp. And we'll have a little bit of idea of that in the in the sequence, really a little bit of idea of why it's so different. Okay. But at least it gives you an idea of what you want to do. Okay. And for SL2, I mean, actually, things work a bit like that. You're happy. Bit like that, you're happy, or you want one, as I said, you do. And actually, when G has a split of rank one, so for instance, if you take unitary group in three variables, so three by three matrices, then you can do the same thing. So it's in my PhD also. So you reach up to this stage. Okay, so you have also for this group that super singular and super cusped all is the same, let's say in a naive way, but you can't go further even when. But you can't go further even when f is qp, you don't have the hand on these co-kernel representations because if you think a little bit of u21, unitary group in three variables, actually you can see it in GL3 and GL3 is really far out of reach for now. Okay, good. So, what do I want to say on this? I'm good. Okay. So. So, what to do? Then we can dig a little bit on where this dichotomy comes from. So, in this rank one case, and I mean, more generally, this dichotomy comes from the fact, come from the following fact, which is either you're a subquotient of a parabolically induced representation or you are not. So, it has something to do with parabolic. So, it has something to do with parabolic subgroups. Okay. So, an idea you may have is: okay, what if I try to understand the structure as a representation of a parabolic of these two focus pedal representations that are so mysterious? Okay, and that's really the idea that led Pascunas. So, let me say position of the position of the problem. Back to the Boris World. So, here to just fix a borus, so a borel and a torus, so a torus and a borel, with P being T U, U being the unipotent radical of B, okay? Radical of B. Okay. And the question you want to solve is: what can we say about P restricted to B when pi is the bookus pedal? Or here, I will say super singular because that's really in the p-modular setting, that's really the nice way to work is really using this super singularity thing. Okay, that's it. Thing. Okay, that's really the useful thing. So, what Pascuin has proved in 04 is the following statement. So, he proved something more general that I will say in a minute, but here he answered this question. He said for GL2F, F being any F here, okay, then if Pi is Then, if pi is super cusped or super singular, like irreducible, admissible, and super singular, then this is irreducible. So even if you don't know the representation, you know that its restriction to B must be irreducible. So that's something good because, well, for instance, if you look at Matsievian's thesis, where he tried to build some phi-gamma model theory to build mod P representations of this Borel subgroup. This Borel subgroup, then at least you have something you can put your hand on. You know, you just, let's say, you know what is the restriction, and actually you do know, what is the restriction to B of non-super exposure representation. So you know what to exclude. So then you say, okay, start from another representation of B, another irreducible representation of B. Can it appear not via parabolic induction? Of course, okay, otherwise it's not super cuspidal. Otherwise, it's not super cuspidor. But can it appear as the restriction of some representation of G? So at least you have something you can put your hand on and try to make some calculation. So I don't say it's easy, but at least we can try to do something. So let me give you the full statement of Pascona so that you understand that it's not just irreducibility that matters here, but it's really that the B structure gives you the full control of the structure of the representation. Of the structure of the representation. So, what did he prove? He proved the following result. So, it's for GL to F. So, you start from two. So, pi, sorry, being an irreducible smooth representation of G. Representation of G, and you assume it has some fourth character. Why do you assume this? There is like a concrete reason and a abstract reason, let's say. Concrete reason is that Barten and Liebnik classification is for irreducible, admissible, irreducible, smooth representation with a central character. And then they appear to be admissible. Okay, but like really button anyway construction is this and the conceptual And the conceptual reason, in some sense, is that in the classical world, when you have a central character, you are admissible. And when you're admissible, you have a central character. So this central character condition at that time, 204, in 2004, was kind of generalization of admissibility without saying admissibility. Okay. And actually, in this case, Laurent Berger proved that for a resistible smooth. Prove that for a resistible smooth representation, being admissible or having a central character is the same thing. Not true for other groups. So you take an irreducible smooth representation of G with a central character. You take any other smooth representation of G, okay, pi prime. So the first statement is that when you restrict your irreducible smooth representation to B, Representation to B. So here in this case, B is upper triangular matrices. Okay, so it's of length at most two. So either it's irreducible or it has two irreducible components. And we have equality, so length two, if and only if pi is a parabolically induced representation. Representation. So in this case, it's from a character of the torus. Okay. And for GL2, it's just two characters across, and you just put one on each component of the diagonal torus. Okay? So in particular, this tells you that when pi is supercospidal, then its restriction to b is irreducible. Okay? And the second thing is that the restriction map. Is that the restriction map induces an isomorphism of vector spaces between the G intertwining, so the G homomorphism from pi to pi prime and the same homomorphism, but when you look at the representation as B representation, which is something a priori that has no reason to be true. thing a private that has no reason to be true. If you have a homomorphism as B representation, it has no reason to be extended to a homomorphism of G representation. And actually it works. Okay. And here the really nice thing is that as I said here, this representation pi prime I have so I have a little assumption here to pi prime has no reason to be reduce irreducible. Irreducible can be reducible. So you can understand like embeddings of a given representation into non-irreducible representations. So when you try to understand X groups, it can be useful. And here, I should say something. I should assume that pi is not a special series. So what if pi is a special series? So, what if pi is a special theory representation? Sit again? Yeah, not. Thank you. That would be very restrictive-wise. So, in particular, because that's what we're interested in, in particular, when pi is supercuspidal or super singular here, then there is a control of the G homomorphism from pi to something by the B homomorphism. The B homomorphism. Okay, and I recall you that this pi restricted to B is still irreducible. So that's again something very strong. Okay. And so what happened when chi, when let's say pi is the Steinberg, because otherwise you just twist by a cohort, then you have to go up to the probabilically induced representation from this trivial cart. Okay, then the same. Okay, then the same the same restriction maps induces isomorphism with the B homomorphism from the Steinberg. But now you have to go up to the full parabolic induced representation. So you have this triple character appearing as a sub-object here, but it's not too bad, let's say. And again, what is the most interesting part is the two. The most interesting part is the two. Okay, but there is a but. So what is this but? Is that a Pascuna's proof? Let me let me know it relies on the following lemma. So that's really the keystone. So that's really the keystone of the proof, okay? That's another key lemma. Let me write a keystone. Okay. So you let sigma, so I define an operator on the representation by a very explicit formula. So for any element of the residue field, I look at the action of the diagonal. The action of the diagonal matrix given by a uniformizing element on the upper left corner, one on the bottom right corner, and a Teichmüller lift of the element of the residual field. So this is an operator on pi. I can make this act on pi. And S will be a representative of the non-trivial element of the while group of GL2F. Of GL2F. Okay. Then, okay, so pi is as before. So the first thing is that if for all if V is a non-zero element, so of the I1 invariant of pi, so I1 is a pro P-Warrior subgroup. The propywali subgroup, so it's a pro P radical of I, the Iwari subgroup. It's what Sean denoted by IO plus, if I remember well. Okay, and because of Bartel-Ligne Kilema, you know that this space is always non-zero. You have a propy group acting smoothly on a non-zero vector space. So you can pick a non-zero fixed vector. And if this vector is cancelled by this operator sigma, By this operator sigma. Then you can write it, you can write the action of this element S on V as a sum of Bi's acting on V. And what this means is that the image of V under the action of S actually belongs to the sub- Of S actually belongs to the sub-representation of B generated by V. And regarding what we try to prove, which is that B controls the structure of the G representation, it's very good because if you remember Boulet decomposition, you know that the action of G will be given by the action of B and the action of S. You know, you have either the class B or the class B S U. So if this is in B V, then this means basically that everything. Then this means basically that everything can be written as an action of an element of B on V. So that's good. So the question is: okay, but are we sure that we can find some V such that sigma kills this V? And the answer is yes. So for any V and the U.S., the U.S., the U.S., the For any v in pi, i1, which is not non-zero. Okay, if v is zero, it's working, but it's not interesting, then you can find a non-zero integer, positive one, a positive integer, such that so if you iterate sigma enough, then you will kill it. So that's nice, because then you take for v, so you have to check that sigma lets this space. That sigma lets this space stable. Okay, but once you do that, then you can take for, let's say, v of 0.1, sigma n minus 1 of v. So these two things together allow Pasconas to get this and that, okay, to prove his theorem. So you may ask, why did I say but? So the but comes from the fact that the proof really is really specific to Really specific to GL2. So, for at least two reasons. There are more of that, but at least two reasons. So, the first reason is that this operator that shows up here, okay, it's coming up a priori from combinatorics result. Like, he's really using the paratis three and he's really trying to like he's making explicit calculation, but this explicit calculation, like they they work for GL2F, but well, they don't work for GL three or GLN. Well, they don't work for GL3 or GLN. Okay. So I've made, okay, it was an exercise to try to see whether it would work for SL2F. It does. It's really painful. Like you can, you go through technical artifacts and things. You don't really understand why you have to do this. For instance, remember there was this representation sigma of k. Then you have to distinguish between whether sigma is of dimension one or not. Dimension one or not? Well, where does this come from? Like, does it have a specific reason besides the fact that calculations are different? And calculations are different in this case because as it's GL to F, this sigma operator here is very closely related to this T sigma we saw earlier. Okay, so actually this vanishing condition basically amounts to say that T sigma acts by zero. So basically amounts to suppose. So, basically, it amounts to super singularity. So, that's where things come from. You know, that's why, for instance, here we have irreducibility for super singular things. It's basically because we're seeing that if you have something super singular, point one holds like almost automatically, and then pi restricting to b generates all pi. So, and this is like clearly and definitely not true, even if. Clearly and definitely not true, even in rank one. Like, for instance, if you look at GL2 of D, I mentioned earlier, then in Tony Lee's thesis, you see that there is no such thing as this operator T sigma. You don't have it. Okay, so there is just no hope of just making an ad hoc operator sigma that will give you the action of the spherical Hickey algebra. So, in some sense, we were stuck, like, because it was really. Stuck like because it was really an ad hoc proof, and there was no way of seeing this as something that could go beyond the GL2F case. Okay, but I promise I will give you some positive results, and that's where we go. So, what I will discuss here is a joint work with Julian Uzo. And if I must phrase the content of this section in one sentence, I would say that if you take G, the group of F points of a connected reductive group of F semisimple rank one, so that covers all the group I mentioned earlier, SL2, U11, U21, GL2D. Then this theorem is true. We have this theorem, okay? Theorem okay, but not following this way, okay. So let me write that the option, maybe the upshot fastunas theorem holds for the G of F when G is of F F semi-simple rank one, and this is not only interesting because we have information on supercuspital representation, but also because in non-split cases, such as GL2D, for instance, when D is a division algebra over F, then understanding non-supercuspital representation was not fully done yet. So, the most advanced results in this direction were in Tony Lee's thesis. So, he This so he gave a full understanding of all the special series representation, like twist of the Steinberg and everything. He went really far. But when it really came to a classification of non-supercospedal representation, then it was not complete. So this actually will help us to complete this classification, which is also some, let's say, byproduct. It was not the goal, but it's a nice byproduct. Okay. So. Okay, so I will need to fix some notation and to tell you what is the mysterious key ingredient that allows us to give another interpretation of this. So it's basically the same notations as before. Okay, so for simplicity, just for simplicity, so I can keep saying Borel, I assume that G is quasi-split. But we don't need this assumption. Okay, it's just bringing more technical things like, okay, I take my animal parabolic and this operator sigma is a bit more technical to phrase. So let's do simple things for once. So in this setting, so I can again fix the boroughs. I will let so this T will be the centralizer of a split group of a maximal split torus okay so I will still have the Iwah hurry and everything omega naught will be the generating element of Generating element of the V group. And okay, abuse of notation, as we usually do, I will also denote by omega naught a lift to k of the actual element of the Vale group. So K is as before, like the OF point of G. So you take a model and everything. What else? No, no, no, no, no. Okay, and so. No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, and so as G is quasi-spit, then the co-characters of S are actually just so it's a monogenous. Yeah, how to say this in English. It's generated by one co-character, lambda. And I will set T0 as the value at a fixed uniformizing element of this co-character, lambda. Okay? So in particular, this tells you that S modeled by S intersected by. S modeled by S intersected by with K is just powers of T0. But T0 here is of interest because, spoiler, it will help us define this operator sigma here. Okay, if you look at G being G L to F, then T naught is just the diagonal element pi F one. So here you see what happens. We multiply this G naught by basically unipotent elements. Not all of them. There is some quotient done here. There is some quotient done here, and that's what we will see appearing here. So we fix an open compact subgroup u0 in u intersected with k. Okay, so u is asked before, it's a unit potential radical of b. I can tell this now. This choice doesn't impact the result. Like if you change u0, everything works the same, the construction works the same. There's no influence of this choice, okay? Influence of this choice. Okay. And we can look at T plus being the monoid of all elements in T that contracts U naught. So T minus one U naught T is contained in U naught. And T naught belongs to this. Okay, so this means that T naught minus one U naught T naught is a subgroup of U naught. Naught is a subgroup of u0. And actually, what we saw proving here is just a set of representatives of the quotient of u by t naught, u naught, t naught minus one, u naught, t naught. So this tells you how to define this. Okay. And for people who are a bit familiar with this, it really looks like a hacker action. And actually, it is a hacker action. And I will say you tell you where it's coming from. And then I guess I'll be done. And then I guess I'll read off. So the thing is that if you set sigma to be the sum of a representative of u0, maybe I'm not out on the left, t naught minus one u0, t naught, u0 of u t naught. So exercise when g is G L two, you recover this. Okay. Recover this. Okay. Then you use this sigma and you can prove this keystone for this sigma. Okay, so maybe I can say lemma. So the keystone and the keystone hold for this sigma. Provided a slight modification, which is here, a priori, we do not reach. A preview we do not reach all I1, we reach u0. But it's not a problem because actually, u0 intersected is y1 will be a pro P group. And what is enough is to get a fixed vector that's in this by a small enough propy group. Okay, so provided I one is replaced. By u0 in two, just in two, okay. And the first one here, it's still pi one, pi one, okay. So actually, we could prove this also for you not, but okay. And so actually, once you have the keystone, then it's, I wouldn't say easy, but it's not too hard to go to the theorem, provided you make the connection. Provided you make the connection between supersingularity and this operator sigma. Okay, so what is left to solve? And that's where I will stop. So, question: How does sigma connect to supersingularity? And the answer is we are ordinary part functors of Hamilton. So maybe in In two sentences. So, this ordinal report function, so it was defined by Emerton, but only when f was of characteristic zero. But later on, Vineras extended this construction, let's say, to any F. And what is the main point of What is the main point of the ordinary path functor is to get the second adjunction formula? So we've seen yesterday that in the complex setting, so parabolic induction naturally has a left adjoint. I mean, so restriction to the boreal is a natural adjoint of parabolic induction. Okay, but on one side. So you wonder, can we have an adjoint on the side? So, you wonder: can we have an end joint on the other side? And the answer is: in the p-modular world, you don't use Jackie module, you use ordinary parts. And the thing, the fun thing is that this ordinary parts also tells you to some extent whether the representation you're looking at is super singular. Because, as what happens with the Jacquet module in the classical setting, for infinite dimensional representation, For infinite dimensional representation, being supersingular is the same as having zero ordinary parts. So it's really the right notion to look at in this setting. And once you know that, then what you have to do is understand how sigma comes from the ordinal reports. And I told you it was a Hecke action. And actually, this is the action of T plus on this ordinary report thing. Ordinary port thing. Actually, the ordinary port is a representation of T, and this representation comes from this action of T plus and the action comes from this formula, this heck action. So now you put everything together, like if your ordinary part is zero, this means that this will act by zero. And when g is of rank one, we can compute explicitly this ordinary part. Basically, we can. Basically, we can just say, okay, it's very easy to understand. It's just an extension. You take this u-0 invariant I was telling you about here. You take this u-0 invariant and you kind of extend them to, let's say, fraction field of polynomials in some variable x. And this variable x actually represents the action of t naught. So it's something very explicit that we can calculate. And saying that this is zero is just saying. And saying that this is zero is just saying that t0 acts locally nilpotently. And so you can put all the pieces together and go to the theorem. And as a conclusion, let me just say that this is really a tiny light of hope for higher rank group, because the thing is that this ordinary pods functor, like actually they come with their derived version. And so if you go to higher rank group, like for instance, we're trying to understand what happened for GS3. To understand what happened for GF3, and you cannot just use ordinary ports, you don't have enough relation using this. So, if you use the first derived ordinary port functor, then you may get the missing information. And hopefully, we can reach the same kind of result for higher rank group. But this is a full-author story really in progress. So, I will just stop here, and I thank you for your attention. So, are there any questions? Yes. So, I was going to ask, you answered part of my question about obstructions to going to higher rank. I was wondering if it was going to take a trip through Combinatorx Hell or something worse. But I'm wondering, do you? I'm wondering, do you at least have an idea for what would be the replacement for capital Sigma? I mean, not directly. So the thing is that, okay, we wouldn't have one capital Sigma. The thing is that if you go higher rank, then you would have actually the action of this full monoid here. But, well, there is no like natural element that would be in. Yeah, yeah, no natural one. But even without going up to generators, you know, just having this. Two generators, you know, just having distinguished elements that would give you enough information. Like, for instance, why do I say that? Because, for instance, if you go to the GLN case, there is this, so previously to Abenier, Hertis, and Vinylas, Hertis proved the same kind of result they had later for GLN. And the thing is that in this special case, then you can find some specific HEC operators that are enough in some sense to control the supersingularity. But it's not true for all. But it's not true for other groups. So one has to be very careful here. And even as you see here, it has nothing to do with whether it's GL2, SL2, or GL2D. So there is no, at least we have no hope of finding a finite set of sigmas here. But I mean, this ordinary post-puncture and their derived version, they come with heck action of this T plus. So what we hope is that we will. T plus. So, what we hope is that we would manage to get, let's say, enough control on the action of T plus so that it will connect to this super singularity. But that's really in progress. Okay. So, maybe I can just add the last remark because it reminds me of this. Because here you may wonder whether looking at the restriction to a parabolic is something. To a parabolic is something finally very interesting in some sense besides this result. And I would like to mention that there are other results in different direction of Kohlhazer and Sorenson about smooth duality. So they have this smooth duality, they have a notion of smooth duality for representation of periodic groups. And the fun thing is that if you look at derived, well, in some sense, a derived version of this, then you Of this, then you can control when this derived version will vanish for a given group. And this point of vanishing is exactly given by the dimension of the quotient variety G mod B, but as a QP object. So that's where the difference between F equal QP and when F is different from QP show up. Like for instance, if you look at G L to F when F is not QP, then G mod B will not be dimension one. mod b will not be dimension one. So you will have derived, you know, derived things showing up here, even if it's GL2. So that's that's kind of one of the various way derived objects come up in the game for mod P representation theory. But well, that's a different story. Okay, so there are no more questions then. So let's thanks, speaker, again. Thank you.
