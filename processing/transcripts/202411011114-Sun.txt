So the title of the talk is the stability of solid wave solutions for generalized ABCD Business equation and I have been interested in stability problem of the solidarity wave for a long time now and just try to solve for the older equations and just won't work. Okay, so I just recently I just okay I switched to the systems now and this is the physical problem and of course all other people already saw this. Already saw this picture for long for several many talks. Okay, and the wave on a free surface moving with constant speed. And for this problem, and I have substantial on free surface, so the non-dimensional wave speed, which is called floor number, is F. And there's a bound number, which is non-dimensional substantial. So it's tall, I denote this. And then what, then, and in 1871, and Bosniaksky proposed the And Bosniaski proposed several model equations, system, model systems for studying the existence and stability of solidarity waves. And unfortunately, there are some systems which you oppose. Okay. And then in 2002, and the boundaries, Chen, and Schultz suit and introduced this four-prime family of bosonic systems and they call it ABCD system. And they call it ABCD system, and eta is the free surface, and u is the horizontal velocity at a certain height. Okay, and of course, all these parameters, parameter ABCD satisfy this relation. And of course, you can change other parameters if you have no self-change. So, of course, for this ABCD system, you can introduce many other systems like COP, Bonner Smith. COP BONDER SMIS and Benjamin Bonder, coupled with Benjamin Bonder systems, and so on and so forth. So, now, first, we are going to discuss the initial value problem. Of course, in order to study stability, you need the initial value problem. So this system, ABC system, is well posed if and only if actually you have only two cases. And one is B equals D and A is negative, C is negative. And another case is B D positive and A equals C positive. Positive and A equals C positive. So here we only concentrated on C one case, which is the B equals D, and A is less than zero, C is less than zero. So this system like this. And it's known as this system has like the sort of solutions and in certain parameter regime. Let me check time. And for B equal to D. And for B equal D, and the new system is Hamiltonian, and it's globally well posted in the energy space H1 cross H1. And this is the this is H is the energy. And then for our problem, and we just want to study the generalized ABCD system. And what's called generalized, and we know we put a non-inear term here as eight times UP, and here you and the P equal one is the original. And the P equal one is the original system, ABC system with the B equals D and A and C less than zero. Okay, so we consider this existence and the stability of sort of a solution for this generalized ABCD system. And we assume that this P has this property, which is the common device of this P1, P2 equals one, whatever. And P and P1, P2 are odd because you have only U could be negative. So it's for just for convenience. negative so it's for just for convenience and we assume that the p and the p1 and p2 are odd and this is the fraction of p and then also to study the stability as well know that the in 1987 and the grillax and chateau and the stress introduced the method it's very powerful powerful tool to prove the stability of solar wave solutions for very general homotonium systems and we call it gs approach okay and The GSS approach. And then we try to study the stability. Of course, for these traveling wave solutions, we can only study the orbital stability problem. So, orbital stability means that, okay, you have a traveling wave solution and an initial condition, you're not close to the traveling wave, the traveling solution at certain time at certain like the why here because all the translations are traveling with solution as well. Okay, so. Are traveling with solution as well. Okay, so then we want to show that for all the time, time large enough, okay, and the difference between the solution, original solution with time dependence and the translation of the triangle solution is small enough. So which of course we can use the so-called set instability, set instability. So we assume that the set G omega is just all. Omega is just all the translations of these traveling wave solutions, or traveling with solutions. Yes, the distance between the solution and with this set is less than zero, less than epsilon for large T for R T basically. So that's the optical stability. Then to solve our problem, of course, we needed Hamiltonian stretch. Okay, so of course, fortunately for this generalized ABCD system, and we have this Hamiltonian. And we have this Hamiltonian H, and we can write this as a Hamiltonian equation. And this is the variation of H with respect to eta and T. Okay, so that's well known basic. And then another conserved quantity is Q, Q we call charge, and this Q is conserved. So now, first of all, of course, we are introduced the traveling wave solution. So we choose a coin system traveling wave traveling with wave speed only because. With wheel speed omega, then our system can be changed to this, okay, with time dependence. And this is the omega is the traveling speed, okay? So, in order to have the traveling wave solution, of course, traveling wave solution is independent of time in this traveling coordinate. Okay, so we are trying to find a solution, critical point of this variation of script F. So, now for the stability. So now for the stability, and we use the GSS approach. And the GSS approach basically is just like you introduce a minimizer of a functional f, okay, f omega. And we try to show that, remember this is the operator, second order derivative. Second version of this is operate, symmetric operator, and it's positive. Or more simply, we just introduce this D1. D1 is the infirm of this F and In female of this f and the y is some admissible set. So this is the scale function and this is the operator. So now we want to establish the positivity or the like the d double prime with respect to omega is positive, which is convex. And if this happens, then it's stable. If it's negative, then it's unstable. Basically, it's the GSS approach like that. And so based on the GSS approach, Based on the GSS approach, and there are many studies on the stability of the sort of solutions, costs. So, for our problem, the most difficult part is the verification of the hypothesis, because we don't know the formula of the traveling solution. We only know the existence of the travel wave solutions, and we don't know the form. So, if we don't know the form, then this is almost impossible to compute this second variation of f or just the second order derivative. Variation of F or just a second order derivative of this D. It's just almost impossible. But we can use characterization of this D1 in terms of what? There are a lot of conserved quantities, and we use all these conserved quantities, and we can show that this second-order derivative is positive. So we have thirty-wheel solution. So the conclusion is this. We have thirty-wheel solution, like the intervaling coordinates. Solution like the interval coordinate, and this is in the energy space H1 cross H1, and this is just the equation, and we call the two. And then to find the solution, Charlie was solution, we just do the critical point of the minimization problem and existence results just used the classical Lyons compensating comparedness argument to get the existence of the point of this. Of the point of this function, though. And then, affect the existence of this function solution, then we have a lot of these quantities. And I just list three of them here. So, you have solutions and evaluation like equality, a lot of evaluation equality you can use to prove the stability. So, finally, we got the stability result. And this is the set of stability. And we have the ABC generalized ABCD system, Posnistic system. Both needs to system and satisfies the condition assumptions on p and then if 2b less strictly strictly less than negative a negative zero ac out negative okay and omega traveling speed is positive but is less than the minimum of one one and the square root of ac divided by b then we have a non-empathetic set of the traveling wave solutions with traveling speed omega so this this set speed omega. So this set we call it, we denote it as G. Furthermore, if we assume that the B even less than square root of AC, remember that the minimum now becomes one now, okay? And the P is less than P naught, this P naught is greater than four, okay? Then this set, the traveling wheel solution, the set of traveling wheel solutions able. With omega large greater than zero, but it's near one. Okay, so near one basically is like the Kdv Kdv Kdv Kdv scaling. So which means that this set is stable or if you're initially close to this set, then this solution remains close to this set. So the one final remark is, and it's very interesting to see that the stability of this one is. That the stability of this one is obtained for any p less than p naught, which p naught is greater than strictly greater than four. And if we consider the generalized KDV equation, then the critical exponent for the stability is p equal 4. So for the systems, the generalized ADCV system, we get the better, like a critical point. And if you use numerically and you can show that the p naught is approximately equal to 4.2. is approximately equal to 4.22 or something okay so now after that we are we are going to prove the instability so now for p greater than p p naught and we can we actually can show that and this set of swarth family solutions is unstable okay and of course i don't have time so i just
