Okay, so yeah, so today my talk will relate to two fundamental principles in nature. So symmetry or in many cases isotropy in nature and also homogeneity. So here to be more precise we are going to talk about cellular homogeneity and heterogeneity. So today I'm going to talk about two of our recent research projects. Our recent research projects, where we discussed how cellular anisotropy and cellular heterogeneity will affect cell movement and migration, and particularly in a second project, so how that further affect the growth of the whole tissue. Okay, so the first system we're going to talk about is the flagella and the civia. Okay, so Okay, so many cells they use Gragella or cilia to move and to be more precise to swing. Okay, so here, so this is so serial transperm cell who has one long flagella. Here, this is Bemidomonas that has two flagella on its head. And this one is Aramecium, so where you can. Aramisium, so where you can you can see the propagating wave of the of the beating cilia. Okay, so now if you um okay, so now if you look into uh inside flagella or cilia, so they have very similar structures. So the skeleton of a fragella or ocelia is called the axonye, okay, which has this uh very famous uh 9 plus 2 structure. 9 plus 2 structure, meaning that, okay, so you have two microtubule in the center and you have nine microtubule doublets surrounding it. Okay, so here this is an illustration of a cross-section of a flagella. Okay, so each of the micro microtubule doubles consists of a closed A tubule and then open and then unclose the B tubule attached to the A tubule. tubes uh okay so then uh so the a tubules are attached to the to the center uh microtubules uh by uh by the uh radius bulb okay and then between the microtubule uh doublets so you have the nexin which acts like a like like springs to to hold the two uh to to hold the the microtubule doublets uh together uh and there's another type of uh molecules between Molecules between them, which is called dynam. So the dynams, these are molecular motors anchored to A tubule, and they can attach to the neighboring B tubule, and then they can work along the B tub. And then when it attaches and work on the B tubule, it generates a sliding between the two filaments. Okay, so from now on, I will refer to each microtubule doublets as a filament. So yeah, so as the dynamo. So, yeah, so as the dynam attach and work on a neighboring filiban, it generates the sliding between them, which inert generates the bind. Okay, so here this is an animation video I found from YouTube. So here I will just show two clips from them. But if you are interested, so I highly suggest you to watch the full video. It's a really beautifully made animation. Okay, so here you see one micro tub on the top and one on the bottom. one microtub on the top and one on the bottom okay so these are dynamotors so they are attached to the to the top one and they can sorry so they are anchored to the to the top one and they can attach to the to the bottom one which is the b tubio of this filament okay and then when they attach okay so they generate sliding between the two filaments and then if they receive some signals so their their binding or say their attachment might be inhibited might be inhibited okay and then uh okay and then as is coordinated by the by the signals by the signaling uh dynamics so the attachment and detachment of the uh so they so the so the dynamics they also late in attachment and detachment which generate this uh beating patterns of the whole flagella okay so that that's how your how the flagella can actually switch I can't trace it. Okay, so now here we have talked about microtubule doublets, radio spoke, Nexon, and binding. So if there are only these structures, then your project. Then your flagella or state exonym is more or less isotropic. Well, except for the two microtubule in the center. However, so what greatly break down this isotropy is the 5-6 bridge. So these are the molecules between the fifth and the sixth filament. So they connect these two filaments. But they connect these two filaments so that these two filaments cannot slide with each other like other filaments. Okay. And then you can imagine that, okay, so since this five, since there's this five, six bridge, so there's a, they actually create a bias of the binding, they create a bias in the binding direction of the flagella so that your flagella is easier to find in the direction perpendicular. In a direction perpendicular to the bridge? Yeah, so it's much easier to bind in the direction perpendicular to the bridge, but it's much harder to bind in the orthogonal direction. Okay, so now we have talked about the structure of a flagella. So now let's talk about, so how, now let's think about the questions, how the dynam motors cool. Dynam motors coordinate to generate the beating. Okay, so currently there are three major hypotheses on this. So the geometry clutch theory, which said that, okay, so when the dynamics, they attach to the neighboring filament, so they actually change the distance between the neighboring filaments, which generate binding. The curvature control, which said that, okay, so that the attachment is regulated by the local curvature of the Regulated by the local curvature of your flood. The last one, the sliding control theory. So, this was first developed by proposed by Dr. Frank Julicher, which says that, okay, so let me read this. So, Dynamo's attachment detachment results from sliding forces acting parallel to the long axis of the microtubule doublet. Okay, so what does it mean? Okay, so okay, so you have the dynam on project. The dynam on project, uh, you have dynam on the filament, and it can attach to the next filament. Okay, so when it attaches, it generates slides between these two filaments. And when there's a slide, so there's a sliding force, right? And okay, so by in return, the sliding force will trigger finite detachment, so in this way, it actually creates. So, in this way, it actually creates feedback on the dynam attachment. And based on this sliding control theory, so people developed 2D flagella models. So where instead of considering the nine filaments, they consider one filament on the top, one bottom, and they have dynamics that can attach to each other. Each other. Okay, so using this model, they show okay, so there are the fluid can show different types of beating, yeah, beating patterns. So this is one of their 2D simulations where you can see the beating is from head to tail. Okay, so usually when you have a 2D model, people will ask the question. A 2D model, people will ask the question: Is a 2D model enough for a 3D system? Okay, so here, particularly for the flagella system. So, many people argue that, yes. Okay, so maybe for two reasons. So, first, so when people observe the beating under the microscope, so indeed the beating looks actually more like planar beating instead of 3D spirals. Okay, and another reason, so if you think about the structure of Another reason, so if you think about the structure of the flagella, so like what we mentioned earlier, so the 5-6 bridge creates a bias in the bending directions. Okay, so then if it's actually planar beating other than 3D spirals, then this leads to another question. So why do you actually prefer the planar beating while you are 3D further? Okay, so yes, yes, so the five-sex bridge indeed. 5-6 bridge indeed creates a bias in a binding direction. But okay, so is it strong enough so that the binding in the other direction is totally inhibited? Okay. And also, so there are some recent experimental research suggests that, so actually, the beating is actually the beating is 3D. So the previous believed planar beating is actually due to the limitation of the technology. Okay. So, so well, okay. Okay, so while we wait for the experimentalists to bring up more evidence on whether this is actually 2D or 3D eating, so now we develop a 3D flagella model based on the sliding control theorem. Okay, so the development of our 3D model follows the framework of the 2D sliding control model. So here I list two of the reference paper. Of the reference paper. Okay, so the geometry of our model. So here we use a material frame which is called a cosraid frame. Okay, and so there's and then we consider the rotation angle that goes with the cosa frame showing here. Okay, so then the evolvement of the cosmic frame is actually given by the rotation angles and given by this equation. Given by these equations. Okay, and for mechanics, we have force balance and momentum. Sorry, force balance and moment balance. Okay, so here the capital F is an internal force defined as the force exerted by the part of the flagella from the current point to the tip on the first half of your flagella. So that is from the base to this current point. To this current point. Okay, so this is internal force. And also we have internal moment defined in a similar way. Okay, so the flagella is in a fluid, right? Okay, so the force and moment should be balanced by the viscous force and the viscous moment generated from the viscous flow. Okay, so here, since we have Okay, so here since we have a very long, thin cylinder shape of flagella, so we can get the approximation of the viscous force and viscous moment by the resistive force theory. And for the internal moment, it can be further divided into two parts. So the bending moment and a sliding moment. So the bending moment can be directly obtained from the Directly obtained from the cosmic frame. So actually, it has both bending and twist. So these are the two bending terms, and this is a twist term. And then the sliding moment comes from the sliding of the filament, which is well generated by the sliding force and regulated by the dynamic. So here, if you look at the If you look at the filaments, so for each filament we have the sliding displacement, and also we have the motor load. Okay, so we assume that the motor load linearly depends on the relative velocity between the filament. Okay, so here the velocity is taken as meager view. So when you subtract this velocity, actually you increase the load. The load. And then, the fraction of the engaged motors, or say the attached motors, whose kinetics is described by this equation. So, you have the binding term where we assume a constant binding coefficient, and then you have the unbinding term. So, here you can see that as the dynam attaches and generates lighting between the filaments, so then the load increase, which will quickly. Which will quickly trigger unbinding of the motors. Okay, and now we have the sliding force. Okay, so it consists of two parts. So first the active part generated by dynamic binding. And we have also the passive part that comes from the nexine. So the nexine acts like springs. So try to hold the two filaments to its original position. Okay, so. Okay, so yeah, so finally boundary conditions. Okay, so on the base, at the base, we assume no move and clamp boundary condition. Okay, so here actually, so far, so our fragella actually cannot screw. So it's kind of like it's anchored to a magical point in the fluid. And then at the tip, so it's a free tip. So we assume force-free and torque-free boundary conditions. Okay, so here. Okay, so here this is the non-dimensionalized version of our model equations. Okay, so in particular, we are interested in four parameters. So first, the scaled bending rigidity of the stiffer axis. So here in our model, we scale the binding rigidity of the soft axis as one. So this E2 is actually the ratio. It's actually the ratio of the finding rigidity of the steep versus the soft axis. So, here this J is a scale of the twist module modular. So, your fragella can bind and it can also twist. So, yeah, so you can imagine the twist is some characteristic that only exists in 3D model. In 2D model, you cannot have a twist. And next, And next, the sperm number. So, the sperm number, roughly speaking, it characterizes the contributions of binding forces to viscous drag. And then the last one is the mu A, which measures the activity of dynamotors relative to the binding force. Okay, so here this is all our model and several of the parameters that we'll look into very soon. Uh, very soon, okay. So, first, let's think about an isotropic flugella. So, now if you think about the structure of the exoner, okay, so like we mentioned earlier, so you have the 5-6 bridge, which creates a bias in the bending direction, and perhaps the Q micro TV in the inner center also contributed it. Okay, so here in our model, actually, we didn't actually We didn't actually model each individual filament or the 5-6 grid. So, what we do is we actually homogenize the filaments into a cylinder surface. Okay, so now let's first think about an imaginary isotropic element where the 5-6 bridge dialogue is. Okay, so that you can imagine that it's a homogeneous or say isotropic. Isotropic silenar surface, and there's no binding preference, no, no binding direction preference. Okay, so here what you see, okay, so is the projection of the fragellity at different parameter values of mu A and the sperm number. Okay, all right, so here the black dots means that, okay, so the team just. Loss means that, okay, so the tip doesn't stay there. So that means there's no beating of your flagellum. Okay, so the red means the beating, the beating direction is from tip to head. Green means the beating is from head to tail. Okay, and okay, so here you see some of this very large large scale beating that doesn't show clear pattern. And also, I'm not quite sure if you can see it clearly. So here you see. If you can see it clearly, so here you see some small oscillations, but it's away from the center. Okay, so I need to point out that in our model, so there are several places that we make assumption that the beating should be of small scale or say small amplitude. So which allows us to apply some simplification in the derivation of our model. So that, okay, so for these large-scale Large-scale, let's call them chaotic beating, which doesn't show clear patterns. So, okay, so maybe the flagella is just getting drunk or something, or maybe it's just because it's out of the applicable range of our model. So, yeah, so far we can't say too much about these chaotic beatings, so I make them transparent. So, okay, and let's focus on the other beating trajectories. So, here you can see that, so this. So here you can see that this domain can be divided, roughly speaking, divided into four domains. Okay, so down here you have the no move beating. So the flagella just stays there. And the crossing is border, so that's one hop deprecation is triggered. So that the flagella changes from the no move steady state into the periodic beating. Okay, so here you see that most of the 3D beating is perfect circle, say perfect spiral beating, except for a few along the transition from the tail to head to the head to tail zone. And also, so when you are cross-border of the hub of application, you always first have tail to head and then head to tail. And then if you continue to move in this direction, you will enter another domain, which we call it the initial. Uh, we call it the initial condition sensitive domain. The reason is because, okay, so here we play a little bit with the initial condition of our system where we either add an early compression on the tip of the fragella or we add a little early stretching, which creates a little bit bias in the in the in the initial conditions. Okay, so now if you compare this three plots, you can see that so for other domains, so the beating uh patterns looks almost mostly the same, except Mostly the same, except along the transition border from the tail to head to head to tail. Okay, so but here you can see that the peaking patterns inside the IC sensitive, the initial condition sensitive terminates is very different. Okay, so here you have a mix of head to tail and tail to head. This is also mixed, head to tail and tail to head. But with an early compressing condition, so it is your mix, but you see. It is your mix, but you see that this is dominantly heavy tail. Okay, and okay, so let's make a comparison between this isotropic flagella and 2D model. Okay, so both are based on sliding control theory. Okay, and all the other parameters are actually we borrow our parameters from the 2D model research. Okay, so first I would mention that So, first, I would mention that the maximum of the RME way is much smaller than the one in our model. So, this might be a reason why they didn't see the IC sensitive. So, maybe when they keep increasing the Muay, they will see something similar like what we find here, but maybe not. That's why I can say it for sure. Okay, so now if you compare this with basically the bottom part of our Facebook. Bottom part of our face diagram. Okay, so you see that, so they show quite similar patterns. So you both have no move domain, and then when the across a hub fabrication on transition, so you will first have tail to head BT and then head to tail BT. Okay, and also in their 2D model, they also report that, okay, so when you transition from head-to-tail to tail. From head to tail to tail to have. So you might see some strange beating patterns, just like what we have along this trajectory model. Okay. All right. So now let's watch some simulation movies. Okay. So here this is one of, okay, so here this is one clothe hellipating. Okay. So the heat maps will show the dynan activity. And also, okay, so here the width of the flagella. The width of the flagella is not the actual width in our model. So, here I make it wider for better visualization of the diamond activity. So, okay, so let's play. Oh, and sorry, this should be B2. Okay, so yeah, and these curves show the projection of the Fragella center line. Of the flagella center line. Okay, so here you see that the flagella has reached its steady breathing pattern, which is head to tail. Sorry, tail to head. Okay, next, let's see another one, which is a head-to-tail beating. Okay, so okay. Okay, so this one takes a little bit longer for the flagella to reach its steady state. Okay, yeah, so here this is, yeah, it has reached steady states from head to tail. Okay, so then let's move on to the unisotropic fazella. So where are, so the five-six bridge. The 5-6 bridge, and maybe together with center to microtubules, they create a virus in a banding direction. But here there's a question. So how anisotropic it is? So we didn't find data about the actual banding rigidities from Fragella. From flagella, but we indeed we find this very very interesting paper. So, where people built this wooden flagella, so which has nine filaments, okay, and then two microtubules in the center. And then they glue the five and six filament together, and then they test the binding rigidity of this wooden flagella, and they get an estimation that the ratio of the steep. The ratio of the steep versus the soft axis should be about 2.6. Okay, so then with this estimation, okay, so here now let's see what happens in our model when we have an unisotropic fragella. So here we have the bending rigidity on the for the CFER axis 2 and 3. Okay. Okay, so then, okay. Then, okay, so similar to isotropic flugella. So, first, you see the no-move dermae down here. Okay, and what's new here is: so, here, right now, you can see that in this anisotropic flagella, so it can, so the beating can be either 2D or 3D. Okay, and then other than that, similar to the isotropic for Java, so you have either tail-to-head beatings or head-to-tail beating. Beatings or head-to-tail beating. Okay, so here, I will mention that. So, okay, just from our simulation, it looks like there's no direct relation between tail to head and 2D or 3D. So, here you can see you can have 2D tail-to-head or 3D tail-to-head, or you can have 2D tail-to-head and 3D tail to 2D tail-to-head and 2D head to tail. Head and 2D head-to-tail. Okay, but indeed we find that many of the 3D head-to-tail is just chaotic beating. So that's why we make this transparent. And then also up there, you have the SE-sensitive MA, like what we see in the isotropic fragella. Okay, and then we actually will look more into the finding rigidity by keep increasing the B2. Okay, and this is what we find. Okay, so first, like, like I just Okay, so first, like I just mentioned, so it looks like when you have large sperm number and small MUA, so your beating is more stable. So equivalently, that means that 3D head-to-tail beating relatively small than unstable. Relatively, it's not that stable. And then as you increase B2, the bending rigidity of the stiff axis, so first you see that the 2D beating domain will expand. 2D Btin domain will expand, which is very easy to understand, right? Because it's getting much and much harder to binding in this direction. And also we find that, okay, so the tail-to-head domain also expands, and then the IC sensitive domain shrinks. But this might just be a side effect of the shrink of the 3D protein. So here, here you see that, so it's already disappear in the diagram. The diagram. And next, now let's and then we consider so what's the role of the twist? Okay, so we fix the B2 as two and then we increase the twist modular J. Okay, so we didn't see that much change as previously when we changed the bending rigidity. So here when we increase J, okay, so the first thing we find that the IC sensitive actually expands. The IC sensitive domain actually expands. Okay. And we find that, okay, so both the 2D domain and the KO2 head may also expand a little bit. But this is mostly in this region where you have a large sperm number and a large new way. Okay, so yeah, again, let's see to watch two simulation movie. So this is one with two detail to have beating. So if you look at the projection, the green projection, you can see it's very, it's strictly 2D beating. So it's 2D table we have. And then this is And then this is one of the 3D codes we had. Okay, so here you might feel like the bidding is not as smooth as what you see from the isotropic fertile. So this is mostly because right now it's not perfect circle or say perfect spiral. So it gives you an illusion that is kind of An illusion that is kind of like a dancing. Okay. All right. So, this is the first part of my talks. Let's make a quick conclusion of this part. So, first, we develop a 3D fragile model based on sliding control theory. And then we use a model to study the dynamics between planar versus spiral beating. Okay, so we find that, okay, so I. Okay, so we find that okay, so isotropic flagella always goes spiral beating. Well, when they beat it, it's always spiral. And on the other hand, so for unisotropic flagella, so they may undergo either planar or spiral beating, depending on the parameters. And actually, our simulation suggests that planar beating and tail-to-head beating seems to be more stable. Okay, so yeah, so this is the first part of my talk. The first part of my talk, and next, let's move on to think about another different system. So, the hair follicle. So, hair follicle are these mini organs inside mammalian skin. So, that's where our hairs are produced. Okay, so this, let's take a look at the structure of a flagella. So, this is a flagella. So, let's take a look at the structure of a hair forecastle. So, here this is a hierophoreicle. Have a follicle. Okay, so everything starts from the stem cell, which locates near the top of the follicle. Okay, so if you zoom in, you will literally see a little bit bulge. So that's where the stem cells are. So the dynamic part of the follicle is at the bottom. So where you have a cluster of metamorphos cells called dermal papilla. So these cells, they don't divide. So, these cells don't divide, so they mainly participate in sending different signals to instruct other cells. So on top of the dermal papilla, you have a group of epicilial cells called matrix cells. So these are very fast-dividing epicidial cells, and they give rise to our hair shaft that grows upward. Okay, so outside, you have Outside, you have a layer of also epicillial cells called auto root sheets. So, these cells are derived from the stem cell on the top. Okay, so and it's flowing down. And also, you have connective tissue sheets, so magnochemo cells that protect your follicle. If you look at the cross-section of a follicle, so inside you have hair shaft, and then so this structure called inner loose sheets, also derived from matrix from the bottom, so to protect. From the bottom, so to protect the hair shaft, outside, you have other root sheets that's derived from the stem cell that's growing down, and outside you have connected tissue sheets. Okay, so now if you consider the direction of the cell flow in her follicle, okay, so first there's no active movement or migration in follicle cells. There are epicilial cells, but there's few. But there's still the cell flow created by the cell proliferation. Okay, so if you consider the direction of the cell flow, so first it goes down along the ORS, the auto-rule sheets. They make a turn. So that ORS turns into the matrix. And then it goes up from the center, which now it becomes a hair shaft and it grows out of our skin. Okay, so then the direction you can imagine is going down from our side, make a Going down from outside, make a turn at the bottom and then goes up again. Okay. All right. So, why people, generally speaking, why people care about pair follicles? Okay. So, of course, apart from beauty reasons, so from science point of view, it's mostly for stem cell research. So, nowadays, hyperfollicle is kind of like a very popular model for the study of stem cells and regeneration. Okay, so as for regenerations, For regeneration, so hair follicle is an amazing organs, mammalian organ, that it can actually undergo cyclic growth, mostly over the lifespan of the mammal. Okay, so this relates to the hair cycle. So each hair cycle can be roughly divided into three phases. So the growing phase, the anagon. At the beginning, the stem cell gets activated to lead to the downward growth of the follicle. Follicle and one matrix is formed, so it produces the hair shaft. By the end of the end, the apopus large amount of apopals are triggered, which degenerate the follicles. And when the apopals stop, you enter the telegraph phase, which is a quiet phase. Okay, so now here's a question: that how does the hair follicle set a cloud? Okay, so if you think about, for example, human hair, so human hair annex can last for So, human hair and can last for years. Pelagon is relatively short transition region, and Caligan is a relatively short transition region, and Telagon, so it's may last for several months. So, in particular, people are interested in the two checkpoints. So, the Talagon to anagon transition, so when stem cells are activated, and the anagon to taligon transition when apoptosis are triggered. Hypoplases are triggered. So, here we are interested in what can chose or say what determines the anagon to categor transition or in another way. So, what can chose the length of the anagon phase? So that a follicle knows that, okay, so after I grow for several years, okay, so now it's time to die. Okay, so the popular theory for this question is that, okay, so it's matrix cell cycles that determine the anagle life. Cycles that determine the anagon length. So, matrix cells, so these are transient amplifying ampicillial cells, meaning that they have limited dividing potentials. So, when they run out of dividing potentials, they start apoptosis. And when they start apop, when a lot of them start apoptosis and again terminates. So, then based on this theory, we have the easiest model question in this. Easiest model question in this whole workshop. I'm sure this is the easiest one. So, okay, so in mice, averagely takes half a day or say 12 hours for a matrix cell to divide. And again, in mice, typically lasts for two weeks. Then how many cell cycles does a matrix divide in mice? And in humans, it takes averagely one day to divide. So how many cycles you divide in a year? Okay, so it's not very hard, right? Not very hard, right? So, in mice, uh, so that means uh, so you will have 28 uh cell cycle generations, and in human in one year, you will have uh 365. Okay, so now what's the problem here? So, the problem is, okay, so like I said, so matrix cells, these are 295 cells, meaning that they have limited dividing potential, okay, and it's just impossible that they can keep dividing for 100. They can keep dividing for hundreds of cycles. Okay. And for the number in mice, so I don't know the actual number in mice, but still, so 28 looks a little bit more to me. Okay, so now what's the problem? Okay, so then this fact then put a question into this theory. So if it's indeed regulated by matrix, then By matrix, then so basically, there's a contradiction, right? So, matrix cells just it just cannot divide for so many times. Okay, so now we uh develop a multi-scale model to try to answer this question. So, here I don't have time to go too much further into the technical details. So, what we did is, okay, so first we summarize the major signaling events, signaling tog relations from literature, and then we model the signaling dynamics. And then we model the cylinder dynamics using stochastic reaction diffusion equations. And then, for cell-cell interaction, we use a center-based model where the cells are represented by the RNOI calculations. Okay, so first we rewrite this theory and we find that, okay, so indeed, sorry, yeah. Okay, so first we use our model to revise this theory and we find that indeed, so all of our elements are. Or anagons are very short, about eight days. Okay, so the problem is: so, by the end of the anagus, so first you see sparse apoptosis. And when an apoptosis cell shows up, it will send apoptosis signaling to its neighboring cells. So then when you have a lot of apoptosis going on, so because of the signaling, the apoptosis signal, it will traverse coordinated apoptosis wave that degenerate your volume. That degenerate your voices. Okay, so then, okay, so now what's the problem here? So, here, okay, so our model is now the differential equation type of cell lineage model, but actually here we borrowed a very core idea from the classic cell lineage model. That is, homogeneity among cells of the same time. Or to be more precise, so when cells of the same time. Cells of the same time, they have the same signaling profile, they respond or say they behave in the same way. Okay. And of course, your signaling profiles can be different in different ways, for example, stochastic effect or spatial effects. But as long as you have the same signaling profile, so the cells of the same type will behave in the same way. Okay. So, however, so So, however, inspired by recent experimental results, particularly from single-cell data, single-cell results, so people find that, okay, so actually cells, they are much more heterogeneous than people previously saw. So, particularly, so cells build up heterogeneities along a lineage. So, here we borrow this idea. So, here we borrow this idea and we propose this heterogeneous response hypothesis. Okay, so that when a mother cell divides into two daughter cells, we assume that it creates a little bit difference in the response to the signals. Okay, so in the model, so what we do is we so there's a threshold to control the cell cell fate, and then we perturb it a little bit generation after generation. Okay, so Okay, so here we have three groups of simulations with homogeneous response, heterogeneous response, and strong heterogeneous response. Okay, so here these two groups are increased by changing the threshold difference a little bit. Okay, so like earlier with like we earlier said, so in a homogeneous response, you always end up with very short angles. In a heterogeneous response, A heterogeneous response. Okay, so first the increase of the average is a model setup, but it doesn't reflect anything actually biologically. So what's actually interested are these simulations represented by these red squares. So what they mean, what these simulations tell us is that heterogeneous response can actually increase the chance of long analog. Chance of long eyeglass. And then, when we look further into this simulation, so this is what we find. Okay, so we apply our linear tracing analysis to these simulations. Okay, so at the beginning of each simulation, so we give each cell, each epicillio cells are an identical color. And then I cell DY, so the daughter cells always carry the color of their mother. So this way we can track where the cell comes from. Can track so where the cell comes from. So, first, in the homogeneous response simulations, okay, so this is what we find. Okay, so we find that one clone of cells quickly dominate the matrix. Okay, when they dominate, that means they dewide fast. And when they divide fast, that means they quickly bound with the division potentials. Okay, uh, as he is showing here, so you see that so this clone of cells, they quickly divide. So when they reach When they reach to this day, so most of them start apoposis that generates the apoposis wave. Okay. On the other hand, okay, sorry. So yeah, so for this phenomenon we discovered, we call it we name it clonal dominance. On the other hand, so in the lung simulations from a heterogeneous response. Okay, so at first you also see a dominant clone. Okay, but the thing is, so Okay, but the thing is, so in heterogeneous response simulations, so for this dominant clones, as the cell keeps dividing, they become less and less sensitive to the proliferation signal. So that means as they divide, their further proliferation ability or say further dividing ability will be inhibited, which allows the rise of a second column. Okay, so here you see that. So in this emotion, actually. So, here you see that. So, in this motion, actually, we see a sequence of four dominant clones. Okay, so this replacing the previous one. And for this, okay, so for this interesting dynamics, we call it the clonal drift. And then, so if you consider the cell cycle generations of all matrix cells, okay, so here you see that for the very early cologne, so it keeps dividing, but as it divides, so it like I said, so it runs out of. So, it like I said, so it runs out of the dividing potential so that the cells leave the system. But by the end, they start apoposis. So, there's already not enough of them. So, this you will see some sparse apoposis in the system, but it's just not strong enough to generate the apoposis wave. Okay, so all right, so I'm almost done. So, yeah, so this is the linear tracing simulations from our collaborators. At the beginning, so they color the At the beginning, so they color the RS cells. Okay. And then so at 48 Rs and 78, 72 Rs. So it's moving very slowly, but actually, you can see it's moving. Lower SLs are going down to the matrix and then it's slowly moving up in comparison with our linear tracing simulations. So I guess we don't have enough. We don't have enough okay. I'm running out of time, so I don't have enough time to show both of the simulation videos. So let me show this: is the chrono drift because let me quickly show this one. Okay, so the left one shows the hair follicle with different colors showing different types. Okay, so here this is a linear tracing of all cells, and this is just the part of the matrix cells. Okay, so here you see that, okay, so first the red one dominates corresponding to the first. Dominates corresponding to the first dominant clone, and then it's gradually diminished and then substituted or say replaced by the other dominant clones. Okay, so here, okay, so the red one is still there. Okay, so yeah, so this is actually the, it's already the third one. Okay, and so here you have more of the fourth dominant quantity. Yeah, so you can see more and more evolution. Yeah, so you can see more and more apoptosis, and at the end, there's the apoptosis wave. So, yeah, so here this is the summarize of this project. So, we developed a multi-scale model on Hero Folical. And we use it to, and using this model, we discover two interesting phenomena related to the cell flows and also the growth control, so colonial dominance and colonial drift. Dominance and colonial drift. Okay, so yeah, so this is the end of my talk. And so I would like to take this chance to acknowledge my collaborators. So the Flagella project is done in collaboration with my colleague, Dr. Rala Ben Li and Dr. Otom King from UC Riverside. And for the hair follicle project, so the linear tracing simulation is done by Dr. Suna Lin from National Taiwan University. And then also my other collaborator. And also, my other collaborators, Dr. Peters and Dr. Nia from UCLA. Okay, so yeah, sorry about that. So, yeah, thank you very much. And this is the end of my talk. Oh, thank you for an interesting talk. Do people have questions at this point? I have. Oh, sure. I have one. So if you were to. So, if you were to look at the energetics of the flagellum and ask the question: is it more efficient to go in 2D than in 3D? Would that give you any further insight? Yeah, that's a good question. So, it's actually hard because you would have. It's actually hard because you would have to think of the full fluid effect and how much fluid you're moving in the two different regimes. Right. So yeah, so we didn't actually think about energy, but I would assume that, okay, so if your system reaches a steady state, so that should be the minimization of the energy, right? How so? How so? I mean, a question would be: if you assume that the system is dissipating minimum energy, then which of the two modes is the more efficient? Yeah, I'm not quite sure if you can make a fair comparison in that way because. Comparison in that way because, in because, okay, so the two modes will have different parameters, right? So, it's uh, I guess it's possible that, so, okay, so with some parameters where you have the stable 3D patterns, actually maybe it performs, maybe it needs more or less more energy dissipation than a 2D one, but yeah, so. Yeah, so I mean because you have different, so basically you have different parameters in different cases, right? So the energy landscapes are also different. So then, yeah, so I guess to answer your question, we need to figure out the energy landscape for each for each pair of parameters and then compare with them. So, yeah, oh, yeah, so please go ahead. Are there other questions? Please go ahead. Are there other questions? I don't see any one, so I have one more. This parameter μ sub A, I didn't quite get what that represented. Oh, the mu A, the mu A is relatively measures the dynamic activity. So if you look at the model equations. Yeah, so yeah, so this part is basically the effects from the dynan binding. And so mu A is coefficients to the Dynan binding. So how does one understand the transition from, was it tail to head to head to tail or head to tail to head, tail to head as you increase mu? Okay, so before I answer this question, so there's one thing I need to point out. So, right now, so this flagella is not actually swimming, so it's anchored to the point, right? So actually, so some 2D model research, this suggests that, okay, so like what I showed here, so when you have the same 2D model, so this is also with a no-move and a climb boundary condition. And bone recognition. You see this tail to head and then head to tail beating. But then actually, so when the flagella, when you allow it to actually swim in the fluid, so everyone will be head to tail. So that's what we learned from 2D model. But yeah, so far in our 3D model, we haven't let it swim. So yeah. And so Yeah, so okay, so now about so now for this model okay so so so far okay so so for these different transitions and also maybe later in the anisotropic anisotropic plot. So let's show this one. Okay. Yeah, so the the only Yeah, so the only transition we understand so far is the hub verification. So that's when the leading eigenvalue crosses the imaginary axis. So unfortunately for all the other transitions, so far we don't know what leads to these transitions. So we actually checked the first few eigenvalues in both phi one and phi two directions, but so it looks like so there's no correspondence between No correspondence between the other eigenvalue crossing and this transition. So, yeah, so far we just don't know what triggers these transitions. Okay, Leah has a question and I will can you unmute Leah Keshet, please? Oh, you want me to ask it? Sure. Oh, okay. Yeah, hi, great talk. I was interested in what kind of computation. Interested in what kind of computations you did in the hair follicle model. Is it vertex-based simulations of the cells or yeah, so this is not a vertex model. So this is basically just it's basically just the where is the on where is the model page. Oh, here. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, so this is basically the center-based model. So, so you're considering the interactions of based on their center. Yeah. And we just use a volonalized isolation. Oh, got it. Okay. And do you assign states to the different cells? Are there like differential equations for each of the cells? Or yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. So, yeah. Yeah, sorry. So, yeah, so the differential equation is for the diffusive signaling distribution. And then I suppose you are asking, so how does cell make decision on the cell phase? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so okay, so basically, so each cell carries several different, several signals, right? So some of them let it divide, some of them let it differentiate, or some others let it to start ecologists. So basically, okay, so each cell. Corpuses. So basically, okay, so each cell carries this signaling profile. And then we have, so basically, we set thresholds to different type of cells and to different signals. And then so every computational step, so we compare the cell signaling profile to the threshold. And then we make decisions on whether it should divide or differentiate. Okay, thank you very much. You're welcome. You're welcome. Okay. If there aren't any further questions, well, thank you again for a good talk. And we will resume.
