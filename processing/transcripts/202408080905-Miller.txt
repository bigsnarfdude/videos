With my unlink, which sits inside of S3, right? An unlink is an S3. And I'm going to think of S3 as being a cross-section of a standard height function on S4. So when I say H here, I mean height. That's not how you spell that. Height in S4, where each H inverse of T, let's say like 0 less than T less than 4, is a copy of the 3-sphere. And then H inverse. sphere and then h inverse of zero and h inverse of four are both points so this is just a standard morse function a standard morse function on s4 with an index zero and an index four critical point okay so somewhere in the middle here i have my unlink sitting inside of a cross section and at the same time i have a collection of bands attached to that unlink each band is a rectangle where two opposite edges sit on the actual link Sit on the actual link, and the other two edges on the boundary of the rectangle don't sit on the link. And the bands are embedded in the complement. So, this is a really uninteresting example. The diagram that I've drawn is really something like this is L and this is V. Okay. But given this diagram, I've constructed an actual embedding of a surface by, well, below this cross-section, my surface is going to consist of. My surface is going to consist of a bunch of disks, which I've drawn here, bounded by that unlink. So these are trivial disks bounded by L below this cross-section. But I've also required in my definition that when I take L and surgery it along these specific bands V, that I again get an unlink. So in this example, So, in this example, when I do this band surgery, I get an unknot, which is like just the best unlink, which means that I could also cap it off with trivial discs. So, above this cross-section, I'll have even more trivial discs bounded by, well, not L, but L sergered along V, which I'll just write as like L V. Okay, so let's do some examples. Let's do like the, oh, oh, actually. Let's do like the. Oh, oh, actually, sorry, before examples, let me draw the round picture. The point of these diagrams is that they really describe the restricted Morse function from ambient space on a smooth surface in S4. So this rectilinear surface I drew on the right, I mean, you can see just schematically, it's clearly isotopic to the one on the left, right? The one on the left is what you would get if you smoothed all the corners. So the correspondence between the left diagram and this rectilinear diagram. Diagram and this rectilinear diagram that came from the bandit unlink is that really I have this Morse function on my surface that has minima, maxima, and most interestingly, saddles. And I could pick like a gradient-like vector field on the actual surface. So I have some, you know, nabla h. And really what I've done is start off from the saddles, I'm going to consider the flow lines of my descending manifold from each index. Descending manifold from each index one critical point. Each of these saddles has one flow line that goes like up or up in two directions called the ascending manifold, and two that go down maximally, the descending manifold. Okay. And then same thing with this other critical point. I have my descending manifold. And so really what I've done is I've taken an unlink, which is just the boundary. Which is just the boundary of a neighborhood of all of these minima points. This is my unlink L. And then I've taken a collection of bands, which really just describe these index one critical points by describing their descending manifolds. So for each of these arcs, I just flatten it out, push it down using this Morse function to get a band attached to my surface. Sorry, my link. What do you guys think about that? What do you guys think about that? I think a lot of people have seen this before. If you have never seen this before, I mean, I feel like if you just look at the left and the right picture, they look the same. So maybe that's pretty convincing. Okay, so let's do some examples. Here's the best example. So this is a banded unlinked diagram on the left. L is just an unknown and V is empty, no bands. So here's L, V is empty. So let's construct the surface. D. So let's construct the surface described by this diagram. The surface has one cross-section in the middle, that's just L. And then below this cross-section, I should have a trivial disk bounded by this unnaught. And above this cross-section, since there aren't any bands, I again have a trivial disk bounded by this unnaught. So I can see that this two-sphere has the great property that this S2. That this S2 in S4 bounds AB3 because it just bounds this like disk cross I. So this is a diagram of what's called the unknotted two-sphere. Unknotted. It's isotopic to the nice standard round one. Okay, so that's why it's the best example. Here's the second best example. Here's another banded unlink diagram on the right side. Again, L is just an unknot, but now I've included some bands. So I have my V bands, there's two of them. So if I construct the surface that I get from this, in the middle, I have a copy of L and then I have these two bands sitting here below. Below this cross-section, I'll have a trivial disk bounded by L. And above this cross-section, let me zoom in, I'm going to have a set of disks, or at least one disc, bounded by the length that I get by doing surgery to L along V. So this is L surgered along V, which is again an unnaught. So it makes sense to cap that off with the trivial dip. Sense to cap that off with a trivial disc. Okay, so this is like a really explicit picture of a surface inside of S4. And the way I've drawn it, I think it's hard to look at it and see what it is. But we do know that these bands and these minimum and maximum disks correspond to a Morse function on the surface, which means we know what the Euler characteristic of the surface is. Because the Euler characteristic should be the number of minima, there's one, minus the number of saddles, two, for two bands. Two for two bands, plus the number of maxima for like one maximum disk, zero. And maybe you could convince yourself that looks orientable. So, this must be a torus sitting inside of S4. But in fact, this is like a really nice torus. There's something really special that I just want to point out because it's like kind of worth knowing, I think, in these diagrams. That whenever you have two bands that look like this, which is what I would call dual, you have one band that You have one band that's long and complicated. Who knows what goes on with the sky? But then you have a second band, which just the feet attach very close to the end of the other band, and it doesn't do anything interesting. So you have this local model. What is this really describing? Well, it's describing a surface where at the bottom we have these black strands and they trace out over time something two-dimensional. They trace out over time something two-dimensional. By time, I mean height. And then these bands appear. And let's say first, I'll have the long complicated band appear. Okay, so after it appears, I have a surface where I've done this band surgery. Something like this at the top. And then let's look at this other band that I called the dual band. The reason that it's so good is that I could isotope this band to look. I could isotope this band to look like this. The same. So if I just took this band and slid this circled end, like I mentioned that I pushed it along the edge of the long band. And simultaneously, I took this other end and I pushed it along the other edge of this long band. Then this dual band would be a little bit more. Then, this dual band would really turn in to this blue thing that I've just drawn. Like, this isn't really allowed in a band diagram because I said the band needs to be attached to L, and now I've like attached it to another band. But like, at least it is isotopic to this band if I sort of ignore that restriction. So, when I'm building my surface, I could imagine this other band as really just cutting across the middle, just like this, because it's really the same thing as the blue band. Same thing as the blue band. This is the blue thing. Okay. So then I end up with this kind of resolution after the band surgery. So maybe this is like a familiar picture to you. You might recognize this as like, I don't know, a hyperbolic saddle doubled or something. You really might recognize this as like a tube. Like, look at this thing that I just drew. It has like a bottom, a top, sides. A top, sides. It just looks like I have two vertical sheets and then I tubed them together. So it's that's like a useful thing to note because that's something that we do all the time to surfaces in four manifolds is attach tubes to them. And that tells me exactly what this surface is because, well, it's obtained from the two-sphere that I started off with in my first example by attaching a tube to it. And it's a really A tube to it, and it's a really uninteresting tube. I have a just a round two-sphere, and I attach a tube just like this. And this is a picture of a torus in S4 that bounds a solid torus because it bounds that same three-ball from before, but then I drilled the tube out from it. So, this is a diagram of the unknotted torus. Knotted Taurus and S4. Okay. So I know these are like maybe not the most riveting examples because they're both unknots, but we can draw diagrams of things that aren't unknotted. Like here's a knot called the spon trefoil. We could at least believe maybe that this is a banded unlinked diagram, even if it's suddenly much harder to imagine the surface. Because it's very clear, I think, that this L is a two-component unlink. A two-component unlink. Like, forget the bands. Just look at that. Imagine doing a Vitamyster 2 move here. I'll let you think about that for a second. That's an unlink. Do we all agree? Three, two, one. Yes, good. Okay, that was a 10 minute. And we can also check that if we do the band surgery to L, that we again get an unlink. So even if we can't exactly imagine the surface as explicitly as we did in the previous examples, we know the construction work. We know the construction works, and there must be a surface that has two minima corresponding to the two minima of L, two saddles corresponding to the two bands in L, and two maxima corresponding to the fact that when we do the surgery, this is a two-component unlink. So the Euler characteristic. So the Euler characteristic is 2 minus 2 plus 2 equals 2. So this is a 2-sphere. And sort of this is what its like Morse function looks like as a schematic. But actually, I'm making it sound like it's really hard to imagine. We can totally imagine the surface because we understood this tube thing. Like, look at this pair of bands. That's that standard form for like attaching a tube to a surface that we just saw. So, really, I know that this two-sphere is the same as if I started. Sphere is the same as if I started off with just this two-component unlink as a diagram and then attached a tube to the surface that I got. So ie attach tube to a union of two S2s and S4, a disjoint union. So here's my, this is, this is really a picture. So here's my, this is really a picture of my disjoint union. I know this looks like an unlink, but you're supposed to imagine that this is a two-sphere sitting inside of S4. And I have a fourth dimension, which is hard to imagine, right? So wherever it looks like the other component is going over, it means that really it has a higher fourth coordinate. And where it's going under, it means it has a lower fourth coordinate. It's just like you're explaining usual knot diagrams to like someone who only sees in two dimensions. To like someone who only sees in two dimensions, right? We break the strand when it goes under. Okay, so I have this one two-sphere, and then I have this other two-sphere. And then I've attached a tube to join the two two-spheres along an arc that looks like this. So let's just attach that tube. Oh, partial. And instead of two two-spheres, I'll have one. Okay, so this is my surface. This is really, again, a very explicit picture of it sitting inside of S4. The thing that I drew has rotational symmetry up to the best of my ability about an axis that looks like this. It intersects this twice. This S2 is symmetric. And if you look at this specific example, not only is it symmetric, but really I got this example by taking a tangle, in this case, a tangle for the trefoil knot. You can see it sitting there. And I just spun it about that axis. That's how I got this two-sphere. And so that's why this is called the spun trefoil. Okay, so this is a really well-known family of examples. And in fact, we can get band diagrams for like way better examples than this. We can draw band diagrams. This. We can draw a band diagram for like the Roll Spun figure eight, if you know what that is, or the one twist turn T25, which is maybe an exotic naught a Taurus. Who knows? If you know what that is. But the disclaimer is that actually figuring out how you get these diagrams is a separate trick. I won't justify myself. But I will show you how to get diagrams for one family. So here's one useful family that we have to understand because of what the goal theorem is: go up, twist of twist, but not. twist spin knots. We can understand band diagrams of n twist spins of k. So here k is a knot, any knot you want, and n is an integer, any integer you want, and you'll get a knot of 2 sphere in S4. And this is a family introduced by Zeeman in the 1960s, very well studied, lots of useful properties, and very easy to draw a band diagram for. For. So, you do need to know a definition, I guess, not really, of a twist, but not. So, these are defined by Zeeman in the 1960s. Should I give you a definition? I guess so. Zeeman said, let's decompose S4 into two pieces, B3 cross S1, union S2 cross D2. And one argument for why you might want to do this is that as far as Why you might want to do this is that S4 is four-dimensional and therefore scary. So we cut it into two pieces, which are technically four-dimensional but seem less. B3 cross S1 is basically a circle or a three-ball, depending on your perspective, and those things are both good. Same thing with S2 cross D2. And in particular, what we want to do is try to build a two-sphere, decomposing it in the same way. So we're going to build a two-sphere as an As an annulus glued to two disks, S0 crossed T2. So you should think of your two-sphere as like looking like this. It's two disks glued to an annulus. And so we're going to build a two-sphere inside of S4 by including our annulus into B3 cross S1 using this product structure, basically, and including our two disks into S2 cross disks. Disks into S2 cross disk, again using the product structure. So B3 cross S1, I always like to draw it by thinking of B3 cross I with the ends glued together. B1 cross S1. Oh, yeah, thanks. I wrote S1 cross S1. That doesn't make sense. I cross S1. Thank you. One. Thank you. Okay, glue the ends together. And so, what I'm going to do is build an annulus that depends on both my choice of not K and my choice of integer N. In each ball, I'm going to include a copy of a tangle for K. So I have a tangle for K, one-stranded. So it's going to have two ends. Going to have two ends, the top and bottom. And so, what I'm going to do in the simplest case, I could just take that tangle cross i and glue the ends together by the identity. But instead, I'm going to use the parameter n. And as I go from left to right, and I'll have more pictures of this later, I'm going to rotate this whole tangle n whole times about an axis that goes through those two points. So So, here's like a ball in the middle. Maybe if I twist n times, after a little while, instead of it looking exactly the same, I'll have the same tangle, but it will have rotated some degree about that axis. Like here, it looks like I rotated pi so far around, right? I would need to go two pi around to have one full twist. And as long as Have one full twist. And as long as I twist a whole number of times, and I will twist n times, then at the end, I'll have exactly the same tangle that I started with. And it makes sense to glue the ends together. And this gives me an annulus. So annulus depends on K and on N. Okay, so that's the portion of the two-sphere that's inside of B3 crosses one, and that's really the complicated. B3 crosses one. And that's really the complicated portion. The other portion is not very interesting at all. In S2 cross D2, I'm not even going to draw a picture. I'm just going to say the boundary of the tangle, which is two points, cross D2. That's what I'm going to cap off my two-sphere with. So those are, that's clearly two disks sitting inside of S2 cross D2. And the boundary is boundary of tangle cross S1. Boundary of tangle crosses one, which is exactly the boundary of this annulus that I just made. So it makes sense to glue those things together. And this is my two-sphere, and it's called the n-twist spin. Okay, so this is a really useless picture for what we want to do. So instead of thinking of my decomposition of S4 as abstract, I really want to see the B3 cross S1 and the S2 cross D2 sitting inside of S4. I think the best way to do this. Is with this like sort of open book looking picture. So, this is this is a schematic. Well, actually, no, this is not a schematic. This is just like a cross-section. We're just one dimension down. Everything's, this is fine. This is a real picture. So, I have my two-sphere sitting here. This is supposed to be my maybe S2 cross the center of the disk, S2 cross zero. It looks one-dimensional because I'm only drawing a three-dimensional cross-section, but it's really a two-sphere. Okay. Okay, um, and then I have all of my B3 cross thetas for different angle thetas, and I've drawn a few of them sticking out of this two-sphere, right? So, this two-sphere, the complement is B3 cross S1. So, you can see my circles worth of what look like pages or disks, but I'm one dimension down. So, they're really three balls. So, this is a three-ball. Okay, and there's a circle's worth of them. And I'm building a two-sphere. Building a two-sphere whose intersection with every one of these three balls is a copy of a tangle from my NOPK. So I drew one of those. I drew one tangle sitting inside of V3 cross zero. But really, I need to have a copy of that tangle in every single three ball. And I can see the twisting explicitly. What happens is, well, the tangles all look exactly the same, almost all the way around the circle. I just have like tangle, cross I, nothing interesting happens. Nothing interesting happens. And I'm going to do my twisting all at once. And I put it in this sort of circle interval between zero and epsilon. I'm just going to very rapidly twist my tangle in times. And I didn't draw that because that is hard. Okay. But the nice thing about the schematic is, even though it looks bad, remember that band diagrams describe Morse functions. So where are the saddles? Where are the saddles and where are the minima? Should be enough information for us to get our band diagrams. And in this picture, where are the saddles? Where are the minima? Well, they're here. So a minimum is going to correspond to rightmost points in my tangle, like minimum bridges of the actual tangle itself. Because think about it, a neighborhood of one of these points. About it, a neighborhood of one of these points just in the actual tangle has it's a little interval that opens to the left, right? So as I spin this tangle at the very bottom here, it has this little neighborhood that now opens up. But at the same time, I'm spinning, which means since I'm at the very bottom, it also opens up in the other direction, and it's going to give me a local minimum of the Morse function restricted to my surface. To my surface. So these minima somehow correspond to bridge points. We're not going to like really do the details of how they correspond, but roughly the number of them should be the number of bridge points of my tangle. So bridges in tangle. And then you might ask, what about the other bridges in the tangle? Other bridges in the tangle that open in the other direction? Like, what about the bridges that are leftmost points in this tangle? So, this has a neighborhood that opens to the right. Can you indicate the Morse function? Yeah. Here it is. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Morse function just then sort of looks like it's going upward in the picture. So, if I have a local maxima in this tangle with respect to like a bridge diagram of this tangle, then it'll have a neighborhood in the actual tangle itself that opens to the right, which means as I spin down, this neighborhood will open downward. But at the same time, since I'm spinning in some other direction, I'll trace out something that's opening upward, which is why this point is. Upward, which is why this point is going to give me a saddle in my surface with respect to the height function towards the bottom of the diagram. And by symmetry, it'll also give me a saddle at the top of the diagram. So what's going on here is that this one saddle, or this, this one critical point, this one saddle, is giving me two saddle points in my actual surface. And that's why in this little diagram that I drew, I have two bands. That I drew, I have two bands. And one of these saddles is like really far away from all the twisting because all the twisting happened above the middle cross section. So it's like nice and straight and it like has nothing to do with the number of twists. But the other settle is like more complicated because it came from this critical point, but there's all of this twisting that happens in between this bridge point and the actual set. This bridge point and the actual saddle in the surface. So, if I were going to trace out the descending manifold of this index one critical point, I would start here and go down, but then I do all this twisting and like it twists a bunch of times before eventually it comes down to the middle cross section. So that'll cause one of the bands to twist n times like this. Okay, so I know it's like a vague explanation, but I know it's like a vague explanation, but this is supposed to be a what's my trick, and I haven't really told you the trick, so that's how that's how it is. That was the plan, that's the plan. Um, and practicing, practically, it's really easy to like do. What you do is you start off with k some k bar. That's easy, and you just find all of the bridge points of your not k and the corresponding mirror in k bar, and you fuse them together along horizontal arcs like this. Horizontal arcs like this. And so this is this link that I drew here. And that's going to be an unlink. It has to be, because of just the way we've constructed it. It's an unlink. And then for every time that you fused and got that in order to join two points in K and K bar, we're going to add a pair of bands. And one of those bands is going to be short and straight. And just remember where we did this fusion. Where we did this fusion. And the other band is going to look long and complicated. And it's really just parallel to where we did the fusion, but it also twists in times about a meridian. So this is our formula for how we're going to get a diagram of so-called twist spun knots. And there's really a general picture. Looks like this, where we have some clasp diagram or bridge diagram of our knot. We can always do it. This is just the exact same. Can always do it. This is just the exact same procedure that I said before, just a scarier diagram. I took K and K bar drawn here at the top and bottom. I fused them together along minima or maxima in bridge diagrams and then added a pair of bands for every time I did that. If I put in a class diagram for the trefoil, then I just get back to exactly where I started. These two diagrams here are isotopic. Okay, so that's. Okay, so that was bad, but we're done. That's good. So, why is this useful? Why would I possibly care about this? Well, there's a Riedemeister theorem. Swenton, 2002, some more details. Keert and Carlin in 2012 show that diagrams of isotopic surfaces are related by band moves, which means I haven't told you what the moves are yet, but now that you know there is a Reidemeister theorem, it's a very natural thing to do. It's like, oh, given two surfaces, how do I prove they're isotopic? Two surfaces, how do I prove they're isotopic? Well, if they are isotopic, then their band diagrams are related by moves. So, let's just try to do that. So, that really is the trick. You just sort of do it. So, here are the moves. They're easy. One of them is called cap or cup, sort of the same move. Locally, I can add a trivial band to my diagram, or I can add a trivial unlink component attached via a short band. So, one of these is called cup, one of these is called cap. So, one of these is called cup, one of these is called cap. Here's the schematic for what this move is. Really, I'm just perturbing my surface. This is why it's isotopey. I'm perturbing it relative to the relevant height function. So either I add or remove, let's say I add a minimum, an unlinked component, and a band, which would be in a saddle. So I've added an index zero, one pair. Pair, or maybe I add a band, which would be a saddle, band equals saddle. But at the same time, that means that when I do the band surgery, I will have one more component. So I'll also have one more maximum. Maximum. So in that case, I'll isotope my surface and get a new index 1, 2 pair. Okay, so that's sort of a Okay, so that's sort of a natural move. Another move is that we can slide one band over another. So on this picture, you're supposed to think this band stayed still from left to right, but the other one, I passed this left end over the length of the other band, and it turned into this diagram. So that's called the slide because you're sliding one band along the edge of another. This is really an isotope. This is really an isotopy where we're sort of choosing the relative height of these critical points in our surface. And at some point in the middle, something not something non-generic could happen. Like maybe I have a hexagon on my surface. It's called a monkey saddle. And I have to like choose how I'm going to perturb it to be Morse. And there's a few different ways of doing it. And then the last move, there's only three is called a swim, where you're supposed to imagine that one of these bands is like a river, like Like a river, like this one. It's like a channel. It's just, I guess, wet. And the other band is allowed to swim through the river, but it can't go off the banks, right? So if the other band is sitting here, it could just swim through the river and turn into this diagram. Okay. So you're supposed to think that this move is describing what happens when one saddle goes above another in space, not locally in the In space, not locally in the surface, but like just actually in four-dimensional space. If one is above the other, like of course, you can push them left or right. Nothing bad happens. It just looks weird in the diagram because we lost a dimension. Okay, so those are all the moves. I don't remember if I'm supposed to scroll down to the left or the right now. Oh, yeah, no, we're not going to do that. Okay, so here's the theorem, an example theorem, which is less than the goal theorem, but this was my sub-goal in case that took longer than expected. So we're still good. Case that took longer than expected, so we're still good. We're still good. Um, so for any k, the plus or minus one twist spin of k is smoothly unknotted. Uh, Zeeman's proof. Oh, wait, sorry, I scrolled too far back. Oh, here it is. Zeman's proof is very topological. Like, he really proved that these twist spin knots, their complements are fibered over S1, and he knows what the fibers are. There are certain cyclic branched covers, punctured. Cover is punctured. In the case of N is one, there's like no branching, and you just get that the fiber is punctured S3, which is B3. So, of course, they're unknotted. That's a great argument. That's like the correct argument, but it's a very topological proof. It's a very topological construction. It's really hard to like look at a one-twist bin and see that it's unknotted. They seem really complicated, like the sort of like hard unknot diagrams in the classical dimension. When I was in grad school, When I was in grad school, like the end of my first year of grad school, I went to this grad student conference at Indiana, and Chuck LeMiston asked me if I had like a visual or diagrammatic reason that one twist spins were unknotted. And I did not. But I thought about it really hard and I came up with an argument, which I thought was like a really good diagrammatic argument. And then I found this paper of Maramoto and Nakanishi, who proved the same thing. So that was too bad. But here's a really cool theorem. Um, but here's a really cool theorem: Marmoto, Naka Nishi for any k, the one twist bin, and plus or minus one twist bin is smoothly unknown. I realize it's the same statement, but their proof is you just sort of do it, which again, I realize is unsatisfactory. But here's here's the proof. I'll just do it for one example, okay? Um, let's say that the one twist spun trefoil. We're going to prove that this is unknotted, and in the course of this proof, you will understand what they did, I think. They did, I think. So, this is our band diagram. We understood how to get this. We know that this describes the one-twist spun trefoil knot. And that means if we want to prove that this is unknotted, all we have to do is show how to do band moves to turn this diagram into the diagram of the unknotted sphere, which we also understand. It's just an unknot with no bands attached. Okay, so step one: let's take this strand in the back, and I'm going to pull it up. And I'm going to pull it up, keeping it behind. I'm just doing isotopy of the diagram. And if I do, this is like something you should never do in talks: a diagrammatic argument with a long series of steps, but that's the trick, you know? So just getting good at that is the trick. So, okay, we're going to pull it up in the back and we're going to get this diagram. And okay, now it doesn't look like a trefoil anymore. So let's fix that. This strand that I just pulled up. Well, first of all, let's simplify this band. Okay, it doesn't need to look like that. This band. Okay, it doesn't need to look like that. Okay, the strand that I just pulled up, let's pull it back down, but this time I'm going to keep it in front instead of behind. Okay, so I'll pull it down so it's in front. My bands look really complicated now. That's a bummer. But I could simplify them because I have band moves. What can I do? Well, I'm going to take this long, complicated, ugly band, and I'm going to slide it over the edge of the other long, complicated. Edge of the other long complicated ugly band. And that's actually really good because if you look at these bands, they both sort of come under and then back over again, which means that when I slide one, it's going to all cancel out. Like this new band, it goes under, under, under, over, but then back over and back under. So like nothing happened at all. So I could just isotope that to this, which is way better. And I could do the same thing again. I'm going to slide the Thing again. I'm going to slide the long band over the short band. Oops. Which looks bad, I guess. But if we simplify it, we get this. Okay, and so does anybody remember what this is? That was a lot, but this is something that's very familiar because what is this? This satisfies our formula for how we get a diagram of a twist spin. This is the one twist spin of a knot that has a diagram. That has a diagram. I know City's there. That looks like this. Like, if I took this diagram and I applied the procedure, that's the unlink I would get. That's the bands that I would get. Those are the bands that I would get. And of course, this is the unknown. So this is the same thing as the one twist bin of the unknot. Okay, so it's much easier to prove that the one twist bin of the unknot is unknotted. Spin of the unknot is unknown. You could do that in lots of ways. I mean, one twist, like twisting the unknot diagram is the same thing as not doing anything at all because, like, the unknot tangle just kind of looks like this. So, it's like, is this twisting about the axis? Who knows, right? So, it doesn't matter how many times you twist the unknot, you get the same thing. This is what Nakanishi Maranoto did. They just proved that you could do crossing changes to one twist spin. So, one twist spin of any knot. Twist spins. So one twist spin of any knot is isotopic to the unknot via this diagrammatic style argument. And then if you wanted to, you could. I mean, like you could just sort of like, this is just for fun. It's very easy to like just sort of unknot this. Just don't look at this that hard. Okay. That was just me. Okay, great. Let's not talk about that anymore. So, my goal theorem in the last three minutes, I think I am going to show you a picture of what that looks like. I was going to talk about I was going to talk about band diagrams in general four manifolds. I know I don't have to, which is great. But let me just point out that in a general four-manifold, we're going to be thinking about still an unlink, still bands. But now instead of drawn in S3, it's drawn in a Kirby diagram. So it's just sitting in a Kirby diagram that describes our ambient four manifold. And we're going to surface in exactly the same way. Don't think about that that hard. Ignore these. Yeah, don't look at that. Okay. So we're going to have to add. So, we're going to have to add two more moves of equivalence, which are we're going to have to know that we can slide or move our bands that are in our actual manifold, in our surface, directly below or directly above the two handles that are in our manifold. So, here's a picture of a band in our diagram, and I've pushed it below a two-handle curve. And I'm being picky here. Like, if I want to talk about isotopy of surfaces, I need to know. Isotopy of surfaces, I need to never move my two-handle curves. That's scary. Like, I need my four-manifold to be well-defined. If I only care about equivalence, then it's okay to move the two-handle curve. Okay. The other move that I need to allow is that I need to allow my bands to go over two handles, which means I'm just going to allow now I'll have my band diagrams. I'm allowed to slide bands over two handles. And these are the only two things that I need to add. And I could draw a banded unlink sitting inside of a four-manifold. Inside of a four-manifold, and these are again these moves and the original moves are the only things that I need to consider in order to understand smooth isotopy or equivalence of surfaces. So what's the point of that? It's a theorem of Melvin that the Gluck twist of a two-sphere in S4 is diffeomorphic to the blowdown of that two-sphere connects some CP1 and CP2. And this gives a way of approaching the Gluck twist problem diagnostic. The Gluck twist problem diagrammatically. So, remember, we're trying to prove that the Gluck twist operation applied to a twist spun knot is diffeomorphic to S4. That's the goal. One minute, we're going to do this. Melvin tells us that we can do this diagrammatically because all we have to do is draw a band diagram of this particular two-sphere sitting inside of CP2, or this twistbunk connects some CP1. And if we can prove that that two-sphere is equivalent to CP1, then that means we'll know that its blowdown is the same. means we'll know that its blowdown is the same as the blowdown of CP1, which is S4. Okay, so that's our goal. Twistbona connects some CP1 as standard. How do you do that? We know what twist funnel is. We know what CP1 is. Maybe you'll believe that that's CP1. I didn't like, I think you could just maybe guess connected sum. It's you take connected sum. Nice. So here's CP1. Connect sum are twist one knot. We're trying to prove this is standard. Well, what is this? Well, what is this? It's just our twist button knot with a two handle attached along a meridian. And all the meridians, like of a knot or length, they're all the same. We can just put that two handle on a different meridian. Okay, and so now I have these moves. I could slide all of these bands over this two handle. And if I did, I would get something with an extra twist, and the two handle goes around more curves. And then I could swim this band, these. This band, this two handle through all of these bands. And if I did, oh, then I would get something like this. But look at this two handle, it goes around almost all of this diagram, which means I could just sort of isotope it, isotope it, until eventually it's just a meridian on the other side. So really, I just got this CP1 connect sum twist n plus one of k. n plus one of k. So we showed that we can always add one twist, which means all of the n-twist spins blown up are equivalent inside of CP2. In particular, they're all equivalent to the one twist spin blown up, and we know very explicitly that this is the unknown, which means they're all equivalent to CP1. So the blowdowns are all standard. Okay, so I had a bunch of examples for things that I use these diagrams for in papers. And then I saw Kyle was here and I forgot we used that in our paper. I should have put that. That was a good one. Paper. I should have put that. That was a good one. But so I don't have any marks on MR surfaces, and I would recommend this trick. And thank you. Okay, let's stop. Questions on that? Who is the like general four manifold moves future? Me and Mark and Salon. It's in a paper. And Mark and Salon. It's in a paper from 2018: Band Diagrams and Isotopy of Surfaces and Four Manifolds. And so then there's like a very careful Morse theory argument about general position stuff. Any other questions? Can I ask you a question? May I ask a question? Yeah. Yeah. Just in the case of Notatori, can we read off whether the Notatoris is ribbon or not from the diagram, from the band diagram? Oh, well, proving that it's not ribbon from a band diagram would be very hard. But in particular, we saw this general form for tubes in a circus. So if we can draw a diagram, Draw a diagram that looks like an unlink and sets of bands that are always attached in pairs where one of the bands is long. This is like somehow the most complicated band I could draw, but the other band in the pair is just a dual band to it, then we'll always get a ribbon surface. And every ribbon surface does have a diagram of this form, but turning an arbitrary diagram into one of this form might be hard. One of this form might be hard. Does that make sense? I see, I see. Thank you so much. Well, let's take Maggie again. Thanks, Judas.
