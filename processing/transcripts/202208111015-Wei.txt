Thank you, Ricard, and I want to thank the organizers for the invitation. It's really a great pleasure to be here. So I'll talk about this about semi-local simple connectedness of rich limited spaces, which are based on the three works. On the three works. First is joint with Jiyin Pang. I think he is in the audience, so you can ask questions. And the other two works is joint work between Jiyin Pang and Qi Ken Wan and by Qi Keng Wang himself. So this in this, all of them in the archive, and a few of them already being accepted a while back, actually. Okay. So let me start. Let me start with the outline. So I will start with the background, then state the results, and may hopefully get the idea of the proofs. Okay, so maybe let's start with this grammar-haused of distance. Of hostile distance, I think. Maybe we already covered a lot in this, so just to get started. So, in one of the basic thing in this study about manifold with rich curvature bond is Gromov's peripheral compactness. Namely, if you have a sequence of manifold with rich low bond, then there always a sub-sequence which converges. And if it's non-compact, we have. If it's non-compact, we understand as pointed Gramov-Host of convergence. So this really why we study this kind of limit is right in order to study the sequence, it's very really almost equivalent sometimes study the limit. If we have good structure about the limit, then we can go back, say something about sequence. Say something about sequence, or if we have some good control of the sequence, then that can pass to the limit. So that's lots of work we have. It's about the sequence pass to the limit, but if we understand the limit, then it also helps us understand the sequence of the manifold. Okay. So now let me get a precise definition. Precise definition, the language we call this lichen limit space if this sequence of manifold with rich lower bond, and it's one of the limit. And if in addition the sequence has a volume lower bond, then uniformly, then the X is called non-collapsing Litch limit space. So, this is a special kind of Lich limit spaces. Just when we study this kind of one thing actually kind of maybe immediate surprise or it's a little bit we can to be careful about this. This kind of limited space could have even in non-collapsing case could have locally infinite topology namely for example second BT number could be infinite Second bitty number could be infinite in arbitrarily small ball. So, which is a look very different from the one, the manifold we used to. So, this is a forced by Meng Yu in 2000. And that's also a big contrast with manifold, with sectional curvature-loh bond. In that case, the limit is referred to as Alexandrov space. Referred to as Alexander space, and in this case, the space is always locally contractible. Okay, so locally, in some sense, there's no topology, it's more closely like a manifold case. So, therefore, you know, while this topology is so complicated, one wonder, can one still say something about it? And still say something about it. I mean, traditionally, for manifold with rich curvature bond, it gives a really good control on the fundamental group usually, but not high beta numbers. So one still would like to, you know, have some control on the maybe on the fundamental group. And that's the goal of the talk. Okay, so in general, about literally limit space. In general, about literally limited space, there's lots of studies. So mainly due to Chiga coding and labor. So I think maybe we already could kind of reveal some of the a little bit here. So this is about the geometric structure of rich limited space. To study the structure, we consider so-called tangent cone. Called tangent cone. That's a blow-up limit. So for manifold, we always have a tangent space, and that's a really nice approximation about the space. So basically, you take sequence numbers going to infinite, and you scale the space, and you blow up. So you get a kind of linear approximation of the space. And the only thing in this case, this See in this case, this limit always exists but may not be unique. Okay, so all of the limit is referred to a tangent. And for manifold case, it's always just a Euclidean space. So those are the nice point. So when we follow, those are the regular point, namely nice point. And if it's RK, it's just K regular. Okay. So tangent cone, if it's a It's a Euclidean space, then you refer to some good point. So now, in general, in the non-collapsing case, namely you have rich low bond and a volume lower bond. In this case, so then the limit is always still like a sequence of n-dimensional. In some sense, the limit is also n-dimensional. You have n-dimensional Hausdorff measure on the space, and it's converged in this called measured Glom of Hausdorff convergence. And this regular point, so-called a good point, they have a full measure with respect to this Hausdorff measure. And those points look like topologically is manifold, which is pretty nice in this case. Are pretty nice in this case. And all the cones, it may not be all regular, but it all has to be metric cone, even may not be unique, but they all looks like a metric cone, which is structure-wise. It's nice. So that's an unclapped case. Okay. Now, in general, when the space could be clapped. When the space could be collapsing, then we know the measure collapsing usually that means the volume of the ball is going to zero. Okay, so if you look at the measure directly, the measure will go to zero. But instead, to make sure it's not zero, so we one consider so-called renormalized measure. Namely, take the usual measure of the manifold divided by the volume of the ball. They both go to zero, and the ratio actually does not. Ratio actually does not by volume comparison. So you still have a limited measure, but it is a so-called renormalized limit measure. So any of the renormalized one is referred to a limited measure on the space. And in this case, with respect to this measure, the good point also has four measure. So the regular point has four measure for has four measure for some for some unique k actually so which has a reflection to some dimension in some sense okay on the other hand uh recent example of myself joint with jay impossible measure of the space actually of the regular set could be Of the regular set could be actually zero. So, which means that the limit measure and host of measure are very, very different. Namely, for limit measure, the regular point, right, is full measure. But if we look at the host of dimension and look at that host of measure of that dimension, the regular point actually has zero measure. Okay. So that's a geometric structure. But today we said we would like to focus on the topological side of those liter limited space. Is any questions? Okay, so topological side, as we saw it before, you know, even in non-collapsing case, the X could be quite complicated to have infinite topological, local topology. Topological, local topology in this case. And this is a big contract with Alexander space, which is locally contractible. Okay. So, but they have do have some positive result. It's also first one is joint with myself with Christina Salmani in 2000, showing that any of the Lich-Limless space does have a universal. Nameless space does have a universal cover. And this work with joint with Andrew Mandino, we extend to RCD space. So I think from the conference, we know the little limit space are so-called RCD space. So RCDKM space. So these are extended. But here, the universal cover is just means it's universal. Just means it's universal of all the carving map, the carving property. It's not the usual universal cover we refer to. So usually the universal cover means it has to be a carving which is simply connected. And this is not necessary. We do not assume that. So in order to space as simply connected universal cover, it has to be so-called semi-locally simply connected. Semi-locally simply connected. Namely, at every point you have a neighborhood, and all the loop in there is contractible in a whole manifold. So you can go, the contractor can go out. So that's why it's called a semi. So I might define this more precisely later on. Okay, so maybe it's a So, maybe it's some space does not have universal cover. That's not something we do it, see it every day. So, I thought, give an example here. Namely, if we look at the Hawaii vein, which is the common circles glue together, smaller and smaller, getting smaller and smaller circles glue together. So, then in this case, So, then in this case, it has no universal cover because if you have a universal universe, if any coven space, right, every point has a neighborhood which lifts homomorphically, but there is a arbitrary small loop, so that cannot be happen. You can always unravel this more. Okay, so this does not have the usual universal cover, but people study. Universal cover, but people study like they can generalize a covering space to more general carbon space. And then this makes sense, but that's not. We are just focusing on the usual carving space concept. And another example of this called a graphics twin cone basically is take the Hawaii min, you double it, and you get the suspension of both sides. Then this space. Then this space is has a universal cover, which is itself, but it's not simply connected. Okay, so the loop, which is, you know, any loop, you can always go to the tip and contract it to a smaller one. But when you do it, if I take this by this itself, just one side, yeah, it's contractible. It's a comb definitely. Now, if I double suspension, then if Double suspension, then if I go to the loop alternating from one place to another, and each of these, then in order to get smaller, this is like the sine one over x. You have to going up and down, you know, infinite many times to get smaller and smaller, and that's what cannot make it to be continuous go to zero. So, therefore, there's a non-contractible loop. But any Carving space, it's just Anya Kavian space, it's just itself. So, therefore, so this kind of space does exist, but we can show that this does not occur as literally limited space later on, actually, or even in this theorem with Christina, because we showed that any local ball has also universal cover. So, this cannot happen as literally limit spaces. Basically, so any questions? Okay, so for a while, yeah, we've been trying to can we, you know, improve the result, saying the space actually is a universal cover is simply connected. And so a few years ago, joint with Jiang Pen. With Jai Inpen, we show that if we assume the sequence is non-collapsing, namely the volume has a lower bond, then indeed the space is, we prove directly without using the early result, we prove show that the space is indeed semi-locally simply connected. Therefore, the universal cover is The universal cover will be simply connected. Okay, so that's the result. Then later on, Jia Yinpeng and Ji can one replace the non-collapsing result assumption by you can take the carving, you take the carving of the sequence. Takes the carving of the sequence. Okay, here is okay. This, these are the manifold, right? We have a manifold coming. So, your manifold, you take the ball, the ball you can have, take the universal of the ball and take the unit ball in there. You assume instead the volume of the universal cover of the ball has uniform bond. So, that's a weaker assumption instead of. Instead of the volume on the base, the sequence itself, if you have this, then the same statement is also true. The X is similarly simply connected. Okay, so finally, GKAN1 himself showed that without any assumption, X actually semi-locally simply connected. So namely, from this, From this, you say any literally limited space, you have a simply connected universal cover. Okay, so that's a result. Any questions? Yeah, I have a question. Maybe I misunderstood, but the last theorem is saying that you can remove the That you can remove the non-collapsed or still collapse, right? Yeah, so last CERLIN said, Yeah, you do not need assumed non-collapse exactly. So any general, literally emitted space, X is true. Yes. Right. Okay. So this getting the full result about which limit space exactly. Okay, so now maybe let me go to the idea of the proofs. So why this maybe it's taking so long all this? Let's go back to like in the section of COVID case, how do we do it? You know, we know that's actually locally contractible. So one way to do it. So, one way to do it is for the sectional curvature case, is in that case, you do know that all the tangent columns are metric. Metric columns are contractible, right? Because it's a comb metrical. So, then this is due to Gromov and Pereman in their paper. And Pereman can show that you even can construct. You even can construct a homeomorphism from the tangent column to a neighborhood with the ball. Just like a manifold case, right? It's a tangent column. You expect it's a good approximation of the neighborhood. So you can connect from the tangent column to the neighborhood of the space. So therefore, since the cone is contractible, the neighborhood is contractible. And you do it with so-called, you cannot, there's no expansion map in the There's no exponential map in the smooth manifold. We can just use exponential map to do it. Here, you use the gradient flow of distance function. So now if we try to work on the niche limited space, right, well, at least in the non-collapsing case, we do have, it's true, it's also metric cone. This is due to Chiga coding. But on the other hand, one cannot get a homeomorphism from the tangent column to the space because tangent column is a metric column, so it's contractible. But we thought before there's examples such as that the second BT number is infinite, so which it's, you know, it's not, there's infinite topology. Not there's infinite topology while the tangential cone has no topology, it's contractible, but as a space has infinite, so you cannot connect these two. Okay, so one might think ask, you know, just you do this just in the level of the fundamental group level, because rich curve only controls the fundamental group level, not the beta numbers. But is this Numbers, but is this really no natural choice of connecting the tangent space to the neighborhood? You know, in Alexander space, there's gradient flow of distance function, but in the which there is really, there's no natural connection, it's really hard to connect. So that's kind of does not work well. Another way in the non-collapsing case, in the sectional curvature, there's walk-off by. Culture, there's a walk-off by Grof Peterson, uh, also think about 20 years ago, more than if you assume non-classing and with a sectional covature bond, then actually you can get uniforms. I will be a little bit more later on explain precisely. You can get a local contractability that is uniformly controlled, namely in a ball. In a ball, in every point, you can get a ball such that that ball is contractable in a big ball. So, this is a local. Once you have that, you can pass this property to the limit. If you have every point, you have this kind of control in this case. Okay. So, then maybe you say, okay, in the non-collapse case, can we at The non-collapse case, can we at least instead of contractable everything to a point, you just contract all the fundamentals loop to a point? You get so-called fundamental group level of contract radius. And that looks reasonable, but unfortunately, even that is not true. So, even for each case, even on fundamental group level, there's example by O2 showing that it's not. By or two, showing that it's not true. So, false part and not true. But if you assume the both part, you know, at some point locally, it's true, then you do can pass through the limit. And this, this part, yeah, does not, it's a general property, does not have, need to have curvature assumption. So you need a uniform control at all points. That's the thing to pass to the limit. That's a thing to pass to the limit or locally in a neighborhood of all point. Okay, so maybe this is not clear. Let me specify more clearly what do I mean here. In the Graph Peterson's work, actually, sorry, it's 88, so it's 30 years. Yeah, remember, it's just about when I graduate. Basically, saying if you have sequence of math. Basically, saying if you have a sequence of manifold, any all manifold, if they have a sectional curvature lower bond, volume lower bond, okay, with fixed dimension, then there is some constant epsilon, a constant C, such that any ball, if the radius is less or equal to less than epsilon, then this ball is contractible in a big ball. Contractible in a big ball. So, C is a constant here, it's bigger than one usually. So, in general, you cannot say the ball is contractible itself because the comb is a manifold will satisfy in some sense. If you have a comb, well, smooth out a little bit. But the component, you can have thin and thin. Can have thin and thin, it will satisfy these assumptions. Well, actually, uniform lower one, we cannot make it too thin. Well, just make it this approximation. But then this, if you take a point, then in order to be contractible, you have to go to the tips. So you need to go to a big one. Yeah. But you cannot. Yeah, but you cannot make it contributable by itself, so this condition is necessary. But all okay. Wait. Sorry, it's not letting me go forward strange. Oh, okay. What's happening? Okay. All right. Sorry. Okay. So voting for the O2 construct examples with S3RP2. So RP2 has a non-trivial fundamental group. non-trivial fundamental group has a loops. And this RP2 actually eventually becomes the metric suspension of this one. So the loops RP2, they are at the tip of this, it's getting shorter and shorter. Eventually in the limit, those loops disappear. But in the sequence, so we have arbitrarily short, non-trivial loops. Of course, if Trivial loops, of course, if it's a non-trivial, then you cannot be contractible in any of the space in this case. So, therefore, you know, one expect this Graph-Peterson result in the fundamental group level is true, but actually it's not true. So, that's one of the difficulties in attaching this problem. Any questions? There is a question here. Sorry, just a relevant question for this example. Are there any similar examples but with negative curvature in some sense? In that, like similar to Otsu's? What do you mean? I mean, if you have this is a rich, yeah, positive. This is a rich, yeah, positive. If it's then, it's just this is a lower bond. So if you have a positive low bond, you always have an active low bond. Yeah, but where like the say like R C D plus cat minus one or something like that. Or Ritchie limit bounded below with cat minus one, so that you have both bounds, but they're both negative. If you have R C D and ket locally ket minus one, then it's I thought it's Alexander space, so that cannot be possible. Right, keta and a couple which proved it's Alexander space. Good, yeah. Actually, I think you don't need catamara, just a coach. Just a covet bonded from above, the local sense and RCD, then it's Alexander space. Yeah, so that will not happen. Thanks. Okay, so we have, yeah, that's difficulties. Now, how do we solve this problem to deal with it? So we have to get heads-on, I guess. There's no way to carry those methods directly. So now let's define. So now let's define still this so-called contractability radius. So we put a one here because we only consider the loops, namely just the one-dimensional instead of the whole balls. So take a point X refoliant. If this ball, all the loop in the ball is contractible in this big ball row, and the smallest row possible is so-called one-contractable ladies. And if it's never It is. And if it's never possible, then this row could be infinite. So it's between this row could be infinite. Right. So this is only in fundamental group level in some similar to the graph Peterson's work. So now what is the semi-locally simply connected? This is a little bit awkward. What this means just now in terms of this row just means for any X. Just means for any x, and we can find a t such that this row is finite, right? For any x, you can find a ball, and this ball is contractible in the big space. So if you have, it's a finite, then it's definitely semi-locally simply connected if it's finite. If it's finite, I mean, for the non-compact, maybe even it's infinite, it works. Now, compared to what is locally simply connected, namely without a word semi, locally simply connected means the ball itself, all the loops can contract to the inside of the ball itself. So, namely, that means while the ball could be smaller and smaller, so we can find a sequence. So, we can find a sequence go to zero, such as that the row is just equal to the ti, so without getting bigger. Namely, you have every point, I can find a neighborhood such is that this neighborhood is all the loop inside is able to contract to a point. So, if you have a sequence going to zero satisfy this, then it's locally. Then it's locally simply connected. So here, basically, it's not getting larger. So, rho is equal to Ti. Okay, so in the work with Penn, so that's the first theorem. I list the three theorem. In the first theorem, okay, we assume non-collapsing. Actually, what we really proved is following so-called local. Proved is following so-called local version. Namely, we assume this sequence of the manifold. You only assume the covature bond in a ball with radius two, let's say, and non-collapsing. And we want, you know, it's complete. So I don't want the ball does not intersection boundary if there's boundary, or if it's no boundary, then it's always good. So it's locally compact. So all the assumption is, let's say, on a ball of Is let's say on a ball of radius two, then we can show that this row of the function when t goes to zero, it's almost like t. It's equal to one. So definitely this row xt actually, when t goes to zero, it's equal to zero. And so that's that's like essentially the row looks like t. So maybe you can call it, it's essentially locally simply connected. Locally simply connected. So it's definitely semi-locally simply connected. So if you have these assumptions, then this true is for all the point in a smaller ball, let's say size one, from the same point. So you just need the assumption in a local and you get result. And we get more precise estimate on the function row. Okay. Okay. So that's how we prove this result, and how do we prove it? So the main work is we show that this row actually it goes to zero. Once in the non-collapsing case, we know the tangent column is the metric column. Okay, so once you go to zero, then using this structures, the tangent column and the Tangent and the Solman is uniform cut lemma to combine this together, you can show that the row will be almost look like T actually. So we will mainly work on trying to show this actually equal to zero, which implies semi-locally simply connected. Okay, so the natural choices, those approaches do not work. So we Work, so we divide the point into three types and do each one like head-on in this case. Okay, so first one may be type one as a in some sense as a good point. So this is why you know we this proof only works for rich laminar space, not in general RCD space, because we divide the point. Because we divide the point according to what it looks like in the sequence. So every point in the limit space X, there's a sequence of point convergent to it, right? So look at the behavior of the sequence. If actually, you know, you look at the ball in the sequence of this XI, all this point, this row is at zero, it's equal to. zero it's equal continuous at zero namely they are really uh that means there's a uniform property at zero but this is for all the point q in the neighborhood then this is type one so these are really a good point in some sense it has uniform control on this uh on this one contract wave radius okay so then the type two is this is not The type two is this is not true at the point xi, and that's in also the example that happens this type two. And type three, we don't know the rest of them. If it's not one, two, we just refer to type three. Because in general, there could be still other point left in this case. So maybe emphasize. Maybe emphasize, you know, also you need to justify this is well defined. So, what is the difference between type one and type one is you really need control of this point q, all the point in the neighborhood. Okay. So, not just as a point xi. Okay. And type two point do exist, yeah, from this. So, we have to deal with those all these points. All this point and show that actually the row is all controlled in all the cases. Namely, show this the row actually goes to zero. So this starting the technical work. Okay, so then we do it for each type. We do it for each type. For the type one, we said, yeah, they are really some kind of, in some sense, a good point. Basically, you have uniform control on the one contract radius. So then we can try to pass to the limit. So our proof actually streamlines this Bosaka, which is in the 50s already a lot made more clear. His work is more general. We just assume it's. More general, we just assume it's a land space, and our proof is more direct. So, precise statement we can abstract out as the following. If, you know, we focus, yeah, always we assume locally compact, right? So, in this case, if you have a sequence of balls and all the points in this ball, the row are uniformly controlled. Uniformly controlled, that's like equal cont this is equivalent to equal continuous at zero. Uh, that's another lemma. Namely, the rho is less or equal to some function lambda uniformly, and this lambda is fixed and zero equal to zero. It's a continuous function. So, all of the sequence, this is uniformly controlled. It's less or equal to lambda. Then, basically, we say, oh, it passed through the limit. The limit also. Limit. The limit also, the one contract radius also less or equal to lambda in a smaller ball. Okay, so our assumption is on a ball of radius two, and our conclusion is what radius one half. You need some room in this case. So if it's less or equal to lambda, remember lambda, we assume zero equal to zero. So definitely then when t goes to zero, this row. Then, when t goes to zero, this rho is equal to zero. Okay, so the idea, yeah, basically, if you have uniform control on the sequence for all the points in a neighborhood, then you can pass to the limit. Okay, so that's type one case. And this is abstract, as no assumption on the curvature is needed. As long as I have uniform control, then you can pass through the limit. To the limit. Okay, so that's the type one case, it's good. Any questions? Okay, so to the proof, do you also have a so maybe it is clearly false, but do you have a reverse of this opposition? So if you have something nice at the limit, can you say that? Can you say that definitely you have something nice also on the sequence, maybe with a worse lambda or completely obvious? Yeah, if it's just at one point, then that's not possible, just as also the example. And that in the limit, it's actually, you know, contractible. But yeah, you could have the sequence non-trivial loop getting smaller and smaller in the limit. You don't see. And smaller in the limit, you don't see it, right? Right, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right, right, yeah. Thank you, yeah, right, yeah, that's a problem, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's exactly some problem. Okay, so that's a actually, yes, a type 2 case. Namely, you have the sequence non-trivial loop. The sequence non-trivial loop, smaller and smaller loops, actually. So that means I can take a cover to unravel those loops. Okay, so this is a cover of the ball. Well, we can just take the because the sequence in the manifold is nice. I can take the universal cover of the ball. And there's a fundamental local fundamental of gamma i, which in this case. Gamma i, which in this case is not trivial because there are small loops, non-trivial loops here. So the gamma i is not trivial in this case. So this convergent to the balls, then there is equivalent gram of host of convergent. This is introduced, I think, by Fokaya first. Then Fokaya Yamakuchi studied a lot. Namely, they have the lot namely they have this diagram commutative diagram you have takes a limit here as a u converged to y and this group and this h i is okay so gamma i is a whole fundamental group then there is a h i is the smaller ones it's a very smaller ones so you can keep track the group also can contract then the limit in the bottom is just a y In the bottom, it's just a y quotient out g because all the sequence, the ball here b and the universal cover quotient out gamma i is this, then in sometimes that's passed to the limit. Limit is also the here, the g, the group usually is not discrete anymore. So it's just an isometry group action. Unlike here, the gamma i are discrete. Yeah, right, okay. So this, but now, okay. Uh, but now, okay, so this setup is general, you can do it, you know, you don't need non-collapsing. But under the non-collapsing assumption, then you can control all the number of the smaller element. This is by Anderson. Go back to 91. The number of smaller loops cannot be too many. It's uniformly bounded by n. Okay. So that implies. So that implies because it's uniformly controlled, then this group H all fixes the point Y. Okay, it does not move, all the H does not move in this case. So that's where we used a non-collapsing property. Okay. So now we have this picture basic. Sorry. Now you have this, when you unravel in that case, basically we clean in that case, when you unravel it, then in a smaller ball, when you go to the cover, the volume is going to be at least doubled, getting bigger. Because here, you know, because all the small, there's small loops in here. So all when this small loop. So, all when these small loops unravel in here, they're going to unravel because they are very small. So, it's like this one ball becomes two balls. So, a covet space is just adding all this up together. So, therefore, you know, the volume is continuous, we can pass to that to the limit. So, the local volume in here is at least twice of the local volume in here. We can. In here, we can, because non-collapsing, we can just look at all measured by host of measure dimension n. Okay, so that's the key is the volume getting bigger. If this happened in the type 2 case, you take the limit and then small ball, the volume to the cover in the limit, it's at least doubled. Okay, so that's two here. Okay, now one. Okay, now once we have that, then you can. So then, what if you just assume in the bottom already, the volume are already big? So then if I assume the volume here, well, this is a host of big, okay, by, you know, all then which has a lower bond. So the volume cannot be too big. It has to be less or equal to the model space. So now if I So now, if I this volume is already big than half of this, then this cannot happen because that means on level you're going to be the volume is bigger than the model space. So therefore, if, and this is the model space, if I assume the volume is already big than half of the model space, then you cannot unravel. So it must be already type one. That cannot be happen. So once we have this picture, So, once we have this picture, now we can, you know, as a byproduct, you say whenever actually, if the volume is bigger than half of the model, in this case, so this omega is bigger than the half of the model, then actually it is contractible. All the loops are contractible in a big one. So, that's like a Graph-Peterson result in the fundamental group level. Fundamental group level corresponding, but the assumption is you need the volume not just non-collapsing, but you need the volume relatively big and big than half of the model in that case. So that's a local version of the result as the proof from this product. And one can formulate this in the global version in the non-compact case. In the non-compact case, this is like a quantitative version of okay, Peter Lee and Anderson. They showed that if you have rich non-active and Euclidean volume growth, then the fundamental group is always, well, if you have rich non-active and Euclidean volume growth, and with this L, you know, the rate is big than again, half of the model, then they can show. The model, then they can show that the manifold is simply connected. Now we can have more precise quantitative motion, saying then in this case, all the loop in the ball actually must be contractible in a bigger ball with a uniform control on the C. So this C only depends on N and L. So not only is a manifold simply connected, but how far Simply connected, but how far go out it has a uniform control. Namely, all these loops can only it will be already contractible by going certain amount out. So that's exactly similar to here. It's just as a non-compact emotion, which is non-active in this case. Any questions, comments? So basically, yeah, in the fundamental Basically, yeah, in the fundamental group level, for the rich curvature case, if the volume is bigger than half the model, then it's like in the sectional curvature case, at least for fundamental group. Okay, well, in general, we cannot assume the volume is bigger than half, right? So in general, but we assume non-collapsing. So then, this volume ratio to this in our assumption, okay, so this is always. Okay, so this is always less or equal to one, right? So Bollinger, it's always less or equal to model. But under our assumption, this is also positive. It's greater than zero uniformly. Okay. So it's some number between zero and one, less or equal to one. So then we, in this case, then we can do induction on this quantity. Yeah, this is always between zero and one. Between 0 and 1. At the regular point, it is equal to 1. Yeah, okay. So those are the nice point. We know already there are manifold points, so we don't have to worry. So now basically we can start as an induction on this number. Namely, if this number is bigger than half, we said then it's already done. It has to be type one, you know. Type one, you know, this, all the point in there, because this function is continuous. If it's big than half, then in a neighborhood, it's going to be big than half. So then all the points there, you know, cannot unravel. So it has to be already contractible from the previous result. We are already good. Okay, so now if instead not big than half, but it's big than one fourth. Have, but it's big than one-fourth. The next level. If it's big than one-fourth, okay, so you look at the point. If it's a type one, then type one, we don't need any assumption. So they are good. So that's the then, okay, it could be going to type two. If it's type two, then we look at the cover. Then in the cover, the volume will be doubled at least. So it will be big than half. Than half and a big than half, then you can apply to this one, only a one, and still it's good. Okay. Well, but but when you go to the next level, it's the thing is if it's not type two, namely, what if it's a type three? If it's a type three, okay, so that's. Type 3, okay, so that's in the original work. That's a very difficult technical part, basically. And we have to show because there's a lot, not much we can use. In the type 1, type 2, we can have lots of assumptions. This type 3, it's just a reference and not much. But we're able to prove is that, so I want if what type 1 is always good in basically this has no curvature. Say if it's also type 2 point. It's all the type two point, it's good. Then, types we can also control the type three point by going the contractable between the sequence and the limit going back and forwards, and we can also control it. Okay. So now in this case, so you basically you have two, it's already good. Then you apply this lemma, and if it's type three, it's still good. Then you go to next level, one over eighth, but this this w omega is. This W omega is a finite number. So after some finite steps, you end. Okay, so, but what want to indicate actually now, fortunately, this technical step or even this type two, you don't have to deal with. Later on, work is that basically everything in some sense can be done like in type one, and that's so G comes. And so, Ji Khan's work. So, the last theorem that's I put in serial C. So, he formulates the following key lemma. Basically, let me see. He kind of obtained a weak one, but which is enough to control the contractible radius. So, basically, you don't need to divide it for every point. For every point, you can have a neighborhood. Okay, so this is the sequence, and this is x, x here. Every point we can have a neighborhood. So any loop in the neighborhood here or does not have start from this point. So we want to make these tooth be smaller, right? Now you can find, okay, so this is gamma, and you have x, and this is ni. And this is ni, you have the gamma i. This loop, I think. Sorry, I didn't draw really well. This is gamma. Gamma i is conversion to gamma. So what he can seek is you can find a loop which is much smaller, gamma i prime, and the lens is much smaller, and this actually. And this actually, these two loops are homotopy to each other in a controlled way, in a ball which does not have to go too out. Okay, so two things are different from earlier. First, the loops he control here is only from loops coming from the X. Okay, so from the X, you go back and another. And another thing is that basically in the sequence, this gamma i actually he does not control contract to all the way to a point like we did before, only make it too small. Actually, under Gromov host of convergence, this is enough because you cannot really tell from a point and assign something epsilon i. So, and this epsilon i go to zero, so then actually in the end, So, then actually, in the end, that's enough in this case. So, how he controls this? So, he controls less, but that's good enough to get in the control for the X already, because that's all we interest in. It's all the non-trivial loops here, you go to here, and you're able to homotopy to a much smaller loops, and then that able to control the home topic. Okay, so. Okay, so how he obtained this, the key is don't know when annotate it looks like. Okay, the key to obtain that is in this work with Penn, I think, in the proof of the B, they obtained so-called slice theorem for pseudo-group action because the group is just from the fundamental. Group, it's just from the fundamental group of the ball, which is not really. So, the key is, I think, maybe. So, this pseudo-group, you extend to a Lie group, a big one. And for Lie group, there is a slide theorem. So, basically, you can have a slide such that these slides, you can just work on the slides. This is a G-invariant and the G invariant and the projection is you can just the neighborhood of the X in the bottom is just this slice quotient out of the G. So the group action. So you can work on the slice. So therefore, you're able to obtain the result, the key lemma I had in earlier. Okay, so that's also once you have this result, yeah, that's also. Yeah, that's also the other works we have carryover. So basically, it can just reduce the type one case. Okay, maybe I just end with some quick question is, so in general, so here he showed this, it's a semi-locally simply connected, but did not get information in general about what the row look like. So is it true in general that the row is almost like T? So in the Almost like t. So, in the non-collapsing case, this is true, but still don't know in the general case. Then you can ask, you know, is the tangential cone of Lichelinum space is always simply connected? It sounds like, but it's, as I said, it's very hard to actually control between the tangent cone and the neighborhood. It's not so easy to connect. Lots of things could. To connect, lots of things could go wrong, and also, can win work is this general is true for R C D space, you know, for R C D space, I said with Mandino, we know the universal cover exists, but is it simply connected? And this work still does not apply because we use a sequence a lot. Yeah. Okay, I think I'll end the talk here. Thanks. Thank you very much for your talk. Are there any questions? Well, I have a question. Your first question about the limit being equal to one, like what could that imply, or why, or are you expecting that? Yeah, if it's let's say equal to one, that will be the space. equal to that will be the space it's not just a semi-locally simply connected it will be look like a locally simply connected yeah it will be i thought maybe that's possible still true yeah it's not it will it's a kind of related to the second one actually if it's really locally simply connected you know the the loop you don't have to go Know the loop, you don't have to go very far away to get contractable. Yeah, can I ask a question? Thanks all for this very beautiful talk and congratulations for the great results. So is there, so with the subsequent works of Pan and pan and um and uh say uh is the case of the say is the non-collapse is the non-collapse case uh much easier to handle so you mentioned uh say uh subsequent lemmas and theorems um with with the subsequent machinery uh is the non-collapsed situation much easier to handle rather than the collapsed in the arc Than the collapsed in the yard papers, or basically doesn't simplify much? The whole thing actually simplified in the collapsing case, the whole proof simplified. So in that case, non-collapsing does not help, only help to get this equal to one. Maybe I jump in here and say a few words. Say a few words. So, in the Qi Kong-wan's work that Guofang mentioned, any limit space is semi-locally, simply connected. It also used this idea that you take local balls, then you take local covers, then you and then a technique is one requires slicing really there. Now, if you have the non-collapsing condition, Condition, the slides is much easier because it really is just the whole group fixed the base point. So in that case, it's easier in that sense. I think. Okay, thank you. And then just take comments, say, in the very beginning, you were mentioning that you knew before that the example, say the cone over the double OER ring. Or the double OR ring, you knew that it couldn't be reach limit. And we also know that it cannot be R C D because it has wild branching at where the two things join, there is a wild branching. And this cannot happen in R C D. So just to say that this counter example, we know that it cannot be R C D, but of course that's quite far from the proof that R C D. Yeah, right. Okay, so I think we still, I think, hopefully it's true, right? Hopefully it's true, yeah, but it's right, yeah, yeah, yeah. Many thanks for both to Wufang and Ejanji for the comments. Okay.
