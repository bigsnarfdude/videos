All right. Well, thank you. Thank you for the invitation. Yeah, I want to talk about, okay, see now I've sort of let's make an invariant. Okay, yeah, so I want to talk about Rasmussen's S invariant, and let me just sort of start with a general overview of how. Overview of how I think about building or constructing a yes invariant over the rationals or really over any field that is not characteristic to. So as you'll see in Lucas's terminology, I am on the dark side here because I am going to do it with filtrations. So let's see. Let's just, you know. Let's just, you know, review the situation in S3. Let me give myself enough space here. Okay, so whoops, S3 is not contained in a link. Okay, if I have two links contained in S3 and a co-board is in between them, what sort of things do I Them, what sort of things do I want to be able to build? Well, so let me write links here. From links, as I think many of us are aware. So the process is: I have to have a link diagram. So let me write link diagram. Okay, and then I just have to do some sort of combinatorial things. Okay, and so if I understand my link diagram, I'm able to build maybe a graded chain complex, the Kavanaugh complex. Okay, similarly down here. Down here. Okay, and the theory should work out that my cobordism gives me a graded chain map. Okay. Okay, so this is the notation from any Kavanov complex. Okay, and then Okay, and then the next step, if I want an S invariant, is to deform by sort of adding a filtered term. Let me use filtered chain complex, okay, which I'll call L C for the Lee complex. Okay, so. Okay, so I want to be able to make myself a filtered complex instead. Okay, and now the theory should work out that a cobordism gives me a filtered map. All right. So from there, I take There, I take homology. Okay, upon taking homology of these complexes, I get we homology. Okay, and you know, one of the important One of the important things for how I think about the S invariant is that the Lie homology really should just be generated by, let me write, ORIs for orientations of the link, copies of the ground field. Okay. All right, and we still have a map. A cobordism still gives us a map here. All right, and then at the end of the day, at the end of the day, we ask for filtration levels of specific elements to be able to define. To be able to define an S invariant for the link. Okay, so now we're in the integers. Okay, but in fact, filtration levels of what elements? Well, it depends on the orientation. So really, the S invariant is an invariant of oriented links. Okay. Okay, so in some sense, well, this is a way to think about the S invariant. All right, and okay, so this is just some construction. What good is it, of course? So let me try to write it here. So I'd like to keep this up for a couple moments. So the theorem. So, the theorem is that if your surface is what I'll call L1 connected, in other words, it looks like this. So, here's L1 and here's L2. L1 connected just means your surface has to, every component of your surface. Every component of your surface needs to touch L1, but maybe not L2. Okay. If your surface is L1 connected, and really this is just a statement of saying that so maybe an orientation O1 on L1 determines an orientation on the second link. Orientation on the second link. Okay, that's kind of the purpose of an assumption like this. Then the difference in the S invariance is bounded by the Euler characteristics. So, of course, this is sort. Euler characteristics. So, of course, this is sort of Rasmussen's original result for knots. Belyakov early talked about it for links. So this is sort of, so in other words, differences in S invariance tell you something about topology. That's sort of the whole game. Okay. And I'm pretty sure this is the correct direction. Do I have a sign wrong? Do I have the sign wrong? I mean, chi is negative, right? So if we switch, yeah, this is just chi, and so I'm going to rewrite it as in terms of the genus bound. Maybe I'll just write it here in particular. The S invariant of your link. Gives you bounds on the B4 slice genus. Okay, where absolute value value just means the number of components in the link. Okay. And I'll just, you know. I'll just, you know, say out loud quickly: this was the sort of setup Erasmus and used to reprove Milner's conjecture on the sliced genus of Taurus knots. Okay, so what we would like to do, I mean, somehow the goal of the talk is to tell you about redoing all three of these boards in some other scenarios. Okay, so. Scenarios. Okay, so maybe I'll say some possible generalizations. Okay, so there's sort of a couple of things you could ask for. Maybe, you know, the main one, or the first one that I think would come to mind, would be replace. Replace S3 with some other three manifold. So replace. This is what I mean when I say Rasmussen's S invariant in other three manifolds. Just somehow doing that entire system of constructions with S3 being something else. And And but of course, you know, if you do that, you want to get down to statements like this. Okay. And so, you know, of course, you'd very much like this in, okay. So, I mean, this is, that picture is M3, or sorry, S3 cross I. Maybe I'll say that here. S3 cross I. So this picture then becomes M3 cross I. And then you would like similar input. Then you would like similar in particulars, right? So maybe I'll just say, right, and if your new three-manifold is the boundary of some other four-manifold, okay, you would like to investigate a sort of W-slice genus. You slice genus with your newest invariant, if possible. Okay. All right. So I think that's sort of, you know, a version of generalizing this that might occur to you sort of right away. Another version, maybe you sort of don't want to do all of this. All of this. Maybe it's good enough just to try and generalize this part. Okay, so maybe it's interesting enough just to replace B4, which you can think of as punctured four sphere. So punct for punctured, okay, with other punctured four manifolds, so maybe. Folds, so maybe like this. Okay, and could you investigate, say, the genus still using sort of this original S. Okay. Wouldn't it be nice? Wouldn't it be nice? Okay. All right. So maybe I'll just say out loud: my notation is going to be little s on its own always means sort of Rasmussen's original S invariant in the three sphere. Okay, and once I start changing three manifolds, I'll add some notation to my little s's. Okay, so this is sort of the overview. The overview and okay, I promise this is the last time I use a green board rather than reuse the black. Oh, yeah, let's oh, we're okay, okay. So let me now summarize some results. Everyone, okay. Uh results. So, the first theorem: this was joint work with Ciprian, Marco, Tutrit, and myself. And myself. Okay, the first theme from a few years ago I'd like to share with everybody is: yes, you can do all those things, including the thing I just erased, for, so maybe I'll say can be done for okay, there's an assumption you need null. Assumption: You need null homologous links in connect sums of S1 cross S2. Okay, that's your new three-manifold in that case. Okay, and I want to make sure. And I want to make sure I also say: so, when I say all this can be done, I don't mean that you have like some sort of brand new construction. It is a generalization in the sense that it recovers this. So recovers, recovering the usual we homology and S invariant. Invariant if the link L is what we call local. In other words, L was actually contained in a three ball in your connect sum of S1 cross S2s. Okay, so this is the sense in which I would consider it truly a general. In which I would consider it truly a generalization of this precise setup. Okay. The total, the total. And so it's necessarily an oriented link. Yes. Yes. Okay. So maybe let me say a few. So I'm sorry. The question was: do I require each component to be null homologous or am I? Or am I saying sort of the link as a whole is null homologous? And the answer is the link as a whole is null homologous, which in particular means I'm saying that there was an orientation on the link. So let me say a couple words about that. The orientation and the null homologous bit really only starts to matter over here. Really only starts to matter where I'm actually using an orientation. Okay? In general, I can. I can do all of this part as long as the link is maybe too divisible in homology. Basically, as long as in the handle, let me just do a single S1 cross S2, in the handle, you have evenly many strands sort of passing through geometrically in the handle. Okay, but once you put an orientation on your link and you ask for things like this, then I really need an all-homologous. Male homologous. Okay. I said that would be the last time I so great. So that's, oh, okay. That's part of an answer to the first question. Oh, but I also said investigating genus in sort of other four manifolds. So what does S1 cross S2 bound? Well, the simplest thing. The simplest thing would be just products of falls. I'm sorry, I may remove this. This is products of wells. So let me then get a little bit of a message. Then get okay. So let me write S1 cross S2 really does mean here like any number of connect sums of it that you want. Okay. If you have a link in a bunch of S1 cross S2s, the S invariant gives you a bound for twice the genus in, so one. So 1. So B2 cross S2. Okay. And this really means, you know, if this is many connect sums, this is some like bunch of boundary connect sums or something. Okay. And it's the same thing that has been erased. Okay, but we also have, well, let me just write it. It's sort of funny. It also bounds negative the S invariant of the mirror, which itself bounds the genus in sort of oops, yeah, yeah. B one cross S three. One cross S3. Sorry, did I write that backwards? S1 cross B3. It's like, this doesn't make sense. S1 cross B3. Sorry about that. And also these guys are. These guys are less than each other. Okay, and let me make a comment. So, I did not make a comment in the original. Okay, so let me just say out loud, the original S invariant giving you genus bounds in B4 is really a statement that I know how to compute the S invariant of the unnaught, right? A surface in B4. A surface in B4 gives me a cobordism to the unknown. But I need to know the S invariant of the unknown for that to be of any help. Okay, here, the links that I need to know, maybe a color to try and so this part, this top line, needs, is that a different color? And this bottom line needs. Okay, so let me say what those things are. Okay, so first off, the bottom line needs, oh goodness, I said that I would do this, so let me do it. These are the S1 cross S2S invariants. Okay, so the bottom line needs the S1 cross S2 invariant of the unknown in the sense that you think of the unknot just in a ball in S1 cross S2 bounding a disk. Okay, whereas this guy, if you're really thinking of a surface in V2 cross S2, what you get is What you get is a cobordism in S1 cross S2 cross I to this various links of this form. FPP is so here's my zero surgery and S1 cross S2. And let me do this to denote like or to illustrate closure rather than doing it for all the strands. And the point is, this is. strands and the point is this is uh this is f p comma p and the p comma p means you know i mean it's the null homologous one p going upward and p going downward okay um all right so uh this is sort of This is sort of a summary of one of our generalizations. Let me sorry, what time do I have until 9.30? So it's like 10.30 or something. Let me maybe just say out loud. We also get relationships between our Relationships between our S invariant and like the self-linking number and the standard contact structure of S1 cross S2. So we can sort of reprove a slice Bennikin inequality if you're into sort of contact topology for S1 cross S2 as well. But maybe I don't want to sort of dwell on this. Instead, let me know that's a bad idea. That's a pretty. That's a bad idea. Let's put it here. Theorem, same people. Here's okay, so let me do that for the same people since I already accidentally erased it. Okay, so what I just described was a version of the first question. Okay, now I'm going to. First question. Okay, now I want to describe, you know, give a summary of a result related to the second question. And I've done it in this order because, in fact, the theorem I'm about to give about the second question actually was related to what I've just discussed for the first question. Okay, so here's the game. For You think of your link as being in the three-sphere, which you think of as the boundary of, let's see, connect sums of, if you prefer, CP2 bar punctured. Okay. Okay, so I mean, I really mean one puncture, not a bunch of connects, you know, punctured things connected. Bunch of connects, you know, puncture things connected. Okay, I have one puncture that my link is sitting in or in the boundary of, I suppose. And I have a surface with okay, so what would I well, of course, I'm always talking about surfaces bounded by my link. Okay. Link. Okay. And okay, so much like the other theorem that I just wrote, we can really only do this for sort of null homologous things. Okay, so in particular, I really need my surface to be zero and h2 of the four-manifold rel the boundary. Okay, w is this. I mean. Let me that is not visible at all. Okay, well, W is the punctured CP2 bar. Okay, for such a surface, I can say that my S invariant, now this is S invariant in S3, right? I really have a link in S3. My S invariant is less than or equal to one minus. That's less than or equal to one minus the Euler characteristic. And this is a sort of a junction inequality. Okay, so maybe let me just say out loud rather than writing it out, this is sort of another thing that sort of gives a similar. Gives a similarity between Rasmussen's S invariant and the Tau invariant coming from Hagard Fleur. TAL, of course, works a little better in the sense that, well, it really works sort of for any four manifold with B1 and maybe, I think B2 plus have to be zero. Okay, maybe somebody knows quickly, but and in particular. And in particular, tau does not really have this null homologous requirement. But of course, the homology class of your surface actually affects the inequality for tau. But for us, we're declaring our homology class zero. So this is our adjunction inequality. And so I don't really plan on coming back to anything about this one. So let me just give a remark about the proof now. Okay, so I sort of draw sort of a handle decomposition for my punctured ski. Let me just do a single sk. For my punctured CP, let me just do a single CP2 bar. Okay, so I think of my CP2 bar punctured. Okay, there's sort of a two handle. There's a four handle. Okay, I punctured out sort of the zero handle, you might say. All right, and my link is down here in the boundary. I don't know which of these colors is going to be best. Is that okay? Is that okay? Okay, there's my link and my surface. I have a bad feeling about blue, but did that accomplish anything? Maybe not. Let me just draw it in white. Sigma can, of course, be made just to, you know, not touch. Just to not touch the four handle, but here's two handle. There's my surface bounded by the link. And then, so I want to sort of get myself some sort of cobordism in S3 cross I, right? So I take away the four handle. I remove the four handle and sort of the co-chores of the two handles or two handle. Okay, so here's sort of a diagram. Here's sort of a diagram of I've sort of removed co-core, and now the thing about my surface is I can't sort of generically miss this, right? So my surface may intersect this in some way. So my cobordism is really a cobordism between my link L and you know some other Other link J indicating sort of this intersection. Okay, and what is that link J for CP2 bar? Okay, well, I mean, it depends sort of how often you're sort of going. So J sub P is full twist on two P strands, one full twist. Okay, so that's a notation for full twist. Okay, one full twist. Okay, one full twist on two P strands where, I mean, my surface was assumed null homologous. So I have this sort of P upward, P downward thing going again. Okay, and then it's closed like this. This is an S3. Okay, this is not FPP, which was in S1 cross S2. Okay, this is, but it seems like a related link in S3. And here's sort of the The uh so maybe I'll write. So we compare the S invariant of our link with S of this very specific oriented link in the three sphere. Okay, and then you know you worry, you worry because P can get arbitrarily large. Okay, that's about one ellipsis worth of worrying, and then Ellipsis worth of worrying. And then you learn that. Wait a moment. Based on the construction, which I have not said a word about yet, okay, but I will. Okay, based on the construction, the S invariant of this thing is, it needs to be the same thing as the S1 cross S2 invariant for that FPP. Okay, which you've already calculated if you were doing the previous theorem. Okay, so maybe I'll just like put like this is sort of supposed to feel vaguely surprising, okay, given that I haven't told you the construction yet. All right, so okay, that's what I wanted to say about this. Sorry, I've been just sort of talking at everyone. Is there any questions? Talking at everyone. Is there any questions? I've sort of which direction of twist is the oh goodness. The question is, which direction of twist is the full twist? I mean, okay, so I believe it's positive or like right-handed. I don't remember for certain. Let's see. I'm pretty certain, yes, we wanted sort of right-handed full twists. Okay, so somehow very negative, right? Because I have oppositely oriented strands. What are the values of this? Oh, yeah, sorry. I can tell you that. The question is: what are the values? And they're all 1 minus 2p. Okay, and so, yeah, right. So, this is sort of a sketch of the proof, but really, the proof really relies on the construction of how you would have ever done this. And I will say some words about that in a minute. Okay, but I wanted to sort of summarize all the results first. And this is the majority of what I wanted to say in S1 cross S2. Maybe, maybe I'll. Let me erase. Maybe in particular, I'll give a quick aside. This is this was sort of a corollary of this result is that if, okay, so this is the corollary, this is like the bad news corollary that. Larry, that um the Raswisson's S invariant. Uh, well, let me write it. Um, if the four-manifold, okay, um, is if you have a luck twist of a four-ball, okay, um, let me not sort of define it, let me just sort of mention that the point of thinking about a bluck twist is that. Of thinking about a glup twist is that this is known to be homeomorphic to the floor ball, but maybe not diffeomorphic. Right, so this would be a potential counterexample to smooth Poincaré conjecture. Okay, so if you take a gluck twist of the four ball and you take a look at the ball, Four ball, and you take a link L in here sort of strongly sliced, like somehow the The surface is not somehow interchanging these things, the surface is sort of disjoint. Then the S invariant in S3, maybe I'll just say satisfies same bound that it would. It would or strongly slice in four ball. Really, I'm just trying to say that a corollary of this result, this sort of adjunction inequality, and this computation, is that you cannot use Rasmussen's invariant to detect exotic structure on a glut twist via sort of slice. Via sort of slice genus. Okay, which was sort of one of, you know, one potential hope for what the S and variant might be able to do for you. And yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Sorry. How is this related to what I just said? The point? Yes. So. Yes, so this uses the fact, let me say, just put in parentheses. An important fact about a Gluck twist is that as soon as you connect some with a CP2 bar, you're in the same as CP2 bar. Okay, so you know, it's somehow Somehow it's very close to CP2 bar, and so we can just sort of attach a CP2 bar onto it and then run the machine that we have. Okay, this also shows that any sort of like so tau also is not helpful. Anything that sort of satisfies a sort of adjunction inequality for CP2 bar is going to sort of not help you decide things of this sort. Okay. Okay, so this was everything I wanted to say about, or at least the summary of the results in S1 cross S2. Let me change the three manifold again because I said other three manifolds. Okay, so uh here's Here's maybe I'll mention this is sort of in progress with Chiprian. All right, and so I've long since erased the giant sort of diagram of everything that I think of doing to get an S invariant, okay? But But the big diagram I'm just going to write can be done again. So maybe the quick reminder, I can think of a link diagram, first of all, and from there build a Kavanov complex. From there, deform it. From there, take homology, see that my homology is based on oriented resolutions. Okay. And from there, build an S invariant and pay attention to circumstances. And pay attention to surfaces correctly. That's what I mean by can be done, I guess, for links in RP3. Okay, and again, since I wrote it last time, I'll write it kind of in shorthand again. And it's a generalization in the fact that I recover the usual. The usual sort of Lie homology and S invariance for or if L is local. So if L is just in a three ball and RP3, I still get my original constructions. All right, so in the case of RP3, we don't yet have quite so many sort of fancy follow-ups, but let me at least say. Let me at least say the following. Well, okay, I should write sort of the genus statement. Okay, so we haven't really thought carefully about links. Let me just write some statements about some knots. Okay, so first off, Or I'm not in RP3, okay? Um, let me say, so the projective genus of the knot, okay, G sub P, let me say, okay, what do I mean by this? Well, I mean the minimum genus. So, I mean, the minimum genus of a cobordism, right? Rather than saying a surface or whatever, I'm going to think of a cobordism to various types of unknots. Minimum genus of a cobordism in RPV cross I from. Cross I from K to okay, and they're sort of cases because my cobordism can't really change the homology class of my not K. And I have two homology classes in RP3. Okay, so if K, so let me just say U0, which is sort of the unnot bounded by a disk. So I'll draw it this way. Here's sort of. Here's sort of my RP3, I guess, okay? And my unnaught really is sort of trivial. Okay, this is where I'm going to go, asks my cobordism to go if K was null homologous in RP3. Right. Right. All right. And if K is sort of homologically essential or is sort of the generator of H1RP3, that's Z2. Okay, if I'm the generator, then I need to ask to reach sort of this unnaught, maybe the projective unnaught, if you prefer. Okay, so that's it. All right, so these this is sort of my definition, if you will, of projective genus, okay. And then once you have that, then the S invariant does more or less what you want, it bounds this sort of genus. It bounds this sort of genus. Then, so let me write sp for projective s invariant rather than writing RP3 over and over. Okay, sp of a knot sort of bounds. So it's the same bound. I'm just I'm just as usual, so to speak. All right. Great. So yes, we have sort of this construction in RP3. And let me point out, you know. So I tried to like indicate some sort of follow-ups in the S1 cross S2 case here. Let me sort of point out that. Well, okay, so you know, in this case, that your knot was sort of homologically essential. Okay, this is precisely the case that the lift in S3, okay, I mean, RP3 is you know, S3 mod the intipidal action. So upstairs, this knot. So upstairs, this knot lifts to, in particular, a knot, not a link, okay, what we sort of call a freely to periodic knot. Okay, that is to say, sort of, you know, it's preserved by this antibodal map in a free manner. Okay, and it's a knot. And so, A knot, and so in this case, what I'm calling the projective genus, or really twice the projective genus, really is just some sort of equivariant genus of this guy upstairs, right? So let me write that as twice the projective genus, okay, is actually just the four-ball genus, but so. So SE here stands for standardly equivariant, and I'll write down what I mean in a moment, but it's, I think, what you imagine. So the standardly equivariant genus of the lift upstairs is the, you know, minimum genus of your guy in B4 such that the boundary. That the boundary is k-twiddle, but your surface has to be preserved by the antipodal map. All right, so let me kind of tell you one last thing here. Tell you one last thing here. So you have something like this. Okay, what you sort of realize is that you actually have two different bounds for this now. Okay, so okay, so the projective genus is a bound for this, sort of this equivariant genus upstairs. This is all in this case that K downstairs. That K downstairs was homologically essential. Okay, the projective guy downstairs, the S invariant downstairs bounds this genus, but you also know that, you know, Rasmussen's original invariant bounds over two, okay, bounds the four-ball, just regular four-ball genus, okay, which of course. Four-ball genus, okay, which of course is a bound for the equivariant or ball genus. Okay, so, you know, in some sense, we have two bounds, but do we really have two bounds? You know, is one better than the other? Are they actually just the same? Okay, and so what I want to say is that. And so, what I want to say is that we have some examples where these two things are not the same. Okay, and really in both directions. Okay, and really in both directions. You know, we have a case where one of them is larger than the other, and vice versa. Okay, unfortunately, we do not have a case where being larger actually gives you a better bound. So in particular, we sort of have this case. Okay, so maybe I'll just say like no example yet, unless Chippyon's been running the computer while I've been gone. No example yet where No example yet where our new bound is better. Okay, and if you're wondering how can that be if I'm saying they're different, well, the issue is, you know, if this is equal to one, that's just as good as two for the equivariant genus, which has to be even. Okay, so really, I'm basically telling you that our example is this is one and this is two in one of our examples. Okay, and Okay, and but we do have some sort of application from these examples. So it's not just that the invariant is different. We can say something topological. And so the corollary of having such examples is that let me say there exist really two periodic Two periodic knots which are concordant. So, this is in the three-sphere now, right? So, upstairs, I can find two periodic knots that are concordant, but not, let me abbreviate standardly equivalent. Abbreviate standardly equivariantly important. Okay, and this is essentially this issue that, well, you can arrange it so that you get sort of the same S and variance upstairs. And in fact, you are concordant upstairs, but your projective S invariance downstairs are different. I would just say they cannot be sort of concordant downstairs. Okay, so. I remember thinking that that clock is not correct. So I maybe this is a good place to stop. Maybe this is a good place to stop. Thanks, guys. Great. Do we have any questions for Mike? Thanks very much. Great talk. Thank you. So if you have this like balanced link that goes to Link that goes 2p times goes p times one direction minus p times the other. Yeah, so if you allowed it to be sort of unbalanced, then you'd be intersecting that CP1 or two handle, you know, certain number of times, giving you a telling you that the surface represents some homology, absolutely, yes. So, how close do you get to reproving the TOM conjecture, if you like, allow that? I don't think. Okay, well, first, let me just say the following. In our setup, what we want, you know, what you would want, if you're going to use the S invariant to sort of do this, you want a calculation for those guys, right? And we sort of have a conjecture on what all these S invariants should be for the various levels of imbalance, I guess. Various levels of imbalance, I guess. But we don't have a proof in those cases. The sort of the balanced case really uses like some special techniques very specific to the balanced case. But if you had that, I'm not sure. I'm not sure of the conjecture you're referring to, I'm afraid. Oh, it's just like, so if you've got a surface in CP2 that represents class N and um Class N in second homology, then the minimal genus is realized by the complex surface that represents that class. So it's like the thing that Kronheim and Robko originally proved using gauge theory. So you'd basically be looking in your setup, you'd be looking for cobordisms from the unknot to this unbalanced thing, and then trying to see what the minimal genus is. Yeah, no. Um, certainly, it sounds like uh, if we could you know prove these conjectures on what that S invariant, you know, at the imbalance thing is, this would at least give a bound. You know, one way. Can I answer this? Oh, yeah, great. It's not actually provable this way. Like, you could, I mean, you could also try to do it with tau in the same way. And for tau, you are, you know, the answer. But I mean, you know, you know the. But I mean, you know the invariance of the links, but the thumb conjecture cannot be proved this way. Somehow it's about CP2 as an with the positive orientation, and the methods there are different from this kind of methods, which are more about CP2 bar. So with these methods, you can prove bounce like in CP2 bar for surfaces with boundary, but when the surface has boundary, the unnaut, you don't get anything. Really, are not, you don't get anything, I don't think. Well, somehow it can, at least, I don't think you can prove things about closed surfaces in CP2 this way. Right, okay. Thank you, Chiprian. Yeah, okay, so it really was about CP2 as opposed to CP2 bar. Yeah, then I'm also have no idea how you'd manage. Other questions? Do you have any interesting examples of knots in these three manifolds where this gives new lower bounds for the slice genes? So let's see. I mean, so somehow here, if you sort of mean, you know, somehow here, the answer is in some sense no. Answer is in some sense no. And this is essentially this issue that, you know, comparing it to upstairs, you wouldn't have sort of seen anything different than what Rasmussen's original S invariant would have given you. In S1 cross S2, did we have examples where this was a better bound than previous? I don't remember right offhand, if I'm being honest. I don't know, maybe Chiprian, do you remember if we had a specific example that where this was a new bound on genus? Oh, you're muted. What were the previous bounds in S1 times S2? You mean the ones from gauge theory or something like that? Or something like that. I assume that's like what. Yes, then we have examples. I mean, like take some white hat double of the trefoil where the original S invariant is different than the tau invariant. And then you can show that, I mean, just look at the local NOT with that S invariant, and that gives a bound in S1 times S2, just as it gave an S3. Yeah. Okay. That's fair. Yeah. That's fair, yeah. But somehow, so this is somehow essentially a statement that, you know, the fact that Rasmussen's S invariant still holds for local links in S1 cross S2 means anywhere that it was good, you know, was better for you there. Better for you. I mean, if you want, you know, you can take connected sum with some standard NAT in S1 times S2 to make it more complicated. But yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, good. Thanks again. Okay, good. Thanks again. Two quick questions. So, one, I had basically the same question as Andrew, but just to make sure I understand part of it, separate from the closed case, if you could calculate the S invariant for those unbalanced, like FPQ or whatever, would that give you the relative version? Like, like some sort of relative adjunction inequality. Yeah, that's right. That's enough. Okay. And the other thing is, um, Great. And the other thing is for the corollary about periodic knots and strong equivariant concordance, can that just like is that equivalent to a statement about looking at sort of like the equivariant connected some of them and what the or what one and it's the other one's mirror? Yes, yes, that is. So the statement is somehow if you have a knot where these are different, you sort of take connect sums with mirrors, sort of upstairs, downstairs, you sort of like, you know, you notice that maybe. You notice that maybe I can write the specific thing. I'm sure it's what you have in mind. Let me not get it backwards here. So maybe I'll just write it so. So let's see, I guess it would be this. Like you use these guys upstairs, and like the key is that somehow this is also freely periodic. It's sort of the lift of this guy. Okay, so upstairs, I mean, you know, they're concordant because you just did. As you just did with the mirror, but downstairs, you can make sure that these guys are sorry, this case should be twiddled, right? Yeah. Other questions? Yeah. So I noticed at some point you pointed out that for links, For links, the S invariant doesn't satisfy a good orientation reverse. It's not negated under orientation or under mirroring. Right. And is that true for knots in S1 Curses 2? And is it true for NOTS and S in RP2? No, no, no, no. It should be fine for NOTS in all these. Just not for links. There's just, yeah. Okay. Okay, I have a suggestion/slash question. So, maybe this standardly equivariant slice refers to being sliced with respect to the like isometry on the four ball. Maybe isometrically equivariantly slice is a good name. Isometrically equivariantly sliced. So, you want this. So, you want this? Yeah, maybe. Okay, all right. Isometrically, equivariantly slice. I mean, yeah, okay, yeah, you're doing the isometrical. All right, we'll keep it in mind. Thanks. Other questions? All right, let's thank Mike again. Thanks, everyone.
