You're pressing the button to record because I think Veronica is going to do it, and I appreciate that very much. And so it's really nice to be, well, I hope it's going to be nice to hear about Shintani descent from Scott Harper from the University of Bristol. So. Thank you very much, Donna, for that introduction and this invitation. So yes, I want to talk about generation of finite groups, and this will be done by way of This will be done by way of an invariant measures icon of generation property called spread. And I want to use these 45 minutes to explain why spread's interesting, why to study spread you need to study subgroups, maximum subgroups, and then the way to study maximum subgroups in this context, the groups we're interested in. And the way to do that is to use a technique called Shintani descent, which I'll discuss. So that's where we're going. So let me just introduce the principal question. The principal question that motivates this talk. So, I think lots of interesting questions come from asking, taking two mathematical structures and asking how similar is one to the other, by which I mean you can ask questions like how far from, how much does this module fail to be a vector space? Or how not a finite group is this group, or how much like a group is this semi-group or something? So, I guess this question is a bit like: how much like a vector space is a group from the perspective of generation? Perspective of generation. And in particular, I want to ask this question. So here's an easy linear algebra observation. If you have a finite dimensional vector space V, then every non-zero vector is contained in a spanning set of minimum size D of V. Every non-zero vector can be extended to a basis. That's clear. So you can ask, well, which groups have this property? Which finite groups? Info, which finite groups is every non-trivial element contained in a generating set. Contained in a generating set of minimal size, which I'll call DFG. DFG Therac is the minimal size of the generating set of a group. So that's the question. And I'm not going to up the ante and try to start motivating this. I'm just going to give you the answer straight off because we know it. So this is a work of many authors over many years. The final piece of the puzzle was put in by Tim Bronesko, Grelnick, and myself this year, and the answer is as well. And the answer is as follows: Let G be a finite group. Then, every non-trivial element is contained in a generating set of minimal size, provided if and only if, whenever you take a quotient of the group, it needs strictly fewer generators. So, for example, for the case of two generated groups, that's saying that every non-trivial element is contained in a generating pair if and only if all the proper quotients are cyclic. In general, it's Are cyclic. In general, it's this. So, I want to begin by giving some, kind of discussing this theorem. So, here's some remarks in the statement of the theorem. Firstly, the only if direction is easy. That's the first thing to say. So, I think every talk I've given has had some variant on this proof. I'll give it anyway. So, if you take, if you have the property that every non-trivial element is contained in a generating set of minimal size. Generating set of minimal size, then take our non-trivial normal subgroup n and take a non-trivial element in that normal subgroup. I can extend it to a generating set of minimal size, but then when I take the quotient, that little n disappears, and lo and behold, I now have a generating set for my quotient that's smaller than the generating set I took for the original group. So if you have this property, then you certainly need this condition on the number of generators of proper groups. Condition on the number of generators of proper quotients. That much is evident. So the question is: can you reverse the implication? Okay, I want to just now just maybe you can decide if this is a more intuitive phrasing or not. But let me just restate the theorem in a way that might help you understand why it's true. So if every non-trivial element of a group is contained in a generating set of size k and sorry, sorry, every non-trivial element is contained in a generating set. Non-trivial element is contained in a gender set of size k if k is bigger than the minimal number of generators. Because you give me your non-trivial element and I just give you our smallest possible generating set and add it to that, and that will generate the whole group. The point of the theorem is you don't need the whole group to be generated by strictly Fourier K elements. You just need all the quotients to have that property, and that's enough. So that's another way of seeing it. And a final kind of remark is that. A final kind of remark is that you might kind of object to this whole setup. You might say this is not the most natural question to ask, Scott. You've been considering minimal generating sets, sets that minimal in terms of size, they're the smallest possible size, but it might be more natural to consider generating sets that are minimal by inclusion. That is to say, any proper subset doesn't generate whole group. It might be more natural to frame it in that language. And the reason we have it is because there's not really much to say. There's not really much to say. So, the theorem I just restated here: every non-trivial element is in a minimal generating set by size, so a minimal size of a generating set, if and only if you've got this quotience condition. Every non-trivial element is in a minimal generating set by inclusion, so a generating set that no proper subsets are generating set. That's just saying that, so clearly that's a more general property, and that's just saying that the Fruttini subgroup is trivial. So, somehow the problem's already been solved. So, somehow, the problem's already been solved in that case. So, we're looking at a specific family of fratini-free groups and saying that we don't just want every non-trivial element to be in a minimal generating set by inclusion, but actually by size. And just a bit of sanity check, the conditions on the right-hand side also have the implication going in the right way. Because if you have a, if you take the quotient by the Fertini subgroup, that will have the same number of generators as the regional group. So, you better have the Fertini subgroup. So, you better have the Fertini subgroup being not trivial for all proper quotients to have strictly fewer generators. So, that again, all of these hopefully to maybe make you have a better picture of what this theorem is saying. So, I now want to give some remarks on the proof of the theorem. So, we're only interested in the if direction. So, we're going to take a group, and I'm just going to assume the group's non-abelian. If you want to use the t-break to prove it for abelian groups, then. The t-break to prove it for abelian groups, then go ahead. So, I'm going to take a non-abelian group, and I'm going to assume that whenever you take a quotient, it has it requires strictly for your generators. And I want to show it's got this generation property. So, the first thing to note is there's a dichotomy between the case where D of G is strictly bigger than 2 and D of G equals 2. And the thing I want to make actually very clear at this stage is that the D of G strictly bigger than 2 case has nothing. Strictly bigger than two case has nothing to do with Bernese Gran like an arbor. But that was done before we put in the final piece. In particular, in that case, the structure of G is known. I'm not going to describe it, but it's what's called a crown-based power. They arise from taking primitive monolithic groups and kind of bulking them out a bit. Anyway, the structure of these groups is known, and Achiari and Accini a couple of years ago. Sherry and Lucchini, a couple of years ago, proved the theorem for such groups. So, in the case where you're not looking at, you're looking at three generative groups, four genitive groups, and so on, this theorem is true using different techniques. The case where D of G equals 2 is different and their methods didn't apply. So, that's what we studied. And in this case, there's two possibilities for G, it's insoluble or soluble. If it's soluble, it's an affine group. If it's soluble, it's an affine group. So you've got an elementary abelian subgroup, a normal subgroup, and you've got actually adding one irreducible matrix, say, on top that acts on the vector space. That's what happens if it's soluble. And if it's insoluble, then you've got the minimal normal subgroup being a direct product of a load of non-abelian simple groups. Then you've got some element on top that permutes them transitively and acts as a perhaps inducing some automorphisms. So it's a kind of twisted wreath product. So it's like kind of twisted wreath product in a sense. Anyway, that's the point. The point is that that's the structure of the groups in this case. It's not the structure of the groups for bigger D of G. Anyway, so how do we prove this result? Well, the first step logically, though in fact the final step chronologically, was to reduce this problem to the almost simple groups. So we do that in, I guess, as one of the two things in the paper. So you handle the soluble groups and you then reduce to the case where K The case where k in this case is one, that's all the simple groups. So that's the first thing to do. And then you say, great, we've reduced to the almost simple groups, and the simple groups have been studied by the proved, the theme was proved by them, by Granach and Canter in 2000. So we think essentially we're done, right? We've reduced it to the almost simple groups, and we know it's true for simple groups. So there can't be much more to do. So before I go on, let me just point out why the simple groups had been studied earlier. Had been studied earlier. Well, of course, as we all know, simple groups are interesting groups and they have interesting generation properties, and this is an interesting generation property, so it's not surprising that people studied it. But I want to explain that the symbol groups are somehow the extreme example of groups with this property. Because I said we're interested in groups where all the quotients have a fewer number of generators. And in simple groups, obviously, they're two-generated. We know that by the classification of finite simple groups. But the minimum, take any normal subgroup. But the minimum, take any normal subgroup, if you quoti it, you get the trivial group. So it's zero-generated. And this is, in fact, I'd say an extreme example because it's a fact that if you take a finite group and you quotient by a minimal normal subgroup, then you can only ever reduce the number of generators by at most one. You quotient by minimal normal subgroup, but the number of generators required for the quotient is only ever reduced by one from the Only reduced by one from the original group, except for this case of non-immediate simple groups, where it jumps down by two. So that actually explains why the whole theorem divides up into D of G strictly bigger than two and equals to two. It's because of that fact. Anyway, that's a long story short. Simple groups were the extreme example they were studied. Wait, can I ask a question? Yeah. It's just to show I'm awake. But it's a real question, too. So is it easy what you just said? Said to take this minimal normal that it goes in the mic most one. So, I don't know. It's not, it uses the classification of finite simple groups, and that way it's it uses the class, it uses the classification, yeah. Okay, it's not easy then, okay. Yeah, exactly. It's a theorem of, I think, Lucinian menagatsu. Um, um, yeah, so I think, yeah, I think so, um, what we now want to do is fill in this gap. Do is fill in this gap, prove for the almost simple groups that are not simple. And I'd say that that sounds, if you just thought of this problem, not having ever heard anything about it, you might think that sounds quite easy. The main task of this talk is to prove that it's actually quite difficult. And actually, in some sense, the bulk of the work in this project has been moving from simple to on simple groups. So we, these three authors, Bernes Grammck and Harper and I, we did it for the exceptional groups. That was the last thing to happen in a long paper and a short paper. In a long paper and a short paper, mine did it for most of the classical groups of Le Tide, building on work of Bernes and Gasper linear groups and the symmetric and sporadic groups that had already been studied. So the point is this was a lot of work moving from simple to almost simple and that's somehow what I want to kind of convey in this talk. Anyways, so that's what we need to do. We need to study two generated groups, in particular almost simple groups. So we're going to do that by this invariant. So, we're going to do that by this invariant I mentioned called spread. So, here, let me just give the definition. So, as I say, G is a two-generated group. That's the context for the rest of the talk. The spread is this number. It's the biggest k so that if you give me k non-identity elements, g1 up to gk, you have complete control over that. I find an element h so that for each of the gi's you give me, my h generates with it. Generates with it. So it's the biggest case so that given any key non-identity elements, I can find something that generates with each of them separately. So to check that we understand everything so far in this talk, this is the line to check do you understand. The spread of G is at least one, so that's exactly saying that every non-trivial element is contained in a generating pair, which is exactly the sort of thing we're interested in, right? If the group is, if DOG is two, that's saying that every non-trivial element is in a generating set of minimal signs. Trivial element in a generating set of minimal signs. So, really, we're interested in seeing which finite two-generated groups have spread at least one. And that part of the theorem was a conjecture by Brouwer, Grannock, and Cantor from 2008, and it stated, the special case of the theorem earlier, that the spread is at least one if and only if every proper portion is cyclic. But now that we've got this invariant spread, we can start asking more general questions. We can start asking General questions. We can start asking when is the spread at least two, five, a hundred? Um, and in particular, when is it exactly one? Right? So when is it not bigger than one? So that question was asked about 50 years ago by Brenner and Viegold. For which finite groups is the spread exactly one? I mean, can't you do any better than that? And they didn't know any examples, and they knew there were no soluble examples. And they said perhaps maybe there's only finitely many. So the answer to this question. So, the answer to this question, so this is really the theorem that we proved that proved the other theorem, is the following. A finite group has spread at least one, if and only if it actually has spread at least two, if and only if every proper quotient is cyclic. So the answer to Brennan Viegel's question is, yes, there are only finitely many because there are in fact none. And that's an interesting observation. Here, everything I've done is for finite groups, obviously, and infinite. Obviously, infinite groups do exist. And if you wanted, an interesting question to think about is: is there a group necessarily infinite that has spread exactly one? There is a bit of a literature emerging on the spread of infinite groups, and there's still no known examples. Anyway, but that's the theorem I kind of want to talk about for the rest of the talk. So I had three words in the three phrases, I guess, in the title: spread subgroups, and Shintani descent. So, the first thing I'd like to do is indicate. So, the first thing I'd like to do is indicate why spread is a question really about subgroups. So, that's the tagline for this next bit of the talk: to study the spread of some almost simple group. So, a simple group T together with an automorphism X. Look at the maximal subgroups that elements of this coset TX are contained in. That's what I want to get across in the next few slides. The strategy for showing that, considering the spread of normally simple group, is to study the maximum. Simple group is to study the maximal overgroups of elements in a generating coset. So, why is that the case? Let me just give two examples to try to get that feeling across. So, the first example, I'm going to explain why the spread is at least one for this particular finite simple group. So, it's an odd-dimensional orthogonal group, an odd characteristic. So, this is just a matrix group, and I claim the spreads at least one. Claim the spreads at least one. So, why is that true? Well, I'm going to define an element, and it's going to be 2m plus 1 by 2m plus 1 matrix. It's not diagonal, it's got one massive 2m dimensional block and one-dimensional identity. And the big block is an irreducible matrix. It acts irreducibly on a minus-type 2M space. So, I have a big irreducible thing and a fixed point. Fixed point. And it's a fact that the only maximal subgroup to contain this element is the one that it has to be contained in, namely the stabilizer of that 2M dimensional space. It's certainly contained in that maximal subgroup, and you can check that's the only one. So why does that help? Well, as people have already mentioned this week, and as lots of people in the audience just know, control over maximum subgroups give control over general. Control over maximum subgroups give control over generation, and here's how it applies for this property. If you give me a non-trivial element g, then I'm going to find something that generates with it. And I'm going to do that by saying, well, you'll generate with some conjugate s to the x, provided that you're not in the maximum subgroup h to the x. If you are, then both the elements are contained in h to the x and we're stuck. But if you're not, then, well, what would You're not, then, well, these two elements generate some subgroup of g, and if it's not the whole group, it's contained in a maximal subgroup, and the only maximal subgroup it could be is h to the x, but g is not in h to the x. So all we need to do is find some x so that g is not in h to the x. And we can find some x because the intersection of all these h to the x's is trivial because it's the core of the subgroup. And actually, just to make a connection with the talk that guest Tim is about to make, you can see that this whole problem is a bit You can see that this whole problem is a bit related to base size. You only have to check some of the x for people in the know. Anyway, so that's why. But of course, in general, I said we wanted to show spread maybe at least two or something. So we need something slightly stronger. And obviously, you might not be able to find an element contained in a unique maximal subgroup. And I'll say a bit more about that later. So you need something a bit stronger, a technique a bit stronger, a bit more general. And that's this lemma of Goramich and Canter from. And that's this lemma of Goralnik and Cantor from 2000 when they studied the simple groups. I don't really want you to read the statement, I just want you to notice that for it to work and to satisfy this condition. And you can see I'm summing over the maximal subgroups of G that contain S. So I don't want there to be too many of them. And I'm computing an intersection that seems to be bad and H is big. It's big if H is big. So you might, the takeaway from this lemma is you kind of want to find an element S that's contained. Want to find an element S that's contained in few and small maximal subgroups. And if you can do that, you can probably achieve this bound. So, the case where it was contained in exactly one maximal subgroup, that's great. Internally, you just want few and small. But that's the point. To study the spread, you want to study maximum overgroups. Okay, so that's getting lower bounds and spread. It hasn't been featured in the talk so far, but you might also want to study upper bounds on spreads. But you might also want to study upper bounds on spread and get a feel for what the spread actually is asymptotically. So I'm just going to give an example showing that too. So I'm going to explain why the spread of G is at most this polynomial, Q to the 8, in the case where three cases. So the first case is the one we just saw. Odd-dimensional orthogonal groups in odd characteristic. So why is the spread at most this number in that case? So crucially, this is a number independent of the rank. So, crucially, this is a number independent of the rank. This is just a, it depends only on q. Well, here's the reason, essentially. It's a standard fact. Every element of G stabilizes a one space of the natural module. So the element we just saw did, right? It had our kind of one-dimensional identity sitting on the diagonal. And that might help you see why every semi-simple element has that property, but in fact, every element has that property. And why is that really? And why is that relevant? Well, Granak and Shalev have a very nice paper on spread, and you can state this label, but you can extract from one of their really nice geometric proofs this lemma. So what does it say? It says, if I've got some finite simple classical group with natural module Fq to the N, and I'm just assuming it's not PSL, then if every element of T stabilizes in one step, Of T stabilizes in one space, then the spread is bounded above by this polynomial Q to the 8. You can improve Q to the 8, but I won't bother. And there you actually see something much better by Q squared. But the point is, and I'm not going to prove it, but it's a geometric argument. Essentially, you can find Q to the eight elements, and every element will fit some one space in common with those, one of those. Anyway. What I thought was anyway, this factor at one spaces implies this bound on spread. So that's why the result holds in that case. Okay, I said I was interested in normal simple groups. So let's consider a normal simple example. So here, oh, it's not simple. So here I'm going to take g to be t adjoint x. So t is the same group as before, the orthogonal group, and I'm going to add in a field automorphism. So you can think about this as the thing that either acts on. The thing that either acts on the vector space semilinearly and raises scalars to power p, for example, or it conjugates elements in the group T by raising matrix entries in the power of P, however you want to think about it. Anyway, so in that context, here's not a standard factor, a mysterious claim. Every element of this whole almost simple group stabilizes a one space of the vector space. So this is perhaps mysterious for at least two reasons. This is perhaps mysterious for at least two reasons. One, I don't think it really makes much sense as a statement, and two, it's not obvious why it's true. So, let me first clarify what I mean by it. I mean, if you either think of the semi-linear action or better, you think of it group theoretically, by stabilizing our one space for something outside the simple group, what I mean is you can look at the stabilizer of a one space in the simple group, and I'm saying that every element of the whole group normalizes that stabilizer in the simple group. So every Simple group. So every element is contained in the normalizer of the stabilizer of a one space. That's just a way to make precise what it means for some field automorphism to fix a one space. Anyway, the point is that that's true not just for elements in the simple group, but elements in the whole all-simple group. And I'm going to explain later why, why that's true. But at the moment, with that mysterious claim, you can vary the lemma slightly. So you looked away, I just changed what was. So you looked away, I just changed what was in the blue box. And it's actually true in more generality. If I take an almost simple group, if every element in the whole almost simple group stabilizes in one space, then the almost simple group also has the same bound on the spread. So that's good. So we've done it in that case too. I'm going to take a final example. Scott, can I ask what happens for PSLN? For PSLN, just the particular argument is. Argument is a nice argument involving forms on a space. And kind of so the argument doesn't work in that case. Is there a bound though? The bound probably is true. You just have to make set the presence of the kind of the graph automorphism exchanges one spaces and n minus one space just complicates the setup slightly. So I just wanted to avoid it for simplicity. Okay, okay. Thanks. Yeah, morally, everything still is true. Okay, thanks. Everything still is true. Okay, thanks. Okay, so here's a third example. So now I've kind of changed parities. I'm looking at an even-dimensional orthogonal group, minus type, an even characteristic, and I've got a graph automorphism. So you can think of that as a transvection or any graph automorphism. So again, here's a mysterious claim. Every element of this coset, Tx, stabilizes in one space of the natural module. So again, I'm not justifying why, but I Again, I'm not justifying why, but again, I just want to highlight that's not true of the whole group, right? There are certainly irreducible elements in T, right? There's a Singer cycle in T that certainly doesn't stabilize a one space. But it's a fact that every element outside, well, I'm not saying that every element Tx, it stabilizes a one space. So this is just to highlight what's going on with the almost simple groups and simple groups isn't completely transparent, but that is a true statement. And actually, again, I've tweaked the lemma slightly. And actually, again, I've tweaked the lemma slightly. That's all you need. So the final version of the lemma is that if you have a finite simple class of group and every element in the generating coset TG stabilizes in one space, then the whole OMOSIM group has this bound on the spread. So again, like before, we're interested in the maximal subgroups that elements are contained in, but we're particularly interested in the maximal overgroups of elements outside the soccle, which are particularly exactly the ones that are hard to kind of understand because they're not matrix. ones that are hard to kind of understand because they're not matrices necessarily. Okay, so the punchline is the shintany descent is the way to think about this. But before I go there, I want to just highlight something about these one spaces and spread, because I think in itself it's interesting. And that observation is the fact that stabilizing a one space is in some sense the only obstacle to having unboundedly large spread. So that's what the following So that's what the following theorem says. So if I fix some field size Q and I take a sequence of, there are missing hypotheses on this slide, sorry, if I take a sequence of finite simple groups whose order, almost simple groups, so T is the finite simple group, X is the automorphism. I'm assuming the order tends to infinity in this sequence. So a sequence of finite almost simple groups tending to infinity. Then the spread. To infinity, then the spread of these groups is bounded only if, if not only if, every element of a generating coset stabilizes in one space of the natural module. So I've just told you that one direction, if you have, if you stabilize in one space, then you've got a bound on this on the bound in terms of Q of the spread. And actually, that's the only obstacle. Otherwise, the spread will get ultra large. And this is a special case. I fixed the field size. I'm only looking at classical groups. But you can, now using this, get a classification of when the spread of our sequence formal simple groups diverges to infinity. So Grana Kashala did this for simple groups. So what I'm saying is the extension to almost simple groups. And in the BGH paper, we did it in all cases except we couldn't handle this case when you had some classical groups over a fixed field. Of some classical groups over a fixed field, we didn't have this ingredient about one spacy, and that's the bit that I added in. So, what does it say? If I've got a sequence of non-abelian finite simple groups Tk, and each of them has an automorphism xk, and I'm assuming again that the size tends to infinity, then the spread will tend to infinity too, unless there's an infinite sub-sequence where the bottom two cases, that's just the cases that I implicitly have talked about. The cases that I implicitly have talked about on the first theorem, where you have this one spread, a one-space property. Or you have to also avoid symmetric groups because they are spread, it turns out two or three always. And you have to ensure that the alternating groups have degrees, all the primes going to infinity. But anyway, the point is that on the previous slide, I had some upper bounds on spread coming from stabilizing a one space. And for classic groups, that's essentially the only obstacle. Otherwise, and it gives a complete classification. That's what I'm getting across in this slide. Anyway, the point is that I now want to kind of convince you that if you want to study the maximal subgroups that contain elements in these generating cosets, Tx, then you need to use Shintani or I'm suggesting use Shintani descent. So here is the opportunity for me to say something about Shintani descent. So what is it? So, what is it? It's a theory developed in the 1970s by Shutani and other authors, such as Kawanaka, to study the characters of finite groups of LiTape. And a number of years ago, Geralnik and Fuhlman used the theory not to study characters of finite groups of Li type, but to study the finite groups of Li-type themselves, in particular their conjugacy classes. Their conjugate C classes. And then, in this work on spread, we have really taken on this technique of Shintani descent applied to groups themselves. And it's been a bit of an incubation period. This SPRED project has given an opportunity to kind of iron out this theory of Shintani descent. And it's now at a stage where it's quite general and, I think, useful. So let me explain what it is. So the setup is that X is a connected algebraic group. So you could think of SLN if you wanted. So you could think of SLN if you wanted, I'm assuming it's over FB bar. And I've got two commuting Steinberg endomorphisms. So you might think of these as being Frobenius endomorphisms, or maybe one's a Frobenius endomorphism, one's a Frobenius times a graph or something, but they're two commuting Steinberg endomorphisms of X. And here's the theorem. There is a bijection, which I'll call the Shintani map, which, okay, it's a map on. Which, okay, it's a map on conjugacy classes, but we forget that for the moment. It's a map that goes from two between two cosets. So I can take the fixed points, that's why I mean by the subscript, I can take the fixed points under sigma one, coset with sigma two, or I can take, thought as an automorphism of the group, or I can take fixed points under sigma two and coset with sigma one, and there's a bijection between the conjugacy classes in those two cosets. So the Chantani map is a bijection between the conjugacy. map as a bijection between the conjugacy classes in one coset and the conjugacy classes in a different coset of a different group. And let me just give an example just to make crystal clear what I mean. So usual example P is odd. Q is a power of P, X this time is the simple algebraic group. It's the group that probably most of you call SO for reasons that I just called it omega. It's a simple algebraic group or dimensional. or dimensional and sigma 1 and sigma 2 are standard for well sigma 2 is the standard for benefits and sigma 1 is some power of it so I'm going to apply the claim above in this case so what is F go it's conjugacy classes in the coset so you think of this as being part of a normal simple group right omega 2 plus 1 2n plus 1 q so omega over q extended by this field automorphism that coset is bijecting the conjugacy classes in that coset Conjugacy classes in that coset and the conjugacy classes in this subgroup oligo over P. So that is, and this is why Shintini percent is useful for this problem. Because on the left-hand side, I've got this kind of nasty coset of some semi-linear maps, or it's kind of sitting in an almost simple group, but it's not the simple group. I've got conjugacy classes over here, and I can use the Shintani map to transfer information about that over to conjugacy classes in an honest to goodness symbol group. Classes in an honest to goodness symbol group, where I know much more, and that's what's the utility of this technique. Now, as stated, I've just said that F is a bijection, so really it's just a claim that these two sets have the same size. And sometimes all you're interested in is the number of conjugacy classes or something. But you might generally be interested in what structure does this map preserve. And that's what I want to say for the rest of the talk. But before that, let me quickly actually prove. Before that, let me quickly actually prove this claim because actually, there's actually a really nice proof. So, I'm attributing Shintani is essentially starting this theory, Kawanak is stating it in the appropriate generality. I'm attributing this proof to Deshbandin much more recently. It's a really slick proof. So, here it goes. I define a set. So, I'm taking two cosets of the algebraic group. So, this is the algebraic group, X, and I've got the coset with sigma 2 and sigma. And I've got the coset with sigma 2 and sigma 1. I'm taking pairs of elements in these cosets that commute. And I'm module simultaneous conjugation of both factors by x. Now by the Lang-Steinberg theorem, I can assume that the h is sigma 1. I can conjugate everything in this coset, x sigma 1, to sigma 1 by the Lang-Steinberg theorem. So I'm going to do that. And now since the first term has to commute with sigma 1, that means x is in the fixed points of sigma 1. of sigma one and the conjugation is now just by sigma one. And similarly, I can assume that the first coordinate is sigma two and all the usual adjustments. And now I just compose these two bijections and I get the shintani map. I take the first term of the first side, so that's an element x in x sigma 1 with sigma 2. With sigma 2 next to it. On the right-hand side, I've got an element y, which is something in x sigma 2 with a sigma 1 next to it. And f is exactly what I wanted, seeing from the top. And f is exactly the bijection between these two sets. So you don't have to follow the details there. But the point is that there's a slick proof if it's maybe not Friday at 4 o'clock, or 4 o'clock wherever I am. So that's what that is. So that is what we're briefly saying, well, what. So that is what more briefly says, well, what does this map preserve? I've given you as a map between, I'm thinking of it as a map between elements, really, as a map between continuous classes. And I want to say, what does it, such as it preserve? In particular, what can I say about maximal overgroups of an element and its image under the Shintani map? So an element, I understand the maximum overgroups. What can I say about its image under the Shintani map? So here's what you can say. If I take y to be a closed Y to be a closed, okay. The appropriate, the important adjective in this hypothesis is the word connected. If I take a connected subgroup of X, then I'm assuming its fixed points is a self-normalizing subgroup, so think of it as being maximal. Then the long story short, the maximal overgroups that come from taking fixed points from Y, they contain G, so the maximal Y-type overgroups of G. Type overgroups of G correspond to some element in the appropriate coset, correspond to the maximal Y-type subgroups of F of G in the appropriate coset. So if you have a group and you've got these two cosets, you've got an element, you take a Shintani image, the kind of subgroups you get from taking fixed points under a connected subgroup kind of transfer over exactly as you'd expect. So in the example we just had a second ago, if I A second ago, if I take a parabolic subgroup, so say the stabilizer of a totally singular one space, then I'm saying the parabolic subgroups, these p1 parabolic subgroups that contain some element in the coset x phi, they correspond to the parabolic subgroups, the stabilizer one spaces on the other side. So, in particular, the summary is that something in this coset x phi stabilizes a totally singular one space if and only if the Shintani image. If the Shintani image, which is something in this subfield subgroup, if and only if it preserves our totally a singular one space on its natural module. So even if you didn't follow all these details, which you perhaps didn't because I went through them very quickly, the message is I've got this map between coset, a kind of non-trivial coset of an almost simple group, and the subgroup, like a subfield subgroup, which is a simple group. So, which is a simple group, and information about the maximal subgroups contained in this coset correspond to information about maximal subgroups in this simple group. Or in this example, one spaces stabilized by things in this coset correspond to one space stabilized by things in this subgroup. And that's how we sort of prove that mysterious claim, at least for totally singular one spaces. What about non-singular one spaces? In that case, the corresponding subgroup of the algebraic group is disconnected, right? Is disconnected, right? Is this or? And what I essentially want to say is that it's the theory, so I can't apply this theorem, but I can apply some variant. So let me just see what happens. Same set up as before. I just want you to see that there are two types of subgroup now you might be contained in. You might be contained in a plus type orthogonal group or a minus type orthogonal group on both sides. And it's a theorem that the total The total number of plus type subgroups plus the total number of minus type subgroups that contain my x phi correspond to the total number of plus type subgroups and minus type subgroups that contain the Shantani image. But it's not true, so again, so x phi stabilizes a non-singular one space if normally if the shantani image does, but it's not true that the plus type corresponds to the plus type and the minus type correspond to the minus type. That's not true. So you can. So, you can, the paper does explain exactly what the correspondence is, but it's not a correspondence. So, I'm just going to put it up on the screen. I don't want you to make sure you read it. The point is that what I just said holds in general for disconnected subgroups. So, there's a variant on the previous theorem that applies to disconnected subgroups. And that's really useful because most of the subgroups you're going to be interested in will be disconnected. They'll have a little bit on top that interchanges factors or applies an automorphism or something. Okay, so that was a whistle stop tour of Shintani descent. The message being that you can transfer information about an almost simple group to information about a simple group via a bijection that preserves important information about maximum overgroups. That's the message. So I just want to close by just mentioning, I've mentioned the application to spread via maximum subcrowder. To spread via maximal subgroups, I just want to mention an application to maximal subgroups themselves, particularly because it relates to something we heard earlier in the week. So I'm going to finish by defining one final invariant. So for a finite group, I'm defining mu of g to be the minimal number of maximal subgroups an element might be contained in. So let me say that again. If I take an element, you can count how many maximal subgroups it's contained in. It's contained in, and I want to find what's the minimal such number. So if mu of g is one, that means that I can find an element in a unique maximal subgroup. If mu of g is two, that means I can find an element in two maximal subgroups, but not one that's in one. Okay, so what is this number? So for finite simple groups, a couple of years ago, Tim and I studied this. And if you are an alternating group or a sporadic group, then it turns Alternating group or sporadic group, then it turns out that it's almost three and we know the number exactly. So, in particular, we know when an element is contained in a unique maximal subgroup. And in general, the number is at most seven, but morally it's almost three. It's actually, it's almost three in all but four cases, but it is three infinitely often. So, the takeaway from this theorem is that if you have a finite simple group, you can always find an element that's contained in at most three maximal subgroups. There are four exceptions, but Groups. There are four exceptions, but the three is really the best possible. And if you're alternating sporadic, we know exactly what's going on. So the question is: can you extend this result by Shintani descent to all new symbol groups? And the answer is, well, sort of. So obviously the alternating sporadic groups have nothing to do with shintani descent, but just comment that again it's a most three, nothing changes. It's a most three, nothing changes, and it's known exactly. If you're a group of lead type, things are much more complicated. And this is related to the problem that Gareth was mentioning on Monday, his work with Bob Kralnik on trying to determine which finite groups have an element that contains a unique maximal subgroup. And they reduce the problem to almost simple groups. And Gareth mentioned you can somehow trans go from simple to almost simple via Chantani descent. And I guess I may have left out a bit about what that means. But let me just tell you what. Tell you what is known separately from that work, which is that there's no universal upper bound. So there's a universal upper bound of sib in morally three for simple groups, but there's no universal upper bound for almost simple groups. In fact, there's not even for bounded rank. So for any k that you might give me that you think would be a universal upper bound for mu, I can find you some f. So it's psl22 to the f dot f. You can have dot field automark. dot f, we can have dot a field automorphism. That will have at least k, every element will be contained in at least k maximal subgroups. So there is no universal upper bound even for groups of bounded rank. But there are plenty of examples of almost simple but not simple groups of Li-type that have an element contained a unique maximal subgroup. So Shintan extent gives you some information for free, but it doesn't just follow immediately. And as I say, Gareth has mentioned ongoing work in that direction. Ongoing work in that direction. So that kind of draws me to a close. Let me have a slide here that kind of summarises a bit of what I've said. The main problem was to try to study when an element was contained in a generating set of minimal size. And based on previous work, that reduced quite quickly to groups that are true generated. And in that case, we had this theorem answering the question of Brennan Viegold and the conjecture of Berard, Rolich and Cantor. And the conjecture of Berg, Grallach, and Cantor that classifies the groups of spread lease one or spread lease two. And I explained that to do that, you need to study matching over groups of elements and almost simple groups. And to do that, you can use this quite elegant and powerful technique of Shintani descent. So that's what I wanted to say. And I think I'll stop there. Okay, thanks.
