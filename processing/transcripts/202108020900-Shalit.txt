Clean, you'll want to do that instead of desktop. Yeah, sure, the desktop. There you go. All right. Thank you very much. So, sorry. So, this is the inequality. This is it. This is what you missed. You can see it now? Yeah, we can see it now. Thank you. Great. So, you see, thank you very much for letting me know. And, okay. And okay, so we know classically that a commutative sister algebra is just a continuous function on a compact space, and we have this dual equivalence between compact spaces and unitary commutative sister algebras. And then we can go and say, okay, so a non-commutative C-star algebra is something. It's just like a non-commutative topological space. And then people say, okay, we have a dictionary. A closed set is an idea. A closed set is an ideal, compact is unital, etc., etc. And by analogy, we start to call things functions. For example, weights on Neumann algebra, you can call that non-commutative integration theory. Because if you look at the commutative case, it reduces to that. Okay? So we have non-commutative systems. So we have non-commutative sister algebras and we can call them non-commutative topological spaces, but beyond the level of declarations and analogies, we are interested in this question mark. And what is this? Can we really think of the non-commutative sister algebra in some way as an algebra of not commutative functions? Commutative functions on some kind of non-commutative space. Not just say, okay, commutative sister algebras are continuous functions. So if we drop the commutative, then we have non-commutative functions. We really want functions. We really want things that look like functions. And well, we'll see. So how do you do that? So we go back to the commutative case for a bit of inspiration. Commutative case for a bit of inspiration. And so, how is a commutative sister algebra equal to C of X? So, the answer is that the sister algebra acts on its own irreducible representations. For every A in the sister algebra, we have A hat acting on a representation just by reversing the roles of the representation. The roles of the representation and object. And then we take x to be the maximal ideal space. So the not a new idea that lies beneath this talk is that we need to view objects as functions on their representation spaces. Okay, so non-commutative function theory, among other things. Among other things, it gives a nice way of viewing operator algebras or spaces as algebras or functions on their representation. And I suppose I didn't see the entire audience. This is one of the really annoying things about giving a talk. Currently, I can't see anyone, but I can pretend that I see many people here in the audience that have done exactly this. That have done exactly this in their work. So, there have been many takes on what this means. And I'm going to present the following take by Ken and Matt from this preprint that you can all easily find. And well, a little apology. I'm not going to do justice to any of you non-commutative function theorists sitting in the crowd. Crowd because of clutter problems on my slides. All right. So let's make this blanket assumption that everything is unital and separable. And so the bottom line is don't worry about these things. We're going to talk mostly about the structural aspects. Talk mostly about the structural aspects. You'll see why I'm a little bit worried about separable. Unital is like if I forget to say, if I say order isomorphism, I mean unital order isomorphism, etc. Okay, so these are the last flowers I have. So the framework I'm going to talk about is a so the Is a so the starting point is a operator system and we're going to view them as a spaces of non-commutative functions, special kinds of non-commutative functions or non-commutative convex sets. And then we're going to view sister algebras as algebras of continuous NC functions and in a nice way. In a nice way, I think maybe nicer than have been previously done. And then they use this to study operator systems, sister algebras, and their interactions. So this is a major theme in the little field, if we can, whatever we call this, that John was talking about. It's also the relation between operator system, sister algebra, then how to use that for operator theorem. Operator theorem. So, this theory that I'm going to present can be applied to such problems. So, let's start with notation. So, until now, I was just kind of blabbering. Now, you need to start concentrating, okay? Except Ken, I saw Ken in the audience. Ken, you can stop concentrating, please, because this is a bit scary. Okay. Okay, so n and m will always denote cardinal numbers and you can always think of them as integers or a aleph naught. E is a dual operator space with its weak star topology. So E is an operator space which is also a dual space. This is going to be clarified in a couple of slides. in a couple of slides it's it's not really it's not really a problem and so the n by n matrices over e well we know what that means when m and n are integers and when n and m and n are cardinal numbers then these are the infinite matrices that have uniformly bounded sub matrices in the norm these have norms matrices in the norm these have norms because it's an operator space so it's the matrices that have uniformly bounded sub matrices when m is equal to n we denote this m n of e and a we take the disjoint union of all these matrix algebras but a unlike a lot of what's been done in a non-commutative approaches to convexity or to To convexity or to function theory, we take the disjoint union for all cardinals less than some sufficiently large cardinal. And what they write in the paper, and I believe them, though I didn't give this too much thought, so you'll see me maybe balking, is that you when E is separable, everything's a separable object, then you can take this. Then you can take this just for cardinals less than aleph nodes. So we call this ME, this direct union, disjoint union. And then a graded disjoint union, a graded subset in this ME, in this NC space, it's called NC convex if it's closed under bounded direct. Bounded direct sum and compression by isometries. So I have this written here. Maybe it's worthwhile just to look at these. So the Xi's are in Ki Nohar Noni Titkashrela, Sami with Tagidiloshania Suk. Sami mit Kashir. Sorry about that. So Xi's are in Ki and we have these isometries and this is a direct sum and we can compress by isometries also. So this is what's called a non-commutative convex set. So some facts about this is that it's really the definition is Really, the definition is equivalent to being closed on the NC convex combinations, and we need this guy to converge. This can also be infinite. And it's also a fact that being level-wise closed implies being globally closed in the following sense. So I don't want to go over each and every equation. Maybe I should at least at this. Maybe I should at least at the start. So if we have these isometries, you see these are isometries going from Ni to N, and their projections are converging to the identity of K living on the N level, the Nth cardinal. Then if we have this limit, then X is also in Kn. So NC convex sets. So NC convex sets, which are closed, which is everything we're going to talk about, are closed under NC convex combination and they're globally closed. And that's why we needed weak star and not just some other topology. We need these things to converge to be able to say this. And we'll see in a moment why it's natural really to talk about dual spaces. Any questions or remarks? Okay. And anybody alive? Hello. Okay, I see. I see. Great. Thank you very much. So, there's the familiar notion of matrix convex sets, and this is the NC convex set. So, we can take this. So we can take this here, it's a union only over finite cardinals, here it's a union over a bunch of cardinals, and you'll see this guy whenever I feel comfortable. Maybe you're looking at the slides and you can't read my body language. So to convey that I feel that I'm bullshitting you, I draw this little worried person. And so we can make the comparison, the important what. Comparison: The important what I want to say is that really both kinds of objects are dually equivalent with operator systems. So really, they're equivalent things. And you can actually, if you have this union, you can just say, let's take the finite part and you get something like this. And this finite part turns out to determine the big union because of what we said. Because of what we said about being globally closed. So, in a sense, these things carry the same information. They carry the same information, but here you have more points. So, saying that they carry the same information doesn't mean that we are allowed to consider only finite cardinals because. Because it's like saying that the dense set of rational points in the unit disk they carry all the information when you talk about analytic functions on the disk, but you don't want to do analytic functions, analytic function theory only on the set of rational points in the disk, you want the whole disk. So maybe this is a kind of an explanation looking at the points, not at the category theory, why we want. category theory, why we want to work with this larger infinite cardinals, infinite levels. I think I gave a talk maybe two or three years ago. I completely lost the sense of time, probably two or three years ago, where I explained why I don't want to take infinite levels, but today I'm representing somebody else's paper, so I want to explain to you why we must take the infinite coordinate. Take the infinite coordinates. So here's an example, maybe it's an example of a non-commutative NC convex set. So if S is an operator system, we take for K the N C state space. What is that? It's this joint union where Kn are the UCP maps from S to Mn. From S to M N. Now remember, N can be L F naught, so this is just B of H. So it's the UCP maps from S to the n-dimensional bounded operators on n-dimensional Hilbert space. Now the UCP maps from S to Mn, they're contained in the completely bounded map from S to Mn. And this is naturally identified. Identified as a matrix of elements in the dual of S. So you see, if we wanted to talk about matrices over E, where E is a dual space, then when we look at the non-commutative state space, it's really natural to look at this. And when this is the setting, then everything is very nice. And so, K, we can. K, we can think of the points of K, the UCP maps, as the kind of representations of the S. These are the, in the category of operator systems, this is a natural notion of representation. And then we can think, since these are representations of S, we can think of S as functions on K by the usual thing. We just, how does A act on phi? We reverse the roles. So if phi. roles so if phi was in kn we let a hat phi be phi of a that's in mn and this property of taking a point on the nth level to a point in the nth level is called graded something that every non-commutative function in any reasonable definition has to obey a a hat is also continuous if phi n converges to phi then a then A phi n converges to A phi by definition of weak star convergence. So these are continuous and also it has a nice property of being NCF fine. What does it mean to be NCF fine? Here it is. If we have these gammas that kind of a non-commutative convergence Convex combination of the X i's, then, well, alpha A hat respects non-commutative convex combination. So that's called NC affine. Okay? All right. So given a NC convex set, oh, will always K will always be K will always be compact, so level wise compact, NC convex set. We let AK denote the space of continuous NC affine maps from K to M. M is just when E is the scalars. And AK has a natural operator system structure. So obviously you can add functions. add functions but for example there you can ask when is a positive so how is positivity defined if you have a matrix over a k again you can think of it as a nc fine function from k to mn and then you say that a is positive if ax is positive for every x in km if x is in km and a is in mn a k then ax is in n n m but okay we can ask when is it positive ask when is it positive? So that's the notion of positivity and AK is an operator system. So a theorem. So every such K is NC affine homeomorphic to the NC state space of A K, of some operator system, one operator system, the NC affine functions on it. And so the NC state space is this, this UCPA KN. And in the other direction or the other side of things, if you have S is an operator system and K is its NC state space, then S is completely unitally, as I said, order isomorphic to AK. So every operator system is actually an operator. Actually, an operator system of functions on its NC state space. So let's recap what we have until now. Every operator system can be considered as continuous NC affine functions on an NC convex compact set. An operator system corresponds to its NC state space and the AK and the compact set goes to And the compact set goes to its space of continuous affine functions on it. And actually, it's a categorical duality. There's also a correspondence between maps. So now we have this question. I told you that we're interested quite a lot in the relationship between an operator system and a sister algebra that it sits in or generates, say, sister of S. Basis star of s. And we know that operator systems are a, now we know, continuous NC affine functions on a compact NC convex set. And then we have this question, okay, so what's this? What are the what is the sister algebra? Of course, the sister algebra is also an operator system, and we can view it from the start here, but it's more interesting when we have this kind of inclusion. So, how is the sister algebra viewed as an algebra of functions? So, Davidson and Kennedy, they consider two answers to these questions, and they relate the two answers in an interesting way. So one answer is a top-down answer. If we just start with the C-star algebra, then we have this idea that goes back. This idea that goes back more than 40 years ago. It's Takesaki and Bierteleer's non-commutative Gilfan's theory. So we need a definition. We consider the representations of a sister algebra A on a sufficiently large Hilbert space, and we look at functions from the representations space to be of A. space to be of h. Such a function is said to be an admissible operator field if it's bounded with its norm is less than infinity. The norm is t acting on pi for all pi in the representation space. It respects direct sums and respects unitary equivalence. It's a bit more complicated, but let's just leave it like this: it respects direct sums. Like this, it respects direct sum and unitary equivalence. So that's an admissible operator field. And what they proved is the following that I should have written it the other way. So the admissible operator fields, they form a C star algebra. They're going to be of H. So there is pointwise operations there. So under these pointwise operations. there. So under these pointwise operations, they form a sister algebra. This sister algebra is isomorphic to the double conjugate of A. Via this map. So how does an element of A star star acts on a representation? Well, you let the representation act on B where we know from our operator. From our operator algebra class, that we can extend the representations to the universal W star algebra containing A. So anyway, if what I said doesn't ring a bell, then you obviously see that we can do this for elements in A, right? With this, you must agree. Any B in A, we can do this. So A, every element. every element in A gives an admissible operator field and it turns out that A is in this say identification equal to the C star sub algebra of continuous admissible fields. Continuous point strong star to strong star or without a star. Actually, there's lots of topologies that agree here. But here we see that A is really a continuum algebra of continuous function. I'm just noting I'm just noting, I don't know how much this theory was used, but Takesaki, when he, in his first paper on this, used this to give another proof, a new proof of Takeda theorem, that A star star is a star isomorphic and homeomomorphic in the right topologies to the Von Neumann algebra generated by the universal representation. So you see, this point of view can be useful. So this is the top. Useful. So, this is the top-down answer of what it means for a sister algebra to be an algebra of functions. There's the bottom-up answer when we already have a set K and we already have a space of affine functions on K, what's going to be the sister algebra in question? So, here's another definition. This is the newer definition from two years ago. So, if K is a common. So if k is a compact NC convex set, a function from k to m is an NC function if it is graded, if it respects direct sums, and if it respects unitary conjugation. That's an NC function. Now notice, if we change here conjugation by unitary, respects unitary conjugation to respects conjugation by isometry. conjugation by isometry, then we get NC affine functions. If you change unitary here to invertible and instead of taking the star, you take the inverse, we get something that looks like NC analytic functions. And what other people have also looked at is what happens when you conjugate by elements of a group and you get other notions of non-community. And you get other notions of non-commutative functions. So this is a, I just wanted to point out that this idea is recurrent. And in any case, in our setting, this is something broader than NCFine. It contains NCFine as a special case. So notation, let BK be all the bounded functions from K to M. So all these guys. All these guys, bounded density functions. And then we define, so it's a sister algebra with the pointwise operation. We define CK to be the sister algebra generated by AK. So it's a sub-algebra of B of K. Okay? All right. So you see, it would have been nice. So, you see, it would have been nice to say that these are the continuous ones, but it's a bit more complicated than that. So, you see, I get worried again. So, here is a theorem that Davidson and Kennedy proved that BK is star isomorphic to the second conjugate of C star max of AK. C star max of AK, where C star max is a certain universal C star algebra introduced by Kiersberg and Wassermann. And we know that these are the bounded admissible operator fields corresponding to this guy. And C of K is star isomorphic to C star max of A K and a And remember, we defined it, we didn't define this as a continuous function, it was defined as a sister algebra generated by A, K, and B, K. But it's a theorem that these are really the continuous functions. You just have to choose the right topology. And actually, this is a typo, it should say point ultra-strong star continuous NC functions. So, yeah, it's you have to be careful with these topologies, but after after being careful then then this this really can be giving a precise meaning as a c star algebra being the continuous functions on an NC set okay so what is the C star max I owe you so we it's a for every operator system there exists some a unit or completely isometric embedding of s into some isometric embedding of S into some sister algebra called sister max, which is generated by the embedding such that for every embedding of S as an operator system generating a sister algebra, you have a surjection from sister max onto sister generated by that embedding. So it's it's kind of it does the opposite from what a system. A sister mean does. So, whenever you have an operator system, we have the sysmax we just described in the previous slides. And this is not equality. This is an analogy. And we have the sister envelope, which has the reverse universal property that so it's the minimal sister. So it's the minimal sister algebra containing s and yeah so these things in red are not precise. It's just to give an idea of what's going on. Oh, sorry. No, this is equality. My apologies, this is equality. In the commutative case, there wouldn't be equality. So I didn't So, I didn't want to motivate the entire thing talking about affine functions on classical convex sets, but let's just take a look at the commutative picture. If we have a compact convex set, we can look at the continuous functions on it. There's the affine continuous functions inside it, which generate it as a sister algebra. That's by the Stone-Warshadov theorem. And we know that there's the Shilov boundary, which is the minimal Which is the minimal closed set to which restriction becomes an isometry. And the Shield of boundary in case of a compact convex set is the closure of the extreme points of C. So this picture is just the commutative, well, it's the commutative analogy of what we discussed in the non-commutative case. We're going to talk. Non-commuted this case, we're going to talk a little bit more about the roles of the sysar max and sysar mean. So this systar max, it has a universal property. So every point in the state space of a remember, we can also always think of k as the NC state space of a k so every So every point here by the universal property extends to a representation of C star max. And conversely, if we have a representation of C star max, then we can restrict it to AK. So it doesn't make sense anymore to say that it's a representation because this is just an operator system. But this is a UCP map on AK and a And the pi is the extension of x to c star max. So what we have is that the points k are representation of are the representations of c star max up to a certain cardinal. And these are evaluations at points. So all the representations of the c star max, which is continuous functions on k, are point evaluations at points of k. At points of k. So this is working just like a commutative sister algebra. And now it's just a matter of analogy. UCP maps from C star max to M can be thought of as probability measures. I'm not going to have much time to talk about that, but I wanted to state it. Now, CIST. Now systar mean, we would like to think of it as the continuous functions on something. Well, it's not exactly going to be that, but inspired from the commutative case, a set of NC extreme points are going to be defined in such a way that C star mean is precisely the restriction. Precisely the restriction, I mean star isomorphic to the restriction of CK to this set of extreme points. So the set of, oh, I don't see, can you see it? I see you're talking oh, Chalita. I don't see if you can see it. Del K is the notation for the extreme points, the NC extreme points. So the C star mean is going to be star isomorphic to the restriction of C K to this boundary. Boundary and you'd like to think of it as the like in the Shilov boundary case as the continuous functions on the closure of del k, but it's not clear exactly what this means. But you can think of it like this. And the points in the boundary are precisely those points for which the point evaluation. The point evaluation is a boundary representation. And this extreme boundary corresponds to the non-commutative Shoket boundary. And, okay. So I need to make sense of what I said in the previous slide because if you did not understand what I said, that's great because I Great because I explained it. I used things that I did not define yet. So it's actually a good sign if you never heard this and you didn't understand what I said. Great. So now I want to give some more definitions. There's lots of definitions in this paper because we want to define the notion of extreme points. Just to tell you where... Just to tell you what I'm driving at, I want to define the notion of extreme points and I want to talk about the Krein-Millman and the Millman converse in this setting. And then I want to give you a small toy application that maybe can give you an idea of how these things come together. Okay? So it could be, I don't promise, but it's very likely that this. But it's very likely that this is the last slide with definitions. So let's go. A point Y in K is called a dilation of X if there's an isometry going between the relevant spaces such that X is a compression of Y. Okay, so it's the usual notion of dilation, but we're only looking at points inside this non-commutative set. commutative set okay and this is something that has no classical no commutative analog but of course we are familiar with the notion of dilation from whatever we did in operator algebra or operator theory now this point a a a point x is called a maximal point if the only dilation If the only dilations are the trivial ones. So you can always dilate a point by adding a direct sum and k is closed under direct sum. So you can do that. But if that's the only way in which you can dilate x, then x is called maximum. And it's a Davidson and Kennedy attribute this to Dricheland McCullough, who did this in the setting of Open. Who did this in the setting of operator algebra? So it's really their idea. Every point in a compact anti-convex set K has a maximal variation. So in particular, there are maximal points. Now, a point is said to be extreme. I'm giving this as a definition to save your proposition, but not a very difficult one. Proposition, but not a very difficult one. It's not the original definition, but because of a proposition, it's equivalent to the definition. A point is extreme if it is maximal and pure. What does pure mean? Pure means the following. So whenever you can write x as a finite NC convex combination, oh, here he is missing this should be equal to one, this sum, showing that it's an NC convex combination. and see convex combination, then actually all the alphas are positive multiples of isometries which compress xi to x. So in the literature, there are several, I don't know, I can think of maybe five at least notions of a non-commutative or matrix or absolute, harvesting, all kinds of. Harveston, all kinds of notions of extreme points, essential extreme points. And so, this is Davidson and Kennedy's notion of extreme points. And the nice thing is that it corresponds exactly to what we need from the point of view of boundary representations and our systems theory. So if X is pure, then it's irreducible. Is pure, then it's irreducible, right? Because you cannot write it as a direct sum. A little deeper, if x is x is extreme, if and only if the point evaluation is a boundary representation, because it's an irreducible maximal. And we know not from what I said today, but from the theory, that that means it's a boundary presentation. Another way of saying it. Another way of saying it is that it's irreducible, the point evaluation, and it's the unique representing UCP map for X. What do we mean representing UCP map for X? It means it's the unique UCP map on CK that extends a that extends X. X, remember, X is a point in K, but it's a. It's a NC state. Oh, all right. So here are the Klein-Millman theorems, the NC versions. A compact NC convex set is the closed NC convex hull of its extreme points. And there are various versions of this. Crucial to the proof, I'm jumping to here, is that the extreme. Jumping to here is that the extreme point completely norms AK, the operator system. So, how do we get that they completely norm AK? That's a very difficult and deep theorem. It was proved by Arveson for the separable case and by Davidson and Kennedy in general a few years ago. And in this paper, they also proved it again using the point of view of NC function. Point of view of NC function theory. And they also have a Millman's converse. If K is compact NC convex set and we have a closed subset X, which is also closed under compressions, if it generates K as an N C convex set, then X must contain the extreme boundary. Okay, so the statements of these sets are exactly like Krine-Millmann and the. sets are exactly like crine millman and the millman's converse in the classical case of convex set but here it's for ncy convex sets compact nc convex sets okay so now i want to skip the commutative case and go to my toy application okay to illustrate i'm going to illustrate how these ideas work in this small application Small application. So let's go. Let theta. What we're going to do is we're going to find the irreducible representations of the rational rotation algebras. Okay? Five-minute warning. Thank you. Theta is this, where m and m are a, yeah, co-prime. And then a theta is the universal sister algebra. Universal C-star algebra generated by unitaries, I forgot to write, that satisfy this commutation relation. Now you can check this X and this Y as a pair. They satisfy this relation and they are unitary. So u goes to X, V goes to Y determines an irreducible representation of A theta. And now the claim that I want to prove using maybe Using maybe an exaggerated theory for such a problem, but this generalizes. Every irreducible representation has this the form u goes to alpha x, v goes to beta y. That's what I want to prove. Okay? All right. So here's the proof. Yeah, it's a bit roundabout, but I'm trying to bring in all the ideas. The ideas. So, first of all, we need to do some things that have nothing to do with the NC convex set. We construct these two, a pair of unitaries u and v, which is the direct sum of all the alpha x beta y. And because there's gauge invariance of the two torus of this representation, this defines a faith for representations of a theta. So, this is something from theory of rotation in algebra, and you can prove it. Algebras, and you can prove it by hand differently. Okay, so great. This is a phaseful representation. So, all the irreducible representations should be there, right? Well, it's not clear why every irreducible representation should be a summit of this, even if it is a faithful representation. So, here's where we're going to use NC convexity. So, consider a subset A. A is now just a subset. A is now just a subset. It used to be a sister algebra, but here it's just a subset A. All the alpha x beta y in the answer state space, or if you like, these are just matrices, so in the matrix range of UNV, which is the same. You can move from here to the NC state space of the operator system generated by UNV. So we're looking at this subspace. So we're looking at this subset of the NC state space of U and V. A pair of operators determines the NC state. And then we look at B, the closure of the compressions of A. So it's a closed set, closed under compressions. Now, the boundary representations of these operator systems in A theta Theta. Well, that's just all irreducible representations because unitaries are hyper-rigid. That's something I didn't talk about today, but take it. It's all irreducible representations. And the boundary representations of A theta, they correspond to points in the extreme boundary. Now, because this is a faithful representation, the Representation: the NC convex closed set generated by B is the entire matrix range. So by Millman's converse, actually David's and then Kennedy's Millman's converse, the extreme points have to be in B. So B contains unitary conjugates of this, and all the irreducible representations are here. Now, the only you can check that. So the only you can check that a compression of representation can't be of an irreducible representation can't be a representation. So they actually have to be equal to some of these guys. And that's the proof. It might be a bit roundabout, but it can show maybe how you can get information about non-commutative C-star algebra using these ideas of non-commutative convexity. which are natural to use just as in the classical commutative case. But I think my point is, and this is the last sentence I'm saying, John, don't worry. My point is that this point of view of looking at things as functions on a non-commutative convex set, Said it stands on its own. It doesn't need justification by looking at the analogies from the commutative classical case. So here I close my talk. It's one half or less of Davidson and Kennedy's paper. So I recommend to you to take a look. And thank you very much, everyone. Thank you, Art. Does anybody have any questions or remarks? And I'm not sure I'll see your hand, so just unmute yourself and ask if you have a question. Where is everybody? Ah, here you are. Well, with no other questions, let's thank Orr again for such a good Thank Orr again for such a great talk just.
