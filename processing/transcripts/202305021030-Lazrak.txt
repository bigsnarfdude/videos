So, our next speaker is Alida Zach from UBC. Great to be here. Great conference. It was great to see so many friends that I didn't see for many years. So, this is a quite special event for me. So, this is a joint paper with Jeff Leng, who's here. It's a paper about polling. It's a bit different, I think, from It's a bit different, I think, from the topic of this conference. I thought it was appropriate to present it here. I'm going to try to explain why. Let me first just give you the context of where are we coming from to write this paper. So we start basically was interested in group decision. Basically, most individual decisions are rather the exception than the rule. Most of our decisions. And the rule loss of our decision, whether it's economic or personal decision, we are in fact group decisions, not immediate decisions. So I started with this. I was interested. I wrote a paper with my colleagues from UBC who are economists about group managed red options. So this is a paper about timing. When the decision maker is a group and the decision is taken by voting, so the paper has some. And the paper has some, I think, interesting economic insight. But the mathematic questions where we just touched them on the surface, so it felt a little bit incomplete. And then I started talking to Jianfeng about, you know, what about optimal slapping when the decision maker is not a single individual, but a group. And then we started talking about the snail envelope, the important Of love, the important theorem in optimist where the decision is taken by voting, we start doing some work, and then the work was a bit interesting but a bit unfocused. So we realized we have to come back to something more limited in scope, and that's how we end up with the first deterministic and static paper of Jinfeng. So, some of you may become very, very, you know, disappointed, but there. You know, disappointed, but there will be no demonic in this talk, so it will be a very boring one-period deterministic. Then I think it's interesting because there are, you know, it may open some questions for more work. No problem. No problem, no croissant process, no backward, no mid-field game. But I believe that it can be done. In this way, it can be done. The question I hope. The question, I hope I will convince you that the question is architects. Okay, so the presentation would be based on kind of numerical examples just to make the points for the concept. But there is a paper, the paper is on archive for those of you who are interested. Okay, so let me now start talking about the paper. So the paper is going to be about one form of vote trading. And there is a stigma about it. There is a stigma about it. Trading vote is a kind of silly for many people because voting is a kind of moral duty, especially for political election. So many people will view this as a crazy right to trade vote. Doesn't make sense. This is a moral duty that should not be traded for money or favor. Okay, however, in real life, vote trading, what we call basically vote trading is a bit broader. It's not just give me your vote, I'll give you money. Just give me your vote, I'll give you money. It's a little bit broader, I'll give you some examples. So it could be any form of pre-vote negotiation or bargaining or interaction. So let me give you some examples. The first one is called log rolling. So this is log rolling, this is very common in the US Congress, but also in many European institutions. It's basically the idea that politicians That politician votes against his preference to support some other politician with the expectation that sometimes in the future that other politician returns the favor by voting for issues that you really care about. This is called vote rolling and it's a form of pre-vote transaction. There are many other examples, but it's quite common that people kind of negotiate and interact before voting to smooth out their vote. So this is one example. Many bills, in particular the celebrated Obamacare bills, went through many a round of amendments before being actually proposed on the table for voting. So there is a lot of negotiation before actually the vote, right? And this is what we're talking about in this paper. Okay? Before I give you what we're doing exactly, let me observe that the normal Let me observe that the normative implications of this pre-vote negotiation or interaction are not clear at all. They can be good or they can be bad for efficiency. So on one hand, they can be very good because anything that allows people to negotiate is going to promote efficiency. So if two people disagree, maybe the one who feels very strong about the issue can provide some compensation to the person who feels strong. Some compensation to the person who feels weakly about the issue. So, this is good for efficiency because when you vote, you cannot vote 50% yes or 50% no. You either vote yes or no for most votes because most votes are actually binary. So, promoting this kind of pre-vote interaction is going to promote efficiency. So, it's going to be good for efficiency. But on the other hand, when two people negotiate, When two people negotiate a side contract on the side, that may harm other people. And in fact, that may harm them a lot. So, this is the externality. And the externality is bad for efficiency because it creates a clash between private interests and collective interests. So, it's not clear whether Lewis is good or bad up to both. Okay, what we do in this paper, we consider a standard voting model. Standard voting model, you know, it will be a direct democracy model where people vote directly. And we allow people to kind of trade promises contingent on the voting outcome before they actually vote. And we assume that this can be done in a completely decentralized way. So anyone can promise to anyone else something. There is no political leadership or no. No political leadership or no representation. So, this is like a complete decentralized way. And we define an equilibrium and we say, okay, what will happen in that world? And this is what we do in this work. Okay, so in the next two slides, the first, I'm going to just go through two slides. One slide, I'm going to fix the limitation. The other slide, I'm going to just give you a numerical example just to make sure that we're talking, we understand that. Talking, made me understand that what we're talking about, and that will hopefully set the stage for me to give you the results. And then after that, I will dig a bit deeper on the mode. The presentation again will be mainly based on the Miracle example, but if you're interested, you're welcome to go to the paper. Okay, so notation. So these are the notation. So we're going to have a committee with I members. So this is like the So, this is like the number of voters. You can think about this as, you know, or a member of a political institution, as Senate or Congress in the US or in any other country. Okay, so this is a number of voters, and they vote for reform versus a status score. And so, think about I3 member, and then kappa is the majority threshold, so you need two people to vote for the reform to enact it. Vote for the reform to enact it, basically. Okay, think about with three members, we need two members who vote to support the reform. Everyone feels about the reform. This is the intensity of the reform versus the status quo. So some people have positive intensity, meaning that they support the reform. And some people have negative intensity, that means that they oppose the reform. So there is disagreement. There is disagreement, but some people feel very strongly about the reform. Very strongly about the reform, and some people feel mildly, so there is disagreement about the intensity of the reform. So then we make the assumption that reform is socially optimal in the sense that if you add all intensities, it's good. So the reform is good. So you can think about the reform as an environmental reform or something that's good for society. So then, in all our work, in actual In all our work, enacting the reform is a good thing. So, efficiency is to enact the reform. So, this is the timing of the model. Initially, people will make promises to each other. So, this is the vector of promises, R, and they are netted because, in fact, we need a matrix, but we aggregate all the problems. So, RA is. R R I is a vector, it's a profile of promises that are contingent on the reform being adopted. And S is a vector of promises that are contingent on the reform being defeated. So this status quo. In fact, in equilibrium, you don't need this, but they are important because people will need to use them as a threat. But in equilibrium, the reform will be enacted and only the promises. Be enacted, and only the promises contingent on the reform will be honored in some ways. And we assume that this is a zero-sum null, so whatever is promised by some people is received by some other people. Okay, so this is the first step of the game. People make to each other promises in a completely decentralized way. Step number one. Step number two: given these promises, people vote. Yeah, yeah, yeah, got it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So you don't distinguish the I number makes a lot of promises, you just like to take them up. Yeah, I aggregate them. So those are net promises, in fact. But I make this promise. So it's a what matter for an incentive? So this is a very good question. Okay, if I really want to describe a promise, I need a matrices. I need what you I need what you promised me, but what you also need promised to Niza and what Nizar, so it really matters. But we took the aggregates, the aggregations. We just take the net, and the net is all what matters to determine how people vote. Because in this model, everyone retains the voting rights, the promises just alter the incentive on how to vote, but everyone retains the voting right. So when you decide how to vote, In white. So when you decide how to vote, it doesn't matter for me whether the promise is received by you or by Nizar or by anyone else. All what matters to me is what the net promises are. And that's what determines the incentive to vote. So that's why it's okay to define only the net promises. And in fact, the equilibrium is going to be characterized just by condition on the net promises. Okay, so this hinge may be. This hinge, maybe this is a first step to start preparing you that there will be multiple equilibria in this framework. Okay, but that will come a bit later. So the R could be positive or negative. Any R, so there will be promises receiver and promises sender. Okay, so the R could be positive or negative. The sum of the R has to be equal. Sum of the R has to be equal to zero. And the same for S. So both R and S can be positive or negative. Yes, really. And the promise is only contingent on the passing or failing of the law. That's right. It's not conditional on me voting for it or... No, no, it's so weird. Because you want to say, you know, I promised you that I will vote for it. I did vote for it, but it didn't pass. And so, you know, you're not giving me what I was saying. So, so, so, you, yeah, that's right. So, so, this is, so, what we have in mind is those amendments on the bill. Uh, so you know, just think about the Obamacare. There have been many amendments on the bill, and then the final proposal will bundle what was initially proposed together with all the promises, right? So, it's kind of bundled, and so in that way, you will get the promises only if the proposal is passed away. It's definitely a restriction. What we're gonna. A restriction, what we're going to argue is that this way of organizing the promises is promote efficiency, is good for efficiency, but there could be other ways of trading votes. Because otherwise, you couldn't really do like the netting that you need to do. You will have to make the promises contingent on how to vote. You could trade, actually, vote. You sell me your vote, and I'll give you a payment up front, not at the proposal. So, I mean, there are other ways. In this paper, we focus on the. In this paper, we focus on this type of votes. It's basically a secret vote. Sorry? It's basically a secret vote. It could be... Yeah, it's a secret vote. Yeah, so if it is a secret vote, there will be no way of contracting on your votes. Yes. So if it's a secret vote, this would be easier to implement than a promise container on voice. Okay, last stop. Yeah, yeah. Last stop, yeah, yeah. Yes, go ahead. Yeah, no, go ahead. Very good, very good. I want to understand what kind of units you have in mind for these things, because you're calling them intensities, and then you have something that's called promises, and then they act additively on the intensities. And then you're saying that the sum has to be zero. What? What? What? So that's a very good question. So it's a model of transferable utility. Okay, so utility can be transferred and we assume that utility is plus. So it's monetary. Yeah, it's monetary. Yeah, it's monetary. Yeah, you can think. So, so anything, so you need the transfer of utility to be possible between one agent to another, and it's a transfer unit by unit. So, everyone, so that's the underlying assumption. Okay, so last step, given these promises, people vote. People vote, accounting for the promises, so the incentive to vote are actually going to be manipulated by the promises. Promises. And at the end, the promises are enforced. And basically, that's the framework. That's the frameworks. I'm not sure how much time, or what time should I finish? 10. 9. 11.10. 11.10. Okay, so I have 25 minutes. Okay, very good. So, okay, so in this framework, we define what is the political equilibrium and And we define and we provide insight on what kind of promises need to be done in order to implement perfect method. This is basically the result. Before I state the result, let me give you one example, one numerical example, just to illustrate what we're talking about. So just imagine a group of three members. Member number three feels very strong about the reform. It has 10 units of intensity for the reform. Intensity for the reform. Number one and two oppose the reform, but their preferences are kind of minus two and minus one. So if you let them vote, the reform will be defeated because two members will vote against it. And that's bad because number one, but memory two, you feel very strong about so you feel like a loser in this transfer kind of vote. So you so in this case something must be done, treatably. Must be done, and we TB Lee number three is going to provide some conversation to number one and two to get to be in a win-win situation. And so this is what happened. The reform is defeated if there is no promises. But those are a couple of promises that will enact the reform. So member three can pay five to member, you know, two and three to member one and two. Two and three to member one and two, and they all be win-win. Everyone is gonna, it's a Pareto improvement relative to the no promises equilibrium. And the same here, okay, this is another one. In fact, there is an infinite number of ways to enhance the outcome with new promises. Okay, so it feels something can be done to promote efficiency here. And basically, there are And basically, there are too many degrees of freedom here. So, what we do in this paper, we provide some kind of selection. What should be the political equilibrium? This is what we call political equilibrium. It's going to be based on two ideas. One of them is kind of classical. It's the stability. So, it will be the core for those of you who are familiar with this. So, province needs to be stable in some sense. Stable in some sense, okay. We're gonna tell you exactly in what sense. And the second assumption, which is perhaps less standard in the political economy literature, is the idea that this needs to be done at the cheapest cost, cheapest, not cost, cheapest transfer, at the minimum transfer. And this is, you know, we wrote about this a little bit in duplication, like this is similar to the principle of least action. Similar to the principle of least action of more pertuvities. Okay, so this is this, we talk a bit about that. But basically, with these two principles, despite we're not going to remove the indeterminacy, we still have multiple equilibria, but we're going to be able to say something general about this equilibria that will hold without, you know, in general for all this equilibria. We still are going to be able to say something general about this. So this is what we do in this paper. What we do in this paper. Let me tell you the result. So, we're going to define a political equilibrium. Essentially, there should be no blocking coalition. So, this is the core. The promises need to be stable in the sense that once they are in place, no coalition has the incentive to form, reverse the group decision, and make a party to improve a strictly party-to-improvement for all its members. All its members. So, this is the stability, first condition. Second condition: the total promises need to be minimized. So, with these two conditions, we're going to say, okay, first, the reform is always enacted. So, this is good for efficiency and this is kind of good. Mathematically, the result is not very difficult, but economically, I think it's interesting because it's a I think it's interesting because it's a form of Coe's theorem in the context of political markets. So, this idea that people can reach efficiency by contracting among themselves is known under the cost theorem when transaction costs are low. This is like the parallel of the cause theorem for the political market, kind of. So, this is the first result. Second result: there are multiple equilibria, and equilibria are multiple. And the ecliptia are multiple because there are many ways to share the cost of enticing people to vote for the reform and there are many ways of distributing the compensation to the coalition, to the receiving coalition. We can distribute the global, the aggregate compensation in many ways. So that's the multiplicity. Okay, let me give you some interesting You know, interesting, what we think has interesting applications. So, this is what we can say in general. First, all the promises will be top-down, meaning that they go from the people with high intensity of preference to the people with low or negative. So they will always go. So, in a way, the promises are going to push toward equality. So, in general, when the reform lacks support, so this is the point. Reform lacks support, so this is the problem that I give you in the first example: a frustrated minority with three members. The reform supporter will always compensate the reform opponents. So again, so this is consistent. And this is maybe a surprising result. What may happen when you have a majority support for the reform? So, without promises, the reform is enacted, so the outcome is efficient. You may think, oh, there may be a Outcome is efficient, you may think, oh, there may not need to be for any promises. But in fact, no. In fact, when you have a majority support for the reform and then minority of opponents, promises may be needed. And why? Because some compensation needs to be directed to the minority to preempt them from bribing the cheapest member of the majority and form with them a majority that will avert the. That will revert the reform. So, promises for this kind of enticement need to be done to preempt that from happening. So, this is the result here. And finally, the promises in general, they will go across the eye. But there are conditions under which they may be of a type of circle de Wegen, meaning that reformed supporter may compensate. Supporter may compensate weakest reform supporter under some conditions. But in general, they need to reach across the eye, meaning that reform supporter needs to pay reform opponents in general. And we have condition, like mathematical condition on the initial distribution of intensity that that give you exactly the condition under which that may or may not happen. So we're May not happen. So we're kind of able to produce some results that are potentially, you know, perhaps testable in some future work on what may happen in this world where promises are completely decentralized, where there is no stigma about watch trading. So basically, that's what it is. Okay. So I have 15 minutes. So I'm going to let me first give you some brief notation. Give you some brief notations. Hopefully, so again, most of the talk will be based on numerical examples, but we need some minimal amounts of notation. So, this is the kappa is the majority, the majority rule. So, kappa is between 1 and i. Think about it as majority, which is more or less i over 2 if i is even. And so, this is the minimum support for reform. Those are the support, the reform supporters. Those are the reform opponents. UR is the aggregate intensity of the reform supporter, and US is the aggregate intensity of the reform opponent. And so, those are the promises, R and S. This is the set of promises, so this is a simple X. Simplex. And then the committee decision is going to be either R, like reform or status quo. And this is the committee decision after the promises R and S are in place. This is the voting outcome, VIRS, which if the reform is enacted, and if the reform is defeated, then it's SI. And this is the total transfer. Okay, so this is the total transfer. So you may think about if this is the total transfer. This is the total transfer for the first, if the reform is adopted, and this is the total reform is defeated. Okay, so what is the political equilibrium? This is what we mean by stability. So this is a kind of short-sighted core. We're not going to be able to say how we reach an equilibrium. What we're going to be able to say is that once able to say is that once this equilibrium is in place then it is stable. So if a reform is adopted once these promises are in place then it is a stable coalition, it is a stable equilibrium if there exists no coalition that can take those promises, make incremental promises on top of those existing promises. Promises, revert the group decision and get a Pareto improvement for all its members. Okay, so if this is done, this will be a blocking coalition. If this exists, it will not be as stable. And we do the same for the other ones. Okay, so this is the political equilibrium. This is an equilibrium if it is stable, meaning that there is no blocking coalition, and if the total transfer province cannot be diminished. Diminished, so it's minimized. Okay, so this is the political equilibrium. Okay, so what can we say? So the first observation, we can just forget about S. In fact, the equilibrium are organized as an equivalence class. So we can just forget about S and assume that S is equal to zero. You only need to do promises contingent on the reform being maxed. On the reform being maximum. Second thing, this is the characterization. We need this to be larger. That's what a province is stable if those system of inequalities is true for any decisive coefficient of the status quo. So this is a set of conditions that is easily verifiable on any example. So that's stability. And then we have existence. And so this is what I told. And so, this is what I told you: the reform is always enacted under equilibrium. So, those premises are effective in promoting efficiency. But they are multiple, they are multiple equilibria, and so even if it's removed. So, let me give you an example. So, let's take this example, the same one as before. 10, strong support for reform. Support for reform and two weakly opposed reform. So then we need to verify the inequalities that I just told you. And so those are the inequalities. So we have a set of four tree inequalities and then a condition on the sample X. And that will say, okay, so there are many of them in all. So in one of them, one eclipse. One of them, in one of them, one equilibrium member three will pay three to the coalition one, two. Okay, so this number three will pay an aggregate of three to these two members. Two to this one and one to this one. They will both go to zero and number three will end up then with seven, right? It's ten minus three, basically. So more generally, the equilibrium is going to look like this. Is going to look like this. So the set of equilibria is going to be this triangle. It's going to be this triangle. Those are the set, sorry, the set of stable promises are going to be this triangle. And so you see how large is stability. But when we impose minimality, it's going to be these segments here. Just this piece, this subset of the trend. This is how we reduce the equilibrium by the assumption of minimum. Equilibrium by the assumption of minimal total payments, basically. And so this is a huge reduction. In particular, like you see, the stability is not very restrictive here because member 3 in this region is going to pay more than 10. So this is not consistent with individual nationality, right? Member 3, for example, here is paying maybe 12 and just receiving 10. So this is stable. Member 3. Stable. Member 3 could end up with minus 2, which is not, so member 3 will not, you know, this is kind of rational to pay more than what he initially had. But this is still stable. This is still stable. This is a feature that will not happen if we impose minimal total payment. In minimal total payment, a a feature of the equilibrium is that everyone is gonna be individually. Going to be individual basis. No one would pay more than what she can get from this bargain. So the insight here is that minimal promises will reduce the multiplicity but not eliminate it. And in addition, they will be consistent with individual rationality. So it was a bit of a surprise. I mean, it was a bit of a surprise to us in the beginning. How come? But remember, this is just a core. We're not saying that people maximize self-interest in some ways, right? It's just a core. What we describe is a core, meaning a stable situation in a case in right. Okay, so let me give you some general property of the equilibrium promises. So again, again, the promises will go from top to down. The promises will go from top to down, so there will be a critical voter Kappa star. Anyone above Kappa Star is going to make promises, it's going to be a promiser, and anyone below Kappa star is going to be a promise. We receive the promises. And notice that the values, the exposed valuation, are going to be ranked between the two coalition, the coalition of promisers and the coalition of promises. This is another example of a weak. Of weak support of the reform. So now we have three members. Two members support the reform, and three members oppose the reform. So what is the equilibrium here? So we take, so the coalition, so in all equilibria, this coalition is going to compensate this coalition with a total of four. With a total of four. So in all equilibria, Total of four. So, in all equilibria, there will be a transfer from the coalition of reform supporters to a coalition of reform opponents of an amount of four. This is the set of equilibrium. And there are many of them. So, for example, so this one is going to take two and two from each one of the two and transfer them to this tree this way. One, one, and two. And this is how they end up with the promise. Notice that if there is no promises, the outcome is zero because the reform is going to be defeated with no promises. So this is better than zero. This is a better outcome. So it's really clearly a win-win in this case. This is another way of transferring the promise. And again, this is going to achieve. This is gonna achieve this is not parento improving, but it definitively enacts the form. So this example helped me just highlight that the equilibria are not necessarily valid to improve. They could be, but they could not be. They are not always valid to improve. Having said that, they achieve efficiency. They enact the reform. Enact the reform. Okay, so this is the proposition associated to that case of why we can do things this way. I'm going to just go through it quickly. Let's go to the case where there is enough voting support for the reform. So now, without promises, the reform will be enacted. So before I give you the example, let me just say: okay, so this is N is going to Okay, so this is N is going to be the reform, the coalition of reform supporters, and these are reform opponents. And this is the coalition of weakest majority members. So this coalition, when they join this coalition, will form a decisive coalition that will be able to enact Euro form. So those are the weakest members of the majority, if you want. And so this is. And so this is their intensity. So these are the intensity of the weakest member of the majority. And those are the gain from trade. So what are the gain from trade of the coalition CAS? So this is the aggregate intensity of the reform of Vermont minus the aggregate intensity of the weakest member of the reform support. Okay, so this is the gain control. So this is what the coalition the coalition of reform opponent may gain from bribing the weakest member of the reform or support. Okay, so if this gain from trade is lower than zero, then there is a unique equilibrium. There is no need for promises. But in general, if the gain from trade is positive, promises needs to be done to preempt this sort of move. To preempt this sort of move. So, given for the sake of time, let me just give you one example. So, this is the example. We have four members, and their intensity are distributed this way. So, three reform supporters and one reform open. Okay, three reform supporters and one reform open. So, the outcome without promises is going to be to enable the reform. Okay, it's going to be the enable reform, but this is not making any promise. Not making any promise, is not an equilibrium because this member has a lot to lose, so he may want to bribe these two members to change the equilibrium outcome. As a result, this member may have to make some promises to preempt that from happening. This is basically the equilibrium. So, essentially, what will happen is that the coalition tree, in all equilibria, the coalition tree for needs to promise the Need to promise the payment of 4, the payment of 4. Why 4? Because 4 is the gain from trade. It's basically 5 minus 1. That's the gain from trade. So in all equilibria, this coalition needs to pay 4 to these two numbers. They can pay 4 completely to this one. In that case, that will be an across the I promises. But in some cases, I think they can pay also to this person. But in any event, in all encryption. But in any event, in all equilibria transfer of four, so this is exactly what happened here. Four will be paid here. And so these are some equilibria scribe here. So this is the proposition of that. Let me give you the other, maybe last case, which is so again it's the same example except that this person is not that rich anymore. So so this coalition cannot afford to pay for anymore because To pay for anymore, because if they pay for, they will create a new round, incentive for a new round of enticements, and that needs to be preempted. And so there is an algorithm on how to do this in the paper. But essentially, what happened is that they need to pay three, and they will have to pay it to this person first. And so there will be many steps. So, there will be many steps. At the end, they will have to pay more than four. They will have to pay more than four because initially, I remember that was, you know, when this guy was very rich, they just need to pay four. But because member four now, they don't have enough ammunition to preempt. If they preempt, they create new incentive for additional round of promises. At the end, they would have to pay more than four. More than four, and in the paper there is an algorithm on exactly how to do that and what kind of you can get. There is more in the paper. I think I'm going to stop here. Let me just conclude. You can leave time for questions. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So let me just conclude. We hope this. We hope this is going to be a difficult thing to discuss. Thank you. Any questions? Could it be extended to a case where you have minus infinity utility? Like Ted Cruz is never going to vote for a bill brought up by Bernie Sanders. Right, right, right. So if it's minus infinity utility, there is no way. Infinity utility, there is no way you can provide any incentive, like even if you make a promise, people are very ideological. So, promises will not be effective in that case. They need to use other ways. Yeah, so promises will not alter the incentive. If someone is very theological, there is no way you can alter the incentive. Yeah, in this modeling, the coalition. In this modeling, the coalition who's it's a coalition who is making the promises. And so, is there a way, or is it possible? Because in the example you gave where there are two guys, they could say, no, you're going to pay. So, they are not in Nash, saying that they agree on providing the minimal amount to the opponent so that they can. But they could also, for instance, you have examples in France like this, where reforms. Council like this, where reforms are passed, because, in fact, those who are opponent would say, Yes, we are both opponent, but let's, you are going to do the job and I'm not going to be doing the job. Right, so you're talking about the tragedy of common. Exactly, yeah. The tragedy of common that we need to push for something, but because we're a group, we all rely on research on other people. So I think here we're not addressing that. We're not addressing that directly. I think that our promises are individual. They are not coalition. Everyone makes a promise individually. There is no negotiation. It's completely decentralized. So I don't think we can deal with the tragedy of common clarity on this example. Kind of how to do it. Very good either. It's not a decentralized. Yeah, it's not decentralized. So the last talk for this morning's session is by Beatrice. Do we need to do that?
