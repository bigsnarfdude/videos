Today I will talk about some about a map associated to a semi-simple hope algebra action. My talk will divide into three parts. In the first part, I will discuss some classical results in the Molita context. And as a second part, I will I will do some properties of the coconut of the junction map. And then in the last part, I will talk about when the junction map is injected. First of all, I have to give some notation. I always talk about But on the ground field, K is an algebra closed and with characteristic zero. And H is always a semi-simple HOV algebra. I use co-product the notion data and the co-unit epsilon and take an integral E is an integral such that epsilon E equals one that means one that means e is an idempotent so a is always an k algebra which is also a h module algebra h x on a from the left this notion is denoted to be the invalid sub algebra which means the h action on a is trivial so another notion is the smash product Another notion is the smash product. I use a sharp H denote the smash product. The multiplication is defined like this. Here, that HE, I write that H1, H2. I omitted the sigma notation. Now, in the SMASH product, we can draw A and H as a sub-algebras of this algebra. This algebra by through the inclusion map. So the element E, which is the element in H, we also build it as an element in A shop H. So it is an idempotent in this algebra. I will record some class classical result. Firstly, one is the there is an I algebra isomorphism. Algebra isomorphism. The invariant algebra is isomorphic to this algebra defined by the idempotent. And the algebra A has a bimodal structure, which is left A sub H and right AH by module. Also, it is a left A H and right H of H by module. As a left module, as a left H of H module. left H of H module is just the algebra multiplied by the idempotent. In the left case and the right are also similar. So also if A is no ceiling, then the invading sub-algebra is also nocelian and it is finitely generated by as I as a left AH module is also finitely generated. All these results can be found in this classical book. In this classical book written many years ago by Montgomery. And then we can define two maps. First one is alpha. Alpha that we define H times A over this match product. Just use the multiplication of AB and the left action of E. And remember E is the item. Member E is the idempotent in H. And another member is A times A over the invalid sub-algebra divided by the multiplication insert this idempotent E. Then this map is A H by model. This map is A sharp H by model map. It is very easy to see that See that these two maps together with these two bimodals form a Moita context. And this alpha is subjective, it's always subjective. But this beta is more complicated. Sometimes it's subjective, sometimes it's not. So we give a name for this beta. We call it the This beta, we call it the adjunction map associated to the h-action or a. Indeed, it is the adjunction map of defined by the adjoint functors. Now, the first question is when the adjunction map beta is subjective. This already has been done by many years ago by Montgomery and his cooperator. Montgomery and his cooperators. If this beta is rejective, then we go back. If the beta here is rejective, then the model context indeed defines a moderate equivalent. So in this case, the invalid sub-algebra AH and the smashed product are Morita equivalent. In this case, the algebra expansion A. With the algebra extension A over AH, the algebra extension is usually called a Hobokarois extension. Then we have the following well-known result. The result says that if H is semi-simple, A is a level H module algebra, then the following statements are equivalent. The first one is C this is a Hopper Grava extension, then A over A H is a projective. AH is a projective. Also, the endomorphism of this light module is indeed the smash product. Of course, in this case, the global dimension, if A has finite global dimensions, and AH has finite global dimension. Well, in general, for general algebra, this beta is not subjective. So, our question is when? Our question is when do we have any idea of this co-kernel? So our first question is when this co-kernel is finite dimensional. So because this is a bimodal map, so this is the idea of this algebra. So we have a quotient algebra. The first question is. Algebra. The first question is when the Cushing algebra is finite dimensional. This comes down. I need some further notations for the statement of the result. So if B is a Nosini algebra, we write model B as the category of finite generator by B modules and POS the subcategory of the subcategory of this category consisting of finite dimensional B modules. Then we write a Q model B means a cushion category. Because in this case, top B is always a subcategory of this A-bling category. So we obtain another A-bling category. Now Now, for NAB module, an element of M is torsion. It's a torsion element, which means the cyclic module X times B is a finite dimension. Then we call X is a torsion element. We use tau M to write all the torsion elements of M. Then tau M, tau M is indeed a How M is indeed a submodule of B of M. Then this toy indeed defines a function from model B to model B itself. So we have a derivative function. Ri ton is the derivative function of term. We define depth of m to be the minimum number such that ri tau m is not zero. So then Then we have the following results. In co-final case, which means that the image, the coconut of the beta is finite dimensional. If and only if we have an equivalent of this category, these categories, Q model H mesh H and H of H and the Q model AH. These two categories are equivalent. Equivalent. In general, the endomorphism endomorphism of this module is not isomorphic to H of H. But if the depth of A, this depth of this module is not less than two, then this isomorphism still holds. So this student is somehow a generalization of the classical Hopkalova extension. Of Galois extension. Now, in graded case, if the average of A is graded, then we have some further results. Indeed, I need some further notations. Now, B is a graded algebra. Then GRB is the category of graded modules, and the toss also the. modules and the toss also the finite dimensional gradient modules then we also have this uh torsion category also have this caution category and uh the authors of this paper are i think um kupman there's a sitting here james sitting uh uh there and uh this proved that if a is artificial label algebra of global dimension two Mentioned two, then if H is a semi-simple and X on A inner phase body, then the co-current of beta is always finite dimension. And this isomorphism is always cold. Also, we have the equivalent of two A-biting categories. For global dimension, two cases. But if the global dimension of A is bigger than two, then Is bigger than two, then the problem becomes complicated. In special case, if Vn can be square polynomial algebra generated by an elements, then in these three case cases, if G is this group of this group, indeed it is K4 X on A or G is the. Or G is a secret global generated by this element, or G is a secret global generated by this element, then the co-current of beta is always finite dimension. This data was proved in this paper. So, in this case, the coconut of beta is the finite dimension. So, what if the coconut of the dimension is not finite dimension? So I need some further notation. So now B is a sitting algebra, great algebra with GK dimension M and we write GRK means the subcategory of this category consisting of graded modules with Consisting of greater modules with GK dimension not larger than k. Because the GK dimension is equal. So this sub-category is an abelian sub-category of sub-category of this GRB. So we obtain a quotient category, but it is still an abelian category. Then we have the following result. I didn't show the regular college means GK Kuhn McCollin already mentioned several minutes ago by first talk of this afternoon. The TK dimension of we assume the TK dimension of A is not less than two. Then we have the following result. Have the following result. These two statements are equivalent, which means that the tk dimension of this co-kernel equal to d should not have larger than m minus 2. And we always have this isomorphism of algebras. Moreover, in this case, we take any k, take any k not larger than n minus d. d is the decay dimension of this Cauchy algebra. Then we always have this. Then we always have the isomorphism of these two categories. By now, we only know this for a specific identical label algebra A, we don't know. Indeed, we don't know this when this TK dimension is, how to compute the TK dimension. How to compute a tick dimension is difficult. Now, let's move to the last part. We should ask when the general map is injected. The question is: when is the general map beta is injected? We cannot deal with general Hopper algebra action. We now Hub algebra action: We now assume this every finite group acts on a quantum polynomial algebra. Here, I mean, quantum polynomial algebra means a artificial regular algebra with hundred series like this one minus p like this. Indeed, A has the same cubic theory with the polynomial algebra. With the polynomial algebra. So that's because a useful tool defined by James and Peter Jackson. The case of an automorphism or greater automorphism of A is defined to be this power serial. Here, TRG distributed into AN means the usual case function of linear transformation. Transformation. So if A is a quantum polynomial algebra with global dimension N, an automorphism G in a greater automorphism of A is called a causal deflection, which means the choice function should look like this. If A is a polynomial algebra, if A is just a polynomial. If A is just a polynomial algebra, then this quasi-deflection is indeed the usual definition of the deflections. This lambda is indeed the aging value not equal to one. The other agent value of this automorphism is one. So for quasi-reflections, there is a classification. Reflections: there is a classification on the quantum polynomial algebras. So, now if A is a quantum polynomial algebra and G is a quadratic deflection, then G is has only two, if G has a finite order, then G has only two cases. The first case is a usual deflection, which means G fixed G fix others, fix others, and g send x1 to lambda x lambda x1. Lambda is not equal to 1, and fix others. And the other reflection is of order 4. And the gx on the generators like this: gx on x1 is i, x1i is the square minus 1, and the gxx. one and the g x x on x two is a minus i x and fix others in in this paper uh this quasi deflection is called a mistake deflection because it it it it is a mistake now i will give a uh uh an answer uh on the question we asked you If A is a quantum polynomial algebra and G is a cyclic group, G is a cyclic group generated by a causal deflection, just one causal deflection, then the adjunction map is always injective. The proof of this proposition depends on some tedious computations on the action. So it is not a it it it is it's not a not hard but it is tedious need some tedious computations of course this is uh this proposition can be generalized to uh even group case then we finally we get the uh result there's the following result which means that for any abelian finite abelian subgroup of g any ability Of G, any abelian subgroup of G. So if this G is generated by causative Blaciancy, then the adjunct matter A beta is always injective. So it is always injective. This is the answer, a partial answer of our question. But even G is not A V D, he is not A V D, I know nothing about this interactivity. Injectivity. Now, below, I will give some application of this result. Because the requirement of triangle categories. The requirement means for given a triangle category T, we can write a T in we can divide the T in two parts: T prime and T double prime with this. line with this functors here this bunker and this bunker is a full face for and this bunker and this bunch are fully faceful which means t prime and the t double prime are full subcategory of t and both these functions are adjoined these ones are joined to this one and these ones are joined with this adjoined to this one also joined to this one. Also here, this one is a joint here. Here is a joint here. The this condition means that given any object in T, there are two decomposition. One is given by here, here, and then go here, here. And another way is like this, go here and go here. Uh this diagram is called a decolon of a triangle category for an algebra. There is always a decolon, always such a decolon. Now, if B is any algebra, take an idempotent in B, we always get for the following decolon. Here I is R is a differential graded algebra. is a differential graded algebra r and e b e is the algebra divided by e also uh these three functions are the natural nature functions defined by the inclusion or something like this on top attention and home and this r also is negative which means uh important Which means in positive paths, all positive paths disappear. Also, H0R, because this is R, is a differential gradient algebra. H0R is just as a quotient algebra defined by B model alter the ideal generated by the item potent. This is proved in this paper. And remember, B is any algebra. We don't need any assumption. need any assumption so our second our third question is when when this algebra r a dg algebra r is indeed isomorphic to this quotient algebra we need another notion mean the strike stratifying action which means that a say A is a connected connected grade algebra, and G is a finite subgroup of the outer morphs. A final group acting on A homogeneous. And the G action is called straightening binding. If the following two conditions are satisfied, the first one is the torsion element, torsion group vanish for N. n not equal to zero. Here we mean the invariant sub-algebra a built as a right hand module and the right left module of over this invariant sub-algebra. And the adjunction map AG here it should be KG is injected. By the by the cilium we just The theory we just mentioned that in this case, if A is a quantum polynomial algebra and the G is the abelian subgroup of the automorphism group, then and G is generated, if G is generated by positive flexions, then the G action is always a straight infining. Now we can get a Go to the oh sorry. Yes, that's of course there's something uh uh yeah uh the strategy depend on both uh both A and G and and the And the G action, even the A is different than A. I mean, if given A and I give the same A and give the same group G, but the group actually is different, then this is very different. Both depending on the structure of algebra A and the structure of group, also the group action. Now we have the following requirement, which means that here is just the integral of the group algebra. So in this case, I would like B to be the smash product and C to be the quotient algebra. Here, A E A just Here, AEA just means just equal to BEB. In this case, AEA is equal to BED. Then we have the following equivalent. G is generated by quasi-defraction if and only if we have such a requirement, which means the derivative category of GB can be divided into this one and this one. Since this is just, I remember the remember uh because in the in the uh resulted uh proved by uh yandong and the calker means that here c is just a dg algebra here we just the uh what we need is a cushion algebra uh a short remark is that uh in this case in this case uh Case, the invariant sub-algebra is indeed regular. Is it indeed regular because we assume G is generated by quality fractions, then this is indeed regular. This result was proved in this paper. Now, I give some give an example to show what is what is the What is what is the mesh product and what is C. Now we take A to be the subgroup polynomial algebra, and if G is given by the generated by this G, send X to IX and send Y to minus Y, then this is a mistake reflection. So the invariant sub-algebra of this Of this action is just a polynomial algebra. So it has a global dimension two. And the smash product B, we can use the Merkel correspondence, we can draw the McKay cube. It looks like this diagram. And the relations of B, relations of B, B is the quotient alpha of this. The Cauchy algebra of this pass algebra of gamma and the mode outside relations. So, what the relationship looks like this, which means we go from this point, we go inside by two steps equal to go outside by two steps. And the C or what is C is this algebra by this. Just defined by this quip with relationship looks like go two steps take to zero here zero here zero so this is a C so that's all my talk thank you very much
